Title: Spiritans accused of putting own interests before those of abuse victims

The Spiritan congregation has been accused of putting its own interests, needs and concerns before survivors of abuse in schools run by them. The Restore Together advocacy group for survivors of abuse in Spiritan-run schools has said: “Our experience is that the Spiritans have failed at every stage, from the time of the abuse onwards, to put the interests and rights of victims/survivors first. The Spiritans have invariably put their interests, needs and concerns and those of the institution first.” The accusation is in a lengthy letter written on behalf of the group by survivor Philip Feddis, who attended Blackrock College. Last month it was sent to past pupils’ unions at Blackrock College, Willow Park, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College, all in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. Easter, it said, was “a time for Spiritan priests to reflect on the adequacy of their response to child sex abuse”. The “victim/survivor experience” involving Spiritans was “not one of compassion”, it said. “Victims/survivors feel frustrated, disappointed, angry and worse. The ongoing delay in implementing the comprehensive restorative programme has increased the suffering of victims/survivors in many ways. It is not compassionate, it is cruel.” It pointed out that “a comprehensive, victim-centred redress scheme and a testimony-gathering (truth-telling) project has still not been delivered and the Spiritans have made no commitment to a start date for either. This is completely unacceptable to victims/survivors; most of us are over 60, who have already waited far too long for justice.” [ Spiritans have paid €8.8m in settlements to 125 abuse survivors since 1998Opens in new window ] Because of the age factor, “urgent delivery is vital for the success of these redress and testimony programmes”, the letter said. “A constant refrain is that victims/survivors are tired. We are tired of being ignored and marginalised. We are tired of feeling betrayed and abandoned by institutions that were supposed to protect and care for us as children.” It noted how “Restore Together recently called on the Spiritans to finalise the redress scheme without further delay and have it up and running no later than June 1st this year. The Spiritans have not responded to this call. We in Restore Together have been more than patient.” Survivors, the group said, are “tired of having to fight and push the Spiritans every step of the way to fully and comprehensively face up to the issue of child sex abuse in their schools and `do the right thing’. We are tired of being told we will have to wait.” The “historic power imbalance that we as victims/survivors experienced as children and which facilitated our abuse is still present and underpinning the current situation. This compounds the suffering of victims/survivors and has to be ended for once and for all. The Spiritans must take all immediate steps to bring justice to victims/survivors without having to be pushed every step of the way to do so,” it said.

Title: A county pension fund in Pennsylvania just became the first known to cease purchasing new Tesla stocks
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/pennsylvania-pension-fund-halts-new-tesla-investments-2025-5
Time Published: 2025-05-07T03:41:17Z

A swing county in Pennsylvania has decided that it will no longer purchase new Tesla stock, citing CEO Elon Musk's political activities and the company's declining shares. Lehigh County, located toward the east of Pennsylvania with a relatively affluent population that is often a swing county, has a county pension board that oversees $500 million in assets. It is the first known US pension fund to stop purchasing new Tesla stock. "Elon Musk's choice to become a political figure rather than a customer-focused leader has compromised the Tesla brand," Mark Pinsley, the Lehigh County controller who first introduced a motion to cease Tesla investments, said in a joint statement with organizers of Tesla Takedown. "Tesla's earnings are down 71% from a year ago, their auto revenues have dropped 20%, and profitability has taken a sharp dive," Pinsley added. "We owe it to our retirees and taxpayers to take a hard look at whether these are wise investments at this time." On Tuesday, the board not only voted to hit the brakes on new Tesla investments in a 4-2 decision, it has also and directed the county's investment manager to draft a report outlining options to divest its passively managed funds from Tesla. The Lehigh County Controller's Office and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comments. Pinsley and the retirement board of Lehigh County aren't the only ones concerned about pensions invested in Tesla. In March, a group of 51 New York State legislators called on the state to divest its $1 billion in Tesla holdings. A top contender in the New York City Comptroller race has pledged to pull the city's $300 billion pension portfolio out of Tesla if elected. Brad Lander, the current New York City Comptroller, has also been vocal about his dissatisfaction with Musk's leadership, but stopped short of calling for a divestment in his office's latest response to BI in April. The city's five public pension systems held more than 3 million Tesla shares worth about $1.26 billion on December 31, 2024, yet this figure has shrunk to $831 million by March 28, according to the comptroller's office. In April, eight state treasurers penned a joint letter to Tesla's board to express concern over Musk's lack of focus on Tesla, and the American Federation of Teachers is pressing major asset managers — including BlackRock and Vanguard — to consider divestment. Beyond the US border, the Netherlands' largest pension fund offloaded its $600 million stake in Tesla in January. Denmark's $20 billion pension fund, AkademikerPension, followed suit in March. Recently, Canada's largest public-sector union also urged national pension funds to cut ties with Tesla, though divestments have yet to happen. Tesla has been facing growing pressure over Musk's governance of the company and his political activity. The Tesla Takedown movement that emerged in protest of Musk's involvement in the White House DOGE office is aiming to evolve beyond demonstrations. The movement's next goal is to helping cities and states develop resolutions to divest in "all things Musk," according to a statement on April 22 after Tesla reported earnings. As of May 6, Tesla stock has declined more than 27% since the beginning of 2025, and its Q1 revenue missed expectations. Musk has announced during the latest earnings call that he will be stepping back from his political activities at the White House. Marketing experts have previously told BI that Tesla has alienated its core customer base, and that rebranding efforts may require significant concessions from Musk. "To some degree Musk can say, 'I don't care because I'm so rich and I've got so many other entities that I could afford to lose a lot of money.'" David J. Reibstein, professor of marketing at the Wharton School, previously told BI. "But for the other shareholders who are bailing on the company, that's problematic." Jump to

Title: $330B Bitcoin Corporate Surge? Why BTC Bull Token Could Be Poised to Benefit

Bernstein predicts that corporate treasuries could hold $330B worth of Bitcoin by 2029. That prediction indicates an ongoing change of heart from Wall Street — and could prime BTC Bull token to explode in 2025. Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, used to be a Bitcoin critic. Now, Blackrock offers $IBIT, the largest Bitcoin ETF on the market, controlling $55B of the $116B Spot Bitcoin AUM (assets under management). Bernstein’s latest report projects a staggering $330B in corporate Bitcoin holdings by 2029, a figure that underscores the growing role of $BTC in mainstream finance. According to Bernstein’s research, companies worldwide could allocate up to 5% of their treasuries to Bitcoin by 2029, translating to an estimated $330 billion inflow. That trajectory – Bitcoin as a strategic asset, rather than just another kind of tech stock – marks a dramatic turnaround. If sovereign wealth funds sink 3-5% of their assets into Bitcoin, the crypto’s price could reach astronomically high levels; $700K, per an earlier Fink prediction. The question remains: are funds buying Bitcoin? Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) certainly is. It continues to amass Bitcoin at a prodigious rate. After snapping up another 1,800+ Bitcoin, the company holds 555,450 $BTC. There will eventually be only 21M Bitcoin, so Strategy already holds a little over 1 out of every 42 potential tokens. Put another way, the stated goal of the US Bitcoin Treasury is to purchase 1M Bitcoin. Saylor’s already halfway there by himself. Strategy’s stock has grown 2,476% since buying its first Bitcoin in August 2020, validating Saylor’s increasingly aggressive approach to purchasing Bitcoin. The key to Bitcoin’s success will be if it continues to decouple from equities. And if Bitcoin gets even close to that $700K mark, then another group of crypto investors will have already made huge gains – anyone who owns BTC Bull token, one of the best crypto to buy now. How can average investors compete with institutions that can drop billions into Bitcoin treasuries? With BTC Bull token ($BTCBULL), there’s a way. $BTCBULL is designed to give everyday crypto enthusiasts leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s market movements, without the complexity of managing futures or options. $BTCBULL uses two simple tokenomics tools to tie $BTCBULL’s performance to Bitcoin’s growth. Both tools are triggered whenever Bitcoin reaches key price milestones. Those milestones occur every time Bitcoin’s price reaches an all-time high, in $25K increments up to $250K. Of course, if Bernstein’s prediction is correct, then the team behind BTC Bull might have severely undershot with their project’s goals. Regardless, $BTCBULL token holders gain three ways to earn from the project: The project has already raised $5.3M, with a current token price of $0.0025. Our analysis shows that the token price could reach $0.06467 by the end of the year, with the potential for even greater gains if Bitcoin accelerates rapidly. Learn how to buy BTC Bull token, and visit the presale page today. As institutional Bitcoin adoption grows, retail investors seek vehicles that maximize their upside potential. $BTCBULL is perfectly positioned to fill that gap, offering amplified returns tied directly to Bitcoin’s price movements. And the better Bitcoin does, the better the outlook for the best altcoins, which will also benefit from market momentum. Always do your own research. This is not financial advice, and the crypto market remains highly volatile. With bullish momentum across the market and growing mainstream acceptance, projects like BTCBULL could become key players for traders aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin’s next growth cycle.

Title: Germany's new chancellor: Who is Friedrich Merz?

He has never held a top position in government, yet he has become Germany's tenth chancellor. DW takes a look at the life of Friedrich Merz. Friedrich Merz has made it to the chancellery after a bumpy start. He needed an unprecedented second vote to secure the necessary majority in the Bundestag in what was a historic debacle in German politics. Now Merz's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) the regional Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) will be working together as Germany's new government. For Merz, it is a big step in an unusual career. Merz, who is 69 years old, has never held a top governmental office with significant leadership responsibilities. He has never been a federal minister, or a state premier, or even mayor of a small town. He is the oldest chancellor to take office since Konrad Adenauer, the first post-war German head of government (1949–1963). The previous weeks were also the first time he had ever taken part in negotiations aimed at forming a government coalition. The media, as well as some unnamed representatives from the negotiation teams, have at times held this against him. The SPD leaders, Lars Klingbeil and Saskia Esken, and the head of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), Markus Söder, all have experience in this particular kind of wrangling. But as the would-be head of government, Merz hopes to lead a coalition between the CDU and these parties, and mediate between their interests. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video According to the German business magazine Wirtschaftswoche, Merz is a "trans-atlanticist, friend of Europe, and reformer." This, it wrote, could mean he was "exactly the right person for the current times." From 1989 to 1994, Merz was a member of the European Parliament. This was followed by 15 years in the Bundestag, between 1994 and 2009, during which he rose to become head of the CDU's parliamentary group, only to lose out to Angela Merkel in a struggle for the party leadership. Over these years, he took a particular interest in Germany's relationship with the United States. A commercial lawyer, Merz hails from Sauerland, an area of North Rhine-Westphalia, east of the Ruhr, where he still lives. It's predominantly a middle-class, rural region, popular with tourists, that tends to espouse conservative, Catholic values. Merz was clearly more traditionally conservative than his East German rival, the quantum chemist Angela Merkel. Early in his career, he was a close confidant of the now-deceased veteran CDU politician Wolfgang Schäuble, who was a member of the German parliament for more than 50 years. Merz chose not to stand for parliament again in 2009, and went on to pursue a career in business. From 2016 to 2020, he was chairman of the supervisory board of the German arm of BlackRock, currently the world's largest asset management company, and during this time he was often in the United States on business. It wasn't until 2021 that Merz ran again for the Bundestag, and was elected. In fleshing out his plans for government, he has been more outspoken than his taciturn predecessorOlaf Scholz, Merz frequently makes a point of mentioning that, for several months now, he has been in regular contact with European heads of government: dinner with France's President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace, bilateral talks in Berlin or Brussels. He also intends to travel to the US before the summer recess to meet Republican President Donald Trump. In a particularly striking example, Merz gave an hour-long TV interview to the German political talk show Caren Miosga eight days before the Easter weekend, in which he spoke about continuing military aid to Ukraine, going significantly beyond the "red line" repeatedly drawn by Chancellor Scholz. Merz raised the prospect of Germany delivering Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv. These long-range, high-impact weapons would be of great assistance to Ukraine, and could seriously pressure Russia. He added that the UK, France, and US had already been supplying cruise missiles, and if the weapons supply was coordinated with its allies, "Germany should also participate." He commented that the Ukrainian army "has to get out of the defensive position — all it does is react." It needed to "be able to exert some control over what's happening." Merz even explicitly mentioned the possibility of Ukraine destroying the Crimean Bridge, a key strategic link between Russia and the unilaterally annexed Crimean peninsula. With this rhetoric and level of detail, Merz has positioned himself in direct opposition to Scholz, who consistently opposed Taurus deliveries and warned against any further escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Continued support for Ukraine is only one element of the broader political upheaval in Germany that has resulted from the policies of the new US administration — an upheaval that at times has caused Merz's standing and credibility to plummet. For months, both in the Bundestag and on the campaign trail, Merz and other conservative politicians emphasized the importance of adhering to Germany's debt brake, and called for fiscal discipline. This abruptly changed with the start of the exploratory talks between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. By mid-March, both of Germany's legislative chambers had approved a historically unprecedented decision: From now on, there will be no cap on defense spending. A package worth €500 billion ($570 billion) is also being introduced, aimed at improving Germany's crumbling infrastructure. This entails easing the debt brake to which, during the election campaign, the CDU and CSU had initially promised to adhere. Meanwhile, Merz — and all the mainstream parties — have the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) pressuring them from behind. Observers say the AfD's gains in the most recent election have prompted the future coalition partners to include stricter immigration policies and a greater focus on internal security in the coalition agreement. Just days before the federal election, Merz sparked controversy and confusion, both at home and abroad, by effectively weakening the "firewall" that he, along with all the other mainstream parties, had pledged to maintain against the AfD. Merz accepted the AfD's backing in several parliamentary votes on migration policy, in a bid to help the CDU/CSU and pro-business Free Deomcratic Party (FDP) defeat the remaining red-green votes, which by then no longer held a majority. This move triggered a wave of outrage among politicians and in German civil society. Now, Merz says he wants to boost the confidence of the German people. "We are a great country of more than 80 million people, who live and work here and take care of their families," he said. He wants to show "that the effort is worth it."

Title: The Real Deal Behind the Panama Canal & Greenland

Editor Empire Canadian Patriot, Cynthia Chung There has been a great deal of criticism against the recent developments with the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison’s agreement to sell its Panama Canal ports, Cristobal and Balboa, to BlackRock. A sale that has been loudly backed by the Trump Administration. There has been especially a great deal of criticism by Trump and his administration over the operation of the Panama Canal claiming China has taken over control of this vital trade chokepoint and is causing the US to pay more than others for the use of the canal. There have even been accusations within the Trump Administration, including by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, that they are certain China plans to block America’s use of the Panama Canal completely. The accuracy of these accusations will be reviewed and discussed in detail in this series. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino earlier this year had made a public statement, in response to Trump’s accusations that China was controlling the Panama Canal, and published a strongly worded statement “wholly rejecting” Trump’s words and saying the canal would remain Panamanian. President Mulino added that no nation was interfering with the canal’s administration and that dialogue was the best way to resolve the issues Trump raised. He also disagreed with Trump’s characterisation of the US returning the canal to Panama.[1] “The canal wasn’t given by anyone, it was the result of a generational fight that culminated in 1999,” Mulino wrote on X.[2] However, after Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama after less than one month as US Secretary of State (Panama was first on the list of visits by Rubio, followed by El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic) he proudly stated in his interview with FOX News that Panama was the first country to exit from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and that he expects other Latin American countries to follow suit. Trump has repeatedly stated that the US built the Panama Canal and thus has the right to “reclaim it”. These developments and the history of US-Panamanian relations will be discussed in this series. China has been heavily criticized for the deferral of the BlackRock purchase, who has filed an anti-monopoly investigation launched by China’s State Administration of Market Regulation. This move has ignited accusations that China is overreaching in its legal reach. The accuracy of such accusations will be reviewed in this series. BlackRock’s role globally as well as domestically will also be reviewed in detail, and especially its direct role in influencing the economy and well-being of Americans. In addition, BlackRock’s role along with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) will be reviewed in what they are in fact proposing as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, along with an overview of BRI’s activities thus far. Through A Glass Darkly On matters of geopolitics, counterintelligence, revisionist history and cultural warfare. By Cynthia Chung As Trump has recently stated “China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.” Trump, in his first speech of his second term, denounced the so-called “deal” the US made decades ago to turn over the Panama Canal to Panamanians. “We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should never have been made,” Trump said during his inaugural speech. “And Panama’s promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated.” In the weeks ahead of his inauguration, he threatened to have US reassert control of the Panama Canal, including possible military action the day after Christmas on his Truth Social platform. As has already been briefly mentioned, the President of Panama Jose Mulino disagreed with this statement by Trump that the Panama Canal was “given” to the Panamanians by the Americans but that this was the culmination of a long fight – a long fight for Panama’s sovereignty that is. Trump went on to state “Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous.” Trump also stated that “It was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else,” Trump said. “We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!”[3] Mulino dismissed these criticisms as well as Trump’s threats to retake the Panama Canal, stating “Every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama,” he said on a video posted on X. Mulino also stated “The canal has no direct or indirect control from China, nor the European Union, nor the United States or any other power,” Mulino continued “As a Panamanian, I reject any manifestation that misrepresents this reality.”[4] It should be noted here that President Mulino is a right leaning conservative and had very good relations with the US up until these recent accusations. Let us go over whether there is any validity to Trump’s statements and accusations. In a recent speech Trump claimed that the Panama Canal had left 38,000 Americans dead. He stated “The United States, I mean think of this, spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.” This is not remotely true. Rather, it is estimated that 25,000 people died that were French and Jamaican, during the first construction period, that were mostly from mosquito-borne viruses. Virtually none of those deaths were American.[5] Author Matthew Parker who wrote the book “Hell’s Gorge: The Battle to Build the Panama Canal” said that during the US period of construction from about 1904 to 1914 about 6,000 died, mostly all who were Bajans, i.e. from Barbados, with about 300 Americans who died in the effort.[6] These figures are largely in line with other estimates of the death toll in the efforts to build the canal, which was completed in 1914. That during the 1880s more than 22,000 workers from France died (many from malaria and yellow fever). Thus, it appears it is the French who have by a large margin the highest death toll in the construction of the Panama Canal. It should be noted that the Panama Canal was engineered by the same French engineer as the Suez Canal, it was not engineered by an American. Thus, the Panama Canal was engineered and largely built by the French, though it was the Americans who had colonised the territory (more on this history later in this series). It is curious as to where Trump got the number 38,000 and how he came to the conclusion that these were American deaths. Trump has also recently stated that “China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn’t give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” Panama has been controlling the Panama Canal since 1999 after a treaty transfer. It is controlled through the Panama Canal Authority, an 11-member board that oversees the waterway’s maintenance and security. CK Hutchison won a bid in 1997 (thus before Panama even took control over the Panama Canal from the United States!) that allowed Chinese companies to operate in ports at the ends of the canal. But China is not the only one, the United States and Taiwan also have companies who are operating ports along the canal which is open to commerce from all countries. Only two out of the total five ports adjacent to the Panama Canal are owned by the Hong Kong company CK Hutchison. President Mulino has stated that the passage rates are determined by market conditions. There has been no evidence of unfair treatment in China’s favor as the BBC and Financial Times also acknowledge. It is also acknowledged by the BBC and Financial Times that there is no evidence that Chinese soldiers are positioned at these ports as Trump has claimed. For those who may still think there is credit to what Trump has been accusing China of concerning the Panama Canal. I suggest the reading the following excerpt from this article “The Chinese Interests in the Panama Canal Including Updates” published by the Newsroom Panama, here is an excerpt to which I would like to particularly highlight from their article: ‘The truth, nothing but the truth. Our family, friends, coworkers and acquaintances rely on our words and that is why we have to be as accurate as possible. To help in this effort of citizen diplomacy, here are the truths we must understand in order to share them with the world. False statement: “The United States gave the canal to Panama for one dollar ” Answer: In 1903, Panama authorized the United States to build a canal and gave permission to use land and water. Panama was severely limited in its own development, at a high human and economic cost. The canal was not free; we Panamanians had paid for it in advance and in full. False statement: “The Panama Canal charges excessively and represents a high cost to the United States economy. ” Answer: The Panama Canal toll represents 5% of the value of freight between Asia and the United States. 2.7% of world trade passes through the Canal ($33 trillion in 2024), but the Canal only generated revenues of about $6 billion. So it is not a cause of inflation but rather a huge subsidy to the economy of one of the most developed countries in the world. False statement: “38,000 U.S. citizens died during the construction of the Canal.” During the construction of the Panama Canal (1904-1914) 350 American citizens died, according to data contained in the Roberto F. Chiari Library of the Panama Canal. False claim: “The US Navy pays too much to cross the canal and is discriminated against by Panama.” The US Navy has free [i.e full access] passage through the Panama Canal, so there are no lines or reservations required. [In other words, the passage of the US Navy is prioritised through the Panama Canal.] Between 2015 and 2024, the US Navy only paid approximately $17 million in tolls to cross the Panama Canal. That’s less than $2 million a year. False claim: “The Chinese government controls the Panama Canal.” Answer: Panama controls, manages, supervises, regulates, cares for and maintains the Panama Canal. There are no Chinese military personnel stationed in Panama, instead, the Panama Canal Advisory Board is chaired by retired Admiral William J. Flanagan, who was head of the U.S. Southern Command. False claim: “The Chinese company that operates two ports at the entrances to the Panama Canal can close them whenever the Chinese government orders it.” Answer: The ports of Balboa and Cristobal are owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchinson. This company has 53 ports in 24 countries, including the United States, and by 2023 it had handled more than 81 million containers or the equivalent. This company is not included on any United States government list of restricted companies, as are other Chinese companies. It is important to understand that all ships entering and leaving the Panama Canal are captained by Panamanian Canal pilots, including ships going to the ports of Balboa and Cristobal. So at all times those ships are commanded by a Panamanian Panama Canal collaborator. Go ahead, take what is said here, put it into your own words and share it with the whole world. Only the truth and national unity will lead us to a safe harbor.’ Thus, the US does not appear to be receiving unfair treatment afterall. Rather the US pays more than any other country for the use of the Panama Canal because it accounts for 75% of the canal traffic in the fiscal year 2024, with China coming in at second with 21%. In other words, the passage rate is determined by the number of ship/cargo that is going through, thus, the US pays more since they have more ships/cargo going through. To claim that this is unfair treatment is a dishonest statement. As with Trump’s tariff war – threatening international companies to set up their factories in the US or face sky-high tariffs, in order to artificially boost the US economy without creating American jobs and manufacturing – it appears Trump is also upset with the Panama Canal simply because the United States is expected to pay for the use of a canal “they built” (no mention of the French ever…). There is no unfair treatment. There is no evidence of Chinese manipulation to restrict US access. The US simply does not want to pay, period. And they are using China as an excuse for why they feel justified in reclaiming an imperialistic agenda towards Panama. Think about it for a moment. The United States is doing the very thing that they have been trying to scapegoat China’s BRI on, that because the US “built” the Panama Canal when Panama was a colony of theirs, that means it is theirs forever and they get to do with it as they wish despite Panama being a sovereign country now?!? Isn’t that exactly what they were accusing China would eventually do, but actually hasn’t? Is the US going so far as to justify that it needs to become an imperialistic empire in order to defend the world from China’s business? Sounds awfully similar to Churchill’s NSC-75 when the United States was dragged into defending Britian’s colonial interests worldwide in order to so-called save the world from Soviet communism. Yes, subject countries were told they had to continue being British colonies in order to fight communism…. One wonders if that is what spurred Trump’s recent musings to actually join the British Commonwealth while in the presence of King Charles. So there does not really seem to be any Chinese coercion after all. Rather, it appears that Trump simply does not want to pay Panama for the use of the canal, while other countries would be expected to do so. And the way the wind is blowing, it looks like it is rather the US who wishes to cut China out of the use of the Panama Canal, one of the most strategic trade routes globally. And the US apparently feels justified in this, all because they apparently built and gave the Panama Canal to the Panamanians – which is a very dishonest account of this history which will be reviewed in detail later in this series. However, for now, if you wish to know more about the real role the United States played in Panama you can watch this Oscar winning documentary “The Panama Deception” (1992) for free on youtube here which goes over the real reasons for the US invasion of Panama in December 1989. When President Mulino had made his public statement that “Every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama” Trump directly responded to this statement by Mulino on his Truth Social platform with “We’ll see about that!” and posted shortly after an image of the American flag with “Welcome to the United States Canal!”. This was reposted by Elon Musk with “2025 is gonna be so lit” laughing emojis. The level of hypocrisy of these statements are hopefully sinking in. And the accusations of China are more and more looking like guilty confessions of what the US desires for itself. This will be confirmed time and time again as we go further in this series. It does not seem to be about China’s so-called use of power and influence in the canal after all, but about the US reclaiming a former colonial asset. And it just so happens that that is BlackRock’s speciality. The deal between CK Hutchison and BlackRock consortium was unveiled in March, which saw BlackRock team up with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Terminal Investment Limited to purchase CK Hutchison’s global port operations, spanning 43 ports in 23 countries (out of their total which is 53 ports in 24 countries). Included within this deal were the Panama Canal ports, Cristobal and Balboa. The Panama Canal handles roughly 3-5% of global maritime trade, with the United States accounting for nearly 75% of canal traffic and China coming in at second with 21%. The Hong Kong based CK Hutchison, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, stood to profit $22.8 billion (enterprise value) selling BlackRock 80% ownership of CK Hutchison’s portfolio of 43 global ports and in a parallel agreement for 90% ownership of their Panama Ports Company, which operates the terminals in Balboa and Cristobal, in the Panama Canal. For BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with $11.6 trillion under its belt, the acquisition promised $1.7 billion in annual revenue, marking a bold expansion into infrastructure from its more traditional ventures in stock and bond investments. News of the deferral of a signing date for the deal came along with news that China had launched an antitrust review in March. The antitrust investigation was to probe the impact on China’s interests and national security if the deal went through, essentially whether it would cause unfair competition. In other words, to assess whether BlackRock’s acquisition could lead to a monopoly on specific routes, such as Asia-Americas, which could form a global monopoly network. China could counteract through tools like the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, but it would need to balance the conflicts with international law and diplomatic costs. The parties (CK Hutchison and BlackRock) have 145 days to exclusively and confidentially negotiate the final terms of this sale. Beyond the 145 days of this exclusivity period, CK Hutchison has the right to sell the assets to other parties. Once the deal is signed there will be no leeway for negotiations or backing out. Other than BlackRock, the consortium comprises of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Terminal Investment Limited, funded by BlackRock and run by the Mediterranean Shipping Company or MSC. U.S. President Donald Trump had hailed the BlackRock transaction as a positive step at “reclaiming” the Panama Canal. More recent developments have further complicated this deal between CK Hutchison and BlackRock after an audit by the Panamanian authorities, which began this past January closely following Trump’s accusations of “unfair” treatment blaming the Chinese. The audit claims to have found contractual violations that amount to $1.3 billion in unpaid fees and alleged tax evasion from the Hong-Kong based company. The audit is of most suspicious timing on CK Hutchison which has been operating these ports for over 28 years. It is not so much the accusation that CK Hutchison owes $1,3 billion in fees but rather that this has been used to justify revoking CK Hutchison’s concession over the ports. If this goes through, CK Hutchison stands to lose the ports overnight. It is acknowledged even by the Financial Times that this audit is in fact a “nod to Donal Trump” and clearly in opposition to the President of Panama’s statements of Panama’s sovereignty in this matter. Financial Times writes in their article “Panama begins an audit of Hong Kong company in nod to Donald Trump” published January 21, 2025: Panama’s government on Monday began an audit of a Hong Kong company that operates ports at either end of its canal, after US President Donald Trump warned that he wanted to take back the waterway over alleged Chinese influence. … In response, Panama’s Office of the Comptroller General published a video on social media platform X of about 10 men and women in suits filing off a bus into the local offices of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to begin an audit, in a move seen as a nod to Trump. “Today our auditors arrived at [the company] to start an exhaustive audit aimed at guaranteeing efficient and transparent use of public resources,” the comptroller general’s office said on X. Llegada del equipo de Contraloría encargada de realizar la auditoría a Panama Ports Company.#ContraloríaPanamá #CGRPanamá #Transparencia pic.twitter.com/O4jtRRj2rR — Contraloría General de la República de Panamá (@ContraloriaPma) January 20, 2025 … China does not control the canal, but some officials in Washington are increasingly concerned about Chinese companies’ presence in the area. … Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino — a law and order conservative — on Monday published a strongly worded statement “wholly rejecting” Trump’s words and saying the canal would remain Panamanian. He added that no nation was interfering with the canal’s administration and that dialogue was the best way to resolve the issues Trump raised. He also disagreed with Trump’s characterisation of the US returning the canal to Panama. “The canal wasn’t given by anyone, it was the result of a generational fight that culminated in 1999,” he wrote on X. CK Hutchison’s Panama Ports Company (PPC) has had a concession to operate the ports of Balboa and Cristobal since 1997, which was renewed in 2021 for 25 more years. Again, this contract was given to CK Hutchison two years before the Panamanian government gained control of the Panama Canal in 1999 from the United States. What this means, is that it was in fact the United States itself who first allowed the concession to CK Hutchison for use of these ports. Perhaps they thought nothing of it at the time since Hong Kong had a legacy of 99 years as a British colony, the effects of which would not leave the region anytime soon. And was being returned to a disempowered China that same year, 1997. However, Panama’s Comptroller General[7] (i.e. manager of public funds) Anel Flores’s withering assessment has called into question CK Hutchison’s concession renewal in 2021 and has accused the company of flagrant procedural breaches and financial mismanagement. The comptroller’s office intends to file criminal charges against officials who greenlit the 2021 renewal, while Panama’s Maritime Authority now faces pressure to revoke the concession entirely.[8] Other than the Panamanian ports, the BlackRock deal with CK Hutchison was the purchase of 41 other overseas port operations (out of its total 53 ports). The two ports in Hong Kong are also included in the total count of the ten ports located in China. Thus, CK Hutchison was willing to sell all of its overseas port operations excluding only the ten ports that were located in China, for reasons that should be clear. As we can appreciate from these maps of the port locations that CK Hutchison was willing to sell to BlackRock, selling 43 out of their total 53 ports, we can begin to appreciate the concern China might have in BlackRock acquiring a monopoly of trade routes, especially since BlackRock has made it no secret that it intends to counter China’s BRI. It is for this reason that Chinese articles had called this deal a “betrayal of all Chinese people.” CK Hutchison was willing to hand-over all of its overseas ports, which are located in vital trade routes to a company that is publicly opposed and antagonistic to China’s global trade. Imagine if the situation were reversed and an American company had done this, the reaction would be no less. In addition, it has now more recently come out that the other entity to stand to benefit from this deal, to which BlackRock is working for, is the Swiss-Italian Aponte family who own the world’s largest container line and has a 20.3% market share, according to shipping data provider Alphaliner. Sources told the South China Morning Post that the Aponte family was the mysterious driving force behind the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) that aimed to solidify its dominance at sea. MSC was the one that stood to acquire the 41 ports in 22 countries through its arm Terminal Investment Limited (TiL) in partnership with BlackRock. Under the proposed deal BlackRock would acquire the two ports in the Panama Canal. If MSC successfully acquires these 41 ports they will potentially become the world’s largest container terminal operator.[9] South China Morning Posts’ article “Twist in Hutchison ports deal as Italian shipping family’s role surfaces” writes: “The partnership with BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners highlights the scale and financial muscle behind the family’s ambitions, allowing MSC to leverage significant investment capital while retaining operational influence over these vital port facilities. … While Geneva-based MSC keeps its financial results private, Italian media reported that the company’s equity was €91 billion in 2022, with net profits of €36.2 billion.” Who is the Aponte family? According to The Swiss Times, the Aponte family who owns the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) in Geneva was “recently crowned the richest family in Switzerland thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic and western buying habits. But the notoriously secretive family has also come under fire for how they may have obtained their success: making friends with politicians and turning a blind eye to shipping some nefarious items.” The Swiss Times continues in “How the pandemic helped make the richest family in Switzerland” published October 17th, 2022: The Aponte family is famously tight-lipped; they have never confirmed their wealth and have declined to give any interviews to media outlets. Moreover, MSC is the only major shipping company to have never published financial figures and it is not even listed on the stock exchange. The price of shipping by frigate increased six-fold during the pandemic. American shipping expert John McCown estimates the company made $26.6 billion in profits between June 2021 and June 2022. “MSC earns as much as three-quarters of Facebook” McCown told 24 Heures, meaning that the family now has about $100 billion net worth. This places the family just below Bill Gates (fifth richest person in the world) and above Warren Buffet, according to Forbes’ billionaire ranking. Before the pandemic, the Aponte family did not crack the list of the top 100 wealthiest people in the world and now they likely rank among the top 10. How did this happen? While many economists predicted that global trade would collapse during the 2020 Covid pandemic, homebound Americans went on an online spending spree – making shipping one of the most in-demand industries at the time. The explosion in demand – coming mostly from the U.S. for products made in Asia – peaked in 2021 as bored Americans bought laptops, Pelotons, furniture and clothes. The congestion in supply chains caused shipping prices to soar. A container that once cost $2,700 to ship now cost $15,000 or more. Essentially, costs multiplied sixfold during a 12-month period. The Aponte family “made more money than in the entire previous decade” during the pandemic, an MSC spokesperson told Le Matin Dimanche. Even U.S. President Joe Biden called out MSC for raising their prices by 1000 percent to the detriment of “American families and businesses.” And while shipping prices are now declining, they still remain about three times higher than they were in 2019, according to shipping experts from maritime research firm Drewry. The prices remain that way because MSC has global influence at this point. The family decides on “the price, the availability, the deadline,” a former MSC employee told Le Matin, adding “Today, they feel untouchable.” Last year – at the height of MSC’s pandemic earnings – it came to light how the Aponte family cultivated a friendship with Alexis Kohler, who has served as the secretary general to France and the right-hand man to French President Emmanuel Marcon since 2017. Kohler began working at the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance and slowly climbed his way up to become director of Macron’s cabinet in 2014. When Macron resigned from that position in 2016 to begin working on his presidential campaign, Kohler became the financial director of MSC Cruises in Geneva, earning nearly CHF 500,000 [Swiss Francs] per year – more than most senior directors at MSC. During this time, Kohler was allowed to take a half day or day off each week to work on Macron’s presidential campaign. During the same period, Kohler, his wife, and three children went on eight vacations on Aponte family yachts, as well as staying at their ski chalet in Megève. It was also during this time that Kohler was privy to sensitive information regarding MSC’s contract with the French shipyards of Saint-Nazaire. MSC has spent more than 20 billion euros building cruise ships in Saint-Nazaire, according to Mer et Marine. It has been a symbiotic relationship: MSC funnels business into the shipyards, and about 80 percent of the construction was financed by bank loans from the French government, according to Mediapart. In 2021, French anti-corruption investigators from Anticor searched the MSC offices in Geneva on suspicion of “successive conflicts of interest” between Kohler and MSC. Kohler, his family, and the Aponte family say they have never discussed the Saint-Nazaire shipyards or financing MSC cruise ships, but just two weeks ago the French government served Kohler a conflict-of-interest lawsuit. Luckily for Kohler, the offense does not exist under Swiss law, so he is presumed innocent here. But in France, Kohler may still face a trial. Illegal shipments In 2019, a MSC ship traveling from Brazil to Europe ran aground in American waters. U.S. authorities discovered about 20 tons of cocaine hidden on board. MSC had to pay $50 million for the U.S. to release the ship. The discovery gave credence to the widely-held belief that Brazil was funding Antwerp’s European drug market. Since then, Belgian port authorities have tightened security by adding thermal cameras to their ports. Then at the end of 2021, authorities at a Yemen port discovered another 200 kilos of drugs aboard an MSC ship coming from South America. In January of 2022, MSC announced they would halt all South American shipments until further notice. MSC only finally cracked down because drug cartels made threats against the company, its customers, and business partners, according to Belgian state media outlet RTBF.”[10] The close relationship MSC has with the Macron government will become further relevant as we look into the role of BlackRock who was selected by the G7 to oversee the Build Back Better World (B3W) agenda. Again, BlackRock was working in partnership with MSC in attempting to secure the purchasing of these 43 ports worldwide owned by CK Hutchison. BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager was also selected by the G7 to oversee the acquiring of infrastructure worldwide in service to B3W, which was later called the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII). It is curious as to how Trump supporters appear to have no questions about this new alliance between the Trump Administration and BlackRock, who have in the past been heavily critical of BlackRock’s activities. Let us take a closer look at BlackRock shall we? In less than one month after Joe Biden’s election win, it was announced that two BlackRock executives would join his administration, taking on roles at Treasury and the National Economic Council. Wall Street bankers, particularly from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have long held senior positions in the White House. In the case of Biden’s administration, these positions were largely filled by BlackRock executives. Eric Van Nostrand, a BlackRock managing director who was head of research for sustainable investments and multi-asset strategies joined the Biden Treasury Department and worked as a senior adviser on economic issues tied to Russia and Ukraine. Not so coincidentally, Zelensky later announced in 2023 that the world’s largest investment company would be in charge of creating a fund for rebuilding Ukraine…which was BlackRock. Zelensky’s official Ukrainian government website reports: “President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting with the management of the largest asset management company in the world — BlackRock. The parties discussed the details of the creation of an investment fund to restore the economy of Ukraine with the involvement of public and private capital. At the meeting, Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy signed an agreement with BlackRock Financial Market Advisory on providing support services to the Ukraine Development Fund. The main goal of the fund’s creation is to attract private and public capital for implementing large-scale business projects in Ukraine.” In other words, this deal is about “rebuilding” Ukraine with infrastructure that will be privatized and owned by the largest asset management company – BlackRock. Ukraine will own nothing as a result of this deal. Ukraine has been one big shell company and laundromat for the dirty offshore tax havens of billionaires with direct ties to the City of London since Ukraine’s so-called independence in 1991. Readers should be aware that current Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky was found to also be concealing assets offshore in the Pandora Paper’s revelations. According to the Pandora Papers, Zelensky and his inner circle were the beneficiaries of a network of offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, and Belize, including some that owned expensive London property. There has not been an official inquiry as to whether Zelensky’s offshore holdings are indeed implicated in tax evasion and bank fraud, however, we do know that Zelensky is indeed implicated in this by the mere fact that the majority of his funding up until he became president of Ukraine had come from Ihor Kolomoisky, who was also named in the Pandora Papers, and whose PrivatBank was found guilty of embezzlement. Recall it was Joe Biden, as vice-president of the United States, who publicly bragged on a Council on Foreign Relations platform in 2018 that he would only deliver a loan to Ukraine for economic aid if the Ukrainian prosecutor Shokin was fired who was at the time investigating Burisma Holdings for corruption charges. Where Biden’s son Hunter had allegedly received $3.5 million from the company at the expense of Ukrainians. Thus, it should be no surprise that BlackRock was Biden’s pick to implement his bizarrely titled “Build Back Better World” initiative as a counter to China’s Belt and Road. This Build Back Better World initiative of Biden, which was supported by the G7, was sold as something that would compete with China and meet the “tremendous infrastructure needs of low and middle-income countries…Build Back Better World (B3W), a…transparent infrastructure partnership led by major democracies to help narrow the $40 trillion infrastructure need in the developing world…”[11] Later B3W would be effectively renamed as Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), what would continue after the Biden administration as G7’s “flagship infrastructure and investment initiative” in the words of the Biden administration’s White House statement. At the 2024 G7 Leaders’ Summit on June 13th it was made crystal clear that BlackRock would be leading this PGII initiative to meet the infrastructure needs of low and middle-income countries in the developing world. According to a Biden Administration’s White House briefing room statement: “In support of the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) topline goal of mobilizing $600 billion in infrastructure investment in emerging economies, a coalition of U.S. investors highlighted and committed anew billions of dollars in private investment in scaled infrastructure in emerging markets, aligned with PGII priorities…The meeting confirmed the commitment to launching and scaling investments around PGII economic corridors globally, including corridors in Asia, Africa, and one connecting Europe to Asia through the Middle East, noting appreciation for the wide range of current and future investment by private companies in strategic sectors, such as finance for green energy and digitalization.” In a FACT SHEET released by the Biden Administration it was confirmed that at this G7 summit, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella were invited to lead the G7 meeting in discussing the buying up of infrastructure globally which will be privatized and managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). Who owns the Global Infrastructure Partnership (GIP) in 2024? BlackRock does. The Biden White House FACT SHEET continues stating: “Microsoft and BlackRock each highlighted billions in investment in support of PGII priorities, including Microsoft investing nearly $5 billion in digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, skilling, and other capacity building in Kenya, Indonesia, and Malaysia, plus additional infrastructure investments and other initiatives in Thailand and the Philippines.” Thus, this is effectively a BlackRock and Microsoft led endeavour in the execution of the G7’s PGII as a counter to China’s BRI. Nothing concerning about that arrangement right? BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, managing over $10 trillion. What that means is BlackRock manages trillions of dollars of wealth that is primarily owned by billionaires around the world. Its job is to find out ways to invest the money of the rich so that they can become wealthier. BlackRock has traditionally invested in stocks and bonds (with its counterpart Blackstone investing in infrastructure, more on this in part II of this series). However, with BlackRock’s recent venture into investment in infrastructure globally, what this amounts to, is the acquiring and privatization of key strategic infrastructure globally to service the billionaire class. These key infrastructures will be privatized under BlackRock and will charge a fee for their use. Such as Malaysia’s airports… We can see now how the Aponte’s close relationship to the Macron government is also in line with this agenda. Thus, the attempt to buy up these 43 ports from CK Hutchison – who clearly desires to wipe its hands clean and step out of this dangerous global game – such a deal would stand to directly benefit PGII agenda which appears to be more interested in benefiting a class of billionaires than the people of these developing nations. And to cut out China from strategic global trade routes. Thus, the G7’s PGII under management of BlackRock’s GIP is intending on doing the very thing that the United States has been falsely claiming China’s BRI of doing. Under the PGII framework, infrastructure will be acquired in the developing world and these countries will have to pay to use these essential infrastructures within their own countries. They will own nothing. Rather ownership of these key infrastructures will be amongst a global billionaire class to which BlackRock is in service to. What this means is that your local government may privatize the water grid or the power grid or the garbage disposal service or it might simply privatize the roads and they will be bought up by some of these asset manager funds on Wall Street and they will hike up the prices, charge monopoly rents, charge you more and more fees to use these basic services. This is not just the plan for the “developing” countries of the world. It is the plan for within the United States as well. In fact, it has been already ongoing for decades under Blackstone, one of the primary backers to Trump’s more recent presidential campaign. Blackstone has had a long legacy of buying up American infrastructure such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools. When these infrastructures came under the ownership of Blackstone which is the world largest commercial landlord, all sorts of budget cuts were made to the detriment of health and educational services. Budget cuts even included cuts to food for patients. Part II of this series will discuss this in detail, however, for now you can read more on this here and here and here and here. In addition, Blackstone is responsible for buying up homes and is largely responsible for the inflation of house prices such that most Americans today cannot afford decent housing. In fact, they made a killing during the 2008 financial crisis. Again, more on this in Part II of this series. Americans should question how Trump is fine accepting money from an asset manager company who works for the interests of billionaires to the devastation of America’s real economy and real jobs. However, it does explain Trump’s enthusiasm in his backing of BlackRock’s attempt to claim the two Panama Canal ports. After all, as the CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink has proudly acknowledged, BlackRock started as Blackstone… Cynthia Chung is the President of the Rising Tide Foundation and author of the books “The Shaping of a World Religion” & “The Empire on Which the Black Sun Never Set,” consider supporting her work by making a donation and subscribing to her substack page Through A Glass Darkly.

Title: States Halting Efforts to Create Strategic Bitcoin Reserves
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2025/states-halting-efforts-to-create-strategic-bitcoin-reserves/
Time Published: 2025-05-06T12:52:22Z

Soon after taking office, President Donald Trump floated plans for a strategic bitcoin reserve. It was part of a larger push by the president, backed by the digital asset sector, to turn the U.S. into the world’s cryptocurrency capital. However, similar efforts to create bitcoin reserves have begun to flounder on the state level. The latest example comes from Florida, where, per a report Tuesday (May 6) by Decrypt, a pair of bills designed to allocate up to 10% of select public funds to bitcoin were withdrawn. As that report notes, Florida joins Arizona, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wyoming on the list of states that have rejected crypto treasury legislation this year. In some states legislation made it past both chambers before the state’s governor vetoed the bills. That’s what happened last week in Arizona, when Gov. Katie Hobbs rejected legislation that would have invested a portion of the state’s retirement fund into bitcoin. “Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу,” Hobbs wrote in a letter to the state senate president. According to the Decrypt report, as of early May there were 36 active bitcoin reserve bills in 19 states. Just two weeks ago, there were more than 45 such pieces of legislation in more than two dozen states. This legislative back-and-forth is happening, as PYMNTS wrote recently, amid a growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. “Observers believe it is becoming increasingly held, across Wall Street and beyond, that digital assets may no longer be confined to speculative circles,” that report said. “As bitcoin ETFs become a growing component of diversified portfolios and regulatory frameworks begin to crystallize, the decentralization dream that once defined crypto appears to be giving way to a new era of structured integration.” And while it’s no longer a novelty to see major investment firms delving into crypto, this year has marked a turning point. Morgan Stanley is preparing to offer cryptocurrency trading to its massive E*Trade user base as soon as 2026, a move that could bring digital asset investments to millions of customers. At the same time, Charles Schwab is preparing to offer spot crypto trading for bitcoin and ethereum sometime this year to address increasing demand from traditional investors. “These moves are not isolated,” the report added. “BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is pushing blockchain technology deeper into conventional finance. The firm recently announced plans to register a new share class of its $150 billion money market fund on a blockchain, a step designed to enhance transparency and operational efficiency.” States Halting Efforts to Create Strategic Bitcoin Reserves Wonder Aims to Expand Meal Prep Biz After Raising $600 Million CFPB Reportedly Reworking Biden-Era Open Banking Rule Joor CEO: Retail Is Reeling as 'Uncertainty Kills Economies' We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. The family behind Skechers is set to pocket over $1 billion from selling the comfortable footwear brand. Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital, which has previously invested in companies like Burger King and Tim Hortons, will spend nearly $9.5 billion to buy Skechers in a deal that will also take the company private. Robert Greenberg, a former hairstylist who tried to get rich off of everything from mail-order toupees to roller skates, founded the company with his son Michael in 1992 and the family still owns a 12% stake. The shoemaker reported a record $9 billion in revenue last year, though the deal comes in a precarious period for retailers amid tariffs. Nonetheless, 3G seems to be in it for the long haul. Ford pulled its annual financial forecast Monday. As President Donald Trump’s tariffs cause continued distress, Ford became the latest firm to pull its annual financial forecast Monday, in addition to truck engine maker Cummins. The automaker expects tariffs to reduce its earnings before interest and taxes by about $1.5 billion this year, and cited the “the potential for industrywide supply chain disruption.” Filming for some of the biggest blockbusters from this decade—from the Avatar franchise to Barbie—took place abroad, raising questions about the impacts of President Trump’s proposed 100% tariff on films produced outside the U.S. Film productions in the U.S. have declined in recent years, driven by the pandemic, labor strikes and financial incentives offered by locations abroad. MORE: California Governor Gavin Newsom said Monday that his home state was “all in to bring more production here” and that he wants to work with the Trump Administration to craft a $7.5 billion federal film tax incentive to support the entertainment industry, an alternative to the proposed tariffs. Warren Buffett's six-decade tenure as Berkshire Hathaway CEO will come to an end this year. Berkshire Hathaway and its iconic leader Warren Buffett saw a rare but predictable setback Monday, as the investment firm’s shares slid 5% on the first day of trading since Buffett announced he would step down as CEO at the end of 2025. Buffett’s fortune shrank by nearly $9 billion to about $160 billion amid the selloff, according to Forbes’ estimates. Alphabet’s Google has awarded Gamuda—a construction company cofounded by tycoon Lin Yun Ling—a contract worth $236 million to build a hyperscale data center in Malaysia. It’s the second deal Google has made with Gamuda, as Malaysia rapidly emerges as a key hub for data centers, with total investment commitments from major tech firms reaching more than $23 billion. A new bipartisan Senate bill would raise the limit on loans for small businesses in manufacturing from $5 million to $10 million, a needed increase on the Small Business Administration’s 15-year-old cap, but still a far cry from the $50 million limit proposed in Project 2025. ​​Bankers say the higher limit may help some manufacturers invest in equipment or expand facilities, but they don’t expect a flood of new factories due to President Donald Trump’s tariff uncertainty. The federal government will offer undocumented migrants $1,000 to leave the U.S., the Trump Administration’s latest effort to speed up its immigration agenda. The Department of Homeland Security estimates the program will decrease the cost of a deportation by 70%, down from an average of $17,121. Amid DOGE’s efforts to slash the federal workforce, the IRS has been a major target. The cuts have impacted 11% of its workforce, including those who voluntarily resigned and those who received termination notices—and more are on the way. Some positions were affected more than others, like revenue agents, who audit tax returns. Bills in the House and Senate aim to bring stablecoin issuers into the regulatory fold. Congress is racing to lay down the rules for stablecoins—blockchain-based tokens typically pegged to the U.S. dollar and, increasingly, the plumbing of global payments. Dueling bills in the House and Senate aim to bring stablecoin issuers into the regulatory fold, spelling out exactly how much capital, liquidity and risk management is enough. They also aim to clarify which federal or state agencies get to play referee. But there’s another, less flashy subplot: How will widespread acceptance of stablecoins among traditional institutions globally affect the $28 trillion U.S. Treasury market? Treasurys are the backbone of stablecoin reserves because not much else comes close in terms of safety and liquidity. If you’re offering a digital dollar, you need to back it with assets that are as close to risk-free as possible. This sounds a lot like hundreds of money market mutual funds, issued by giants like BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard, that hold over $6 trillion in assets—mostly in U.S. Treasury bills. But unlike a money market fund, stablecoin issuers have so far resisted offering any kind of yield or income to their holders. That’s one reason why Tether, the largest of them, has extremely high margins and reported over $1 billion in operating profit in the first quarter of 2025. Right now, the dozens of stablecoin issuers that exist hold about $150 billion in U.S. government debt. That’s a rounding error in the $28 trillion Treasury securities market and a fairly insignificant portion of the $6 trillion in Treasury bills outstanding. But Britain’s Standard Chartered Bank, which offers custody for cryptocurrencies, projects that the global stablecoin market could jump from $240 billion to $2 trillion in just three years. WHY IT MATTERS “The Trump Administration has argued that stablecoins could help secure the dollar’s global dominance, ensure higher demand for Treasurys and, in turn, lower U.S. borrowing costs,” says Forbes reporter Nina Bambysheva. “Still, some academics warn that embedding stablecoins into the Treasury market creates new vulnerabilities.” MORE Key Crypto Bill Imperiled By Trump Crypto Firm’s Deal With Emirati State-Owned Fund Shares of Netflix dipped after President Donald Trump announced the tariffs on foreign-produced movies. Still, the stock pared some of its losses after a White House spokesperson said no final decisions have been made: $20.4 billion: The market capitalization Netflix lost Monday morning 1.94%: The drop in Netflix stock at market close Monday 51%: The share of Netflix’s 2024 content budget that went to content sourced outside North America A key tenant of digital marketing from the last decade is shifting right before our eyes: Traditional search engine optimization, or SEO, is giving way to generative engine optimization, which is being referred to as “GEO.” For most businesses, the effects of ignoring GEO won’t be immediate—it will be a gradual decline in visibility and relevance.

Title: Why is Germany's Friedrich Merz, so unpopular with the public?

After some difficulty, Friedrich Merz has become Germany's new chancellor. His personal popularity is low. Most Germans don't trust him, not least because of his approach to the far-right AfD. Friedrich Merz has failed in his first attempt to become the Federal Republic's 10th chancellor on May 6, not garnering the necessary absolute majority of votes in the Bundestag. Only in round two did he manage to gather enough votes and become chancellor. This comes one day after his center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) signed their coalition agreement. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Even though he won the national election in late February, the 69-year-old's personal popularity has been on a permanent slide: According to an April poll by research institute Forsa for Stern magazine, just 21% of respondents consider Merz trustworthy — nine percentage points lower than in August, and down three points from January. The same poll found that only 40% of respondents consider the incoming chancellor a strong leader, and 27% think Merz "knows what moves people," both of which represent nine-point falls since January. On the plus side — indeed, the only leadership criteria in which Merz scored a majority in the survey — about 60% of respondents believe that Merz "speaks understandably." It's no shock that Merz isn't exactly the most popular chancellor-in-waiting Germany has ever seen. But Ursula Münch, the director of the Tutzing Academy for Political Education in Bavaria, told DW that it's not all his fault. "The circumstances are very different than they used to be," Münch said. "We have a government that has a relatively small proportion of support among voters." Merz has not picked the most fortunate moment in history: In traditional political parlance, a coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD is called a "grand coalition," because for many decades these two parties represented an overwhelming majority of Germany's voters (sometimes well over 80%). In the fragmented landscape of 2025, in which parties have splintered and splintered again over the past 20 years, the two big centrist parties can only claim to represent 45% of voters, going by the February election results. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video There are two obvious reasons why the perception of Merz's trustworthiness might have fallen in the past few months. In January, Merz broke his own word when he became the first CDU leader to pass a motion through the Bundestag with the support of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), whole factions of which are deemed by intelligence agencies to be a threat to Germany's democratic order. For CDU supporters, however, that seemed like a less-egregious U-turn than the one Merz performed a few weeks later: In March, the party leader agreed a debt brake reform with the SPD and the Greens that paved the way for €1 trillion ($1.14 trillion) in new loans, something he had expressly ruled out throughout the election campaign. Unsurprisingly, many of his voters felt betrayed. In a "Politbarometer" poll carried out by public broadcaster ZDF at the time, some 73% of Germans agreed that he had deceived voters — including some 44% of CDU/CSU supporters. Merz has problems that go much further back than his recent U-turns. Surveys have shown that he is particularly unpopular among women. A Forsa survey from March 2024 found that only 9% of women aged 18 to 29 saw Merz as their preferred chancellor candidate. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Merz has been dogged by accusations of misogyny. In 1997, as is often brought up, he was one of the Bundestag members who voted against recognizing rape within marriage as a crime. In October last year, he was criticized for rejecting the idea of gender-balanced Cabinets, and this reputation was not helped by a photo released in February showing that the main negotiators of the CDU/CSU bloc were all middle-aged men. Merz is also unpopular in eastern Germany, where he regularly polled behind both the AfD's Alice Weidel and the SPD's Olaf Scholz in the run-up to the election — partly, it seems, because of his belligerent attitude toward Russia. Merz's calculation appears to be that, with right-wing populism apparently on rise around the world, what people want is straight-talking leadership. But populism does not appear to be making him more popular. In November 2018, when he first announced his candidacy to re-take the leadership of the CDU, Merz posted a tweet that seems to age worse with every month: "We can once again reach up to 40% and halve the AfD. That is possible!" he wrote. "But we must create the preconditions for it. That is our task." Almost the opposite has happened. Since Merz eventually re-took the CDU leadership in January 2022 (on his third attempt), the party's poll ratings have stayed at 24%, while the AfD's have not halved but doubled: From 11% to 24%. Germany's far-right and center-right parties are now neck and neck. "The best way to keep the AfD small isn't making some random announcement about big changes in refugee policy that you can't implement," Münch said. "People need to be given confidence again, and that will only be possible when the economic forecast turns more positive and the refugee numbers fall." Merz was initially considered a strong candidate precisely because of his business background (he was on the board at the investment company BlackRock for several years), which was supposed to signal his economic acumen. In the past few years, however, his populist statements have increasingly been about immigration, and that hasn't helped him shake off the AfD.

One of Tower Research Capital’s trading groups has “increased capital allocation to its crypto trading book,” and upgraded its crypto market making infrastructure, the source told the financial newswire. Wall Street is quietly ramping up its support for bitcoin and crypto as the Trump administration promises to open up access to bitcoin trading and crypto markets, rolling back Biden-era restrictions and fast-tracking legislation that will rewire the financial system. Last week, Wall Street giants that manage a combined $10 trillion on behalf of clients are predicted to "open for business" on bitcoin this year, allowing advisors to recommend bitcoin ETFs to clients for the first time. The dozen U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, which rocketed to assets under management of more than $100 billion last year, pulled in almost $2 billion last week, according to data from SoSoValue, marking a return to growth after a recent period of outflows that mirrored the stock market’s volatility. “The flows are back in a big way,” BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, said during a recent bitcoin and crypto conference panel discussion, it was reported by The Block.

Title: Why Stablecoin Issuers Could Displace Japan And China As The Biggest Buyers Of U.S. Treasury Securities

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Staff Writer, Money & Markets ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Brian Moynihan, the chief executive officer of $2.6 trillion (assets) Bank of America, doesn’t usually make headlines for his crypto opinions. But in February, he did just that: “If they make that legal, we’ll go into that business.” He was talking about stablecoins—blockchain-based tokens typically pegged to the U.S. dollar and, increasingly, the plumbing of global payments. “They” are Congress, which is now racing to lay down the rules of the road for these crypto creations. The STABLE Act in the House and the GENIUS Act in the Senate are dueling bills with a common goal: to bring stablecoin issuers into the regulatory fold, spelling out exactly how much capital, liquidity and risk management is enough. They also aim to clarify which federal or state agencies get to play referee. But there’s another, less flashy subplot: how will widespread acceptance of stablecoins among traditional institutions globally affect the $28 trillion United States Treasury market? Here’s the thing: Treasurys are the backbone of stablecoin reserves because not much else comes close in terms of safety and liquidity. If you’re offering a digital dollar, you need to back it with assets that are as close to risk-free as possible. This sounds a lot like hundreds of money market mutual funds, which are issued by giants like BlackRock, Fidelity and Vanguard and hold over $6 trillion in assets, mostly in U.S. Treasury bills. The big difference is that unlike a money market fund, say, from Fidelity, which might pay you an annual yield of 4%, most stablecoin issuers have so far resisted offering any kind of yield or income to their holders. That’s one reason why Tether, the largest of them, has extremely high margins and reported over $1 billion in operating profit in the first quarter of 2025. Right now, the dozens of stablecoin issuers that exist—though mostly Tether, based in El Salvador, and Circle, headquartered in New York—hold an estimated $150 billion in U.S. government debt, primarily short-term T-bills. That’s a rounding error in the $28 trillion Treasury securities market and a fairly insignificant portion of the $6 trillion in Treasury bills outstanding. Most Treasurys are still held by the U.S. government itself, think Social Security and federal pension funds. U.S. mutual funds, banks and insurance companies are the next biggest holders, with foreign investors accounting for about 30% (roughly $8.8 trillion), led by Japan and China. But Britain’s Standard Chartered Bank, an $874 billion (assets) institution that offers custody for cryptocurrencies, projects that the global stablecoin market could jump from $240 billion to $2 trillion in just three years. Both current drafts of the stablecoin bills explicitly identify Treasury securities with maturities of 93 days or less as one of the few acceptable reserves. That could mean an extra $1 trillion in demand for T-bills in the near term, according to an April 30 presentation by the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC), a group of senior bankers, asset managers and hedge fund representatives that advises Treasury officials each quarter. Citi’s research team goes further, suggesting that by 2030 stablecoin issuers could surpass any single foreign country as holders of U.S. government debt. Despite its controversial history, Tether, with $120 billion invested in U.S. Treasurys already, could become the largest holder if it falls into compliance with new regulations. Citi This market upheaval could unfold as the U.S. national debt climbs past $36 trillion, swelling by another trillion roughly every 176 days. Meanwhile, creditors like China and Saudi Arabia are quietly trimming their Treasury holdings. China’s dropped to $761 billion earlier this year, its lowest since 2009, while Saudi Arabia’s have fallen to a year-and-a-half low of $126 billion, reflecting a global rebalancing of reserves and rising skepticism about U.S. sovereign debt. Enter crypto users around the world, in places like Buenos Aires and Nairobi, using stablecoins for everything from paying their rent to hedging against local currency volatility and simultaneously stepping up as a new, eager class of lenders to Uncle Sam. The Trump administration has already made its stance on stablecoins clear. Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks has argued that they could help secure the dollar’s global dominance, and President Trump has pressed Congress to get a bill to his desk before the August recess. “Stablecoins have the potential to ensure American dollar dominance internationally to increase the usage of the U.S. dollar digitally as the world’s reserve currency, and in the process create potentially trillions of dollars of demand for U.S. Treasuries, which could lower long-term interest rates,” said Sacks during his first press conference in February. Additionally, the Trump family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, announced plans for its own stablecoin, which is now apparently complicating the fate of pending regulation. On May 1, World Liberty announced that the token would be used by MGX, an Abu Dhabi government-backed firm, to invest $2 billion into Binance, the crypto exchange whose founder is reportedly seeking a presidential pardon. A couple of days later, nine Senate Democrats, including four who previously backed the stablecoin “GENIUS” bill, issued a statement saying they would oppose the legislation in its current form, Politico reported. But lawmakers had been promoting the idea of stablecoin issuers as ultimate Treasurys buyers even before Trump took office. Congressman Ritchie Torres of New York wrote last fall that more stablecoin adoption means higher demand for Treasurys and, in turn, lower U.S. borrowing costs. Earlier, former House Speaker Paul Ryan floated stablecoins as a buffer against a future wave of foreign selling: if traditional buyers retreat, dollar-backed token issuers could fill the gap. Christopher Perkins, president of crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund, puts it bluntly: “You couldn’t invent a better innovation for the U.S. dollar than a stablecoin. It makes the dollar more available globally. It reinforces it as the global reserve currency. If it gets into the wrong hands, there's due process by which the government can freeze and seize assets. It checks so many boxes: creates buyers for your debt, brings your interest rates lower.” Yesha Yadav, a professor at Vanderbilt University whose research focuses on the Treasury market, is decidedly less enthusiastic about a crypto takeover of the government securities market. She believes that embedding stablecoins into it creates new vulnerabilities. “If the U.S. Treasury market becomes, for whatever reason, stressed, if there are doubts about the U.S.’s ability to make good on its payments, then for stablecoin issuers, it's no longer a safe asset that can substitute as a money claim,” she explains. And if a major stablecoin issuer collapses, it could be forced to dump Treasurys en masse, destabilizing the market. Unlike foreign central banks, stablecoin issuers face genuine run risk: panicked customers can pull funds instantly, triggering immediate selling pressure. Of course, this risk applies to money market funds as well. In 2008, after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the $65 billion Reserve Primary Fund, which held less than 2% of Lehman’s commercial paper, experienced a run and “broke the buck”, forcing it to liquidate its assets. “For the first time, the Treasury market is supporting the moneyness of a payment system by becoming a backstop of an entirely new monetary claim,” Yadav notes. If a crisis hits, will the government have to bail out stablecoin issuers to honor the dollar claims they’ve issued? Policymakers haven’t fully grappled with these questions, and they should, she says. Arthur Wilmarth, a law professor at the George Washington University, raises another concern: “The creation of major new demands for Treasury bills and Treasury-backed repos and reverse repos by stablecoin issuers could cause dangerous shortages of available Treasury bills, particularly during periods of financial stress.” He points to past disruptions like the repo market crisis of September 2019 and the “dash for cash” in March 2020 as cautionary tales. For now, another trillion dollars in Treasury demand from stablecoin issuers might seem manageable. But the landscape is shifting fast. Major financial institutions like Bank of America and Fidelity, which manage trillions in assets, are eyeing stablecoin launches. Visa and Stripe-acquired Bridge just rolled out stablecoin-linked cards across Latin America, and Mastercard unveiled a new platform through which users will be able to pay for purchases with stablecoins and withdraw them directly into their bank accounts. Still, Yadav cautions anyone thinking that stablecoins will become a reliable backstop for the U.S. dollar or the Treasury market: “The presumption that stablecoin issuers will simply fill the gap, is not something that policymakers should be counting on,” she warns. And there’s another potential risk: will banks and other stablecoin issuers limit their reserves to Treasurys? Kevin Lehtiniitty, CEO of Borderless.xyz, believes bank-issued stablecoins could become subject to the fractional reserve rules that banks have long used to turn their FDIC-insured deposits into more lucrative growth areas. Perhaps, commercial real estate, subprime mortgages, DeFi? Stay tuned.

Title: Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp22d2kexo
Time Published: 2025-05-06T08:00:05Z

The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at £2.9bn and will create a company with operations in more than 40 countries. While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years. Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens. Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items – like nappies, flowers and pet food. Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time – Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange. But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much. This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value – its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets. Let's look at another measure – the price of each share. An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%. An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%. What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival – just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets. This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing. There are many reasons. Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half. How can there be such a huge disparity? Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies – the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings – still a massive premium to the UK. One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand. UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled. Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds. But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets – and they have been dead right. In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%. But there are changes afoot. The government's so-called "Edinburgh Reforms", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others. There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan. They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year. The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market. Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had "no immediate" plans to move, he and his company "got a very warm welcome" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it. What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals. Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here. Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate. Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract. The deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US rival. Oury Amadou Diallo, 22, did not have licence for modified bike classed as motorcycle, court hears. David Nicholson rents a school kitchen out of hours and cooks meals that are sold on Deliveroo app. Councillors say action is needed from companies to avoid the safety risks being posed to shoppers.

The expansion brings Spark’s total value locked (TVL) to $2.4 billion, making it the leading on-chain allocator, per DeFiLlama data. The allocation follows the conclusion of Spark’s "Tokenization Grand Prix," a months-long initiative that awarded capital to three RWA protocols: BlackRock/Securitize’s BUIDL, Superstate’s USTB, and Centrifuge-Anemoy’s JTRSY. “The expanded capital base comes at a time of growing institutional and retail momentum in onchain finance, particularly across Asia Pacific and emerging markets,” the platform shared in a statement with Decrypt. The initial $1 billion allocation, finalized following a Sky governance vote on April 3, deployed $500 million to BUIDL, $300 million to USTB, and $200 million to JTRSY. Spark’s Liquidity Layer automates liquidity provision for USDC, among other stablecoins, directly from Sky across various networks and protocols. The new funds are being distributed to the same recipients as Spark’s original $1 billion Tokenization Grand Prix. The latest allocation offers a clearer picture of how tokenized RWAs, primarily short-term U.S. Treasuries, are being actively adopted as primary reserves by major DeFi protocols seeking to stabilize yields and reduce exposure to crypto-native volatility. The Tokenization Grand Prix, launched in July 2024, was an open call for asset issuers to propose RWA products for Spark’s stablecoin-backed treasury. Thirty-nine applications were reviewed by Steakhouse Financial, a firm embedded in the Spark ecosystem with experience underwriting RWA protocols. Evaluations focused on liquidity, pricing transparency, and alignment with Spark’s goal of integrating low-volatility, yield-generating assets into DeFi. The assets were onboarded via the Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL), which holds stablecoins including USDC, USDS, sUSDS, USDe, and sUSDe. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund holds approximately $2.81 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, making it the largest among the three. Superstate’s USTB follows with $490.7 million, while Centrifuge’s JTRSY stands at $237.1 million, according to DeFiLlama data. All three funds are backed by short-duration government debt and structured to reinvest as securities mature. Spark’s role within Sky, a rebranded MakerDAO, has grown since the governance overhaul was announced in August 2024. Now operating as a standalone “Star” (Sky’s designation for modular sub-protocols), Spark has reported around $40 million in revenue in Q1 2025 and launched a USDC Savings Vault, which has attracted more than $41 million in deposits, according to the protocol. The protocol also expanded to Arbitrum and Base earlier this year. While many DeFi protocols have explored exposure to sovereign debt, Spark’s combined $2.4 billion deployment places it ahead of peers. RWA.xyz data shows that total tokenized U.S. Treasury assets across protocols now exceed $3.5 billion, meaning Spark alone accounts for more than two-thirds of the current market.

Title: Conservative Leader Friedrich Merz Set To Become Germany's Chancellor
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/conservative-leader-friedrich-merz-set-to-become-germanys-chancellor-8341776
Time Published: 2025-05-06T06:08:39Z
Full Content:
Conservative Friedrich Merz is set to be sworn in on Tuesday as Germany's new chancellor at a critical juncture as the economy battles its longest post-war downturn, relations with top security ally the United States fray and the far-right surges. Lawmakers are widely expected to back Merz as chancellor in a vote in the lower house of parliament after his CDU/CSU conservatives, who won February's federal election, secured a coalition deal with the centre-left Social Democrats. The pressure is on for Merz to show leadership after the implosion last November of outgoing SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-way coalition left a political vacuum at the heart of Europe, even as it faced a myriad of crises. "People have been asking Germany to lead for a long time, and there is no more space to not heed that call," said Sudha David-Wilp of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. "Everything that had been undergirding post-war Germany in the past eight decades is no longer the case, whether it be open markets and free trade, whether it be the U.S. security presence in Europe." A global trade war sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping import tariffs is threatening a third year of downturn in Europe's largest economy, which has already had to grapple with the end of cheap Russian gas since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and growing rivalry from China. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened not to come to the aid of fellow members of the NATO defence alliance, prompting even transatlanticist Merz to question the reliability of the United States and urge Europe to improve its ability to defend itself. The German coalition deal has mapped out plans to revive growth such as reducing a corporate tax and lowering energy prices. It also vows strong support for Ukraine and higher military spending. While Merz is a veteran politician who started his career as a European lawmaker in the 1980s, he still has to prove his chops in power as he has never held a government office. After losing a power struggle to arch party rival Angela Merkel in 2002, he spent over a decade working in the private sector before finding his way back into top level politics. A wealthy, Catholic west German lawyer and hobby pilot who served for four years as chairman of the German arm of fund manager BlackRock, Merz is widely considered the antithesis in both style and policy to the woman who led Germany for 16 years. Where Merkel was an even-tempered pragmatist who shifted the conservatives more towards the centre, Merz is a provocative economic liberal who has pulled the bloc back to the right. Merz's supporters highlight the fact he secured a historic fiscal package to boost spending on infrastructure and defence even before taking office. Critics say it was only necessary because of his erratic decision to push an anti-migration motion through parliament with the backing of the Alternative for Germany, breaking a taboo on cooperation with the far-right. That decision boosted support for both the AfD and the far-left Left party, who together secured enough support to be able to block a loosening of Germany's fiscal rules in the next parliament. "Merz remains a black box," said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING. "The U-turn on fiscal policies, as much needed as it was, still begs the question why Merz ruled it out during the elections, and does he really have a longer-term vision on the economy?" With the AfD topping some recent polls, the new government's main challenge is clearly to restore confidence and trust in Germany's political centre, said Brzeski. "If this government fails, the AfD will get more support in the next elections and could become part of any next government," he said. Merz's designated cabinet reflects a belief in the need for expertise over political capital and a desire for renewal given the declining trust in the establishment, say analysts. Only one minister from the previous government will retain his position: Defence Minister Boris Pistorius. The rest of the cabinet are new appointees, many of them like the economy minister with private sector experience in the area they will now be governing.

Title: ‘It’s a stunning setting for any cafe, but this one has extra-special credentials’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/health/your-wellness/2025/05/06/its-a-stunning-setting-for-any-cafe-but-this-one-has-extra-special-credentials/

There is a palpable sense of purpose and job satisfaction among the young adults with Down syndrome who work in the Happy Out cafe in Dún Laoghaire. We are chatting on the outdoor terrace of the cafe in the refurbished Dún Laoghaire Baths building overlooking the harbour. It’s a stunning setting for any cafe, but this one has extra-special credentials because it may be the first commercial cafe in Ireland to employ adults with Down syndrome in partnership with a social enterprise. “I don’t have anyone in my family with Down syndrome, but this opportunity fell into my lap and I thought it would be very nice to do,” says Brian Hanratty, who owns Happy Out cafes on Bull Island and in Donnybrook as well as Dún Laoghaire. Hanratty first came in contact with the Together Academy social enterprise – which trains and finds work for adults with Down syndrome – at its base in the Wanderers Football Club a few years ago. “I helped them set up their coffee shop in the bar at Wanderers and trained them how to make coffee,” Hanratty explains. The Together Academy was cofounded by Therese Coveney, whose 14-year-old daughter April gave her the impetus to set up the social enterprise. “I can feel change in the Dún Laoghaire/Blackrock area since the Happy Out cafe opened [in July 2023]. Most adults with Down syndrome rely on day services when they turn 21, but we wanted robust, industry-recognised training and a job to change the statistic that only 10 per cent of adults with Down syndrome work,” says Coveney. “After Covid, most of us understood what it was like to have meaningless, aimless days with no purpose. We are giving these young adults opportunities to be more independent, to be a valuable part of their community and to be paid employees.” Currently, there are 14 adults with Down syndrome on the roster at Happy Out in Dún Laoghaire. Each person does a three-hour shift – partly because they can’t work more than about 10 hours a week while keeping their disability allowance, but also because three hours is long enough for most of the employees. [ Down syndrome and employment: ‘It shouldn’t be amazing anymore, it should just be the norm’Opens in new window ] “In the beginning we found it hard to get enough guys to work with us but not now. They do everything from serving on the till, making and serving coffee and dealing with orders,” says Hanratty. The cafe has a card-only payment system which reduces potential for errors. Hanratty says the younger generation of customers love seeing adults with Down syndrome working in the cafe, but it has taken some older people a bit of time to get their heads around it. “Some ‘old school’ people don’t expect things to be done right and they will look to another staff member to make sure it’s really happening. But when they see that the staff member with Down syndrome has done the job well, they are very positive,” says Hanratty. The staff working regular eight-hour shifts also have to be a bit more flexible. “When we hire staff, we have to make sure that they know what they are taking on and be willing to help out in certain scenarios, and be more patient at times. They need to know that it’s different to a regular cafe.” Hanratty says the key to everything is to serve good coffee. “If the coffee isn’t good, people will come once and won’t come back, even if they think it’s a nice idea.” Ciara Donohoe from Newtownmountkennedy in Co Wicklow works on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays at Happy Out. “It’s really good and not too hard. It’s very challenging making the drinks and I’m still learning how to be a barista,” she says. [ Down syndrome: ‘Sarah regards herself as a businesswoman... she’s certainly breaking the stereotype’Opens in new window ] Charlie O’Reilly from Sandycove works on Mondays and Fridays: “I love chatting with customers and colleagues when I’m working at Happy Out. It’s a really good business.” Kim Williams from Shankill has a reputation for being good at latte art. “I also do the tills and take orders,” she says, admitting that walking through the cafe when it’s really busy can be a bit difficult. Cafe manager Matthew Roche says some of the staff with Down syndrome can get a bit flustered and emotional if it’s very busy. “We just take some time out in the foyer or outside if this happens – especially on busy days or at the weekends,” he explains. Building up people’s confidence to work front and centre in a public space has taken time, says Coveney. “When we first started training people, there was a lot of heads down, withdrawn people with their headphones on, but they have grown and flourished,” she says. “Working in a cafe won’t suit everyone, but there was something there waiting to be nurtured and educated. “It is about having higher expectations of these young adults but it would be naive to let them fly on their own. They need the supports around them.” Paula Doherty is the Pathways to Employment lead with the Together Academy. Her job involves finding work placements and paid employment for students who have completed the two-year culinary and hospitality programme that Together Academy runs at the Wanderers Football Club. [ Man with Down syndrome who wants to live independently brings council to court over housing assessmentOpens in new window ] “It’s about matching the person with the job and carving out a role for them. This can involve two or three tasks over two mornings a week from, say, 10am-1pm,” she says. “Some businesses are nervous about taking someone on, but once they meet with us and see the supports they get, it eases their minds.” The Together Academy provides backup support for the workers, meeting them before and after their job, and checking in every four to six weeks with three-, six- and 12-monthly reviews. They also do inclusive training with staff and set up a buddy system in the workplace so the person with Down syndrome has one key worker to turn to if they have any concerns. This summer the Together Academy will open a second, larger training centre in SMBC Aviation Capital on Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin. “This will be about providing more programmes for young adults with Down syndrome. It’s about elevating people’s expectations whilst giving people a lot of support,” says Coveney. She adds that all of the staff at Happy Out still live with their families and it has taken a lot of forbearance on their parts. “Many travel to work independently on public transport. We know that we are still working with vulnerable young adults. We take our role very responsibly.” Sylvia Thompson, a contributor to The Irish Times, writes about health, heritage and the environment © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Ather Energy IPO Post-listing Gaurav Garg, Lemonn Markets Desk Ather Energy made a muted debut on the stock market, opening with a modest 2% gain before slipping 8% intraday to close at approximately ₹303—below its lower issue price of ₹304. The IPO saw a lukewarm response, with the retail portion subscribed just 1.89 times and the HNI segment at a mere 0.69 times. The stock’s weak listing and subsequent dip reflect cautious investor sentiment around its steep valuation. However, continued downward pressure could help realign its valuation, potentially making it more attractive to value-conscious investors. The Indian rupee slipped on Tuesday, tracking mild losses in regional peers and dollar demand from foreign banks, though broader weakness in the greenback limited the decline.

Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) had permitted general insurers to issue surety insurance bonds in April 2022. The bonds are legally enforceable tripartite contracts that seeks to provide hedge against risk involved with infrastructure projects. In the last decade, India has initiated 9,242 PPP infrastructure projects amounting to massive Rs. 68.13 lakh crore.

But he never cottoned to Bitcoin, although his stance about the technology behind digital assets softened over time. The 94-year-old Buffett, who made his surprise announcement at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting, maintained that Bitcoin would never endure as a unit of value, and once famously called Bitcoin “rat poison squared” in a May 2018 interview with CNBC’s "Squawk Box." He remained skeptical of its usefulness, even after meeting with some of the industry’s most powerful advocates. In a 2018 interview with CNBC earlier in the year, Buffett had said that “cryptocurrencies, generally... with almost certainty… will come to a bad ending." “When it happens or how or anything else, I don’t know,” he added in an interview from Omaha, Nebraska. “If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I’d be glad to do it, but I would never short a dime’s worth.” “We don’t own any, we’re not short on any, we’ll never have a position in them,” he added. “I get into enough trouble with things I think I know something about,” he added. “Why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don’t know anything about?” As recently as 2023, even as the price of the asset had surged to new highs in the years prior, Buffett called Bitcoin a "gambling token." He said that people investing in it were chasing easy money, and that investors wanted to "play the roulette wheel" by putting funds into it. To be sure, Buffett was a reluctant tech investor, whose portfolio weighted more to companies in manufacturing and other traditional industries. He began buying shares in Apple only in 2016, although the personal device manufacturer later became the largest part of his holdings. Buffett’s rhetoric about the technology behind Bitcoin changed over the years, too. In a 2019 CNBC interview he said “blockchain was important,” although he called Bitcoin “a delusion" in the same discussion. His remarks echoed the opinions of financial services titans, including JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who praised blockchain technology but slammed Bitcoin. Those firms have subsequently debuted multiple crypto-focused initiatives over the years and shown an increasing willingness to embrace digital assets as a long-term fixture. (Fink is now a fan of Bitcoin; Dimon not so much.) Buffett reiterated his own more nuanced Bitcoin-Blockchain stance during a fancy dinner with Tron founder and crypto mogul Justin Sun, saying that while Bitcoin was just value changing hands and “no different from a seashell,” crypto companies were here to stay. “Bitcoin cannot capture the value of blockchain,” he said at the much-publicized 2020 dinner date. “Just because something has value doesn’t make it a good investment,” Buffett added. Buffett made a living off seeing a company’s value before everyone else, buying up its shares and being patient. But his distaste for the so-called digital gold was perhaps understandable: Buffett also famously avoided commodities like gold and oil.

The problems in question are wide-ranging, from medicine and cybersecurity to materials science and chemistry. But first, there are very practical problems to be solved, such as developing chips that can reliably host large numbers of qubits — short for quantum bits, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing. As usual in a high-stakes tech race with an uncertain time horizon, tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are at the forefront. Yet startups are also set to play an important role, especially tackling bottlenecks like connectivity and error correction that are critical for scaling quantum systems. But some startups and smaller tech companies are taking on the chip challenge head-on and deserve mention alongside the more attention-grabbing efforts from industry giants. While Big Tech projects typically boast the highest qubit counts, rethinking designs from first principles and using different approaches could yield equally promising results. Here are some of the companies behind the main quantum chip projects that are worth tracking. Akhetonics is a German photonics startup working on an all-optical, general-purpose chip — a contrarian bet in a field where most focus on narrower applications. This bold version and its first-principles approach helped the company raise a €6 million seed funding round led by Matterwave Ventures in November 2024. Alice & Bob is a French startup that raised a $104 million Series B round of funding in January 2025 to continue working toward building a “fault tolerant” quantum computer. Unlike companies focusing only on chips, Alice & Bob is developing a full quantum computing system. To do so, it relies on cat qubits, a type of superconducting qubit designed to reduce errors and simplify error correction. Amazon officially joined the quantum chip race in early 2025 when AWS introduced Ocelot, developed in partnership with the California Institute of Technology. While this is the company’s first quantum chip, AWS had previously launched Braket, a quantum computing service, in partnership with D-Wave, IonQ, Rigetti, and others. Atom Computing is a U.S. company building quantum computers with arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms. At the Microsoft Ignite 2024 conference, Microsoft and Atom Computing announced plans to launch a commercial quantum computer in 2025. D-Wave is a quantum computing company whose latest flagship system, the Advantage2 prototype, relies on a process called quantum annealing, which uses quantum physics to find the most stable, lowest-energy arrangements of elements to figure out the best mix for a given problem. Founded in 1999 as a spinoff from the University of British Columbia in Canada, D-Wave is now a public company listed on the NYSE. Illinois-based EeroQ is a startup betting on helium for its quantum chip design. Having raised a $7.25 million seed funding round in 2022 and received regional public support, the company made a $1.1 million commitment in September 2024 toward expanding its HQ in Chicago’s Humboldt Park. In April 2025, Fujitsu and Japanese research institution RIKEN announced having developed a 256-qubit superconducting quantum computer at the RIKEN RQC-FUJITSU Collaboration Center, up from a 64-qubit iteration in 2023. In December 2024, Google announced Willow, its latest quantum computing chip. Google didn’t stop at saying Willow was better than its predecessor, Sycamore, or at describing it as “a major breakthrough in quantum error correction.” In a statement that made headlines, Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven wrote that Willow’s performance lent “credence to the notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes.” IBM’s quantum efforts include Condor, its milestone superconducting chip for scaling up to 1,121 qubits, and Heron, a 156-qubit processor focused on improved performance and lower error rates. Founded in 2007, Infleqtion (formerly ColdQuanta) is a US-based company developing quantum computers based on neutral atom technology. Intel is developing quantum computers based on silicon spin qubits. In June 2023, it unveiled Tunnel Falls, a 12-qubit research chip, and said a next-generation quantum chip based on Tunnel Falls was expected to be released in 2024, but this hasn’t happened. IonQ is a publicly listed U.S. company developing trapped-ion quantum computers, including the IonQ Forte. After going public via a SPAC in late 2021, it acquired Canadian networking specialist Entangled Networks. IQM is a Finnish startup building superconducting quantum computers and is a spinout of the Aalto University and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. It received funding in its early days from the Business Finland government agency, followed by additional support from the EIC Accelerator program. In 2022, IQM raised €128 million in Series A2 funding led by World Fund, adding to the €39 million led by MIG Fonds it had raised in 2020 as part of what was then its Series A. This second tranche included part of a previously announced €35 million venture loan from the European Investment Bank, as well as participation from the EIC Fund and others. In February 2025, Microsoft introduced Majorana, a quantum chip using a topological core architecture. Microsoft previously declared that it expected to build a quantum supercomputer within 10 years. As its name suggests, Oxford Ionics is a British startup that spun out of Oxford University and focuses on trapped-ion quantum computing. It raised a £30 million Series A (approximately $36 million) in early 2023, followed by an additional £2 million (approximately €2.32 million) from the UK’s National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) that same year. More recently, it was selected for DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) alongside Quantinuum. Pasqal is a French startup taking a full-stack approach to quantum computing and betting on neutral atoms. The company emerged out of the Institut d’Optique in 2019, and its co-founders include 2022 Nobel Prize laureate for physics and professor Alain Aspect. In February 2023, Pascal raised a €100 million Series B funding round led by Singapore’s Temasek, with participation from existing investors Quantonation, the Defense Innovation Fund, Daphni, and Eni Next, as well as new investors European Innovation Council (EIC) Fund, Wa’ed Ventures, and Bpifrance (through its Large Venture Fund). PsiQuantum is a quantum computing startup using photonics technology and aiming to build “a 1 million-quantum-bit machine.” In February 2025, it announced Omega, a quantum photonic chipset manufactured at GlobalFoundries in New York. In 2021, PsiQuantum landed a $450 million Series D investment led by BlackRock, which is now said to be leading a potential $750 million round into the company at a $6 billion pre-money valuation. Founded by Australian academics, it is also backed by the Australian and Queensland governments. Qilimanjaro is a Spanish startup focusing on analog quantum app-specific integrated circuits (QASICs) and taking a full-stack approach, including hardware, software, and applications. Based in Barcelona, it won the Four Years From Now startup competition at Mobile World Congress in 2024, going on to receive €1.5 million in funding from Catalonia later that year. Quandela is a French startup founded in 2017 to develop photonic quantum computers. In November 2023, Quandela raised a €50 million Series B and received support from the French government through the France 2030 Plan. Quantinuum is a quantum computing company formed in 2021 by the merger of Cambridge Quantum and Honeywell Quantum Solutions. Its flagship product is the H-Series of trapped-ion quantum computers. In April 2024, together with Microsoft, it announced a breakthrough in error correction. QuantWare is a Dutch startup that came up with a proprietary 3D chip architecture, VIO, which focuses on scaling bottlenecks in quantum processing units (QPUs). It started accepting preorders for Contralto-A, its first QPU for quantum error correction, in February 2025. Founded in 2020, it is a spinout of TU Delft and its affiliated research institute, QuTech. In March 2025, and following a €6 million seed round in 2023, it announced having raised a €20 million Series A (approximately $19.27 million) — including €5 million in equity out of the €7.5 million it previously secured from the European Innovation Council (the remainder is a grant). Boston-based QuEra is betting on neutral atoms as the “best approach to achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.” Its products include Aquila, a 256-qubit analog neutral-atom quantum computer launched in 2022 and accessible via Amazon Braket. QuEra is notably backed by Google, which led the $230 debt round that the quantum startup raised in February 2025 — with a convertible note also backed by SoftBank, Valor, and existing investors. Founded in 2013 by Chad Rigetti, Rigetti Computing is a quantum company focusing on superconducting technology. Its range of products include Ankaa-3 and the uppcoming 336-qubit Lyra system. Just like rivals D-Wave and IonQ, Rigetti Computing is a listed company; it raised just under $200 million in VC capital before going public via a SPAC in 2021. In February 2025, it signed a strategic partnership with Taiwan-based Quanta Computer, which is set to invest $35 million and purchase shares of Rigetti, while both companies invest more than $100 million each over the next five years to accelerate the development and commercialization of superconducting quantum computing. U.S. quantum startup SEEQC — an acronym for “scalable, energy efficient quantum computing” — is a spinout of chip company Hypres, which was itself established by former employees of IBM’s superconducting electronics division. In 2023, SEEQC announced a partnership with Nvidia to build an “all-digital, ultra-low-latency chip-to-chip link between quantum computers and GPUs.” In January 2025, SEEQC raised a $30 million round of funding co-led by Booz Allen Ventures and Japanese-European VC firm NordicNinja. Other backers include Merck’s corporate venture capital arm, M Ventures. SEEQC is leading the U.K.-supported QuPharma project to explore how quantum computing can accelerate drug discovery, in partnership with BASF and Merck. SpinQ is a Chinese startup founded in 2018 that develops quantum computers. It claims that some of them are portable and making use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Xanadu is a Canadian startup aiming to build quantum computers through a photonic approach. In January 2025, it introduced Aurora, a 12-qubit system, including 35 photonic chips. Founded in 2016, Xanadu raised some $275 million to date, including a $100 million Series C in November 2022 at a $1 billion valuation.

Title: Germany's chancellor-in-waiting: Who is Friedrich Merz?
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-chancellor-in-waiting-who-is-friedrich-merz/a-72314352
Time Published: 2025-05-05T19:15:00Z

He has never held a top position in government, yet he has become Germany's tenth chancellor. DW takes a look at the life of Friedrich Merz. Friedrich Merz has made it to the chancellery after a bumpy start. He needed an unprecedented second vote to secure the necessary majority in the Bundestag in what was a historic debacle in German politics. Now Merz's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) the regional Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) will be working together as Germany's new government. For Merz, it is a big step in an unusual career. Merz, who is 69 years old, has never held a top governmental office with significant leadership responsibilities. He has never been a federal minister, or a state premier, or even mayor of a small town. He is the oldest chancellor to take office since Konrad Adenauer, the first post-war German head of government (1949–1963). The previous weeks were also the first time he had ever taken part in negotiations aimed at forming a government coalition. The media, as well as some unnamed representatives from the negotiation teams, have at times held this against him. The SPD leaders, Lars Klingbeil and Saskia Esken, and the head of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), Markus Söder, all have experience in this particular kind of wrangling. But as the would-be head of government, Merz hopes to lead a coalition between the CDU and these parties, and mediate between their interests. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video According to the German business magazine Wirtschaftswoche, Merz is a "trans-atlanticist, friend of Europe, and reformer." This, it wrote, could mean he was "exactly the right person for the current times." From 1989 to 1994, Merz was a member of the European Parliament. This was followed by 15 years in the Bundestag, between 1994 and 2009, during which he rose to become head of the CDU's parliamentary group, only to lose out to Angela Merkel in a struggle for the party leadership. Over these years, he took a particular interest in Germany's relationship with the United States. A commercial lawyer, Merz hails from Sauerland, an area of North Rhine-Westphalia, east of the Ruhr, where he still lives. It's predominantly a middle-class, rural region, popular with tourists, that tends to espouse conservative, Catholic values. Merz was clearly more traditionally conservative than his East German rival, the quantum chemist Angela Merkel. Early in his career, he was a close confidant of the now-deceased veteran CDU politician Wolfgang Schäuble, who was a member of the German parliament for more than 50 years. Merz chose not to stand for parliament again in 2009, and went on to pursue a career in business. From 2016 to 2020, he was chairman of the supervisory board of the German arm of BlackRock, currently the world's largest asset management company, and during this time he was often in the United States on business. It wasn't until 2021 that Merz ran again for the Bundestag, and was elected. In fleshing out his plans for government, he has been more outspoken than his taciturn predecessorOlaf Scholz, Merz frequently makes a point of mentioning that, for several months now, he has been in regular contact with European heads of government: dinner with France's President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace, bilateral talks in Berlin or Brussels. He also intends to travel to the US before the summer recess to meet Republican President Donald Trump. In a particularly striking example, Merz gave an hour-long TV interview to the German political talk show Caren Miosga eight days before the Easter weekend, in which he spoke about continuing military aid to Ukraine, going significantly beyond the "red line" repeatedly drawn by Chancellor Scholz. Merz raised the prospect of Germany delivering Taurus cruise missiles to Kyiv. These long-range, high-impact weapons would be of great assistance to Ukraine, and could seriously pressure Russia. He added that the UK, France, and US had already been supplying cruise missiles, and if the weapons supply was coordinated with its allies, "Germany should also participate." He commented that the Ukrainian army "has to get out of the defensive position — all it does is react." It needed to "be able to exert some control over what's happening." Merz even explicitly mentioned the possibility of Ukraine destroying the Crimean Bridge, a key strategic link between Russia and the unilaterally annexed Crimean peninsula. With this rhetoric and level of detail, Merz has positioned himself in direct opposition to Scholz, who consistently opposed Taurus deliveries and warned against any further escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Continued support for Ukraine is only one element of the broader political upheaval in Germany that has resulted from the policies of the new US administration — an upheaval that at times has caused Merz's standing and credibility to plummet. For months, both in the Bundestag and on the campaign trail, Merz and other conservative politicians emphasized the importance of adhering to Germany's debt brake, and called for fiscal discipline. This abruptly changed with the start of the exploratory talks between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. By mid-March, both of Germany's legislative chambers had approved a historically unprecedented decision: From now on, there will be no cap on defense spending. A package worth €500 billion ($570 billion) is also being introduced, aimed at improving Germany's crumbling infrastructure. This entails easing the debt brake to which, during the election campaign, the CDU and CSU had initially promised to adhere. Meanwhile, Merz — and all the mainstream parties — have the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) pressuring them from behind. Observers say the AfD's gains in the most recent election have prompted the future coalition partners to include stricter immigration policies and a greater focus on internal security in the coalition agreement. Just days before the federal election, Merz sparked controversy and confusion, both at home and abroad, by effectively weakening the "firewall" that he, along with all the other mainstream parties, had pledged to maintain against the AfD. Merz accepted the AfD's backing in several parliamentary votes on migration policy, in a bid to help the CDU/CSU and pro-business Free Deomcratic Party (FDP) defeat the remaining red-green votes, which by then no longer held a majority. This move triggered a wave of outrage among politicians and in German civil society. Now, Merz says he wants to boost the confidence of the German people. "We are a great country of more than 80 million people, who live and work here and take care of their families," he said. He wants to show "that the effort is worth it."

BlackRock expanded its exposure to Bitcoin-linked assets in the first quarter of 2025, pushing its total investments to more than $5.4 billion, according to data from Timechainindex. Between the last quarter of 2024 and March 2025, BlackRock added over 3.2 million shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to its portfolio. This move brought its total IBIT holdings to around 5.85 million shares, valued at roughly $274 million. In an interesting shift, BlackRock also began investing in rival spot Bitcoin ETFs. It purchased nearly 71,000 shares of Fidelity’s FBTC and made smaller allocations to Grayscale’s GBTC and GBTC Mini products. This marks the firm’s first foray into rival ETFs, reflecting a broader strategy aimed at tapping into multiple channels of Bitcoin market exposure. Combined, these holdings are valued at more than $5 million. Altogether, BlackRock’s total position in spot Bitcoin ETFs has reached approximately $279 million. At the same time, the firm increased its exposure to companies with direct ties to Bitcoin. The asset management firm increased its stake in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) to over 14.4 million shares during the quarter. The firm also acquired more than 620,000 of MicroStrategy’s Series A preferred shares and nearly 15 million shares across two of the company’s commercial notes. These positions bring BlackRock’s total exposure to Strategy to over $4.23 billion. Meanwhile, BlackRock also deepened its positions in Bitcoin mining companies, pushing its investments in these cohorts to almost $1 billion, with investments in Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, TeraWulf, and others.

Title: Stablecoins Could Soon Replace China As Top U.S. Creditor

ByJon Helgi Egilsson ByJon Helgi Egilsson, Contributor. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent views stablecoins as a strategic tool to boost U.S. Treasury demand ... More and strengthen dollar dominance. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) A powerful U.S. Treasury advisory group sees stablecoins emerging as a major new source of demand for government debt. With the market projected to reach $2 trillion by 2028—nearly all of it dollar-denominated. At its meeting last week, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee —comprising senior executives from BlackRock, JPMorgan, and other major financial institutions reporting to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessen—highlighted the stablecoin market as a rapidly expanding force in creating new Treasury demand. The implication is clear: current regulatory proposals could channel more stablecoin reserves into U.S. Treasuries than China currently holds. While the committee stopped short of making direct comparisons, its analysis suggests that if projected growth materializes and legislation like the GENIUS Act is enacted, stablecoin demand could rival that of traditional sovereign creditors. The GENIUS Act, expected to pass in 2025, would regulate stablecoin issuers and link reserves ... More directly to short-term U.S. Treasuries. With the GENIUS Act expected this August, U.S. dollar stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle will be required to hold reserves—including Treasuries—positioning them as major institutional buyers. That demand could surpass the $784 billion currently held by China, reshaping how the U.S. finances its debt. This isn’t just regulatory housekeeping—it’s strategic fiscal architecture. “The ultimate design and adoption of stablecoins will drive the magnitude of impact they have on U.S. Treasury demand,” the TBAC wrote in its meeting minutes. By designating T-bills with maturities under 93 days as eligible reserves, the proposed rules would position stablecoin issuers as key players at the front end of the curve. The GENIUS Act goes further, allowing those Treasuries to be used as repo collateral—making them even more attractive as backing for stablecoins. Japan and China—the top two foreign holders of U.S. Treasuries—currently hold $1.13 trillion and $784 billion, respectively. Combined, that’s still less than the projected $2 trillion market cap of stablecoins by 2028. If that projection holds, U.S. dollar stablecoins could soon rival or surpass traditional sovereign creditors. This isn’t just crypto—it’s a structural shift in how America funds itself, trading geopolitical reliance for market-based infrastructure powered by code and regulation. Stablecoin issuers are already acting like institutional buyers of U.S. Treasuries. Over $120 billion in short-term Treasuries back stablecoins today, with another $90 billion in money market funds. Unlike banks, which operate on fractional reserves, stablecoin issuers—under proposed U.S. rules—would hold full reserves, making them a steady, transparent source of Treasury demand. This shift has high-level backing. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called stablecoins “a new channel of strategic demand,” saying they not only expand access to the dollar but also “support sustained demand for U.S. Treasury bills.” Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has backed the role of stablecoins in extending U.S. dollar access globally—especially in high-inflation countries and regions with limited banking. “U.S. dollar stablecoins could be particularly appealing to those in high-inflation countries or to those without easy or affordable access to dollar cash or banking services,” Waller said. “I believe that stablecoins have the potential to maintain and extend the role of the dollar internationally.” According to a report by the venture firm a16z, stablecoins are crypto’s first “killer app.” In 2024, stablecoins facilitated $15.6 trillion in transfers—roughly equivalent to Visa’s annual volume. In March alone, stablecoin transactions hit a record $1.82 trillion, the report stated. While much of this is financial flows rather than retail payments, it highlights their rapid adoption in global finance. As trade tensions and tariff wars strain U.S.–China ties, Washington looks to stablecoins to reduce ... More its reliance on foreign creditors. As China steadily pulls back—its U.S. Treasury holdings dropping from $1.32 trillion in 2013 to $784 billion—Washington faces a question: who fills the gap? The TBAC suggests stablecoins might. With legislation expected by August, the U.S. could soon have a framework that turns stablecoins from crypto fringe into fiscal foundation. McKinsey estimates global bank deposits at $117 trillion; if less than 8% of this flows into dollar-backed stablecoins, it would exceed all foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries. If current projections hold and regulation advances, the next major buyer of U.S. Treasuries may not be China or any foreign government—but a global network of dollar-backed stablecoins.
