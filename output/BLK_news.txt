Global Times By Global Times Published: Apr 27, 2025 08:32 PM China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) said on Sunday that it is paying close attention to CK Hutchison's planned sale of its overseas port assets and will conduct a review in accordance with the law, CCTV reported. The regulator emphasized that all parties involved in the transaction must not take any measures to circumvent the review process by any means or implement concentration activities without regulatory approval. Otherwise, legal responsibility will be pursued, CCTV reported. The SAMR's statement came in response to media inquiries following a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report on April 16. The WSJ reported that CK Hutchison plans to split its overseas port asset sale into two separate transactions, as a way to advance the deals. According to the WSJ, the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) is considering carving out two Panamanian ports from the $22.8 billion deal to purchase dozens of terminals from CK Hutchison, citing sources familiar with the matter. MSC has reportedly discussed advancing the majority of the acquisition, which involves 41 port terminals across five continents, while resolving disputes over the two Panamanian ports, the WSJ reported. The deal involves collaboration with US asset manager BlackRock and has been structured into two components with different ownership frameworks: one for the Panama ports and another for the remaining assets. Discussions on the two components are moving in parallel, and separating the Panama ports would ultimately require the parties to reach a new agreement, according to the WSJ. The WSJ further noted that the BlackRock-MSC consortium and Hutchison are currently within a 145-day exclusive negotiation period and have not yet signed final agreements. Prior to the report, a spokesperson from the second antitrust enforcement division of SAMR said on March 28 that it would review CK Hutchison's Panama Canal ports deal in accordance with the law to ensure fair market competition and protect public interests, according to a Q&A release conducted by Hong Kong Ta Kung Wen Wei Media and published on the regulator's official website. On March 31, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun responded to the SAMR's review of the planned port asset sale at a press briefing, stressing that China firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries' legitimate rights and interests.

GBTC is still "making more $$$ than all of the other ETFs combined..." Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, stated on X on Sunday. "And it's not even close." The fund generates approximately $268.5 million in annual revenue, with a 1.5% expense ratio applied to $17.9 billion in assets under management, according to Coinglass data. All the other U.S.-Bitcoin ETFs shown by Geraci generate an implied annual revenue of a little over $211.8 million from a total of $89 billion in assets under management. GBTC's revenue dominance persists despite losing more than half its holdings since spot Bitcoin ETFs went live in January 2024, revealing how fee structures have shaped the fund's economics, regardless of market share. Aside from its first-mover advantage and brand recognition, Grayscale's control over GBTC's management allows it to charge a 1.5% fee. For example, BlackRock's IBIT holds three times more assets, at $56 billion, compared to GBTC's $18 billion, but it generates only about $137 million in revenue with its 0.25% fee. In response, Grayscale launched its Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) in March 2025 primarily to offer a lower-cost alternative to GBTC’s fee, while also diversifying its product lineup amid intensifying competition. Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) pioneered regulated Bitcoin investment in 2013 as a private trust, before offering an ETF in January of last year, alongside several other ETF issuers. All this rolled into place after Grayscale won a landmark case against the then-Gensler-led SEC to convert its trust to an ETF. When a trust converts to an ETF, key aspects of its structure change. From a closed-end form, it becomes open-ended, allowing shares to be redeemed based on demand. Because their distribution and transaction costs are different and often lower, the expense ratios for ETFs have been "historically less than those for corresponding mutual funds," the SEC explains. As such, ETFs "can be more tax efficient" because ETF shares are generally redeemable "in-kind," the SEC notes. In April last year, Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein claimed that the fees "will come down" as the ETF market matures. The largest single-day outflow for GBTC was recorded on March 19, 2024, totaling $618 million, according to CoinGlass data. At this pace, it could run out of Bitcoin by July 8, though James Seyffart, ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, previously told Decrypt that its outflows would "slow from here."

Yo, what’s good, crypto fam? It’s your boy Eric Kim, droppin’ the hottest Bitcoin news straight from the X streets, April 28, 2025. Let’s cut through the noise and get to the real talk—Bitcoin’s makin’ moves, and the vibe is straight-up electric. Here’s the top scoop, served with that Kim swagger. 1. Bitcoin ETFs Are Eatin’ Good, Fam! Aight, check this: Bitcoin ETFs are out here flexin’ like nobody’s business. Word on X is that Ark 21Shares scooped up 1,360 BTC worth $116.1 milly on April 21, while ARK Invest dropped a cool $267 milly on Bitcoin. BlackRock? They ain’t slouchin’ either—$84 milly for their spot ETF. That’s big money movin’, y’all, and it’s got the market buzzin’. Posts from @Cointelegraph and @BitcoinMagazine are straight-up hyped, sayin’ this institutional cash is pushin’ Bitcoin toward new highs. With BTC sittin’ pretty at $94K, you know the bulls are runnin’ wild. Eric’s Take: Yo, this ain’t no retail FOMO—this is Wall Street suits stackin’ sats like it’s their day job. When the big dogs like BlackRock and ARK are goin’ all-in, you know Bitcoin’s about to pop off. Keep your eyes peeled, ‘cause this could send us to the moon, fr. 2. Senator McCormick’s Stackin’ BTC, No Cap Hold up, we got a US Senator in the game now! @unusual_whales and @BitcoinMagazine dropped the tea that Senator Dave McCormick copped up to $250K in Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF. A politician bettin’ on BTC? That’s wild, fam. X is lit with folks sayin’ this could mean friendlier crypto laws down the road. If the suits in DC are hodlin’, you know Bitcoin’s gettin’ that mainstream glow-up. Eric’s Take: A senator stackin’ sats is straight-up bullish. This ain’t just about one dude’s portfolio—it’s a signal that crypto’s creepin’ into the Capitol. If more politicians jump on the Bitcoin train, we might see some real policy moves. Big W for the crypto crew. 3. Price Predictions Got Us Dreamin’ of Lambos X is poppin’ with price predictions, and they’re lookin’ juicy. @Vivek4real_ is hypin’ Bitwise’s call that Bitcoin could hit $200K, especially if countries start scoopin’ it up. @AltcoinDailyio’s teasin’ a video with end-of-2025 price targets, and you know it’s gonna be wild. Then there’s Michael Saylor, the OG, droppin’ bars on @BitcoinMagazine, sayin’ BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF gonna be the biggest ETF in a decade. With BTC at $94K and that cup-and-handle pattern poppin’ off (@Bitcoinmeraklsi), the chart nerds are losin’ it. Eric’s Take: $200K? Bruh, I’m already picturin’ the Lambo. But for real, these predictions ain’t just hype—big players are backin’ it with cash. Saylor’s callin’ it like he sees it, and when institutions and charts align, you better strap in. We might be lookin’ at six figures real soon. 4. Whales and Institutions Runnin’ the Show Here’s the tea from @HHorsley: Bitcoin’s at $94K, but Google searches for it are mad low. What’s that mean? Retail ain’t drivin’ this pump—it’s the whales and institutions, baby. @whale_alert caught a fat 564 BTC ($53 milly) movin’ from Antpool to Binance, and @Bitcoinmeraklsi’s talkin’ big transfers too. X is sayin’ the big boys are buyin’ while the crowd’s still sleepin’. Eric’s Take: Yo, when the whales are feastin’ and retail’s snoozin’, that’s when you know the smart money’s movin’. These dudes are stackin’ like it’s a cheat code. If you ain’t payin’ attention, you’re missin’ the wave. Time to wake up and get in the game. 5. CZ Droppin’ Truth Bombs on the Ecosystem My man Changpeng Zhao (CZ) got X shook with some real talk. @erhanunall posted that CZ’s sayin’ this bull run is all about Bitcoin ‘cause of them ETFs, but the altcoin season’s gotta pop off for the whole crypto ecosystem to thrive. That’s got folks on X debatin’ whether BTC’s hoggin’ the spotlight or settin’ the stage for the alts. Eric’s Take: CZ’s spittin’ facts. Bitcoin’s the king, no doubt, but the alts need some love too. If we get that altcoin pump, the whole crypto space is gonna be eatin’. Keep an eye on them smaller coins, ‘cause they might be the next to moon. Why This Matters, Fam This ain’t just news—it’s the pulse of the crypto game right now. Bitcoin’s flexin’ with ETF money, political clout, and whale moves, all while the X community’s hypin’ it to the stars. The sentiment? Bullish AF. But don’t get it twisted—@HHorsley’s point about low retail vibes means this is the calm before the storm. When the crowd catches up, it’s gonna be a whole vibe. Eric’s Final Word: Yo, Bitcoin’s out here makin’ power plays while the world’s still tryna catch up. Whether it’s senators, ETFs, or Saylor’s big bets, the game’s changin’. Stack them sats, stay humble, and don’t sleep on this wave. We in the future, fam—let’s ride it. Peace! Key Citations Note: This is written in the energetic, conversational style of Eric Kim, inspired by his YouTube vibe—hype, relatable, and a bit braggadocious, but always keepin’ it real with the crypto community.

Title: Google Declared An Illegal Monopoly For The Second Time In A Year, Digital Ad Network Under Fire

Google's ad services are an illegal monopoly, according to a ruling issued by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema. The decision, which was handed down April 17, is the second antitrust ruling against the company in the last year. In her opinion, the judge ruled that the company's ad business, which matches website publishers with advertisers and determines which banner ads appear on which sites across the web, has violated antitrust law. Don't Miss: "For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets," Brinkema wrote in her 115-page ruling. Continuing, "Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anti-competitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features." According to the Associated Press, the construction of the monopolizing ad system began back in 2008, when Google bought online ad specialist DoubleClick for $3.2 billion. At the time, U.S. regulators approved the purchase. Now, they've realized that move enabled the company to manipulate ad prices. The Justice Department argued that Google controls all three corners of the digital ad market— one side that allows website publishers to sell ad space on their websites, the other is the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of viewers, and the third is the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions that connect buyers and sellers. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Google has said it plans to appeal the ruling. "Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective," Lee-Anne Mulholand, the company's vice president of regulatory affairs, the media reports. According to the AP, the company's lawyers argued that the government is basing its case on antiquated concepts that were relevant a decade ago, but are no longer a good framework for understanding the highly competitive market for advertising that exists currently. The decision marks the Justice Department's second victory over the tech giant in a year. Last August, US District Judge Amit Mehta, ruled that Google held an illegal monopoly on search. In that ruling, the judge said that the company's exclusive contracts, which secured them the spot as the No. 1 search engine on smartphones and web browsers, violated the Sherman Antitrust Act. And back in 2023, a federal jury found the Google app store to be an illegal monopoly. The cases are expected to play out over the next several years as Google appeals the decisions.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun BEIJING, April 27 (Reuters) – China’s top market regulator said on Sunday it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison’s 0001.HK planned sale of most of its ports operations to a BlackRock-led consortium and parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review. The sale by the Hong Kong conglomerate, which contains two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, has become highly politicized amid intensifying U.S.-Sino trade tensions. “No concentration of undertakings shall be implemented without approval, otherwise legal liability will be incurred,” the State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement. The statement was in response to a Wall Street Journal article on April 16. The MSC shipping empire, which is part of the BlackRock consortium, has held discussions on moving ahead with the bulk of the deal while disputes over the two Panama ports are resolved, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The deal has two components with different ownership structures – one for the Panama ports and one for everything else, the report added. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to take back the Panama Canal and has hailed the deal as a “reclaiming” of the waterway. Chinese state media, however, have criticized the planned sale as a betrayal of China’s interests. Trump said on Saturday that American military and commercial ships should be allowed to travel through the Panama Canal and Suez Canal free of charge. Tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison announced last month it would sell its 80% holding in the ports business which encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries. The business has an enterprise value, which includes debt, of $22.8 billion. Singapore’s PSA International, which owns the other 20%, is also exploring a sale of its holding, sources have said. Overall the Hong Kong conglomerate has interests in 53 ports. Ports in Hong Kong and mainland China were not included in the deal.

Title: Defunding DEI: Here’s how the Trump administration has undone Biden’s very prized programs

Ohio State Sen. Jerry Cirino weighs in on Democratic opposition on the Buckeye State banning DEI practices at public colleges. President Donald Trump shut down all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices across the federal government during his first week in office and signed a number of executive orders to quickly undo former President Joe Biden’s efforts. The president, just hours after taking the Oath of Office on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, signed an executive order to eliminate all DEI programs from the federal government. He also quickly signed an order making it "the official policy of the U.S. government to only recognize two genders: male and female." WHITE HOUSE OPM ORDERS ALL DEI OFFICES TO BEGIN CLOSING BY END OF DAY WEDNESDAY A day later, the president directed the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to notify heads of agencies and departments to close all DEI offices and place those government workers in those offices on paid leave. President Donald Trump shut down all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices across the federal government during his first week in office. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) That move quickly forced those offices to take down all outward facing media — websites, social media accounts, and more — for those DEI offices, and required the withdrawal of any final pending documents, directives, orders, materials and equity plans. Trump also canceled current and impending contracts focused on DEI initiatives, with Elon Musk, who heads up the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), saying that move saved the federal government $420 million. The president also issued two other executive actions that day targeting DEI. One was an executive order to end discrimination in the workplace and higher education through race and sex-based preferences under the guise of DEI. The other was a memo to eliminate a Biden administration policy that prioritized DEI hiring at the Federal Aviation Administration. In the memo rolling back Biden's DEI hiring practices at the FAA, Trump ordered the secretary of transportation and FAA administrator to immediately stop Biden's DEI hiring programs and return to nondiscriminatory, merit-based hiring. TRUMP VOWS 'NEW ERA OF NATIONAL SUCCESS,' SAYS AMERICA'S 'DECLINE IS OVER' IN INAUGURAL ADDRESS Trump also required that the FAA administrator review the past performance and performance standards of all agency employees in critical safety positions and make it clear that anyone who fails to demonstrate adequate capability is replaced by someone who will ensure flight safety and efficiency. A sign marks the entrance to the FAA headquarters in Washington DC on October 7, 2024. (J. David Ake/Getty Images) "Illegal and discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) hiring, including on the basis of race, sex, disability, or any other criteria other than the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence, competency, and qualification, harms all Americans, who deserve to fly with confidence," the memo read. The memo stated: "All so-called DEI initiatives, including all dangerous preferencing policies or practices, shall immediately be rescinded in favor of hiring, promoting, and otherwise treating employees on the basis of individual capability, competence, achievement, and dedication." Trump also rescinded Biden’s order on diversity initiatives, "Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government," which he signed on his first day in office in 2021. In February, the Department of Education also warned state education departments that they must remove DEI policies or risk losing federal funding. That move came after Trump signed executive orders directing agencies to provide a plan to eliminate federal funding for "illegal and discriminatory treatment and indoctrination in K-12 schools, including based on gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology." MAJOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER ACCUSED OF HIDING DEI PROGRAMS, INFLUENTIAL SENATOR CALLS THEM OUT The president’s efforts to end DEI across the federal government also prompted the cancellation of such programs across the private sector. Meta, in January, canceled its DEI programs, as did McDonald's. And after the 2024 election, Walmart, Ford Motor Co., John Deere, Lowe's and Toyota also ended DEI programs. A new study revealed that nearly half of U.S. college students don't DEI courses mandated in their schools. (Fox News) As recently as April, according to Forbes, IBM, Gannett, and Constellation Brands Inc., made changes to DEI policies. Earlier in 2025, UnitedHealth Group, MLB, Victoria’s Secret, Warner Bros. Discovery, Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, PBS, Google, Disney, GE, PayPal, Chipotle and more scaled back or canceled their DEI programs. Meanwhile, in March, the National Institutes of Health rescinded the agency’s "Scientific Integrity Policy" implemented during the last few weeks of Biden’s term, to peel back any DEI requirements. That Biden-era policy said that DEI was an "integral" part of "the entire scientific process," and pushed NIH's chief scientist and top scientific integrity official to "promote agency efforts regarding diversity, equity and inclusion." It also instituted agency-wide policy directives ordering supervisors at the NIH to "support" scientists and researchers who are "asexual" or "intersex," while imploring NIH leadership to "confer with relevant offices" when additional DEI expertise is needed. MULTIPLE FEDERAL AGENCIES END LINKEDIN CONTRACTS OVER DEI "The Biden administration weaponized NIH’s scientific integrity policy to inject harmful DEI and gender ideology into research," said Health and Human Services Department spokesperson, Andrew Nixon. "Rescinding this (scientific integrity) policy will allow NIH to restore science to its golden standard and protect the integrity of science." The Biden administration also funded grants related to DEI, such as one for roughly $165,000 that was focused on "queering the curriculum" for family medicine doctors to guide them in their treatment of transgender patients. Those grants have been canceled. And earlier this week, multiple federal agencies told Fox News Digital that they have dropped millions of dollars in contracts for LinkedIn services over the business social network’s embrace of DEI. The Departments of Treasury, Interior and Veterans Affairs dropped LinkedIn — a move to comply with the president’s executive orders banning federal agencies from contracting with companies that embrace DEI policies. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP "Every American taxpayer should be angry that the Biden administration wasted so much money on contracts like these," an Interior Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital. "Under the leadership of President Trump, we have been combing through hundreds of thousands of contracts here at the Department alone and are canceling wasteful, woke, and downright ridiculous contracts that do not align with the will of the American people." LinkedIn DEI services (LinkedIn) A LinkedIn spokesperson told Fox News Digital, in response, that: "Like every business, the organizations that use our products change, often driven by shifts in their budgets and priorities. We’re keeping our focus on helping our customers achieve the objectives they’ve set." Fox News Digital's David Spector and Alec Schemmel contributed to this report.

Title: My Stock Market Abundance Plan

A Wealth of Common Sense Posted April 27, 2025 by Ben Carlson I liked Abundance by Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein because the theme of the book is about doing stuff rather than scarcity. The big ideas from the book revolve around the fact that there’s too much red tape when it comes to things like housing, energy, healthcare and technology development. If nothing else, the idea of making it easier to build more housing is something I’m completely on board with. But there was one area of the book that was lacking — the stock market. I thought I could help these guys out and give them the Ben Carlson Stock Market Abundance Plan. Here’s the deal: Roughly 60% of American households own stocks but the top 10% owns 87% of the market. We need more people involved in the stock market. I have a two-part plan to make this happen. Just half of all Americans have savings in a retirement plan such as a 401k. We need to fix that. The Thrift Savings Plan is the defined-contribution retirement plan for federal government employees. It’s the best 401k plan there is. There are just five individual fund options, all extremely low-cost1 index funds — U.S. large cap, U.S. small cap, international, aggregate bond, and U.S. treasuries. Plus they have targedate funds made up of these fund options. The funds are managed by BlackRock and State Street. Why is this plan only available to government employees? It should be open to anyone with a job. Many employees have no access to a 401k. Part one of my abundance plan is that anyone who earns a paycheck and pays taxes has the ability to access the TSP retirement plan. In fact, you should be auto-enrolled and forced to opt out of the plan if you don’t wish to contribute. Part two of my plan involves a little more long-term thinking. I want $10,000 from the government into a Roth IRA account for every child born in America today. Don’t worry — there are stipulations on this account. It has to go into the stock market or a targetdate fund. You can’t touch it until age 21. And you can only take the money out at that age to pay for things like student loans, a down payment on a house or to start a business. Otherwise you have to let it ride in the market. After 21 years at 8% growth, $10k turns into $50k. Over 30 years, $10k turns into $100k. Just think about how helpful that would be to young people trying to get their footing in life. It would ease the burden on parents. It would allow young people to take more risks. It would make it easier for them to start a life after school. Would it be expensive? Yeah but it’s an investment in our future. Are there things I haven’t accounted for in my analysis? Sure. But I don’t want the stock market to be just a place for the upper echelon of society. The top 1% owns 50% of the stock market. The bottom 50% owns 1% of the stock market. We should make it easier for more people to save for retirement and invest in the stock market. That’s my abundance plan. Michael and I spoke to Derek about the book, how it relates to the current environment, trade wars and more: ﻿ Podcast version here: 1The small cap fund costs 5 basis points.

Title: The implications of Trump’s big bet on tariffs

Time Published: 2025-04-27T12:12:40Z

Editor’s Note: President Donald Trump’s massive wager on tariffs with your money came together over years. It took just days to fall apart. This is Part 4 of an in-depth, contemporaneous look at the first 100 days of Trump’s second term. When the stock market started chewing through retirement accounts like a wheat thresher, business owners began howling about the risk of ruination, and economic analysts commenced clanging warning bells of a possible worldwide recession, many political watchers thought surely President Donald Trump would take notice. They were certain he would finally see the existential danger of slapping punishing tariffs on scores of countries and step back from his potentially catastrophic plan. Instead, in the 10th week of his new term, the 47th president is leaning into his latest favorite metaphor: that international trade is a high-stakes card game and he is the master strategist. Only he knows which countries hold a strong hand, which do not, and how bets should be placed. And he is laying down a massive wager. “For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” he proclaims to an adoring crowd of Republican VIPs. They have assembled at the White House to celebrate what he calls his “Liberation Day” tariffs. Up at the podium, Trump gleefully displays a chart thick with numbers purporting to show just how much each country will pony up for access to the great American marketplace. But experts who have played the trade game much longer quickly call Trump’s big move on the second day of April a fool’s bet — one that could poison US trade relations with those friendly partners he mentioned and open the door for less friendly competitors to capitalize on his misstep. Skeptics say Trump is flirting with the kind of failure that can unwind a presidency. Trump meets their warnings with a jutted jaw and declarations that he will not blink. To understand how Trump came so quickly to such a perilous spot after much talk, many threats and occasional applications of tariffs in much smaller degrees, it’s worth considering what those close to him have said for years. He truly believes the ability to tax imported goods is a near-mythical power to wipe away trade deficits, stop illegal immigration, control trafficking in illicit drugs, and make the world bow to his will. Aside from military force, he seems to see tariffs as the most direct way a president can rule over not just the United States, but everyone, everywhere. “I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,” he said back on Inauguration Day just as he had on the campaign trail, “because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It’s going to bring our country’s businesses back that left us.” It’s an intriguing claim considering how little good came out of his initial tilt with tariffs. Over the four years of Trump’s first term, he and Chinese President Xi Jinping took turns levying tariffs on pork, solar panels, steel pipes, fruit, nuts, intellectual property, recycled aluminum and more. They eventually worked out an agreement, satisfying Trump’s need to declare himself the master negotiator. But subsequent studies found the promise he extracted for China to buy an additional $200 billion in US goods and services went almost entirely unfulfilled. President Joe Biden maintained those tariffs, but as a practical matter, Trump’s first trade war ended in a draw. Still, this time around Team Trump insists it is making a bigger, longer play. By squeezing world markets simultaneously, the US will drive other countries away from their protectionist tendencies. Better trade balances will follow. Jobs that once moved away from America to find cheaper labor will come back to avoid higher import fees. Gleaming new factories will spring up like wildflowers. Trump will triumph. “Remember the armies of millions of millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones? That kind of thing is going to come to America!” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick says on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” raising the specter of factories full of laborers as a grand vision for the future. But then Lutnick clarifies: Any modern factories will undoubtedly include massive amounts of automation. He’s talking about other, better jobs for the people he says will benefit from Trump’s big tariff gamble. “High school-educated Americans, the core to our workforce, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories.” For many economists, labor analysts and technology specialists, it is a laughably far-fetched idea. Even if tariffs can offset some of the lower wages elsewhere, big investments in big properties — such as manufacturing plants — take years, even if investors are fully confident in the political stability of the host nation. What’s more, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Biden had already boosted American manufacturing jobs to higher levels than Trump ever saw in his first term. Indeed, 20% of domestic factories that are underproducing say a shortage of workers is to blame. By 2033, some researchers say more than half of all new manufacturing jobs in the US could be unfilled. CNN’s Matt Egan, one of the most astute economic reporters around, spoke to a former Ford executive and came away with a cautionary tale. Even that giant of American auto production “had trouble finding qualified workers to work in their assembly plants,” Egan says. And some of those they did find? “They ended up quitting because they didn’t realize just how difficult the job would be.” In a broad sense, Trump is right to say many of America’s once-thriving, old-fashioned factory towns descended into dust and decay in part because other countries used tariffs to protect their manufacturing industries. Some statistics show that most of America’s big trading partners have higher import fees, making US goods more costly and putting US exporters at a disadvantage. But there is precious little evidence to support Trump’s notion that America’s future economic glory will come from pushing its citizens back to assembly lines that, based on his descriptions, often sound like the kind of heavy production of the post-World War II years. And make no mistake: Despite everything Trump says, foreign nations will not pay all these tariffs. Instead, economic analysts overwhelmingly say American consumers will foot most of the monumental bill for what those experts call Trump’s taxes. Perhaps it should be no surprise then, that within days of Trump’s “Liberation” event, even nominal friends who supported him in the election are skimming wild cards toward the president’s carefully stacked tariff deck. “We’ve got to become friends with Canada again,” Joe Rogan says on one of the most popular podcasts in the world with millions of listeners per episode. “I can’t believe that there is anti-American and anti-Canadian sentiment going on. This is the dumbest f**king feud.” “The idea that this is good and makes the American economy inherently stronger is wrongheaded,” conservative commentator Ben Shapiro says to his own vast audience. “Trump’s reciprocal tariffs impose hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on Americans without public or congressional input.” Estimates start appearing in the news about cars costing thousands of dollars more; the price of televisions, bananas, clothing, computers and sporting goods skyrocketing. Considering that voters’ anger over inflation helped propel Trump back to the White House, the idea that he would risk driving prices into the stratosphere with such a big, early move is alarming to even some GOP lawmakers. “High prices are obviously something no one wants to pay — I understand the concern they have,” Rep. Mike Lawler, a New York Republican, tells CNN while nodding to the hope that other countries might cave to Trump’s demands before the worst hits the home front. On the Democratic side, Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Kentucky says the damage is already being done by Trump’s weeks of threatening tariffs, imposing them, then pausing them. “It’s the uncertainty,” McGarvey says. “It’s the on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again. … Our phones are ringing off the hook right now. People see their 401(k)s, they see their college funds for their kids just cratering.” CNN’s Jamie Gangel sees lawmakers of all stripes looking at the days and weeks ahead and quaking. “They don’t know what Donald Trump is going to wake up and decide.” The Yale Budget Lab says Trump’s tariffs will raise costs for the average American family by $3,800 annually. Some analysts picking apart how the administration calculated those retaliatory tariff rates noted the tariff formula released by the White House seemed to bear a strong resemblance to a formula generated by ChatGPT. As if to underscore the administration’s seemingly slapdash approach, the Trump plan is found to include a 10% tariff on some Antarctic islands where there are no people. Only penguins. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who backed Trump in the election, posts his concerns online. “By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war,” Ackman writes, “we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country.” The metric for fear on Wall Street (there really is such a thing) is pegging at levels not seen since Covid-19 shattered global supply chains. The stock market is splashing red across newscasts, showing $6 trillion in lost value over a week. Respected financial institutions are putting the odds of a recession well above 50%. Even Elon Musk takes an apparent swing at Trump’s call for a 20% tariff on Europe. The richest man in the world — and a top adviser to the president — tells a right-wing political conference in Italy he’d like to see a “zero tax situation … a free trade zone between Europe and North America.” A chief architect and defender of Trump’s tariff policy, Peter Navarro, suggests Musk is trying to protect his electric car business. The Tesla CEO calls Navarro a “moron … dumber than a sack of bricks.” Musk will later apologize — to bricks. “THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN,” the president posts on Truth Social, pushing for a rally. At a fundraiser for congressional Republicans, he insists the White House is being flooded with messages from abroad. “I know what the hell I’m doing,” Trump says, implying that his refusal to give an inch is paying off, as Republican lawmakers keep praising his steel spine. “These countries are calling us up, kissing my a**. They are dying to make a deal,” the leader of the free world says as if he is about to lay his winning hand on the table Less than 24 hours later, he folds. The president imposes a 90-day suspension for many of the tariffs he had declared nonnegotiable. It happens so suddenly that US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is testifying in a congressional hearing when he hears about the new strategy. Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat from Nevada, rips into the White House witness for claiming to know what was happening — and then seeming just as surprised as everyone else. “WTF! Who’s in charge?” Horsford shouts. “There is no strategy! This is amateur hour, and it needs to stop!” Amid reports that an alarming shift in the bond market — a key pillar of US economic power — is what made Trump retreat, the president’s team insists he did not buckle at all. Although many were praising him hours earlier for refusing to budge on his tariff demands, they are now crowing about his wily genius. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says this was Trump’s “strategy all along.” Brilliant. The ultimate dealmaker. The praise is unending among Republicans, and the financial markets come surging back for their best day in 16 years. Trump declares victory. In the cold light of morning, reality returns. Commentators outside the MAGA echo sphere start saying all Trump did was push the world dangerously close to an economic disaster and then proclaim himself a hero for backing away from the calamity he created. The prediction of the Yale Budget Lab adjusts upward — now placing the annual tariff tax on families at $4,700. To make matters worse, some analysts say Trump’s brash bet substantially weakened the faith of other nations in the reliability of the US government. “Biggest winner is China. Hands down.” On the “Pivot” podcast, which scrutinizes the intersection of business, tech and politics, entrepreneur and New York University professor of marketing Scott Galloway pulls no punches. “Every Chinese diplomat and businessman … they’re all working overtime and they’re going to European capitals; they’re going everywhere … and they are saying, ‘You may not agree with us, but you know what? We’re good partners.’” Analysts note, through all the ups and downs, the financial markets have still not returned to Inauguration Day levels when all of Trump’s tariff talk was still theory. What’s more, a social media post from Trump saying “this is a great time to buy” a few hours before his about-face brings accusations of illegal insider trading, to which the White House accuses Democrats of playing “partisan games.” In addition, when it becomes clear how many tariffs have not been suspended, and how China is now facing at least a whopping 145% fee to send goods into the US, the markets nosedive again. China calls Trump’s policies a “joke,” strikes back with its own 125% tariff on US goods, and financial experts refuse to lower their predictions of a possible recession. Indeed, Larry Fink, the CEO of the gargantuan, global investment company BlackRock, says on CNBC in mid-April, “I think we are very close, if not in a recession now.” Trump says he’s waiting on a call from China to discuss some sort of deal, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says, “He wants consumers to trust in him, and they should trust in him.” But it appears they don’t — at least not at the levels they did when voters put him back into office. A University of Michigan study, taken before the tariff uproar, is released and shows consumer sentiment at its second lowest level since 1952 with fears of inflation charging upward. Farmers go back to worrying about what will happen to overseas sales of their crops. Businesspeople return to fretting about rising costs and ebbing sales. Working families brace for it all to come crashing down on their bank accounts. Less than one hundred days into his second turn at the presidency, Donald Trump has bet the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of Americans on his deep affection for tariffs. He has started the most significant trade war in generations. It is not clear whether he can end it. CNN’s Kaanita Iyer contributed to this report. © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

A prominent on-chain analytics firm says the 10 largest Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) witnessed massive inflows over the past week as BTC surged above $90,000. On the social media platform X, Lookonchain says the Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of 29,321 BTC worth $2.78 billion in just seven days. Net inflows refer to the number of coins entering an ETF minus outflows or coins leaving the investment vehicle. The analytics firm also notes that nine Ethereum ETFs witnessed positive total net inflows last week to the tune of 20,518 ETH worth $36.5 million. Says Lookonchain, “Apr 25 Update: 10 Bitcoin ETFs: NetFlow: +5,037 BTC (+$477.93 million) iShares(Blackrock) inflows 3,500 BTC($332.07 million) and currently holds 586,164 BTC($55.62 billion).

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 04/28 update below. This post was originally published on April 27 Bitcoin has bounced back this week alongside tech stocks after a leak revealed serious establishment fears of crypto “contagion." Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has surged toward $100,000 per bitcoin as one closely-watched crypto investor calls the market bottom, telling people to “buy everything” ahead of a Federal Reserve flip. Now, as Binance’s chief executive confirms wild speculation that could blow up the bitcoin price, "major" U.S. dollar warnings are priming bitcoin for a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has grappling with the end of a "higher for longer" U.S. dollar ... More amid predictions of a bitcoin price boom. “The preconditions are now in place for the beginning of a major dollar downtrend,” Deutsche Bank analysts George Saravelos and Tim Baker wrote seen by MarketWatch in a note, pointing to a huge shift in U.S. trade policy and a global reassessment of U.S. geopolitical leadership and predicting the end of a “higher for longer” dollar. The U.S. dollar has been supported in recent months by Fed chair Jerome Powell’s relatively hawkish approach to interest rates in the face of inflation fears, though U.S. president Donald Trump has piled pressure on Powell to cut rates. “Given the historical developments of the last few months our EUR/USD forecasts now anticipate the dollar entering a long-winded downcycle,” the Deutsche Bank analysts wrote, adding that, "in a world of extreme uncertainty and rapidly shifting policy norms, the risk of market dislocations and regime breaks remains high." The warning echos the concerns of Goldman Sachs’ head of FX who told Bloomberg this week that the U.S. dollar’s weakness is “here to stay,” as the world adjusts to the new tariff-based international trade order established by Trump. 04/28 update: The bitcoin price has climbed over $95,000 per bitcoin as traders bet the worst of the tariff-induced sell-off is over, cheering data that showed investors poured $3.4 billion into crypto investment products, including the fleet of U.S. bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds, last week— the third-largest on record—according to asset manager CoinShares. "We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets, which are being seen as an emerging safe haven," CoinShares head of research James Butterfill wrote in a report. The bitcoin price rally over the last week, adding 20% to bitcoin from its April low, has emboldened crypto bulls who are now predicting a new bitcoin price all-time high over $110,000 is “imminent.” “Timing the upswing is tricky, but we think it is imminent; we expect a fresh all-time high in the second quarter,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. “Bitcoin accumulation by ‘whales’ (major holders) has been strong. Meanwhile, ETF flows in the past week suggest safe-haven reallocation from gold into bitcoin. We expect these supportive factors to push bitcoin to a fresh all-time high around $120,000 in the second quarter. We see gains continuing through the summer, taking bitcoin towards our year-end forecast of $200,000.” Meanwhile, Jay Jacobs, the head of thematics and active exchange-traded funds (ETFs) at the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, has predicted “geopolitical fragmentation” will be a “megaforce that drives the world forward over the next several decades." "Directly related to that geopolitical fragmentation is the rise of bitcoin as people see more destabilisation and the need for alternative assets," Jacobs said during an interview with CNBC and adding that the bitcoin price is “decoupling" from technology stocks. "Fundamentally, [bitcoin] should behave like an uncorrelated asset," Jacobs said. "The more we see time play out in this uncertain environment, the more we will see this dispersion." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged this week as traders bet on a recovery of so-called risk assets and ... More fears swirl over the future of the U.S. dollar. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion globally on behalf of clients, led the campaign to bring a fully-fledged spot bitcoin ETF to the U.S., winning approval for its IBIT and a fleet of other spot bitcoin ETFs in January last year. In July, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin when he'd previously dismissed it as "an index of money laundering," admitting bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. The arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs on Wall Street was the first step in what Fink branded a digital "revolution" when he revealed his crypto ambitions for BlackRock in 2023—which includes a radical new, blockchain-based alternative to the U.S. dollar.

Title: It’s Time To Buy Muni Bond Funds—Here’s Why And Where
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2025/04/27/its-time-to-buy-muni-bond-funds-heres-why-and-where/
Time Published: 2025-04-27T10:30:00Z

ByWilliam Baldwin ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. Good news for savers in fairly high tax brackets: Yields on municipal bonds are good, comfortably ahead of what you can clear from Treasury bonds. Bad news: This is a treacherous field. It is easy to be gouged buying either individual bonds or high-fee funds. Municipal bonds are worth considering for any fixed-income money you have in taxable accounts. For tax-sheltered accounts like IRAs, munis are inappropriate; there, use this survey of taxable bonds and bond funds. For taxable accounts, munis are a buy. Says Patrick Haskell, who oversees a $182 billion pile of them at BlackRock: “We haven’t had the opportunity to invest at these levels of real and nominal yields since the financial crisis.” The numbers he has in mind: For bonds due in ten years, tax-exempt yields are 80% of U.S. Treasury yields, not bad for anyone destined to pay a tax of 20% or more on interest. At the 30-year mark the percentage is close to 100%. There is a catch with the long munis, having to do with the risk they will be called in early (see rule #3 below), but they remain very attractive even after allowance for this risk. What about that talk of making interest on all state and municipal debt federally taxable (for the first time)? Haskell: “Am I threatened? No.” If this happens, he says, existing bonds will be grandfathered. And if the wise people in Congress decree that henceforth states and cities can issue only taxable debt, his job is not over. The same sewers and school buildings would have to be financed, and the clientele for the bonds would expand to include investors who don’t touch them now, like foreigners and endowment funds. Are you interested in collecting 4% interest federally tax-free? There are too many choices. Fidelity has on its sale counter 138,000 individual tax-exempt bonds. You could get a fund, but even so there is a selection process. YCharts counts 3,700, including all the share classes. This fund survey aims to make the investment easy. On individual bonds our advice is simple: Don’t buy them. As for funds: We narrow the roster of those worth looking at to 40. First, exchange-traded funds, the newer kind of fund that until recently had scarcely anything to offer to muni investors. Here’s a list of 24 of them. These ETFs have annual expense burdens no higher than 0.18%. They each average a daily trading volume of at least $1 million, meaning that you can probably get in and out without getting eaten alive by the bid/ask spread: The older style of fund is a mutual fund. No-load mutuals impose no trading costs but tend to have higher expense ratios. Alas, the subset of municipal-bond mutuals with bargain expense ratios is tiny. All of the funds shown here come from Vanguard. Note: Where Vanguard has both a small-stakes share class starting at $3,000 and a large-stakes version for buyers putting in $50,000, the table displays only the latter. There are two problems with individual tax-exempt bonds. One is that they are hard to research. The IOU you thought was backed by a city or state may in fact be backed only by the revenue from a decrepit nursing home. Do you really want to spend your free time reading fine print? The other matter is that muni bonds are hard to trade. You were perhaps planning to hold until redemption, but things happen. You might need to raise cash. Or you might want to take a tax loss during a spike in interest rates. To get an idea of what befalls small investors trying to sell, take a look at the bond offerings on your brokerage platform. How many are listed as available for sale but with no quote on the bid side? A blank spot for the bid is an indication that, if you need to unload in a hurry, you will get hosed by a middleman. Cashing out a muni fund, in contrast, is easy. To swap for a tax loss, find a substitute fund that isn’t exactly the same. Example: Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond Index behaves much like iShares National Muni Bond but is sufficiently different that the IRS can’t call the swap a wash. After 31 days you can go back where you were, if you want to. It’s easy to find a well-managed fund costing an annual 0.1% or less. It might make sense to pay a little more to get what you want in duration (rate risk) or timing (as with those target-date funds). But not a lot more. Don’t be led astray by the double-tax-free allure of a fund holding only home-state bonds. State income tax rates are usually less than 10%, and muni yields about 4%. There is, that is, not a lot of state tax to be avoided. Kentucky’s flat tax rate is 4%, so the most that a rational Kentucky resident would pay in incremental cost to avoid local tax is 4% of 4%, or 0.16%. How curious that holders of the class C shares of the Nuveen Kentucky Municipal Bond fund pay 1.93% in annual fees, 64 times what they’d pay to hold a muni bond index ETF from Vanguard. Nuveen, a TIAA subsidiary, has another 24 single-state funds on offer for the mathematically challenged. Simple rule of thumb: If Vanguard has a single-state fund for your state, buy it. If Vanguard doesn’t, buy a national fund. The customary practice for a state or city borrowing money is to offer a fairly high coupon on a bond due in 30 years, while reserving the right to call the bond in early beginning in 10 years. For the bond issuer this arrangement is rather nice. For the bond buyer it’s awful. It turns the investment into a heads-you-break-even, tails-you-lose proposition. If interest rates go down, the issuer calls in the bond. That is, the buyer has the good coupon for only 10 years. If rates go up, the issuer stands pat, leaving the buyer stuck for another 20 years at a below-market yield. This unwanted 20-year bond will trade at a discount. The lopsided set of possible outcomes makes quite a contrast to the bet on a noncallable 30-year Treasury bond. Long Treasuries are risky, but the risk is symmetric. They fall in value if interest rates climb, but they are just as likely to rise in value as interest rates go down. Muni owners should be cognizant that they have made asymmetric bets on interest rates. In other words: Muni bond yields overstate expected returns. By how much? To properly answer that question you need to assess, using each bond’s coupon, call date and maturity date, the effect of 10,000 possible paths that interest rates might take between now and 2055, and assign a probability to each path. Such a calculation would be a bit impractical. But you can get a sense of how harmful call provisions are by observing how much compensation investors demand for putting up with them. For AAA-rated munis the yield curve (2 years out versus 30 years) is 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, steeper than the yield curve for Treasuries. A portfolio of long-dated callable bonds has embedded in it some appreciable fraction of that 50 basis points as an expected loss from rate volatility. The following table of net yields aims to deliver rough justice to the situation. It debits the officially reported yields on long-term muni funds for an estimate of call damage. Taxes are allowed for, as well, at different income levels, in two high-tax states. Conclusion: For people in moderately high or very high tax brackets, municipal debt is usually more rewarding than Treasury debt. It’s just not quite as good a deal as bond salesmen would have you believe. The 22% federal bracket, which starts at $96,950 of taxable income on a joint return, is where muni bond interest begins to beat out Treasury bond interest. In the next bracket up, 24%, most couples are also paying a 3.8% investment tax, for a combined federal rate of 27.8%. What about the alternative minimum tax? This affliction largely evaporated with the passage of the 2017 tax law. If the problem reappears, which would happen if Congress fails to extend that law, AMT is still likely to matter only in money-market muni funds and in high-yield muni funds. In short, it’s not worth paying extra fees to get a fund labeled “AMT-free.” State rates, which never apply to U.S. Treasury interest and usually but not always apply to interest on out-of-state municipal bonds, range from 0% to 14.8%. Two states with stiff taxes, New York and California, are home to low-fee double-tax-free funds. New York bonds have pretty good yields. California yields, however, are not terrific and investors there are often better off buying a national muni fund. A peculiarity of the tax code gives fund investors an advantage over bond investors. Say a bond comes out at par and sinks to 90 cents on the dollar as rates rise. If you buy at 90 and redeem at 100, the 10-point gain is taxed as ordinary income (which is totally unfair). Now let’s say a fund buys bonds at 100 and, as interest rates rise, the bonds fall in price to 90 and the fund shares fall in price from $100 to $90. You buy the fund at $90 and see its shares gradually recover as its bonds mature and get cashed out at par. You now sell the fund at $100. Your $10 gain is taxed at the lower capital gain rate.

Title: Trade-war panic is so overblown that it's a great time to buy, these Wall Street strategists say

Thanks to the trade war, Americans are feeling downright awful about the economy. The latest University of Michigan consumer survey reported an 8% decline in sentiment from March, as consumers worried about inflation, unemployment, and their financial situation. It's not only consumers — the American Association of Individual Investors recently reported the 12th consecutive week of a negative bull-bear spread, meaning that more investors were bearish than bullish on the stock market. However, a growing cohort of market experts is shunning the doom-and-gloom narrative that the economy is on a collision course with recession. In their opinion, the bad vibes aren't quite aligning with reality. After all, corporate earnings are strong, the labor market is in good shape, and households have robust balance sheets. Their advice? Don't let the negative news discourage you from buying into the stock market at a discount now. Often, overly bearish sentiment can be a contrarian indicator for a market rebound. Here's why these four strategists are keeping a cool head on tariffs and are ultimately optimistic about the market. To Levine, extremely low investor sentiment means that it's unlikely for markets to fall much further. "Recession's on everybody's lips, and in some ways, that's a really good thing because, as you know, when the market is expecting something, the news of it itself is less likely to cause a downside whoosh," Levine told BI. "The market has de-risked a lot of the downside scenarios." Ultimately, the stock market crash and negative sentiment are all self-inflicted by Trump, meaning that there's nothing wrong with the underlying economy, Levine said. On the bright side, any change in policy can also greatly reduce the chance of a recession. Trump has shown himself amenable to negotiations, as he floated the idea of scaling back tariffs on China earlier this week. Levine believes that some sort of tariff deal will be struck before the 90-day tariff pause is up. "There's some expectation that this is the peak of the tariffs, and so, as those move lower, that would seem to feed into the sense that there is right tail here," Levine said. DeSpirito, who oversees several income and value funds including the iShares Large Cap Value Active ETF (BLCV), has never been too concerned about Trump tariffs ruining the economy. Back in March, DeSpirito said on Bloomberg that it was a mistake for banks to be downgrading their stock market outlooks, and he's held steady to that view. "Periods of uncertainty are actually great buying opportunities. Once the uncertainty abates, companies are very adaptive," DeSpirito told BI. Right now, DeSpirito is seeing opportunities in healthcare services, medical devices, aerospace, and defense companies. "In healthcare, I'm finding a lot more opportunity in services than I am in large-cap pharma. Large cap pharma has a lot of issues around where they locate their intellectual property," DeSpirito said. "A number of them have large patent expirations that are upcoming." DeSpirito thinks the market is overly focused on the risk and overlooking opportunities down the road. He's confident that kinks in trade policy will be ironed out soon. "In addition to greater certainty around trade, you'll also get deregulation, which will be a positive for the market and when you think about tariffs as a source of revenue, that revenue source will create more flexibility on the policy side," DeSpirito said. Tariff concerns have led many investors to diversify outside the US stock market, but Curtis believes the "sell America" narrative is overblown. Instead of fleeing to international stocks, Curtis believes investors should be doubling down on US leaders like the Magnificent Seven. Especially now that many of the Big Tech names are down roughly 20% from all-time highs, Curtis sees a good opportunity for investors to add to their positions in high-quality companies for cheap. "This productivity gain that we're going to get from artificial intelligence is going to be profound and those companies, many of them Mag 7, hold the keys to that," Curtis said at a Franklin Templeton conference on April 22. Curtis is also bullish on defensive sectors like healthcare, where demand for treatments will remain constant no matter what part of the economic cycle we're in. He sees innovations in GLP-1 medications and AI driving sustained future growth for the healthcare sector. "Those businesses are as good as they were over the long term prior to Inauguration Day, and those companies are incredibly well-positioned for what's about to come," Curtis said of the Magnificent Seven. It's easy to buy into a doomsday recession narrative, but Schulze doesn't see much evidence to back it up. There's been a lot of talk about how consumer sentiment is at historic lows, but actions are more important than sentiment itself, he said. "In this cycle in particular, it's more important to watch what people do rather than what they say, because when you look at the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey, it's been low and declining, yet consumption has been fairly broad-based over the last couple of years," Schulze said at a Franklin Templeton conference on April 22. US consumers might not feel so optimistic, but numbers show they're in great shape. Household debt levels are low, and many homeowners locked in low mortgage rates, insulating them from their biggest monthly expense, according to Schulze. "This is a great opportunity to be dollar-cost averaging into the weakness that we've seen," Schulze said. "A lot of negativity has been priced in a short period of time for US equities, and I don't see any structural excesses in the economy that would cause a deep recession." Jump to

Tokenized U.S. treasuries have now reached a new all-time high of $6.16 billion in value. Amid the booming tokenized real-world asset market, it appears that only a few major players are controlling the overall market. According to data from the real-world asset platform rwa.xyz, tokenized U.S. treasuries have now reached a new all-time high of $6.16 billion in value. Tokenized U.S. treasuries on the blockchain were valued at $4.01 billion in January 2025. Since then, their value has surged by 53.62%, reaching $6.16 billion. This sharp increase highlights growing institutional interest and confidence in blockchain as a tool for modernizing fixed-income markets. The data also reveals that six entities—BlackRock BUIDL, Franklin Templeton BENJI, Superstate USTB, Ondo USDY, Circle USYC, and Ondo OUSG—control 88% of all tokenized U.S. treasuries. BlackRock’s BUIDL, representing the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, has emerged as the industry leader in blockchain-based U.S. treasuries. It holds a market capitalization of $2.5 billion, making it 360% larger than the next biggest fund. The other top contenders are: Collectively, these six funds control 88% of all tokenized U.S. treasuries issued, underscoring their dominance in the space.

Meanwhile, BlackRock’s BUIDL has experienced rapid adoption, growing by 291% from the 1st of January to the 26th of April 2025, and now accounts for 41% of the total market. Data shows Ethereum is the primary blockchain for BUIDL, holding 91% of its total supply, or nearly $2.30 billion. Other networks supporting BUIDL include Aptos[APT] ($53.30 million), Avalanche[AVAX] ($52.80 million), and Polygon [POL] ($33.10 million). Launched in March 2024, BUIDL provides daily dividends derived from short-term U.S. Treasury investments.

Title: BTC Price Action Tightens: Market In Consolidation Phase Ahead Of A Potential Break

This week, markets across the board have remained relatively calm, with price action reflecting a clear consolidation phase. The Nasdaq, for instance, has formed an inside bar on the weekly chart, meaning the current candle is trading within the high and low of last week's range. This often signals indecision or a buildup before a larger move. Bitcoin is following a similar pattern. After several weeks of upward movement, the cryptocurrency has entered a tight trading range, consolidating just below key resistance levels. This type of price behavior typically precedes a breakout, and the direction of that breakout could set the tone for Bitcoin’s next major move. Don't Miss: Weekly Analysis: Bitcoin Trading Within a Defined Range On the higher timeframe, Bitcoin remains locked within a clear weekly range. Earlier this week, it dipped below the swing low from March 10, capturing liquidity beneath that level before bouncing back. This kind of price action suggests that buyers are still active and willing to step in at lower prices. However, Bitcoin has not yet pushed through the key range high near 88,742. This level has now acted as resistance twice, reinforcing its importance. If price returns to this area, how it reacts will be crucial. A clean break above it could open the door to a move toward the 92,000s and possibly set the stage for a run toward all-time highs. On the other hand, another rejection could mark the formation of a local top and increase the chances of a deeper pullback. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Key Levels and Market Scenarios to Watch As of now, Bitcoin is holding above 83,000, showing signs of strength despite the consolidation. If it continues to trade above this level and gains momentum, the next upside targets to monitor are 88,000 and then the 92,000s. These levels will be essential in determining whether the current consolidation leads to continuation or reversal. Should Bitcoin break below 83,000 with conviction, particularly on daily closes, a move down toward the low 80,000s becomes likely. If that support fails to hold, price could revisit the mid-74,000s, an area of previous consolidation and strong demand. For bullish momentum to remain intact in the bigger picture, Bitcoin needs to stay above 66,000, which marked the low around the election period. As long as price holds above this key higher low, the broader uptrend remains in place, and any pullbacks can be viewed as potential buying opportunities. See Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now. Wrapping Up Bitcoin is currently in a state of pause after a strong run-up, with price coiling beneath resistance and holding above key support. This kind of consolidation often precedes a decisive move, and traders should be prepared for volatility to return once the range is broken. Whether the breakout comes to the upside or downside will depend on the strength of the next move around the 88,000 and 83,000 zones. As always, staying patient and reactive to price behavior at these key levels will be critical for navigating the next phase in Bitcoin's trend. Read Next: Image: Shutterstock © 2025 Benzinga.com.

There is something very satisfying about having a newspaper in your hands. Photo: Getty Sunday Independent newspaper Sir — Reading news printed on paper is not the same as listening to news on the radio or looking at it on the television or on your phone. Buying a newspaper in a shop, holding a newspaper or placing it on a table to read, turning the pages, choosing the order in which you read it, doing the crossword, placing a cup of tea in the middle of the page you’re not reading, cutting out an article to keep, folding the newspaper or rolling it and putting it in your back pocket, putting it in the recycle bin, or the tempus fugit frisson you get when you open and read a crumpled ball of newspaper once used to wrap a rediscovered vase in the attic — have no equivalents in other media modalities. Newsprint on paper has a physicality all of its own. Newspapers hold a mirror to society; they also hold a lamp — to expose what is ignored or what lies hidden or buried or forgotten. The quality of newspapers is an indicator of the quality of a society. In a world of 24/7 newsfeed, Sunday newspapers occupy a special place — more content, more investigative scoops, more reflective, more glossy, more supplements, more entertainment, more time to read, more news. Newspaper journalists and editors are key workers who provide an essential service; we saw this during Covid and we see it every time there is a crisis; we also see it when we look at countries where newspapers and media are organs of propaganda or in places where journalists are denied access. Being a newspaper journalist or editor is a challenging job, not least having to compete for readers who are being bombarded on all sides by free, fake, sensationalist news. In this context I would like to thank you, in your final edition, on the job you did as editor of the Sunday Independent. Chris Fitzpatrick, Terenure Road East, Dublin 6 Sir — Pope Francis ­re-energised Catholicism by ­living a simple life based on gospel values. By his energy, ­humanity, openness, humility, compassion, repentance and reforms, he regained the confidence of the flock. His successor needs to be cut from the same cloth as him. The decline in active priests ­requires consolidation and best use of its resources by the Catholic Church. Goodwill and generosity of spirit are required at all levels of the church, which must continue to adapt and modernise to meet the spiritual needs of contemporary society. Gender inequality and compulsory celibacy are denying the faithful the service of many fine individuals who would make ­excellent priests. Women have given outstanding ­service, devotion and loyalty to the church, but are denied ordination. Imag­ine the reinvigoration and energy, in addition to a substantial increase in available priests, that would permeate all levels of the church if women could become priests. A priest should always have the right to remain single but should also be entitled to marry. Likewise, ordination should be available to a married person. In a society where the role of the Catholic Church must be predominantly pastoral and inclusive, the sacraments of holy orders and matrimony can no longer be mutually exclusive. Francis has ensured the sustainability of Catholicism into the future. It will be less ­influential in secular society. It must co-exist and co-operate with other religions and none. It will have to work hard to retain the confidence of the laity. However, as long as it’s grounded in Francis’s values of social justice, humility, altruism, equality and reconciliation, count me in as an active and committed member. Billy Ryle, Spa, Tralee, Co Kerry Sir — In 2005, Paddy O’Gorman on his radio programme interviewed a betting man in a Cork bookie shop who had landed a healthy accumulator a few weeks earlier. Pope John Paul II had died the previous day, and our friend decided to use the manna from heaven to attend the funeral. So off they popped, the pious punter, his wife and sister-in-law. Rome, of course, was packed with mourners — roadblocks and diversions everywhere, thousands at the checkpoints. But our Leeside trio were ushered forward at every turn, right up to the cortege and with the best viewing points wherever they went. Apparently, the authorities and security crews assumed they had come from Poland, the Pope’s homeland, and gave them preferential treatment. They were wearing their Cork GAA jerseys. Des Nix, Raheny, Dublin 5 Sir — I am sure Saint ­Francis of Assisi would be so proud of his namesake, our humble Pope Francis, for his empathy for the poor and marginalised. Looking back on his visit to Ireland in 2018, it was difficult for him as he didn’t have the ­euphoria that marked Pope John Paul II’s wonderful time here. At the state event in Dublin Caste to honour his visit, Francis sat thoughtfully listening to then taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s warm welcoming words, which were also laced with pointed criticism of the Catholic Church. There was a sense he was being chastised for all the church’s failings in Ireland and, perhaps, even those of the State. Pope Francis, with humility and dignity, acknowledged the shared pain of what he called the “repugnant crimes” of ­clerical abuse. He also saw the fun and the good in the person, whether believer or not. His sense of hum­our must have lightened the heavy burden on his heart and soul. On Easter Sunday, no doubt gravely ill, he still was giving, praying and smiling. The world and the church will be the poorer for his leaving us. Aidan Roddy, Cabinteely, Dublin 18 Sir — On the passing of dear Pope Francis The TV flashback showed him visiting the Capuchin monks Who feed the poor and destitute. They interviewed a homeless person there; she said: “If I wasn’t homeless I would never have met the Pope.” Derek Seymour, Dún Laoghaire, Co Dublin Sir — I happened to find ­myself in possession of two diff­erent sized Cadbury Twirl Easter eggs (retailing at €10 and €6 respectively) and discovered the two eggs were the same size and weight (155g). The only difference in content between the two eggs (apart from the obviousinflated packaging of the more expensive egg) was one Twirl bar. Orla Maguire, Rathfarnham, Dublin 14 Sir — I googled “Who can be elected Pope?” and was advised that any baptised male could be elected. Is the church aware of the definition of misogyny? M McMahon, Malahide, Co Dublin Sir — Reading comments last Sunday concerning the general subject of letter-writing brought me back to the days when the handwritten letter was the norm. My late mother said to me on several occasions that very intelligent people in some instances had poor handwriting. Given my own scrawl, I always felt that in her subtle way she was reassur­ing me that intellectually I wasn’t quite a write-off. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Sir — Education Minister ­Helen McEntee’s recent threat to introduce legislation to compel schools to take in pupils with special needs is an attempt to distract from the real problem. There is not a school or teacher in Ireland that would refuse admission to children with special needs if the proper facilities were provided by the minister and her department. I acknowledge that there is a serious problem for parents trying to get places for their children. Compelling schools is not necessary and certainly not the solution. There have been a few small units built to cater for children with special needs, but now the department and the minister are no longer providing the necessary grants. Instead, they are suggesting that existing classrooms be used if there are spare ones. In discussion with two ­National Council For Special Education reps recently when I was chairman of a board of management, I asked them about the sensory provision for the pupils. “You can hang a ­curtain in the corner of the classroom,” was the reply I got. Such absurdity I have never heard in my 40 years of involvement with a school. This just proves that the department and the minister are more interested in getting the numbers up than providing the proper facilities. Schools, principals, teachers and boards are absolutely willing to take in children with special needs. Ms McEntee, you need to provide the funding to properly upgrade classrooms or provide the necessary funding to build new units. The solution is in your hands. Walter Lacey, Bullock Park, Carlow Sir — On buying your ­paper last weekend, I hurried to read the articles on Rory McIroy’s ­triumph at the ­Masters. ­Eamonn Sweeney, Tommy ­Conlon and Paul ­Kimmage were excellent, but Declan Lynch nailed it. John McCann, Donegal Sir — Tom Gilsenan (Letters, April 20) opines that there is “a donkey in the White House”. If I were The Donald, I would take that as a compliment of the highest order. Anyone familiar with donkeys will know of their unbelievable qualities: hard-working, calm in stressful situations, wonderful with children, low-maintenance, soothing company, productive. More “donkeys” and fewer high-maintenance temperamental racehorses are needed in ­positions of authority as far as I’m concerned. Aileen Hooper, Stoneybatter, Dublin 7 Sir — Eilis O’Hanlon’s article last Sunday on trans ideology was a damning indictment of both government and opposition parties for their failure to acknowledge what the vast ­majority of people believe. The other elephant in the room that her same arguments apply to is illegal immigration. For the past number of years the last government (with Sinn Féin complicit by their silence) ­ignored the law of the land to the extent that there are now 6,000 asylum-seekers from safe countries Georgia and Algeria out of a total of 33,000 in the direct provision system. These numbers are unsustainable, even without impending tariffs. And all sides of the Dáil are silent — shame on them. Bernie Cronin, Clondalkin, Dublin 22 Sir — I was heartbroken by Maeve Sheehan’s report in last week’s Sunday Independent (‘Grace: Harrowing neglect of severely disabled young girl’).It seems to me that the HSE didn’t ward Grace due to the fact that this case was so bad, it was afraid of what would be disclosed. It must be very frightening for disabled people if they know that the agency entrusted with caring for them is going to keep secrets and is not going to be open, honest and transparent regarding their care. This presents immense fear for a lot of parents, brothers and sisters of many disabled people and for disabled people themselves. We must remember that disabled children are three to four times more likely to be abused. It is much more challenging if one doesn’t have a voice. However, we must always be cognisant of the fact that these children can communicate. They communicate by how they behave, so it’s a question of learning what that means. We can often pick up what is going on when a child is initially happy, and then all of a sudden their behaviour changes. Examples of such changes in behaviour are evident if a child starts to hit their head or if they start to bite or scratch. Doctors, nurses, social workers and gardaí need to be properly trained in this area . I would like to know the level of expertise that was involved in the Grace inquiry. It seems to me a lot of solicitors and barristers were involved and not a lot of specialists. There is a gap in our understanding of disability and abuse. If we don’t learn from the Grace case, we will find similar cases emerging. Perish the thought. John O’Brien, clinical psychotherapist, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Sir — Reading the Farrelly Commission report is very depressing. It is unconscionable that a state organisation entrusted with the protection of all vulnerable people should hide the truth to protect itself. We now know that some in the HSE have different ethical codes of practice. This is very worrying and alarming. Those of us who are whistleblowers and know the issues despair of a failed HSE system not fit for purpose. We demand urg­ent political action that leads to safeguarding of our most vulnerable citizens. Dr Margaret Kennedy, Greystones, Co Wicklow Sir — In recent times I have read advice from financial experts telling workers to join their work pension scheme as early as possible in their working life, as this will put them in a more favourable financial position when they retire. That is good advice. There is another side to this. When a worker starts to draw their pension, they may have a reasonable expectation that their pension payment would keep them within shouting distance of the increasing cost of living. However, my experience has not achieved that expectation. I retired in 2010 after 34 years working for a very profitable company. When I was working I received annual increases in pay, but since I retired my modest pension has not increased by one cent in 15 years. Having not received any increase in my pension payment, I contacted the company and was told that because the pension plan was in deficit, the company had “decided not to award a discretionary increase this year”. I am not a member of any trade union or retirement group. I am a lone voice without power, except for my trusty pen. I note that the CEO of this company is paid millions. The rich are getting richer. Don’t worry about the “old” people. David Riedy, Co Limerick Sir — David Quinn claims that protests on US university campuses “should not be euphemistically described as merely ‘pro-Palestinian’” (‘Student politics is no joke — radicals are sounding alarm bells’, April 20). He is correct, but for the wrong reasons. The protesters in question, like their fellow students elsewhere, are demonstrating in support of international humanitarian law and for ending the impunity that the state of Israel — plausiblyaccused of genocide by the International Court of Justice — enjoys, thanks to the unconditional support it receives from US and EU governments. It is natural that those who support that impunity should experience “hostility”, but to attribute such sensitivity to their being Jewish or Israeli is merelyto accept the Israeli state’s tactic of attributing all opposition to its crimes as antisemitic. In the days of South African apartheid, I’ve little doubt that supporters of white supremacism in South Africa suffered similar unease in the face of protests over racial equality. Raymond Deane, Dublin 7 Sir — David Quinn states that the “Boycott, Divest, Sanction” movement … essentially wants to destroy the Jewish State”. This is not true. Boycott, Div­estment, Sanctions (BDS) is a Palestinian-led movement for freedom, justice and equality. It upholds the principle that Palestinians are entitled to the same rights as everyone.

Join the leading maritime news network Ships move through the Suez Canal, on the Excellence Day, in Ismalia, Egypt, April 16, 2025. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh By María Paula Mijares Torres Apr 26, 2025 (Bloomberg) –President Donald Trump called for “free of charge” passage of American ships through the Panama and Suez canals, renewing his focus of expanding US influence over critical commercial and naval waterways. While Trump began pushing for an exit of Chinese port operators around the Panama Canal soon after returning to the White House in January, the post on his Truth Social network on Saturday also turned attention to the Suez Canal, which cuts through Egypt to link the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. “Those Canals would not exist without the United States of America,” Trump said, adding that he’s asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio to “immediately take care of” the situation. Trump’s focus — with tariffs and other measures, such as proposed fees at US ports — has been on Chinese commercial shipping and shipbuilding, with the ultimate goal of promoting a revival of US shipbuilding. The US government argues that China’s dominance in ship construction was achieved unfairly and harms US interests. US commercial shipbuilding, once a global leader, has shriveled since the 1980s due to subsidy cuts and foreign competition.

Title: Michael Saylor Predicts BlackRock’s IBIT Will Be The World’s Biggest ETF In The Next Decade

Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of the world’s largest Bitcoin corporate holder Strategy, has predicted that in the next ten years, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which launched in January 2024 alongside 10 other US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, will become the largest ETF in the world. It might be pocket change when considering BlackRock currently boasts trillions of dollars in assets under management, but it hasn’t gone unnoticed that the asset management giant’s Bitcoin ETF stash is closing in on 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. “BlackRock is accumulating. They now hold 2.77% of the entire Bitcoin supply,” Arkham Intelligence wrote to X on Friday, noting the Wall Street behemoth had added a staggering $1.2 billion in BTC this week alone. As of April 26, BlackRock held approximately 582,000 BTC via IBIT, worth around $54 billion. That makes it the 33rd biggest exchange-traded fund by assets under management. In comparison, the largest ETF by market cap, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), boasts a market capitalization of $593.5 billion, more than ten times that of IBIT. However, speaking at the Bitcoin Standard Corporation’s Investor Day, Strategy’s Michael Saylor forecasted that “IBIT will be the biggest ETF in the world in ten years.” 🚨NEW: @saylor predicts that @BlackRock’s $IBIT will be “the biggest ETF in the world in ten years.” pic.twitter.com/cyDDFf47FV Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas concurred with Saylor that IBIT could potentially become the world’s biggest ETF, though he stressed that it would be extraordinary. “It’s possible, especially if IBIT starts taking in more cash than VOO, but that would require inflows well north of $1 billion a day — more likely in the range of $3 to $4 billion daily, to gain ground. In short, some extraordinary things would have to happen, but it’s possible,” Balchunas said. It’s pertinent to note that this is not Saylor’s first insanely optimistic Bitcoin-related prediction. As ZyCrypto reported previously, the tech entrepreneur said he thinks the crypto will rocket to a price of $13 million per coin over a 21-year period. Saylor’s company currently holds 538,200 BTC, worth roughly $51 billion. Bitcoin recently changed hands at $94,969, up 1.5% over the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap is up 13.5% over the past 14 days.

Title: Ethereum Whales Sell, But Bitcoin’s Key Investors Are Buying

On-chain data shows the Ethereum whales have sold the asset recently, while key holders on the Bitcoin network have accumulated instead. As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Ethereum whales have participated in selling recently. The “whales” here refer to the ETH entities holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH. At the current exchange rate, this range converts to $1.8 million to $18 million. While these bounds don’t cover the largest of holders in the sector, they do still contain some of the key investors. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the combined balance of these Ethereum whales over the over the past ten days or so: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum whales have seen their supply go through a net decline recently. During this selloff, these investors offloaded more than 63,000 ETH (about $113.5 million) inside a 48-hour window. From the chart, it’s visible that the distribution from this cohort has coincided with ETH’s recovery rally. This could indicate that these large investors have been capitalizing on the profit-taking opportunity. While the key investors of ETH may have taken profits, the same isn’t true for that of BTC. As the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed in an X post, the trend has been that of accumulation for BTC recently. In the chart, the analytics firm has attached the data related to the supply of the Bitcoin holders carrying between 10 ($946,000) and 10,000 BTC ($946 million). This range is broader than the one for ETH and includes two key investor cohorts: sharks and whales. These investors have collectively added a total of 19,255 BTC to their wallets alongside the price rally. Thus, it would appear that the key holders of the cryptocurrency are supportive of the recovery run. Naturally, this could imply the Bitcoin rally may have more chances of being sustainable than the Ethereum one. That said, things can change quickly in the digital asset sector, so the trend related to the large entities of both might be worth keeping an eye on. Speaking of accumulation, BTC is currently witnessing high inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as Santiment has pointed out in another X post. From the chart, it’s visible that the recent ETF inflows are the largest in months. As the analytics firm notes, As Bitcoin has recovered as high as $95.8K today, we are seeing the highest week of net inflows to BTC ETF’s since the week before Trump’s inauguration in mid-January. Institutions like Blackrock have played a large part in the crypto-wide bounce traders were waiting for. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,800, up more than 12% in the last week.

Keshav is currently a senior writer at NewsBTC and has been attached to the website since June 14, 2021. Keshav has been writing for many years, first as a hobbyist and later as a freelancer. He has experience working in a variety of niches, even fiction at one point, but the cryptocurrency industry has been the longest he has been attached to. In terms of official educational qualifications, Keshav holds a bachelor’s degree in Physics from one of the premier institutes of India, the University of Delhi (DU). He started the degree with an aim of eventually making a career in Physics, but the onset of COVID led to a shift in plans. The virus meant that the college classes had to be delivered in the online-mode and with it came free time for him to explore other passions. Initially only seeking to make some beer money, Keshav unexpectedly landed clients offering real projects, after which there was no looking back. Writing was something he had always enjoyed and to be able to do it for a living was like a dream come true. Keshav completed his Physics degree in 2022 and has been focusing on his writing career since, but that doesn’t mean his passion for Physics has ended. He eventually plans to re-enter university to obtain a masters degree in the same field, but perhaps only to satiate his own interest rather than for using it as a means to find employment.. Keshav has found blockchain and its concepts fascinating ever since he started going down the rabbit-hole back in 2020. On-chain analysis in particular has been something he likes to research more about, which is why his NewsBTC pieces tend to involve it in some form. Being of the science background, Keshav likes if concepts are clear and consistent, so he generally explains the indicators he talks about in a bit of detail so that the readers can perhaps come out having understood and learnt something new. As for hobbies, Keshav is super into football, anime, and videogames. He enjoys football not only as a watcher, but also as a player. For games, Keshav generally tends towards enjoying singleplayer adventures, with EA FC (formerly FIFA) being the only online game he is active in. Though, perhaps due to being ultra-focused on the game, he is today a semi-pro on the EA FC scene, regularly participating in tournaments and sometimes even taking back prize money. Because of his enthusiasm for anime and games, he also self-learned Japanese along the way to consume some of the untranslated gems out there. The skill didn’t merely remain as just a hobby, either, as he put it to productive use during his exploration for small-time gigs at the start of COVID, fulfilling a couple of Japanese-to-English translation jobs. Keshav is also big into fitness, with agility and acceleration-related workouts making a big part of his program due to the relevance they have in football. On top of that, he also has a more traditional strength based program for the gym, which he does to maintain an overall fitness level of his body.

Title: Improved Ireland side can get a much-needed shot of self-belief in Edinburgh

This could be construed as something of a dead rubber. There is certainly not as much on the line as has been the case in recent last-day Six Nations meetings, most notably a year ago when Ireland’s taut 15-12 triumph over Scotland in Belfast secured third place and as a result automatic qualification for both the World Cup and WXV 1. There would be a world of difference in securing third place with a commanding third win out of five games 12 months on and rubber-stamping the huge strides taken by this Irish team in the last year. Finishing third a year ago was a welcome upgrade on losing all five matches and earning the wooden spoon in 2023, but for starters it was achieved with two wins out of five and was indebted to Italy beating Wales on the final day in Cardiff. There will be no good fortune or favours required to finish third this year if Ireland secure a third win out of three away games in this year’s Six Nations. What’s more, were Ireland to win as convincingly as they did against Italy in Parma in round two, especially, and Wales in Newport last Sunday, it would emphatically endorse their standing as “the best of the rest” and the biggest challengers to the upper strata of England and France. In truth, Ireland need to be more clinical than they were against Wales when leaving at least two or three tries behind through handing errors. This is no more than they would have said among themselves and it was reflected in the palpably anticlimactic reaction immediately afterwards of Scott Bemand, who previously worked with an English side that is nearly always ruthlessly clinical in such circumstances. Although the defeats to France and England hurt, the disappointment was relative, not least as Ireland were significantly more competitive in both fixtures than they had been in the corresponding fixtures in recent years. In its way, last week’s lack of satisfaction despite posting more than 40 points away from home was the first bump in the road in this Six Nations and is also a reflection of the huge progress this team has made in the last year and a half. Ireland are making serious progress but nowhere is this belief more important than among the players and staff themselves. There will be a long four months to stew on this Six Nations before Ireland play their World Cup warm-up games in August, and how they sign off in Edinburgh will go some way toward determining how they view this Six Nations and how real the advances have been. Even a laboured performance and win could serve to undermine the team’s self-belief and call into question the strides taken up to now on an almost game-by-game basis through the wins over Australia, New Zealand and the USA and in this championship. [ UL Bohemian duo Aoife Corey and Jane Clohessy in line for first Ireland caps against ScotlandOpens in new window ] By contrast, were Ireland to be more clinical in the Scottish 22 than they were a week ago and thus complete a convincing, statement win against opponents who have caused them issues and even some pain in recent years, it would fuel the team’s self-belief over the ensuing months and into the World Cup build-up. With the World Cup in mind, a six-day turnaround is always an issue and, coupled with injuries, is beginning to highlight Ireland’s lack of real depth were Bemand and co required to dig much deeper, but this is still a good side. The loss of the hugely influential Erin King for this Six Nations and the World Cup is a cruel blow, not least for the player herself. Even so, Ireland can still field a fairly complete backrow in Dorothy Wall, Edel McMahon and Brittany Hogan. There’s also enough quality on a bench featuring Cliodhna Moloney, a second potential debutant in Jane Clohessy, daughter of Peter, Emily Lane, Eve Higgins and Stacey Flood, who will feel she has a point to prove; it looks well equipped to add impact and see the team through. Ireland exorcised a few demons in Parma and need to do so again having lost here by 36-10 two years ago. Scotland will be fired up after their results to date. But Ireland have won 15 of their last 17 Six Nations matches against Scotland and reasserting that authority with a third win in the championship for the first time since 2020 would seal the most positive season in years.

Title: How To Price Bitcoin? BlackRock Exec Explains

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin should be valued as “an uncorrelated asset that benefits when the world gets messier,” BlackRock’s US Head of Equity ETFs Jay Jacobs told CNBC in an interview on Thursday. “Crypto over the long run is decoupled from US tech stocks,” Jacobs said, stressing that short-term market stress can mask the difference but that “the long-term correlation between US stocks and Bitcoin is more like two or three percent.” He argued that what pushes equities higher—“higher growth, higher certainty, lower geopolitical risk”—is the mirror image of the forces that move Bitcoin. “Bitcoin thrives when you have more uncertainty and are looking for something that’s going to behave differently, so fundamentally they should behave like an uncorrelated asset.” BTC was changing hands just under $94,000 during Jacobs’ appearance, extending a rally that has added roughly 150% since spot-ETF approvals early last year. Jacobs tied price behaviour directly to flows. “We would think over the long term, if this trajectory of greater uncertainty around the world continues, things like gold and Bitcoin should continue to go up.” He noted that investors are repositioning accordingly: “We’ve seen significant inflows into gold ETFs; we’ve seen significant inflows into Bitcoin, and this is all because people are looking for those assets that will behave differently.” The biggest beneficiary has been BlackRock’s own iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which on 23 April absorbed $643 million of net creations—its largest one-day haul since January—lifting the fund’s assets to roughly $54 billion. Jacobs framed the rush into hard assets as part of a longer geopolitical realignment. “If you look at central banks around the world, a continued movement towards diversification beyond just holding dollars is something that’s been happening for decades… the switch from just holding dollars to holding gold to looking at other types of assets like Bitcoin is a trend that’s been years in the making.” Central-bank gold purchases illustrate the shift: net buying topped 1,044 tonnes in 2024, the third consecutive year above the thousand-tonne mark, double the average of the previous decade. He linked those reserve moves to BlackRock’s 2023 “mega-forces” framework, which identified geopolitical fragmentation as a secular driver of returns. “That mega force is materialising in policies like reshoring in the United States and, I think, directly related to that fragmentation has been the rise of things like Bitcoin, as people see more destabilisation in geopolitics resulting in the need for more alternative assets.” BlackRock’s influence is difficult to overstate: the firm ended the first quarter with a record $11.6 trillion under management. By pairing that scale with a public thesis that Bitcoin’s fair price rises as uncertainty deepens, the asset-manager is effectively codifying a valuation model in which scarcity and sanction-resistance—not discounted cash flows—set the marginal price. As Jacobs put it, the market is “looking for alternatives—parts of the portfolio that are going to behave separately from stocks and bonds.” With IBIT now swallowing more BTC each day than miners can produce post-halving, his remarks may offer the clearest blueprint yet for how the world’s largest asset manager thinks about pricing the world’s largest cryptocurrency.

Title: LIC, GQG, MFs LIC, lead $3.7 billion investment surge in Adani Group post-Hindenburg

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: Investor confidence in Adani group companies appears to have climbed significantly following a generally favourable verdict from India’s Supreme Court on the Hindenburg matter, and the subsequent closure of Hindenburg’s operations. During the fiscal year ended 31 March, Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners, Indian mutual funds (MFs), and domestic retail investors together injected approximately $3.7 billion or ₹32,571 crore into the group’s 10 listed companies, an analysis by Mint of data from BSE showed. To be sure, during the same fiscal, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold shares worth ₹33,945 crore across Adani group firms, except in Adani Energy Solutions, AWL Agri Business and Adani Total Gas Ltd. In January 2023, US-based Hindenburg Research made a host of scathing allegations in a report against Adani group and its dealings while tagging the group for pulling the “biggest con in corporate history". However, following an apex court-monitored probe by market regulator Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) last year, the Supreme Court gave a largely favourable verdict for Adani group in January 2024. Subsequently, Hindenburg’s announcement of closure of its operations in January 2025 led to the rush by domestic investors to buy shares of Adani group companies, the analysis by Mint suggests. Also read | Adani Ports’ latest deal raises growth concerns—markets aren’t impressed Some other factors might have also helped in the resurgence of domestic investment in the group’s companies, according to experts. “Hindenburg shutdown, correction in valuation and, potentially, the progress in execution of Adani's key projects in power and infrastructure have played a major role in attracting investors," the head of equity capital markets at a large global financial services firm said on condition of anonymity. Several Adani companies saw their stocks lose between 12% and 50% in market value after an allegation by the US Department of Justice or DoJ of a New York district court in November 2024. The DoJ had alleged that Gautam Adani and a few other promoter family members and group officials had bribed Indian government officials $250 million to secure solar energy contracts and that it had not disclosed this to investors while raising money from American and international investors. Adani Group had refuted these allegations. Who bought how muchDuring the fiscal, LIC bought shares cumulatively worth around ₹3,575 crore across Adani Enterprises Ltd, Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd (APSEZ), Adani Energy Solutions Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and some others. Domestic MFs purchased shares worth at least ₹20,226 crore in almost all Adani group companies except in ACC Ltd and NDTV Ltd. GQG Partners, which indulged in a buying spree of Adani company shares after the Hindenburg attack in 2023, also resumed its purchases. In FY25, it increased its holding cumulatively by about 10% in Adani Enterprises, Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Green Energy Ltd (which was named in bribery allegations by the US Department of Justice or DoJ) and Adani Ports, worth at least ₹2,467 crore. Read this | BlackRock buys nearly third of Adani group promoters’ $1 bn private bonds Domestic retail investors together bought shares worth ₹6,303 crore in Adani group companies, increasing the most in Adani Green during the fiscal. In absolute terms, across all classes of investors, the most shares were bought of Adani's holding firm (Adani Enterprises), Ambuja Cements, and the group's ports (APSEZ) and power transmission (Adani Energy Solutions Ltd) businesses during the fiscal. Adani Group controls most of the major airports in India along with a large infrastructure portfolio managed through eight listed group companies. Breaking it downMFs increased their holding the most (in terms of value) in Adani Ports ( ₹5,464.92 crore) and Ambuja Cements ( ₹3,453.6 crore) during the financial year, which saw several acquisitions by the group in the ports and cement space. LIC and GQG, on the other hand, purchased the most in the group’s flagship Adani Enterprises, while retail investors bought the most in Adani Green Energy Ltd. Also read | Adani Green is weighing its biggest equity sale ever All four classes of investors put together purchased at least 51.91 million shares in Adani Energy Solutions, 50.84 million shares in Adani Ports, 19.19 million shares in Adani Enterprises and 39.7 million shares in Adani Green during fiscal 2025, according to the Mint study. Together, these investors bought shares worth ₹6,003 crore in Adani Green and ₹6,721 crore in Adani Ports alone. Earnings made a differenceAccording to a veteran market analyst who requested anonymity, MFs may have started seeing more value in Adani group stocks due to their earnings growth despite external events such as the allegations by DoJ in the US. He said in Adani's holding firm, the growth may have come from two incubation businesses—solar energy equipment manufacturing (under Adani New Industries Ltd or ANIL) and airports (under Adani Airport Holdings Ltd). “While ANIL's operating income was up 121% in the April-December period of FY25, the airports business operating profit went up 42% in the first nine months of FY25. The upcoming 500ktpa copper smelter will also add close to 10-15% to the existing operating income of Adani Enterprises," said the analyst. He said in the case of Adani Ports, the company's operating income grew by 19% for the April-December period, while the company increased guidance to ₹18,000 crore for FY25 after commencing operations at Vizhinjam, Kerala—India’s first trans-shipment port. Recently, the company commissioned a major ship terminal in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Also read | Adani-baiter Hindenburg Research shuts shop—“from a place of joy" Within the cement space too, the group, through Ambuja, the country's second largest cement maker after Ultratech Ltd, aggressively expanded capacities during the fiscal through acquisitions. The group's cement capacity increased from 78.9 mtpa last year to over 100 mtpa now. The capacity of Adani Green, which saw maximum investment from retail investors, grew 30% in FY25—14.2 GW from 11 GW, but the stock fell steeply after DoJ’s allegations. “Typically, the advantage of such businesses is that it can provide consistent cashflow, which by leveraging can be re-invested in similar projects. Also, the correction in stock prices of the group firms due to the DoJ allegations may have provided a good entry point for all investors," said the analyst. During fiscal 2025, prices of most Adani group firms corrected significantly on the bourses, with Adani Green stock falling by 48.25%, Adani Total Gas Ltd by 35%, Ambuja Cements by 12% and Adani Enterprises by 27.3%.

Title: Bitcoin ETF inflows hit $442M on April 24 as IBIT leads – Institutional demand fuels BTC rally

Could this underdog ETF soon rival Wall Street’s biggest giants? Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs are regaining momentum as the broader crypto market rebounds. According to data from Farside Investors, spot BTC ETFs witnessed a significant inflow of $442 million on the 24th of April alone. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) accounting for a massive $327.3 million of that total. This marks a consistent streak of inflows since the 17th of April, signaling renewed institutional confidence in Bitcoin. Riding this wave of optimism, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor has made a bold forecast, predicting that IBIT could outpace every other ETF to become the world’s largest within a decade. While such a claim might sound ambitious in a market still dominated by S&P 500 titans, it’s emblematic of Saylor’s long-standing conviction in Bitcoin’s ascent. Echoing similar sentiments, ETF Store President Nate Geraci noted, Source: Nate Geraci/X While BlackRock’s IBIT is still far from matching the scale of ETF giants like Vanguard’s VOO, which boasts over $573 billion in assets, its rapid ascent is hard to ignore. SPY and IVV remain comfortably above the $500 billion mark, but IBIT is gaining traction fast, with BlackRock now holding more than 582,000 BTC, valued at over $54.2 billion. This positions it just outside the top 35 ETFs by AUM, yet it’s already generating daily trading volumes exceeding 45 million shares. In a space where Bitcoin was once barely acknowledged by institutions, this surge signals a transformative shift. Adding to the momentum, U.S. spot BTC ETFs collectively saw a net inflow of 11,898 BTC in a single day, the highest since the 11th of November 2024. While Saylor’s bold predictions of Bitcoin reaching $13 million per coin may seem far-fetched, his history of early, unwavering conviction gives such statements unusual weight. After a period of muted flows, the recent spike in institutional Bitcoin activity signals a decisive shift in sentiment. Daily inflows that once averaged just 23 BTC in 2025 have now surged dramatically, reflecting renewed confidence from large-scale investors. This revival is vividly illustrated by Glassnode’s charts, where bold green bars have replaced the prior red streak, marking a clear break from the stagnation. The resulting uptick in demand has fueled Bitcoin’s price momentum, with BTC climbing to $93,734.12, up 10.86% over the past week. Such data underscores a strong institutional return, likely laying the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next major leg upward.

Title: ‘Forget about glamour’: Jonathan Anderson offers advice to would-be fashion designers
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fashion/2025/04/25/forget-about-glamour-jonathan-anderson-offers-advice-to-would-be-fashion-designers/

Jonathan Anderson, the newly appointed creative director of Dior men’s wear in Paris, made history on Friday when he became the first fashion designer to be made an Honorary Patron of Trinity College Dublin’s University Philosophical Society. At a packed ceremony, the Irish designer was presented with the Gold Medal by the society’s treasurer Perin Winders, who outlined Anderson’s career and achievements. The award is given by the 340-year-old society to individuals who have excelled in their given fields. In this case it acknowledged Anderson’s contribution to the world of fashion as one of the most influential designers of his generation. Previous recipients of this award include film director Martin Scorsese, former US president Joe Biden, actors Al Pacino, Dame Helen Mirren and Whoopi Goldberg, Tim Cook of Apple and most recently comedian Stephen Colbert. Anderson (41), from Magherafelt, Co Derry, who studied in Blackrock College, is the elder son of former Irish rugby captain Willie Anderson and his wife Heather, a teacher. Anderson said it was a huge honour to receive the award in Dublin, where he had come out as gay and where he first fell in love with fashion, “having blagged my way into a job in Brown Thomas”. Dressed casually in a brown leather jacket and jeans, Anderson also described how he had applied to every fashion college he could find “and every single one turned me down, one offer finally coming for a new men’s wear course at the College of Fashion in London” which kick-started his career. “I am a big believer in failure, and those I look up to are people who have failed and kept going,” he said. There is an incredible amount of work. I think you have to be able to get up every morning and learn something new every day and push yourself out there In a free-ranging question and answer session with Winders, issues such as collaboration, his work in film, the changing role of designers, social media and the fashion world in general generated thoughtful responses. “Life and society have become faster and faster because of social media and we are exposed to so much now that everything is becoming a blur and anonymity is the biggest luxury today,” he said. “Fashion’s big questions – how we deal with the planet, with what we make, but we want to fix everything tomorrow. Government and business have to work together and long-term goals are important.” Anderson also spoke about his pride in having set up the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize during his 11-year tenure at the Spanish luxury brand, which he turned into a global superstar now worth nearly $3 billion. The award is an annual one recognising excellence among makers. Asked what advice he would have for young people interested in a fashion career, he was very clear about its demands. “Forget about glamour, there is an incredible amount of work. I think you have to be able to get up every morning and learn something new every day and push yourself out there,” he said. [ Fashion at the Louvre: Spectacular exhibition sees modern masterworks meet art and historyOpens in new window ] “Even as a child I could never sit still and I always try to do a better job every time I get up in the morning. If you are good and believe in yourself, you can go anywhere, but (in fashion) you have to be a bit of a performer and you have to be quite ruthless and fight your way in.” His annual workload has involved 16 collections – eight for his namesake brand and eight for Loewe. His first men’s wear show for Dior will be at the end of June; he is delving into the Dior’s archives and wants to “be able to explore a different language”. “I like a challenge, and I come with more experience to the job,” he said. Anderson concluded his remarks by saying how proud he is to be Irish and highlighting the need for what he called “more crossing of the aisles” in the current debate about unity. “I am so proud of where I grew up. But growing up in the ’90s was shocking in Northern Ireland and I have seen horrifying things. “Today, however, it is like Disneyland with the Titanic Centre and everything else,” he said, to laughter and applause from the audience.

Title: Saylor Predicts BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Will Be The Biggest ETF In 10 Years

At Bitwise’s Bitcoin Standard Corporations Investors Day, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor set an audacious marker for the entire exchange-traded fund landscape, declaring that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (ticker: IBIT) will become “the biggest ETF in the world in ten years.” The remark instantly rippled through the ETF community, where practitioners are well-aware that the current asset-class hierarchy is dominated by broad-based equity funds rather than single-asset vehicles. IBIT already occupies a rarefied tier within digital-asset finance: according to Bitcoin Treasuries, the trust now custodies more than 575,000 BTC, an estimated $54.3 billion. That asset haul places it as the best-ever ETF launch in history. Skepticism, however, was swift—and data-driven. “Just for some context on this… Largest ETF, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) has taken in over $51 bil just this year. IBIT’s total assets = $54 bil. Would be [a] Herculean feat for IBIT,” wrote Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store and host of ETF Prime, in a post on X. Geraci’s framing underscores the magnitude of the gap: VOO’s $51 billion of 2025 net inflows alone nearly matches IBIT’s entire asset base. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas offered a similarly tempered outlook. “I would never say never re IBIT bc it broke every conceivable record its rookie year but… King VOO is curr 10x bigger and hauls in 5x more cash every day = would take a flat or negative decade for US stocks while btc moons,” he posted, pointing to the entrenched scale and relentless cash generation of the Vanguard fund. Balchunas elaborated that for IBIT to close the gap organically it would need “well north of $1 b/day, like $3 b or $4 b/day if it hopes to gain ground,” concluding that “some extraordinary sht would have to… happen but it’s poss.” When asked whether investors might absorb bitcoin’s “perfect savings” narrative more rapidly, Balchunas distilled his answer to “Two words, two syllables: cash flow,” highlighting the gravitational pull that dividend and earnings streams exert on portfolio construction. Saylor’s forecast lands in a market environment already primed by BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink’s own headline-grabbing Bitcoin thesis. On 22 January 2025, during a World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Fink told Bloomberg that widespread institutional allocation—“2% or even 5%” of portfolios, he said, citing a recent discussion with a sovereign wealth fund—could propel Bitcoin to “$500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” Describing the asset as a “currency of fear,” Fink argued that Bitcoin’s borderless design provides a hedge against “the debasement of your currency, or the economic or political stability of your country.” For Saylor, whose corporate-treasury Bitcoin strategy has made Strategy a leveraged proxy on the token’s price, Fink’s framing offers macro-level validation: if sovereign wealth funds follow through on exploratory conversations, demand could eclipse the finite supply captured inside IBIT. The question—posed implicitly by Geraci’s and Balchunas’ numbers—is whether that demand can outpace the relentless inflows into equity index stalwarts during a decade in which global investors remain wedded to cash-generative, regulation-familiar assets.

Title: What to expect as Iran and US head for more nuclear talks in Oman
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/25/what-to-expect-as-iran-and-us-head-for-more-nuclear-talks-in-oman
Time Published: 2025-04-25T15:22:45Z

The expert-level technical talks could determine the specifics of nuclear and sanctions commitments by the two sides. Tehran, Iran – Iran and the United States are expected to hold more nuclear negotiations mediated by Oman amid efforts to shape an agreement to avoid the US attacking Iran. The Iranian delegation will arrive in Muscat on Friday evening in advance of political and, for the first time, technical talks on Saturday. Let’s take a look at what we can expect, as well as all the latest developments and context. Like the two previous rounds of talks in Italy and Oman, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and White House special envoy Steve Witkoff will lead the delegations. But the experts leading the technical talks are also crucial, as they will iron out the details and wording of any agreement. For Tehran, Araghchi’s political deputy, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, and deputy for legal and international affairs, Kazem Gharibabadi, are heading the expert-level delegation. Takht-Ravanchi is a Western-educated diplomat who led Iran’s mission to the United Nations and was ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Gharibabadi led Iran’s representative office to international organisations in Vienna and represented the Iranian judiciary internationally. He was also involved in indirect nuclear negotiations between the administrations of late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and former US President Joe Biden. The chief technical expert whom US President Donald Trump selected is Michael Anton, the newly appointed director of policy planning at the US Department of State. Anton was a speechwriter for New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice during the George W Bush administration. He also held managerial roles in the private sector, including at Citigroup and BlackRock investment firms. During the first Trump administration, he served on the National Security Council to shape government messaging. Anton’s work may be eased by the fact that he has not yet publicly adopted a stance on Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran has emphasised it will not discuss its defence capabilities or regional influence, but is ready for an agreement that ensures it won’t build a nuclear bomb, which it has repeatedly stated it doesn’t want. The technical talks aim to set the steps Tehran would take to curb its nuclear programme, and how Washington and Europe would lift their devastating sanctions, which have continued despite the US calling the talks with Iran “constructive”. Iran, for its part, wants to lift at least part of the comprehensive sanctions against its oil, banking and related industries, some of which are imposed under multiple designations. A deal could unfreeze some of Iran’s billions of dollars of export revenue that remain blocked in foreign banks by sanctions. Negotiators may also attempt to nail down waivers, orders to allow Iran to sell oil or access the global payments system. Iranian officials like President Masoud Pezeshkian have gone a step further, saying Iran would even welcome direct, large-scale investment by US companies in its market, which is brimming with financial opportunity. On the agenda will also be a cap on Iran’s uranium enrichment, which is now at up to 60 percent, a short step from the 90 percent required for a bomb. Under the terms of an earlier nuclear agreement with world powers (the JCPOA), Iran had committed to a cap of 3.67 percent enrichment, sufficient for civilian uses like power generation. However, when Trump unilaterally abandoned the JCPOA in 2018 and slapped punishing sanctions on Iran, Tehran started enriching at much higher levels and using more advanced reactors than those specified in the JCPOA. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN watchdog that will again monitor Iran’s commitments, is expected to send a team to Iran in the next few days for talks. While likely to advance the positive atmosphere surrounding the talks, Saturday’s meetings are only a step among many required for any deal. But time is of the essence, especially in the months leading up to an October deadline, when the 2015 nuclear deal’s “snapback” mechanism expires. It allows any of the signatories to initiate a process to reinstate all UN sanctions on Iran in the case of significant noncompliance, like enriching uranium at levels higher than 3.67 percent. Iran wants to avoid snapback. Iran’s Araghchi has visited China and Russia to coordinate a position, while accusing Israel of “undermining” the negotiations. Witkoff was also in Moscow on Friday to discuss the talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Araghchi has said he is ready to visit Paris, Berlin and London for direct talks with the three European JCPOA signatories. “I was ready to do it before Iran commenced its indirect dialogue with the U.S., but the E3 opted out,” he wrote on X. Meanwhile, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei signalled to his followers, using religious symbolism, this week, that they must not refuse a deal with the US. He recounted how Jafar al-Sadiq, the sixth imam revered in Shia Islam, made a deal with his enemy some 1,300 years ago, adding that any deal would not indicate the “dominance of disbelief and deceit” over Muslims.

Title: Why is Germany's next chancellor, Merz, so unpopular?
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/why-is-germanys-next-chancellor-merz-so-unpopular/a-72355492

Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz and his CDU won Germany's election, yet his personal popularity is low — and getting lower. Most Germans don't trust him, not least because of his approach to the far-right AfD. If all goes to plan, Friedrich Merz will become the Federal Republic's 10th chancellor on May 6. The two remaining hurdles appear to be formalities: On Monday, his conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will convene for a special party conference to approve the coalition contract with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). Then, a few days later, the SPD's members — some grumbling notwithstanding — are expected to approve the alliance in a vote, with the results announced on April 30. But Merz won't have long to enjoy the congratulations. Even though he won the national election in late February, the 69-year-old's personal popularity seems to be on a permanent slide: According to an April poll by research institute Forsa for Stern magazine, just 21% of respondents consider Merz trustworthy — nine percentage points lower than in August, and down three points from January. The same poll found that only 40% of respondents consider the incoming chancellor a strong leader, and 27% think Merz "knows what moves people," both of which represent nine-point falls since January. On the plus side — indeed, the only leadership criteria in which Merz scored a majority in the survey — about 60% of respondents believe that Merz "speaks understandably."

But Ursula Münch, the director of the Tutzing Academy for Political Education in Bavaria, told DW that it's not all his fault. "The circumstances are very different than they used to be," Münch said. "We have a government that has a relatively small proportion of support among voters." Merz has not picked the most fortunate moment in history: In traditional political parlance, a coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD is called a "grand coalition," because for many decades these two parties represented an overwhelming majority of Germany's voters (sometimes well over 80%). In the fragmented landscape of 2025, in which parties have splintered and splintered again over the past 20 years, the two big centrist parties can only claim to represent 45% of voters, going by the February election results. There are two obvious reasons why the perception of Merz's trustworthiness might have fallen in the past few months. In January, Merz broke his own word when he became the first CDU leader to pass a motion through the Bundestag with the support of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), whole factions of which are deemed by intelligence agencies to be a threat to Germany's democratic order. For CDU supporters, however, that seemed like a less-egregious U-turn than the one Merz performed a few weeks later: In March, the party leader agreed a debt brake reform with the SPD and the Greens that paved the way for €1 trillion ($1.14 trillion) in new loans, something he had expressly ruled out throughout the election campaign. Unsurprisingly, many of his voters felt betrayed. In a "Politbarometer" poll carried out by public broadcaster ZDF at the time, some 73% of Germans agreed that he had deceived voters — including some 44% of CDU/CSU supporters. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Merz has problems that go much further back than his recent U-turns. Surveys have shown that he is particularly unpopular among women. A Forsa survey from March 2024 found that only 9% of women aged 18 to 29 saw Merz as their preferred chancellor candidate. The incoming chancellor has been dogged with accusations of misogyny. In 1997, as is often brought up, he was one of the Bundestag members who voted against recognizing rape within marriage as a crime. In October last year, he was criticized for rejecting the idea of gender-balanced Cabinets, and this reputation was not helped by a photo released in February showing that the main negotiators of the CDU/CSU bloc were all middle-aged men. Merz is also unpopular in eastern Germany, where he regularly polled behind both the AfD's Alice Weidel and the SPD's Olaf Scholz in the run-up to the election — partly, it seems, because of his belligerent attitude toward Russia. Merz's calculation appears to be that, with right-wing populism apparently on rise around the world, what people want is straight-talking leadership. But populism does not appear to be making him more popular. In November 2018, when he first announced his candidacy to re-take the leadership of the CDU, Merz posted a tweet that seems to age worse with every month: "We can once again reach up to 40% and halve the AfD. That is possible!" he wrote. "But we must create the preconditions for it. That is our task." Almost the opposite has happened. Since Merz eventually re-took the CDU leadership in January 2022 (on his third attempt), the party's poll ratings have stayed at 24%, while the AfD's have not halved but doubled: From 11% to 24%. Germany's far-right and center-right parties are now neck and neck. But, of course, Merz has not had a chance to be chancellor yet, and Münch said he might yet be able to make good on his AfD prediction — if his government runs without the internal strife that dogged Scholz's coalition, and if it is not hit by an external crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic or escalating war in Ukraine that would requires the chancellor to take more U-turns and lose even more trust. Those are big ifs. "The best way to keep the AfD small isn't making some random announcement about big changes in refugee policy that you can't implement," Münch said. "It's concrete measures that people also notice. But that's not something that a new government can just turn around overnight. People need to be given confidence again, and that will only be possible when the economic forecast turns more positive and the refugee numbers fall." Merz was initially considered a strong candidate precisely because of his business background (he was on the board at the investment company BlackRock for several years), which was supposed to signal his economic acumen. In the past few years, however, his populist statements have increasingly been about immigration, and that hasn't helped him shake off the AfD.

Title: The Jobs That Will Fall First As AI Takes Over The Workplace

ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Artificial intelligence will soon dominate the job market. Artificial intelligence is advancing at breakneck speed. The big question is how long it will take until technology dominates the job market. You should start thinking about your own career. Will you be caught up in the change? With the U.S. navigating a $36 trillion debt, tariff tensions, and economic uncertainty, the specter of disruption from AI adds urgency for workers to protect themselves. Artificial intelligence is expected to fundamentally transform the global workforce by 2050, according to reports from PwC, McKinsey, and the World Economic Forum. Estimates suggest that up to 60% of current jobs will require significant adaptation due to AI. Automation and intelligent systems will become an integral part of the workplace. o remain competitive, invest in skills like critical thinking and digital fluency. Target AI-resilient sectors like healthcare or education. Advocate for retraining programs to reinvent your career. As macro investor and founder of the Bridgewater hedge fund Ray Dalio warns, the economy’s future hinges on balancing AI’s power with human potential. He says those who prepare now will shape the world of tomorrow. Estimates vary, but experts converge on a transformative window of 10 to 30 years for AI to reshape most jobs. A McKinsey report projects that by 2030, 30% of current U.S. jobs could be automated, with 60% significantly altered by AI tools. Goldman Sachs predicts up that to 50% of jobs could be fully automated by 2045, driven by generative AI and robotics. Additionally, Goldman Sachs previously estimated that 300 million jobs could be lost to AI, with 25% of the global labor market being automated. On the bright side, AI is least threatening to labor-intensive careers in construction, skilled trades, installation and repair, and maintenance. Dalio warns of a “great deleveraging” where AI accelerates productivity but displaces workers faster than new roles emerge, potentially within two decades. Larry Fink, the CEO of Black Rock, speaking at the Economic Club of New York this month, cautioned that AI’s impact is already visible in sectors like finance and legal services, predicting a “restructuring” of white-collar work by 2035. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, in his shareholder letter, estimates a 15-year horizon for AI to dominate repetitive tasks. The actual pace depends on technological breakthroughs, regulatory frameworks, and economic incentives. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, argues that corporate adoption of AI is accelerating due to cost pressures, potentially shrinking timelines. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent counters that AI could bolster U.S. competitiveness if paired with retraining, delaying mass displacement. By 2040, AI will likely automate or transform 50% to 60% of jobs, with full dominance (80% and higher) possible by 2050, assuming steady innovation. AI’s impact will not be uniform. Some jobs will fall quickly, while others resist longer. Jobs like data entry, scheduling, and customer service are already being overtaken by AI tools like chatbots and robotic process automation. A 2024 study by the Institute for Public Policy Research found 60% of administrative tasks are automatable. Fink notes that BlackRock is streamlining back-office functions with AI, cutting costs. These roles, requiring repetitive data processing, face near-term obsolescence as AI’s accuracy and scalability improve. Bookkeeping, financial modeling, and basic data analysis are highly vulnerable. AI platforms like Bloomberg’s Terminal enhancements can already crunch numbers and generate reports faster than humans. Dimon warns that JPMorgan is automating routine banking tasks, with 20% of analytical roles at risk by 2030. Paralegal work, contract drafting, and legal research are prime targets, as AI tools like Harvey and CoCounsel automate document analysis with 90% accuracy, according to a 2025 Stanford study. Dalio highlights AI’s ability to parse vast datasets, threatening research-heavy roles in academia and consulting. Senior legal strategy and courtroom advocacy, however, will resist longer due to human judgment needs. Graphic design, copywriting, and basic journalism face disruption from tools like DALL-E and GPT-derived platforms, which produce content at scale. A 2024 Pew Research Center that report notes 30% of media jobs could be automated by 2035. Ackman, commenting on X, predicts AI-generated content will dominate advertising soon but argues human creativity in storytelling and high art will endure longer, delaying full automation. Software development, engineering, and data science are dual-edged: AI boosts productivity but also automates routine coding and design tasks. A 2025 World Economic Forum report flags 40% of programming tasks as automatable by 2040. Bessent sees growth in AI-adjacent roles like cybersecurity, but standardized STEM work will gradually cede to algorithms. Complex innovation, like breakthrough research and development, will remain human-driven longer. Diagnostic AI and robotic surgery are advancing, but empathy-driven roles like nursing, therapy, and social work are harder to automate. A 2023 Lancet study estimates 25% of medical administrative tasks could vanish by 2035, but patient-facing care requires human trust. Teaching, especially in nuanced fields like philosophy or early education, and high-level management job rely on emotional intelligence and adaptability, which AI struggles to replicate. A 2024 OECD report suggests only 10% of teaching tasks are automatable by 2040. Dimon and Ackman stress that strategic leadership, navigating ambiguity and inspiring teams, will remain human-centric.
