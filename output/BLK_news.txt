Title: BTC ETF Options Launched: Markets Saw Record Activity

The introduction of Bitcoin ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) options marked a milestone for cryptocurrency markets. These new instruments set records in trading volumes, drawing significant interest. Binance CEO Richard Teng, leader of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, explained the effects of options trading on crypto markets, “Options trading is poised to enhance liquidity in the crypto ecosystem by providing additional tools for hedging and speculation. Institutional players, who often seek sophisticated risk-management instruments, may find options particularly appealing. By offering new mechanisms to manage exposure, options trading could attract long-term capital, increasing market stability and broadening participation.” Bitcoin ETF options are derivative contracts linked to Bitcoin ETFs, allowing users to speculate on price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. For example, if you believe Bitcoin’s price will rise, you can buy a call option. That gives you the right to purchase the ETF at a set price within a specific period. Conversely, put options enable you to profit if the price falls. This approach furthers crypto as a mainstream option. BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust launched its ETF options on Nasdaq, with more than $2 billion in notional exposure recorded on the first day. This massive volume showcases the appeal of cryptocurrency options for traders. The ETF saw $4 billion in volume, outperforming many more traditional instruments. For context, a comparable product, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), only achieved $363 million in first-day trading when it launched in 2021. The IBIT’s performance signals increasing market confidence in Bitcoin-based assets and highlights the unique role of ETFs in providing diversified exposure. Bitcoin ETF options are a significant event for several reasons: While a retail holder might be somewhat hesitant to hold Bitcoin directly, they can now infuse indirectly using an ETF and manage their risk through options. Despite the successful launch, the market faces regulatory constraints. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) imposed a 25,000-contract limit on Bitcoin ETF options. This could impact liquidity and scalability for institutions. Other instruments enjoy more lenient rules. Such discrepancies could hinder the market’s evolution compared to more established assets like gold ETFs, which operate without similar restrictions. IBITs remarkable start points to significant potential for Bitcoin ETF options in the future. Many are drawn to the ETF’s blend of crypto exposure and traditional safeguards. The continued loosening of regulatory limits could unlock greater liquidity, making this market segment even more appealing. Even with the limits, Eric Balchunas, Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst, posted, “$1.9b is unheard of for Day one” on X. While IBIT options haven’t yet reached the scale of top ETFs like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), he expects this gap to narrow as trading activity accelerates. Crypto adherents considering Bitcoin ETF options will benefit from versatility: For example, a cautious trader can purchase a put option as insurance against sudden Bitcoin price drops, mitigating potential losses. Yet, options allow users to capture the upside to Bitcoin growth without holding cryptocurrency directly. The launch of Bitcoin ETF options is a big step in crypto’s journey toward mainstream acceptance. With record-breaking activity and growing institutional participation, these instruments offer a blend of accessibility and security wrapped in a familiar type of vehicle. Bitcoin ETFs demonstrate how the crypto market is changing and support increasingly complex tactics that institutional players want. As Bitcoin continues to evolve and become a part of diversified portfolios, products like IBIT options are playing an increasing role in shaping the future of markets.

Title: Singapore's Temasek forms $7.5 billion private debt platform
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/investment/2915182/singapores-temasek-forms-7-5-billion-private-debt-platform
Time Published: 2024-12-06T08:54:00Z

SINGAPORE — Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings Pte has set up a private credit platform with an initial portfolio of about S$10 billion (US$7.5 billion) in a bid to seize more opportunities in the burgeoning asset class. The portfolio will consist of direct investments and credit funds, Temasek said in a statement Friday. The wholly owned platform will be managed by a team of around 15 in New York, London and Singapore transferred from Temasek's Credit & Hybrid Solutions team. Temasek joins other major investors that have piled into the roughly $2 trillion sector, despite growing voices of concern about risks due to interest-rate cuts and overcrowding. BlackRock Inc, the world's biggest asset manager, this month agreed to buy private credit firm HPS Investment Partners for about $12 billion. Temasek's total portfolio was valued at S$389 billion as of end-March, with just over half being in private assets. A spokesperson said that the new platform’s portfolio will be drawn from its existing investments in private equity and credit funds and other private companies — two categories that make up 55% of its S$202 billion in unlisted assets. The firm does not provide an exact breakdown of its exposure to private credit. The platform will be led by Nicolas Debetencourt, who has been Temasek's head of credit and hybrid solutions since 2016. It will be separate from Temasek-owned Seviora Group, which includes SeaTown Holdings International. The latter said in August it raised $1.3 billion for its second private credit fund, bringing its assets under management to over $2.5 billion.

Title: Why Charter Communications (CHTR) Is Among the Best Affordable Stocks to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) stands against other best affordable stocks to buy. There has been a growing debate regarding whether the economy of the United States will have a soft landing. A recent report by Vanguard titled “Beyond Landing” released on November 25 discusses the economic outlook for the year ahead. The report highlighted that global inflation has significantly decreased over the past two years, nearing the target of 2%. However, this decline has been inconsistent across different regions, with many developed markets experiencing slowdowns due to monetary policy adjustments. The United States stands out as an exception, showcasing robust economic growth and full employment despite restrictive monetary policies. READ ALSO: 10 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready To Explode and 10 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Now. The report raised critical questions about whether the US has achieved a "soft landing" or if high interest rates will eventually lead to a "hard landing." The narrative has largely focused on the Federal Reserve's ability to time rate cuts effectively to facilitate painless disinflation. Vanguard suggests that the strong growth and falling inflation in the US may be better explained by supply-side dynamics, such as increased labor productivity and a surge in available labor, rather than solely by Federal Reserve policies. Regarding the 2025 outlook, the firm anticipates that US real GDP growth may decline from around 3% to closer to 2%, influenced by potential policy risks like trade tariffs and stricter immigration regulations. Core inflation is expected to remain above 2.5% for most of 2025. The firm also predicts that interest rates will stabilize at levels higher than those seen during the 2010s, fostering better returns in cash and fixed-income markets over the next decade. However, they express caution regarding equity markets due to elevated valuations. The report highlights a tension between momentum and valuation in risk assets, suggesting that while some stocks may continue to perform well, their high valuations could pose risks if economic conditions change unexpectedly.

To compile the list of the 12 best affordable stocks to buy right now, we used the Finviz stock screener, Yahoo Finance, and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we shortlisted stocks trading below a Forward P/E of 15, as of December 4, and that are expected to experience earnings growth this year. Next, we sorted our initial list by market capitalization and cross-checked the Forward P/E of each stock from Seeking Alpha and earnings growth from Yahoo Finance. Lastly, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as per Insider Monkey’s database for Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Forward P/E Ratio: 11.72 Earnings Growth This Year: 12.98% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61 Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) is a major telecommunications company in the United States that provides a variety of communication services, primarily under its Spectrum brand. These services include high-speed internet, television cable services, mobile services, and voice services for both commercial and residential usage. While the company serves more than 37.1 million customers in 41 states around the United States, it has been facing difficulty in retaining cable TV customers. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company lost around 9.5% of its video customers as compared to the year before. Two major factors have been affecting its customer base; the first being the general trend towards rising streaming services leading customers to let go of their wired cable providers. Secondly, the ending of FCC’s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) in the second quarter resulted in around 110,000 customers leaving the company. Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) has been working towards fighting this challenge. It announced to provide its TV Select Video customers with streaming subscriptions of up to $80 per month along with the launch of a “seamless entertainment” program, which will include Disney+, Peacock, Max, ESPN+, Paramount+, BET+, ViX, AMC+, Discovery+, and Tennis Channel Plus. During the third quarter, Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) increased its revenue by 1.6% year-over-year, driven by an addition of 545,000 total mobile lines. It is also working with the local and state governments to bring Spectrum Internet to underserved communities and activated around 114,000 subsidized rural passes during the quarter. It is one of the 12 best affordable stocks to buy right now. Weitz Large Cap Equity Fund stated the following regarding Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We trimmed the Fund’s positions in Meta Platforms, S&P Global, and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR) after significant runs in the stocks. Charter posted better-than-feared quarterly results, and the stock rebounded sharply from what we viewed as deeply oversold levels. A good start, but they still have much work to do. As always, our goal with trims is to re-calibrate position sizes to better reflect the Fund’s current opportunity set.” Overall, CHTR ranks 12th on our list of best affordable stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of CHTR to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CHTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: ‘We want to leave a mark in Irish hospitality’: third generation of Fitzpatrick hoteliers takes the reins
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/12/06/we-want-to-leave-a-mark-in-irish-hospitality-third-generation-of-fitzpatrick-hoteliers-takes-the-reins/
Time Published: 2024-12-06T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Brothers Mark and Joseph Scott-Lennon bounce down the stairs into the lobby of the Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel in Killiney, both wearing broad grins and offering a welcoming handshake. They are Irish hospitality royalty, the third generation of the Fitzpatrick family to own and run the well-known 113-bedroom property, even if they don’t have the surname. The four-star hotel was opened by their grandparents Paddy and Eithne Fitzpatrick in 1971, and then run by their mother, Eithne Fitzpatrick Scott-Lennon, from 2002 until she sold the business in February to her sons, both of whom are in their 30s. Mark has been general manager of the Killiney property for the past 10 years, while Joseph cut his teeth in the industry abroad, including stints in New York, Dubai and the Caribbean. Their uncle John Fitzpatrick operates two high-profile four-star hotels in prime locations in Manhattan, New York, under the family name. “Mum wanted to retire and spend more time with Dad,” says Mark of the generational shift. “She’d been through a couple of recessions, Covid and had to weather various other storms. She’s enjoying her retirement. Joseph had come back [in late 2021] having travelled for a number of years and we were all in the business. It just felt like the right time.” On the announcement of their takeover of the business, the brothers outlined plans for a €10 million investment programme over five years under the umbrella of the newly branded Fitzpatrick Hotel Collection, to include acquisitions. In August they unveiled their first deal with the purchase of the Woodenbridge Hotel & Lodge near Arklow in Co Wicklow. The property overlooks Woodenbridge Golf Club and Aughrim river, has 69 bedrooms, a large private function room, a separate dining area that holds 50 guests and a bistro bar that can cater for 150 customers. The price wasn’t disclosed but it was a single-digit million figure, as part of the €10 million investment plan. Why did they choose Woodenbridge as their first acquisition? “The heritage of it being the oldest hotel in Ireland, family run and it had a good reputation in its community,” says Mark. “It felt right and the proximity to here in terms of shared services, travelling between the two hotels [55 minutes by car] and not wasting too much time.” Woodenbridge is a three-star property - “something we might look at in the future to bring it to four-star”. [ New generation takes the reins at Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel in KillineyOpens in new window ] It was financed with funding from Relm, a nonbank lender, and an equity investor who prefers to remain under the radar. “We will be investing in the aesthetics of it,” says Joe. “There’s planning permission for 40 rooms for the next three years. Whether we execute on that, we’re not sure. “The town of Arklow is expanding massively. A new waste-water plant means there will be planning for thousands of new houses so the catchment area becomes much larger. There’s also a greenway [from Arklow to Shillegagh] to go through the property that will bring significant tourism.” At Killiney, there have been some subtle tweaks to the business model. Padel courts (a racket sport with Mexican origins that has become hugely popular in Ireland) have been built on the grounds at a cost of €75,000 per court, while an outdoor terrace has also been added opposite the main entrance. “The padel courts are a nice new addition,” says Mark. The brothers are aiming for “comfortable elegance” at Killiney Castle, a popular venue in south Co Dublin for weddings and family celebrations, as well as corporate functions. “We pride ourselves as being a home away from home. We don’t see ourselves as being a slick, downtown hotel with not a lot of repeat visitors. It’s a huge special-occasions hotel and we’ve all manner of guests from corporates down to people staying for a couple nights a week. We try and make people feel at home and allow the staff to show their personality.” Killiney Castle has 165 employees, many of them with long service. Some 3-4 per cent of turnover every year is spent on refreshing the property, parts of which date from 1740. It also has meeting room and function facilities, a 20m swimming pool, sauna, steam room and gym. The fitness centre has 1,500 local members, providing some diversification to the hotel’s traditional income streams. Annual turnover in Killiney is €9 million-€10 million a year, with profits of €1.2 million-€1.4 million. So who’s the boss in this sibling partnership? “Ha ha, it’s a pretty flexible partnership,” says Joe. “We have different strengths. Mark is really strong on financial and I’m probably more operational. With the two properties, we work on those two together and are always on the phone to each other.” Formally, Mark is managing director of Fitzpatrick Castle while Joe has the same title in Woodenbridge. In reality they work across both sites. The brothers are tall, trim and neatly dressed. They carry the air of people who have worked in hotel management for years: softly spoken, friendly and patient with tricky guests. A new government has yet to to be formed following last week’s election but it will have a familiar look, with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael set to return. Both made promises to cut costs for SMEs and the hospitality sector in their election manifestos, with Fine Gael pledging to cut the industry’s VAT rate to 11 per cent from the current 13.5 per cent. A reduction would be welcomed by the brothers. “We are the second- or third-highest rate of VAT for tourism in Europe,” says Mark. “With rising costs, it’s harder to make a profit than in recent years, as it’s coming at you from every angle. It would be a nice pressure release valve.” If you charge €400 for someone to come stay here, they are immediately pissed off coming in the door. We want the return guest He rattles off some of the fixed costs that have to be paid before a euro is earned from a guest: the minimum wage increase will cost €105,000 in additional payroll costs; its annual rates bill is a similar figure; it pays €160,000 in insurance; spends €450,000 a year on refurbishment; and €180,000 on utilities. “These are huge costs and it’s why a coffee in the lobby is €4.20. We’d love to do better but it’s difficult.” Before the VAT rate returned to 13.5 per cent last year from the special rate of 9 per cent, the hotel sector had faced accusations of price gouging from some politicians, particularly at peak times, when dynamic pricing was employed to price rooms for events such as Taylor Swift concerts. According to the brothers, a standard double room at Fitzpatrick Castle will usually cost about €169 per night, with breakfast. It might drop to €129 on certain quiet nights. Tour groups would generally getter better rates. “For a standard room, the highest we charge would be about €280,” says Mark. “We made a decision coming out of Covid that we wanted to be in the middle of the market on pricing. If you charge €400 for someone to come stay here, they are immediately pissed off coming in the door. We want the return guest.” Of course, the Killiney hotel is about 18km from the city centre, so it’s not an obvious place for lodgings if attending a concert in Croke Park, the 3Arena or the Aviva. That said, Mark notes that the industry isn’t alone in applying dynamic pricing, where peak nights attract a higher cost compared with quieter times of the year. “Hotels get a bad shake, to be honest. There are no articles about what Ryanair is charging for the Rome Six Nations game [on St Patrick’s holiday weekend] in March.” They would also like to see the Dublin Airport passenger cap scrapped by the new Coalition. “Why are we capping the number of visitors coming to the country? It doesn’t make sense to me,” says Mark. [ Closure orders: Rodent droppings and grime found in kitchens at Fitzpatrick’s Castle Hotel, KillineyOpens in new window ] While the brothers have had a busy year, with largely positive trading, Fitzpatrick Castle made the headlines for all the wrong reasons in May, when it emerged that the Food Safety Authority had issued it with a closure order on April 15th for three kitchens at the venue after rodent droppings, grime and stagnant water were noted by inspectors. The closure applied for 36 hours and rocked the family. “It was really horrible,” says Mark. “We’ve talked about all the pride in our grandad, our mum and our uncle. You feel like you’ve massively let that down. It was an oversight; there wasn’t enough record keeping. We have put our hands up and say we were under pressure in the kitchen and didn’t keep the required records.” “You have to tackle it head on,” says Joe, noting that a “huge amount” of staff training has since taken place, and an external food safety company was hired to conduct kitchen audits. The brothers say they received a huge volume of supportive messages from people who had used the venue over many years. But there was also a significant financial impact from cancelled bookings. They “conservatively” estimate that it cost the business €250,000 in lost income. “You can understand that, particularly in the days afterwards,” says Joe. “People who had booked large dinners wanted to support us but if you have five people [in the group] who are unhappy or a committee that’s unhappy, it’s out of their control. You have to take that ... it’s human nature.” “All you can do is try and restore people’s faith in you and hopefully we have enough credit in the bank with 53 years in business that we are able to lean on that,” says Mark. Are they confident something like this will never happen again? “Yes,” says Mark, firmly. “There are learning lessons in going around with the health inspector and seeing the errors that were there. To live through those couple of days and feel the disappointment personally and the embarrassment for our family is something that you don’t forget quickly. It won’t happen again.” On the outlook, Mark says prospects for next year are “good” although the rate of growth has softened following the strong post-Covid rebound to a “more natural level, which will likely continue”. “We hope to grow our occupancy next year [from the current 72 per cent level]. All the indicators are positive at the moment,” he says. We looked at Kilkenny ... we’ll be pretty open-minded. We’d look at management contracts Back to this month and they have the busy Christmas period to navigate, with no room left at the inn for December 25th itself, with mostly Irish people happy for someone else to do the cooking and washing up. “The bedrooms will be full and we’ll have 160-170 for lunch,” says Mark. “We have a waiting list for Christmas lunch. Last year we had two or three tables that were American families, who decided they wanted to be in Ireland because of their heritage.” Regular room packages cost €550-€600, including breakfast and lunch. Just lunch is priced at €170 per person. Santa comes for breakfast and there’s a Champagne reception in the lobby before lunch with sandwiches in the evening. “It’s a day when everyone has a smile on their face,” says Joe. Ultimately, the brothers would like to have five properties in their collection, each with its own individual personality. “Nothing too stuffy. We don’t want five hotels with 100 rooms and a pool that are all the same,” says Joe. For now, the focus is on the Greater Dublin Area but that might change, Joe adds. “We looked at Kilkenny ... we’ll be pretty open-minded. We’d look at management contracts. We are young and ambitious but not stupid enough to pigeonhole ourselves. It has to excite. “Our grandad was a great inspiration for us. He had a group with five hotels. We want to emulate that, own multiple properties and leave a mark in Irish hospitality. It will be an exciting journey.” Job Managing director, Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel Age 37 Lives Blackrock, Dublin Something we might expect Did a master’s in hospitality at DIT Cathal Brugha Street from 2011 to 2013.

The Canadian government utterly despises the Canadian people. According to a report out at Fox News today, Justin Trudeau’s government just took dictatorial action to outlaw hundreds of firearms, adding them to the growing list of what the Canadian people are not allowed to have, despite a God-given right to self defense. And, in what should be a shockingly paradoxical turn of events: Leaders in Canada also said that they are working with the government of Ukraine to see how the guns can be donated to support the fight against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. For Trudeau and his progressive parliament sees it, the fight in Ukraine is all about defeating tyranny—and they arrived at the logical conclusion that defeating tyranny means arming the resisters. Conservatives would agree, surviving tyrants equates to personal gun ownership; like John Rich said, “The ability to have armed resistance to an oppressor is a prerequisite for liberty.” As you might recall, hard-left Democrat mouthpiece George Takei once unwittingly made one of the greatest arguments for the Second Amendment, or a people’s right to keep and bear arms: Crazy thought, but those 20 million AR-15s now in this country could sure arm a lot of Ukrainians. — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) June 7, 2022 Yet, they fail to recognize the unbelievable irony. Some might argue that the weapons would go to the Ukrainian military…but who fills the ranks? From NPR last month: Ukraine’s military desperately needs more boots on the ground. Draft eligibility for men spans age 25 to 60. There are reports of raids on bars and restaurants trying to catch draft dodgers. And now the government has announced plans to conscript more than 160,000 Ukrainians. Many Ukrainian citizens who started the war in the military are either injured or dead, which is why Volodomyr Zelenskyy is conscripting men as young as 25 and as old as 60, to “replenish [a] huge troop shortfall”. Trudeau is disarming his own tyrannized Canadian civilians… to arm Ukrainian civilians to fight “tyranny” — but who’s the real tyrant of this historical conflict? I’m not claiming that ex-KGB agent Vladimir Putin is some champion of freedom and God-given rights, I’m just saying that between the two sides and I had to pick? I’d definitely opt for the aggressive nationalist with zero tolerance for pedophiles and jihadism over the guy that’s selling his country to BlackRock, staunchly supports the progressive LGBTQ++ and abortion agendas, and sends young men to get devoured in the battlefield meat grinder all so he can maintain a flow of cash from Washington D.C. If they’re both bad guys, one is certainly worse—and he’s got a friend in Canada’s Trudeau. Image: DonkeyHotey, CC BY 2.0, via Flickr, unaltered.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consistent Dividend Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) stands against the other dividend stocks. Stocks that pay dividends, especially those backed by strong financial health and attractive yields, offer investors a reliable income stream, protection during market declines, and the potential for steady investment growth. This year, investors have faced a dilemma: stick with their current strategies or shift focus toward the leading technology stocks driving much of the market's gains. At the same time, many are considering how best to prepare their portfolios for a potential economic slowdown, given uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's ability to achieve a soft landing. Analysts recommend incorporating dividend stocks into portfolios to better navigate these conditions. Also read: 8 Magnificent Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy Now Savita Subramanian, an equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Corp., also advised investors to load up on dividend stocks. Here is what the analyst said: “You want to be in safe dividends — and I know this is the most boring call of all time, but sometimes boring is good. We believe that we are now in a total return world in which the contribution of dividends to total market returns could be significantly higher than it was in the last decade, a period marked by falling cash yields and lofty price returns. We advise investors to seek out companies with above-market and secure (not stretched) dividend yields.” Investors have shown growing interest in companies that consistently increase their dividends. This has pushed many firms to prioritize maintaining and growing dividends, even during economic challenges. Such efforts have paid off, as companies with a history of dividend growth have delivered strong long-term returns. A report by Cohen & Steers highlighted this trend, noting that between 2000 and 2010, dividend-paying companies outperformed non-payers by an annual margin of 620 basis points while exhibiting significantly lower risk, as measured by standard deviation. Over a 30-year span ending in 2011, the benefits of dividend-paying firms were even more evident. Among these, companies that initiated or raised dividends within the prior year consistently outperformed both other dividend payers and non-payers, achieving higher returns with reduced volatility. In addition to offering strong returns, stocks with consistent dividend payouts have become a vital source of personal income. Research from S&P Dow Jones Indices revealed that dividends have steadily grown as a share of personal income over the last four decades. Since Q4 1980, the contribution of dividends to personal income has risen from 2.68% to 7.88% in Q2 2024, while income from interest has declined from 14.58% to 7.61% during the same period. The report also highlighted the impressive growth of dividends among companies in the U.S. Dividend Growers Index. Over the past 15 years, these companies have achieved an average annual dividend growth rate of 13.71%, significantly outpacing the 2.21% average annual growth rate of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the same period. Dividend stocks are bound to regain their prominence, even though the tech sector has been dominating the spotlight lately. In view of this, we will discuss some of the best consistent dividend stocks to buy. Our Methodology: We compiled this list by examining Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database and identifying companies that have consistently increased their dividends for a minimum of 15 consecutive years. From this pool, we specifically chose stocks with dividend yields of at least 1% as of December 4. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A team of professionals prepping for a training seminar, using professional cleaning products produced by the company. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41 The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) is a California-based company that manufactures a wide range of consumer and professional products. The company has faced significant challenges in recent years. The pandemic initially boosted sales as demand for cleaning products surged, but it overestimated the long-term shift in consumer behavior toward heightened hygiene. This miscalculation left Clorox overcommitted once pandemic restrictions eased. Adding to its troubles, the company suffered a cyberattack in 2023. Despite these setbacks, it has reported that its supply chain is now fully restored, along with most of the market share lost during the disruption. Since the start of 2024, the stock has surged by nearly 3%. In fiscal Q1 2025, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) reported a 27% YoY growth in its revenue at $1.76 billion. The company marked its eighth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion, driven by solid cost-saving measures, and remains on track to fully restore its gross margin by fiscal year 2025. It also finalized the divestiture of its Better Health VMS business, building on the earlier sale of its Argentina operations. These actions align with the company's strategy to streamline its portfolio, reduce volatility, accelerate sales growth, and enhance its structural margin performance. In the first nine months of its fiscal year, The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) reported an operating cash flow of $221 million, which showed a 1,005% growth from the same period last year. The company's quarterly dividend currently comes in at $1.22 per share for a dividend yield of 2.92%, as of December 3. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) grew to 41 in Q3 2024, from 38 in the previous quarter. The collective value of these stakes is over $1.66 billion. Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall CLX ranks 9th on our list of the best consistent dividend stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of CLX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. During an appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box Europe, Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, discussed the outlook for the artificial intelligence industry and regulation in the United States with Donald Trump set to become president. When asked if there is a bit of a gold rush regarding AI, Calkins agreed. He said that AI comes with significant concerns, particularly among CEOs. This is because AI has the potential to embarrass organizations or compromise sensitive data, which creates hesitation. “We are all looking for a safe way to take the first step with AI,” he said. READ NOW: 15 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 15 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines Regarding whether companies are panicking about using AI profitably, Calkins observed a cautious approach from most businesses, while large tech firms have been investing aggressively. “It’s a calculated risk, and they should be doing it,” he said, contrasting this with the restraint shown by smaller companies. Talking about regulation, Calkins revealed that the bottom line is that AI can be somewhat dangerous if misused, which underscores the importance of regulatory frameworks. He referenced the European AI Act as an example, explaining that regulation could focus on restricting how AI is used or limiting the types of data it can access. With the Trump administration coming in, Calkins predicted a strong focus on competing with China in the tech space. He also mentioned Elon Musk’s influence on Trump, stating that Musk’s influence on the Trump administration is positive because he knows deeply about artificial intelligence. In other recent news, Sam Altman has announced a special event titled “12 Days of OpenAI”.

With OpenAI seemingly in holiday spirits, the series of reveals will be live-streamed starting December 5, continuing for the next twelve weekdays. It looks like a very merry Christmas for all the tech fans. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Title: Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) Among the Most Profitable Oil Stocks To Buy

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. ​​We recently published a list of the 8 Most Profitable Oil Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at why Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is one of the best oil stocks to invest in. One of the leading oil-producing regions, OPEC countries and its allies are expected to extend their latest round of oil production cuts for the first quarter of 2025, according to analysts. OPEC+ controls nearly half of the world’s oil production and supply. The oil governing body was planning to initiate unwinding output cuts through 2025. However, the decline in global demand and output outside OPEC could impact oil prices. “Market participants are closely watching to see if OPEC+ will focus on bolstering prices by extending production cuts, or opt to defend its share of the global crude oil market by easing those cuts,” said Satoru Yoshida, commodity analyst with Rakuten Securities. Yoshida added that the OPEC decision to cut oil supply would potentially have a short-term impact. Still, the market is anticipated to rise by the year-end following the takeover of the Trump administration. READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks. The OPEC+ countries are holding around 5.86 million barrels per day of output, which accounts for almost 5.7% of global demand. To support the oil market, the oil supply has been managed in a series of steps agreed since 2022. The OPEC members had planned an output increase of 180,000 barrels per day for January 2025. The non-OPEC+ countries are expected to boost the oil supply by almost 1.5 million barrels per day in 2025. Nevertheless, the global oil benchmark Brent Crude has mostly traded between $70 to $80 per barrel in 2024, while it hit a 2024 low below $69 in September. The global oil market is impacted by several factors including, geopolitical risks, production levels, and OPEC’s strategies. The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah could affect prices, but the new war in Syria could potentially be a new issue for oil producers. However, oil prices remain lower than expected based on inventory fundamentals. In the long term, oil price hikes above $100 are less likely to occur due to the impact of U.S. shale production over the past decade. With that, let’s take a look at where Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) ranks among the most profitable oil stocks to invest in. An oil worker wearing a hard hat and a safety vest checking an industrial oil pump. Our Methodology To compile our list of the 8 most profitable oil stocks to invest in, we scanned oil stocks through Finviz Screener using two indicators. We shortlisted the stocks with a minimum net income of $2.5 billion or more in the trailing twelve months (TTM) and a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 10%. From that list, we narrowed our choices to the 8 stocks widely held by hedge funds, as of Q3 2024. As of the third quarter, the list is ranked in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Funds Holders: 71 5-Year Net Income CAGR: 30.22% TTM Net Income: $3.68 Billion Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is a global energy company with assets primarily in the United States, the Middle East, and North Africa. The company is engaged in the exploration, production, and marketing of crude oil. Occidental Petroleum Corporation has three segments including, oil and gas, chemical and midstream, and marketing. Following the acquisition of CrownRock, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) has done well to repay its debt, having paid $4 billion in debt by Q3 2024. The company announced to repay around $4.5 billion in debt in 2024, which has been mostly achieved, driven by strong cash flows. The target of short-term debt reduction means that the company can focus on generating more cash flows and having the opportunity to invest in new projects in 2025. Occidental Petroleum Corporation’s next target is to invest in chemicals (OxyChem) and low-carbon venture businesses, both of which have solid growth potential. During Q3, the company’s OxyChem exceeded guidance with pre-tax income of $304 million. Oil & Gas segment remains the key driver for the company as it continues to grow. In Q3, the segment recorded the highest quarterly U.S. production in the company’s history. Despite the hurricanes that impacted OXY’s operations across the Gulf of Mexico, the company was able to pull off record results. This production outperformance was primarily driven by strong new well performance and higher uptime throughout the Permian Basin. In addition to that, the Gulf of Mexico also remains the top-producing unit of OXY. Overall, OXY ranks 2nd on our list of the most profitable oil stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of OXY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than OXY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The Death of Intel: When Boards Fail
URL: https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/the-death-of-intel-when-boards-fail
Time Published: 2024-12-06T00:44:23Z
Full Content:
If you haven’t heard the news, Pat Gelsinger is “retiring.” The reality is this was not a retirement but a firing of Pat. His brief stint of 1386 days was surprising because not only was he the most technically competent CEO of the last few bad apples at Intel, but he was also among the shortest. Pat has by no means been perfect, and the conference at UBS kind of showed the frustrations that the board likely had with Pat. I'd say, the one thing that has definitely come out of the way the Board is thinking about this is, they do recognize and have pushed us that, hey, we made a lot of investments from a capital perspective in foundry, and we need to start seeing some incremental ROIC on those investments. And so and that's what we're committed to do. That's going to be my -- one of my major focuses, definitely, while I'm CFO or as I'm CFO. But of course, in the interim period where I'm CEO, I'll obviously be focused on that as well. Meanwhile, Pat wanted to pursue the big, bold IFS bet, with 100s of thousands of wafers, when the reality is just getting 10s of thousands of wafers is a massive problem as is. Pat has a bit of an optimistic naivety that comes into play, and I am sure it was likely frustrating. But the reality is he’s the single best candidate for the company. More importantly than being suited for the job, he wants to do it. It’s probably one of the most challenging jobs in the world, and he’s playing for the hometown. The CEOs who got Intel into this mess were much longer than Pat and a worse fit. Meanwhile, the board let most of his predecessor’s activities go unchecked as they sped through disaster. This begs the question—what the hell was the board doing? Today, I will talk about Pat Gelsinger, the Intel board, and an example of when boards and short-termism fail. Yes, maybe splitting up the company would result in a better result for shareholders, but it would be much worse for America. I would liken firing Pat in the final hour of 18A to quitting the final round of chemotherapy in cancer treatment. Instead of seeing the long and painful process through, I think the board will let Intel die and be sold for parts. It’s the correct answer to maximize relatively short-term shareholder value, but it's a nearsighted move that the Intel board specializes in. So, what does that mean for the storied giant? Let’s dive deeper. Today, I’ll discuss the board, Pat, and where Intel is headed. There are so many clues, and I believe the saddest outcome is the most likely here. So, it’s time to talk about the board. Remember, we have to consider each board member's key attributes. For this analysis, I’ll be looking at: Semiconductor experience Other company/work experience Tenure at Intel Meet the board members and committees. Frank Yeary (Chairman of Board & Chair of M&A) Frank has been on the Intel board since 2009 and was recently named chair in 2023. He’s the managing member of Darwin Capital and a former Executive Chairman of a corporate advisory firm. He primarily has experience in M&A, 25 of which at Citigroup. He’s a deal guy and was made Chairman of the Board in 2023. He serves on the boards of Paypal and Mobileye. He was on the board of Paypal for the entire Schulman and Donahoe CEO tenure. Schulman almost ran PayPal into the ground. Although his Semiconductor experience seems limited, he was on Intel’s board for the entire fiasco and chairman of the M&A committee. Barbara Novick (Chair of Governance & Nominating) Barbara sits on the all-important nominating committee. She co-founded Blackrock in 1988 (what a flex) and has almost exclusively worked there for her entire career. She joined the board in December 2022. She has almost no semiconductor experience, is relatively new, and thus is not at fault. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey (Vice Chair of Nominating) Meet Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, who joined the board in March 2018. She has a doctorate in Medicine from Harvard and seems to be a professional board member. She sits on the GE Healthcare and Merck boards. She’s also been on the boards of GE, Better Therapeutics, Genworth Financial, Beckman Coulter, and Hess Corporation. Her career is not clear to me. She’s a professor of health at the University of Pennsylvania and CEO of one of the largest healthcare philanthropies in the US. She seems to be a professional board member, has no semiconductor experience, and has been around for some of the fiasco at Intel, at least since 2018. Gregory Smith (Chair of Audit and Finance) Meet Greg. He’s the former CFO and EVP of operations at Boeing. He’s been on the board since 2017 and was an interim CEO at Boeing during 2020. He also sits on the American Airlines board and is Chairman there. He sits on the Sierra Nevada Space Corporation board as well. He has almost no semiconductor experience and could probably be directly involved with the Boeing fiasco. He’s been on the board for the entire Intel disaster and, at one point, was interim CEO of Boeing, so he's likely not the most focused member. Dion Weisler (Chair of Talent & Comp) Dion Weisler joined the board in 2020. He also sits on the board of BHP and Thermo Fischer. He was CEO of HP from 2015 to 2019 and has a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computing. He’s relatively new and has some experience in computing but not precisely semiconductor experience. I would consider him a decently qualified candidate, and he has not been on the board for most of the Intel disaster. James Goetz James Goetz is a partner at Sequoia and joined the board in November 2019. He has previously served on networking-focused boards. He has a degree in electrical engineering, is likely semi-technical, and understands the industry. He’s relatively new but likely does not have a technical background. He’s been on the board long enough to be partially to blame. Andrea Goldsmith Andrea Goldsmith joined the board in September 2021. She is a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Princeton. She’s been a CTO and cofounded previous technology companies, including one for high-speed wireless networking. She also sits on the board of Medtronic and Crown Castle. She’s relatively new but qualified in the semiconductor space. She hasn’t been around since the disaster. Alyssa Henry Alyssa joined the board in 2020. She was Square's CEO for 9 months, from February 2023 to October 2023. She previously worked at Amazon, serves on the Confluent board, and formerly was on the Unity board (lol). She’s new and unqualified in semiconductors, and she’s had a rough career. Nine months as CEO and then out is not exactly a great look. Omar Ishrak The board's former chairman Dr. Omar stepped down in January 2023. He’s been on the board since 2017 and was chairman from 2020 to 2023. He’s the former CEO of Medtronic and retired in 2020. Before Medtronic, he worked at GE. He has no semiconductor experience, and he was around for the entire disaster and was the chairman, the man with the most power to change the board. He’s very much at fault and still on the board. Tsu-Jae King Liu Tsu-Jae King Liu joined Intel’s board in 2016. She’s an engineering professor at Berkeley and sits on the Maxlinear board. She has heavy semiconductor experience but no industry experience. She was around for the entire Intel disaster. Stacy Smith Stacy Smith has been on the board since March 2024 and fills Lip-Bu Tan’s spot. He serves as the chairman of Kioxia and chair of Autodesk. Stacy is one of the few in the industry with semiconductor experience. Sadly, it’s from within Intel. He’s a new seat, and so is not exactly to blame. The thing that does suck is his background is not exactly great. He is the Chairman of the Autodesk board, which currently has an activist investor because it’s poorly managed. He also is on the Wolfspeed Board (which is poorly managed). So he has experience, but his other experiences don’t look that great. The incoming board members are both super technically skilled, but I want to focus on the backward-looking board for this analysis. Eric Meurice and Steve Sanghi are very qualified but just got there. The board is pretty horrific. Most of the people have no technical expertise, and many of the people most at fault for getting Intel to where it is, are still on the board. Let’s take a second to acknowledge that Boeing's EVP of operations is the audit committee head and has been on the board for the entire fiasco. That’s probably the only other American giant having as bad a time as Intel! There are many Medtronic-related members, people with medical backgrounds, and what it looks like to be a professional board member. An average panel of semiconductor professionals would likely be more qualified to manage the board than the current board! The most senior board members (responsible for the disaster) are in positions of power, and the former chairman is still on the board. He should be fired. The lack of semiconductor experience is staggering. Only one person with industry and semiconductor experience isn’t a professor; they joined this year. This is a disaster board, and the blind are leading the seeing. That’s why Pat got fired; the board doesn’t know what it’s doing. Pat’s faults are real, but how could he get objective feedback from this board? What’s more, there’s an interesting and evident dynamic with the new chairman. My quick read on the situation is that the new Chairman got his job in 2023, only 2 years after Pat got the job. And when you’re an incoming chairman, you don’t sound smart by saying, “Let’s continue the strategy that will have to cut to the bone to save the patient.” You sound a lot smarter coming in with a change plan, and given Frank's M&A background, his ideas will likely always be based on M&A, so it’s time to sell the company for parts. So Frank did what deal guys do: He looked for some deals. We’ve heard the rumored Qualcomm buyout and Altera sale, so we know the board is looking for options. But how does that impact Pat? I think the key is actually in a Stratchery Interview. Check out this interview excerpt. Pat Gelsinger: Let me give maybe three different answers to that question, and these become more intellectual as we go along. The first one was I wrote a strategy document for the board of directors and I said if you want to split the company in two, then you should hire a PE kind of guy to go do that, not me. My strategy is what’s become IDM 2.0 and I described it. So if you’re hiring me, that’s the strategy and 100% of the board asked me to be the CEO and supported the strategy I laid out, of which this is one of the pieces. So the first thing was all of that discussion happened before I took the job as the CEO, so there was no debate, no contemplation, et cetera, this is it. The strategy has changed at the top, and now the chairman thinks it’s time for a “PE kind of guy” because IDM 2.0’s grand vision has sailed, and now it’s time for a deal. There are more signs as well. Intel has an activist defense campaign, meaning the board feels pressure. The Qualcomm and Altera rumors were clearly leaked, and Intel is likely looking for outside buyers. The chairman’s strategy is to sell as much as he can. What is confusing is that the recent CHIPs Act funding also has heavy sale restrictions. The vultures are circling, and Pat has said publically, “I’m not that CEO,” so the board decided enough is enough. The board has decided to gut Intel. Four former board members wrote an OpEd about splitting the company in two. The winds of change are clearly to abandon IDM 2.0, and Pat doesn’t fit into that picture. Now, here’s the thing - I do think that gutting Intel makes sense for shareholder value. Hell, selling Altera and accelerating the sale of Mobileye is an obvious move. A sum of the part thesis there probably works, as Intel’s stake in Mobileye, Altera, IFS, and Design all are worth something, and that’s probably higher than the share price today. But the reality is that outcome also sucks and feels extremely short-term oriented. I would argue that this is the right move in the short term, “value creation,” but in the long term, there couldn’t be a worse outcome for shareholders, industry partners, and, importantly, America. This is the board's failure, but I have to ask: who hires them exactly? The board isn’t qualified. Let’s contrast the above resumes with Pat’s. Pat was the CTO of Intel in its heyday, the chief architect of the i486 that saved the company, and probably one of the most decorated electrical engineers of all time. On the other hand, the board is run by a group of people with no semiconductor experience, and some are legitimate undermanagement scenarios (Boeing, Autodesk, Paypal). The board's chairman has been involved in the entire debacle since 2009. He could have voted against Pat getting the job over Brian Krzanich in 2009. But this is where things get interesting—while boards are a way to govern boards effectively, they are not perfect. The board has almost unanimous votes for “yes” despite royally screwing up the company year after year. And why is that? I will take another step deeper than the board, and that’s the investors. Most large investors vote alongside Glass Lewis and ISS recommendations, the two most prominent proxy solutions for investors. Most GL/ISS recommendations tend to vote with the board and don’t change much unless something drastic happens. If you’re a passive investor, you vote in line with the two proxy powerhouses. Intel’s board has been running on autopilot for a long time. There should have been an activist sooner. The problem (and I have talked to activists) is that the ship is tough to turn around, and the odds are you don’t make money. So, the risk reward is pretty bad, and fixing the company means treading water, not a homerun in equity returns. Ironically, most investors look at the Intel situation and rightfully say, “Wow, that is way too hard,” and that’s the problem. Why fix when you can flee to the 1000s of other company’s stock? The people who left owning the company are primarily passive investors who will vote with Glass-Lewis and ISS. The top 3 shareholders are passive, with 30% of the vote, and going down the list of shareholders, it’s clear there’s not much active ownership in the company. The ship captain (shareholders) are asleep, and most who are smart enough to care to know to avoid the neighborhood that’s Intel. Meanwhile, the board made voting recommendations yearly, and Glass Lewis and ISS went with the board. Intel’s board is being run on autopilot, and that’s how we got the list of supremely unqualified board members. This is an excellent example of how boards fail. No one raised their hand to stop the autopilot, and now the formerly greatest American semiconductor company is in shambles. They have fired the technical leader they needed to turn around Intel. There are valid reasons, as Pat’s naive optimism can feel delusional. It never felt like he never truly acknowledged the problem at hand and had visions of old Intel in his head. But he wanted to do the job, and that’s hard to say for most people. Meanwhile, the transcript out today talking about “rightsizing utilization” implies that the Board didn’t like his grand plans (overly optimistic plans) for IFS and saw the product imploding. At the same time, the CEO focused on the loss-making part of the business. But that’s the thing—the profitable part of the business is commoditized and will only worsen. I would argue that it’s a former monopoly that has become commoditized and will soon become worse. It makes sense to focus on the future, and IFS could have been one of two (TSMC) instead of a product group, which is one of many. The moonshot has always been IFS; now it’s time for plan B. And I frankly find Plan B to be uninspiring. Things are changing fast. They just appointed two new board members, the former CEO of ASML and the current interim CEO of Microchip, to the board. This is an excellent step in the right direction, but it’s like hiring a surgeon and an oncologist after the cancer has moved to stage 4. It might be too late, but it sure is the right direction. I think where Intel goes from here will be interesting. Read more below the paywall.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. ​​We recently published a list of the 8 Most Profitable Oil Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at why EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) is one of the best oil stocks to invest in. One of the leading oil-producing regions, OPEC countries and its allies are expected to extend their latest round of oil production cuts for the first quarter of 2025, according to analysts. OPEC+ controls nearly half of the world’s oil production and supply. The oil governing body was planning to initiate unwinding output cuts through 2025. However, the decline in global demand and output outside OPEC could impact oil prices. “Market participants are closely watching to see if OPEC+ will focus on bolstering prices by extending production cuts, or opt to defend its share of the global crude oil market by easing those cuts,” said Satoru Yoshida, commodity analyst with Rakuten Securities. Yoshida added that the OPEC decision to cut oil supply would potentially have a short-term impact. Still, the market is anticipated to rise by the year-end following the takeover of the Trump administration. READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks. The OPEC+ countries are holding around 5.86 million barrels per day of output, which accounts for almost 5.7% of global demand. To support the oil market, the oil supply has been managed in a series of steps agreed since 2022. The OPEC members had planned an output increase of 180,000 barrels per day for January 2025. The non-OPEC+ countries are expected to boost the oil supply by almost 1.5 million barrels per day in 2025. Nevertheless, the global oil benchmark Brent Crude has mostly traded between $70 to $80 per barrel in 2024, while it hit a 2024 low below $69 in September. The global oil market is impacted by several factors including, geopolitical risks, production levels, and OPEC’s strategies. The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah could affect prices, but the new war in Syria could potentially be a new issue for oil producers. However, oil prices remain lower than expected based on inventory fundamentals. In the long term, oil price hikes above $100 are less likely to occur due to the impact of U.S. shale production over the past decade. With that, let’s take a look at where EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) ranks among the most profitable oil stocks to invest in. An oil rig towering over an expansive horizon of land and sky. Our Methodology To compile our list of the 8 most profitable oil stocks to invest in, we scanned oil stocks through Finviz Screener using two indicators. We shortlisted the stocks with a minimum net income of $2.5 billion or more in the trailing twelve months (TTM) and a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 10%. From that list, we narrowed our choices to the 8 stocks widely held by hedge funds, as of Q3 2024. As of the third quarter, the list is ranked in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Funds Holders: 46 5-Year Net Income CAGR: 19.01% TTM Net Income: $7.14 Billion EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) is an oil and gas holding company with main operations in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford. The company is engaged in the exploration, development, production, and marketing of crude oil, natural gas liquids (NLGs), and natural gas. EOG owns around 535,000 total net acres in the Eagle Ford play and almost 160,000 net acres in the Dorado gas play. EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) is a top dividend stock. The company has raised its payout for seven consecutive years while it has a dividend CAGR of 29% over the last five years. The company has smartly improved its earnings through different fuel sources to grow its dividend. Moreover, EOG has expanded its operations organically rather than making costly acquisitions. The company’s ability to discover low-cost, high-return oil and gas resources across the U.S. has been its major advantage. The company is using technology and innovation across its oil and natural gas basins to improve capital efficiency. This helps EOG to have a solid operational performance across its multiple basins. The company is drilling further and at a historic speed, and the technology utilization is helping it to complete wells with less human capital and equipment. In addition to that, the inventory levels at EOG Resources, Inc.’s North American natural gas are closer to its five-year average throughput. The company anticipates higher demand for gas and has the opportunity to accept additional LNG projects. Since the end of 2020, EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE:EOG) has gathered over $22 billion in free cash flow and more than $25 billion in adjusted net income. This sustained growth has allowed the company to regularly increase its dividends. The company’s ability to generate high returns has also assisted in reducing its debt by 35% since 2020. EOG plans to return more than 100% of its annual free cash flow to shareholders in the near term, through share repurchases and paying special dividends. Overall, EOG ranks 8th on our list of the most profitable oil stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of EOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Funds Holders: 48 5-Year Net Income CAGR: 13.44% TTM Net Income: $7.59 Billion Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) is one of the largest independent crude oil and natural gas producers based out of Canada. The company operates through exploration and production, oil sands mining and upgrading, and midstream and refining. The company has a diverse portfolio of assets which includes major operations in Western Canada, the United Kingdom, the North Sea, offshore Africa, and various other international locations. Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) has a long-life, low-decline asset portfolio which offers greater flexibility and resilience than conventional exploration and production companies. The company’s oil sands assets require minimum reinvestment to sustain output, allowing CNQ to save capital and generate more free cash flow. Similar to Suncor Energy, CNQ has tapped into new assets in Alberta, which is one of the richest oil and gas regions in the world. The company has acquired Chevron’s 70% operator working interest in light crude oil and liquid-rich assets in the Duvernay play in Alberta. Furthermore, the company has announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire a 20% interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) from Chevron Canada Limited. This acquisition will potentially increase CNQ’s per day synthetic crude oil production by 62,500 barrels. In another deal with Chevron, the company expects to add 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to its production in 2025.

Title: Rocket Companies, Inc. (RKT): A Bull Case Theory
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-inc-rkt-bull-002332975.html
Time Published: 2024-12-06T00:23:32Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Rocket Companies, Inc. (RKT) on Substack by Unemployed Value Degen. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on RKT. Rocket Companies, Inc. (RKT)'s share was trading at $14.18 as of Dec 2nd. RKT’s trailing and forward P/E were 213.22 and 25 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. 11 Tips to Get Approved for a Mortgage Rocket Companies (RKT), formerly known as Quicken Loans, stands out as a mortgage-oriented FinTech company well-positioned to capitalize on a potential home equity loan boom. With U.S. homeowners holding an impressive $32 trillion in home equity, a shift in mortgage rates toward 5% to 5.5%—a scenario potentially catalyzed by favorable policies—could trigger significant activity in the mortgage and home equity markets. While the housing market remains cool due to high mortgage rates averaging 3.9% for existing loans, home equity loans are emerging as a more attractive option than cash-out refinancing, setting the stage for RKT to benefit substantially. Rocket's journey has not been without challenges. The company has endured a steep revenue decline from its 2022 peak of $18 billion to $4 billion over the trailing twelve months, reflecting the broader industry slowdown. Despite this, Rocket's financial resilience is notable. Its mortgage servicing portfolio, comprising 2.7 million loans, has proven a robust revenue source, covering fixed costs even in this downturn. Additionally, Rocket has maintained mostly positive EBITDA, aided by disciplined cost control and strategic investments. However, scrutiny over “adjusted” EBITDA figures has grown, especially following the SEC's mandate for greater transparency. The company’s most recent quarter revealed a sharp contrast between a $286 million adjusted EBITDA and a $481 million GAAP net loss, underscoring the need for investors to navigate complex financial reporting. Leadership changes have added another layer of uncertainty. Following the retirement of long-serving CEO Jay Farner, Rocket has cycled through two CEOs, ultimately appointing Varun Krishna, whose diverse background includes roles at Intuit, PayPal, and Microsoft. While Krishna brings valuable tech expertise, the absence of insider stock purchases by senior leadership raises questions about confidence in the company's near-term trajectory. Insider buying is limited to Director Matt Rizik, whose ties to founder and majority shareholder Dan Gilbert could signal some optimism but may not carry significant weight for external investors. Rocket’s tech-forward approach is a cornerstone of its strategy. The company reinvests heavily in FinTech development, aiming to reduce customer acquisition costs by driving mortgage originations through its app rather than brokers. This approach eliminates substantial commission expenses, enhancing long-term profitability. However, the effectiveness of this investment remains uncertain, and its unconventional corporate structure—with a tiny public float and substantial insider ownership—introduces high volatility and limits shareholder influence. Looking ahead, Rocket's ability to capture market share as conditions evolve will be critical. It currently holds 12% of the refinance market and aims to grow this to 20% by 2027. While the potential for growth is significant, near-term upside is likely capped due to the company’s size and operational headwinds. If the housing market rethaws with falling interest rates, Rocket is well-positioned for a rebound, potentially driving its share price to $20. However, its ultimate success hinges on its ability to grow market share in a more competitive, less frenzied market. For now, Rocket offers a compelling short-term opportunity with long-term potential but warrants caution for investors seeking enduring stability. Rocket Companies, Inc. (RKT) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 27 hedge fund portfolios held RKT at the end of the third quarter which was 21 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of RKT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Atkore Inc. (ATKR): A Bull Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Atkore Inc. (ATKR) on Substack by Elliot. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ATKR. Atkore Inc. (ATKR)'s stock was trading at $94.18 as of Dec 2nd. ATKR’s trailing and forward P/E were 7.42 and 11.07 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A worker on a ladder, repairing the electrical power transmission lines. Atkore’s recent earnings report has brought to light significant challenges, altering its narrative from that of an industry leader poised for growth to a company contending with competitive pressures and pricing normalization. Initially, the investment thesis centered on Atkore’s strong position in electrical raceways, its exposure to megatrends such as renewable energy and data center expansion, and a management team with a proven track record in capital allocation. However, the latest financial results painted a more difficult picture. Net sales fell 9.4% year-over-year to $788.3 million, driven by a 12% decline in average selling prices, partially offset by 3% volume growth. Adjusted EBITDA dropped 39.6% to $140.2 million, reflecting pricing headwinds and earlier operational challenges. Moreover, the company reduced its FY25 guidance, forecasting revenue of $2.9–$3.2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $475–$525 million, with EBITDA margins expected to decline further to approximately 16.4%, down from 24.1%. The increasingly competitive landscape poses a significant concern for Atkore. In the PVC market, new capacity additions and rising imports from Colombia and the Dominican Republic are placing downward pressure on prices. Similarly, in the steel conduit business, the influx of cheaper imports continues to erode margins. These dynamics have raised questions about the sustainability of Atkore’s elevated margins achieved during the pandemic. While potential government tariffs on steel imports could provide some relief, management has indicated that any impact from such measures would likely be felt in late FY25 or FY26, underscoring the uncertainty surrounding regulatory intervention as a catalyst for margin recovery. Despite these challenges, Atkore’s exposure to long-term growth trends like electrification, renewable energy, and infrastructure investment remains a key strength. These sectors are expected to drive sustained demand for the company’s products over the next decade. Additionally, Atkore has taken steps to address operational inefficiencies, resolving issues at its Hobart facility and expanding its distribution network with new regional service centers in Texas and Georgia. The company continues to generate strong free cash flow, amounting to $399 million in FY24, with 75% of it returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, reflecting its commitment to shareholder value. Investor sentiment following the earnings announcement was notable. The stock initially declined in after-hours trading, reaching a low of $74, but rebounded sharply during regular trading hours, ultimately closing at $94, above its pre-earnings level. This market reaction suggests that investors are focusing on potential tailwinds from infrastructure spending and pricing stabilization in the latter part of FY25, rather than short-term headwinds. At 7.2x FY25 EV/Adjusted EBITDA, Atkore’s stock appears to be priced in line with current challenges. However, any margin stabilization closer to 20%—instead of the projected 16.4%—could drive a significant revaluation, offering attractive returns over the medium to long term. Atkore’s outlook remains mixed. While its positioning within structural growth markets provides a solid foundation for long-term growth, the near-term risks from competitive pressures and prolonged pricing normalization cannot be ignored. The possibility of tariffs adds an element of unpredictability, but relying on external regulatory measures introduces uncertainty. Investors are likely to monitor closely for signs of pricing stabilization and improvements in competitive dynamics. If management successfully navigates these headwinds, Atkore’s long-term investment thesis remains intact, though the risk-reward profile has clearly evolved. Atkore Inc. (ATKR) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 36 hedge fund portfolios held ATKR at the end of the third quarter which was 37 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ATKR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We came across a bullish thesis on International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) on Substack by Magnus Ofstad. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on IBM. International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)'s share was trading at $229 as of Dec 3rd. IBM’s trailing and forward P/E were 33.38 and 21.23 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A close-up view of an AI-platform software code running on a monitor. IBM stands at a pivotal moment as it transitions into the era of autonomous AI agents, a shift that could redefine its position in the tech industry. While co-pilots that assist users in generating code or drafting emails have dominated AI so far, IBM’s focus on agentic AI aims to go further, enabling systems to autonomously execute tasks based on user-defined goals and real-time data. This marks a significant evolution, positioning IBM to capitalize on the next wave of AI-driven transformation. Long regarded as a mature company struggling to maintain relevance, IBM has faced challenges in balancing innovation with investor expectations. As Aswath Damodaran advises, mature firms should prioritize shareholder returns, yet the tech industry’s rapid pace makes such a strategy risky. Companies that fail to innovate risk obsolescence, and IBM has been no stranger to this dilemma. However, 2023 has brought renewed optimism, with IBM’s stock up over 40%, including dividends—a signal that investors see potential in its AI-driven resurgence. At the heart of this transformation lies IBM’s watsonx.ai platform, which integrates advanced AI orchestration and development capabilities. Watsonx.ai allows businesses to deploy domain-specific AI agents that combine generative AI, business logic, and industry expertise to enhance productivity across functions. Its orchestration tool acts as a "supervisor" for autonomous AI agents, enabling users to assign tasks via natural language, while the development toolkit supports a range of use cases from custom solutions to low-code options. This versatility positions IBM to meet diverse client needs, driving efficiency and innovation simultaneously. Despite these advancements, IBM faces a dichotomy between investor expectations and operational realities. While subscription revenues are growing at an annual rate of over 20%, overall top-line growth remains modest. AI’s transformative potential has fueled market optimism, with investors betting on significant revenue gains in the near future. Yet, IBM executives remain cautiously optimistic, acknowledging that AI’s immediate impact on financial performance is still limited. This disconnect between investor sentiment and company guidance sets the stage for a decisive period. The next few quarters will likely determine IBM’s trajectory. If AI initiatives can translate into tangible revenue growth, IBM may exceed its modest expectations, providing the momentum needed for sustained stock price appreciation. Conversely, failure to deliver on these expectations could dampen enthusiasm, leading to stagnation or even declines in the stock’s performance. International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 56 hedge fund portfolios held IBM at the end of the third quarter which was 54 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IBM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Police cover evidence with paper cups after UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson was shot as he entered the New York Hilton. Photo / AFP Large companies rushed to assess whether top employees have sufficient protection after the slaying of a US insurance executive in New York stoked broad concerns about corporate security. After Wednesday’s shooting, heads of security for groups on both sides of the Atlantic raced to share intelligence and make inquiries with specialist companies on how to shield top executives, industry participants said. The sudden focus on corporate security comes after Brian Thompson, the boss of UnitedHealth Group’s insurance unit, was fatally shot at dawn while walking alone to a corporate gathering in midtown Manhattan. New York police on Thursday were engaged in a sweeping manhunt to find the suspect in the shooting, which authorities described as a “premeditated, targeted attack”. Bullet casings found at the scene were inscribed with the words “deny”, “defend” and “depose” — in a possible allusion to a book on insurers allegedly denying claims. The attack against a high-profile American executive prompted dozens of security officials at major companies in the US and UK to convene a call on Wednesday as they sought to understand what risks they are exposed to and how to mitigate them, said Dave Komendat, a former security executive at Boeing and founder of consultancy DSKomendat Risk Management Services. “Could this happen to us? What are we not doing today that we could be doing? These were the questions chief security officers are being asked by their boards,” Komendat said. Brian Stephens, a former top Bank of America security official who now works at consultancy Teneo, added the shooting was “a very difficult wake-up call ... a lot of security leaders in these organisations are getting attention on things that they were talking about for a while”. Allied Universal, a large security company, received hundreds of calls from prospective and existing clients after Wednesday’s incident, Glen Kucera, the head of the group’s enhanced protection services, said. UnitedHealth, a blue-chip company that provides healthcare and insurance services for tens of millions of Americans, did not disclose its spending on security in regulatory filings ahead of Wednesday’s incident. Several people who have seen chief executive Andrew Witty at public events in the past year said he only had a small security detail. However, he is required to use corporate aircraft when travelling for business reasons as a security measure and was encouraged to use them on leisure trips. The Minnesota-based company did not respond to requests for comment on its security posture. Kucera said it was not unusual that Thompson, a lower-level official than Witty, would lack a security detail, adding that many executives “walk around New York unprotected”. However, personal security is adopted as default by executives in “controversial business”, such as social media, or by those with a major public profile “like Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan Chase”, he said. He added: “An event like this certainly will make companies reconsider what they do to protect their executives.” Many big businesses have significant budgets allocated to securing top executives, according to regulatory filings. Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is thought to be among the biggest recipients of security spending, with the social media group allocating more than US$9 million ($15.2m) on his personal security last year. It also provided a US$14m allowance for additional security costs “related to Mr Zuckerberg and his family’s personal security”. The company said this spending was in response to “specific threats”. Pharmaceutical groups Pfizer and Moderna boosted their security spending after the pandemic, and their senior executives are accompanied by bodyguards at all public occasions, said people familiar with the matter. Last year, Pfizer spent almost US$800,000 on security services for chief executive Albert Bourla. Moderna authorised the provision of personal and home security to certain executives in 2020. In a filing, it said the decision had been taken “in response to the increased profile of our company and our executives as we pursued the development of a vaccine against Covid-19″. Its latest regulatory filing disclosed US$1.1m in security spending for chief executive Stéphane Bancel, but none for its other executives. Protests against controversial global events, such as the war in Gaza, have frequently targeted companies, another factor that helped drive increased demand for security over the past year, according to Jason Towse, head of business services at UK security group Mitie. “As a result of the incidents in Israel, we’re providing services to senior executives in the UK who are from those areas,” he said. “People feel vulnerable.” One chief executive in the defence sector, which has also come under criticism during the war in Gaza, said he recently moved house because his address was compromised. The executive added he wanted the business to obtain a higher public profile, but that was not possible because of the risks to him of greater exposure. Last year, BlackRock more than tripled spending on home security for Larry Fink to almost US$600,000 after the chief executive of the world’s biggest asset manager became a target for “anti-woke” activists. Some US$217,000 is also spent on his bodyguards. But no recent incidents have garnered as much attention as the killing of an executive in Manhattan. Towse said businesses would now be asking: “What security procedures do we have in place to mitigate this threat?” Additional reporting by Josephine Cumbo, Ortenca Aliaj, Laura Pitel and Joshua Franklin.

Title: Bitcoin hits $100,000 mark. When is best time to buy cryptocurrency?

Now that Bitcoin has surpassed $100,000, what does that mean for the average investor? Is there still time to join Bitcoin's run or have outsiders missed the party? Considered the first successful cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was valued at zero when it was launched in 2009, according to Investopedia. The digital currency has doubled in value throughout 2024, hitting record highs as it neared $100,000 last month and surpassed the milestone for the first time on Thursday. Helping fuel the rally has been expectations that a second Trump Administration will create a conducive regulatory environment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The latest sign is Trump's selection for Securities and Exchange Commission chairman: Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly financier and a former SEC member. All this momentum probably has investors wondering whether it is time to buy into Bitcoin. "The current impressive run will inevitably attract new interest and a certain degree of FOMO (fear of missing out)," Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory firm deVere Group, told USA TODAY in an email exchange. Holiday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors. Whether you have invested in Bitcoin yet, it's safe to say "that Bitcoin is undeniably now a global mainstream, legitimate asset class, evidenced by increasing levels of institutional interest," Green said. And you can invest – even if it's just a few bucks. Here's how. Bitcoin had a rollercoaster of a day, topping $103,000, then dipping below $96,000 – and was up about 113% for the year as of late Thursday afternoon. "People who are on the fence and maybe who are having fear of missing out and think they want to jump in and start investing now … may be wondering whether now is a good time to buy, or they should wait until the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin dips," NerdWallet personal finance expert Elizabeth Ayoola told USA TODAY. Conventional wisdom is not to invest in something while it's at top value. But Bitcoin, Ayoola said, "is volatile. So we don't know how much higher it will go." Many predict Bitcoin will continue to rise. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge and a former White House director of communications, has said Bitcoin could exceed $170,000 by mid-2025, and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has predicted Bitcoin will hit $1.48 million by 2030, Fortune reported. Standard Chartered Bank expects Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, Newsweek reported. While Bitcoin has a volatile history, it has become an asset many should consider investing in, Scaramucci said Thursday on CNBC. "I do think it will be part of a long-term tactical asset allocation strategy, meaning portfolios will have one, two, three, 4% in Bitcoin," said Scaramucci, whose new book, The Little Book of Bitcoin, came out Thursday. Bitcoin just hit $100,000:How high will it go in 2025? If you are thinking of investing in Bitcoin, you could watch for an upcoming decline in its value. There were small declines in its value in the months of August, September and November. Green expects to see a "short-term sell-off" as some investors bank profits. After that "temporary pause," he expects Bitcoin to surge "to hit $120,000 in the first quarter of 2025," he said in a note to investors Thursday. "Naturally, it’s typically better to buy during a dip if it’s a genuine asset class, which Bitcoin is, rather than at the peak," Green told USA TODAY. "This is standard investment practice." Bitcoin is a slightly different type of asset in that it's digital. Its creator, a person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, designed Bitcoin to have a cap of 21 million bitcoin tokens. So far, about 19 million tokens have been released. Bitcoin is created as crypto miners use their computing work to validate bitcoin transactions on its decentralized blockchain network, essentially a digital ledger meant to prevent fraud. As the crypto miners work, they earn Bitcoin. Back in April, bitcoin underwent a "halving," which kicks in about every four years to reduce the rate at which new bitcoins are created and released into circulation. As the bitcoin cap of 21 million tokens nears, demand likely increases, according to Investopedia. If you want to learn a bit more about Bitcoin's creation, the HBO documentary "Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery," looks into the cryptocurrency's creation. There are several ways to invest in Bitcoin: "If you invest in a fund, it can make Bitcoin easier to buy and sell, and it also has better regulations," said Ayoola, adding that NerdWallet has many online resources for investors about Bitcoin. "But if you buy directly from the exchange, you have direct ownership of your coins and aren't restricted to trading on traditional stock exchanges." If you are going to invest in Bitcoin, consider it within your entire investment strategy – most finance experts recommend a diverse portfolio, with cryptocurrencies not accounting for more than 3%, Ayoola said. "But if you have a higher tolerance for risk, then you may consider speaking with a finance expert before throwing your hard-earned cash into cryptocurrencies," she said. "Bitcoin, is bullish right now, that doesn't mean that within the next week or month that your investment could not dip," Ayoola said. "So you don't want to put money in there that you're going to need in the near future." Want a Bitcoin investment strategy? Try dollar-cost averaging. Identify a set amount of money you can afford to invest in Bitcoin, then divvy that up and invest chunks at different time frames, regardless of the price. You could opt to invest even "$50 and divide that by however many months you want to stretch it out to," Ayoola said. The theory: "the cost will average out over time," Ayoola said. "That might be a way for people to still invest within their means, without putting too much in, and still basically, over time, get Bitcoin at the best price point."

With fears of World War III looming, safe haven assets and critical minerals have seen prices soar. Central banks are rushing to buy gold, defense stocks are booming, and there’s even talk about starting a national strategic Bitcoin reserve in the U.S.First of all, gold continues to assert its status as the ultimate safe-haven asset, hitting a record price of $2790 in October amid escalating uncertainty. Bitcoin, often dubbed "digital gold," is defying expectations as it continues its march past $100,000 spurred by both institutional and mainstream adoption. But the most impressive commodity rally this year comes from a little-known yet indispensable metal: antimony, a critical component in almost all military equipment. Here’s a closer look at these three soaring commodities, their drivers, and the key players benefiting from the rally. 1. Antimony: The Hottest Commodity in 2024Antimony’s meteoric rise in 2024—surging 300% year-to-date—has catapulted the obscure metal into the spotlight as global militaries race to secure critical supplies. Traditionally overlooked in commodity markets, antimony has proven indispensable in modern warfare, where it fortifies ammunition, powers explosives, and underpins advanced battlefield technologies like night vision goggles and secure communications systems.Western powers have embarked on a $100 billion spending spree to restock their armories, increasing the demand for antimony at a time when China is weaponizing this crucial commodity. While there are a few good gold-antimony plays on the market, it’s the pure-play antimony miners that stand to gain the most from this rally. Take Military Metals (CSE: MILI, OTCQB: MILIF), a relative newcomer in the space has acquired two of the top ten Antimony projects in the world and is rapidly bringing onstream a new source of antimony supply. One of their most significant acquisitions is the Trojarova project in Slovakia. This historic antimony deposit, dating back to the Cold War, holds an estimated 60,998.4 tons of antimony – a resource now valued at an astounding $2 billion. Source: Military Metals Corp. Discovered in the 1950s and explored further in the 80s and 90s, Trojarova's development was suddenly halted as the Cold War ended and antimony's strategic importance faded. But the world has changed. Geopolitical instability is the new normal, and with NATO countries spending tens of billions of dollars to re-stock their depleted arsenals, the demand for antimony is peaking.And Military Metals isn’t concentrating all of its effects on a single continent: it’s also making huge moves back in North America, in Canada’s famous WWI antimony mine in Nova Scotia. The reopening of the West Gore mine represents more than just a business venture; it’s a strategic initiative to bolster North America’s supply of antimony, a mineral deemed essential for national security. Is This The World’s Most Undervalued Antimony Pure-Play?Military Metals is valued at only $23 million right now; but its new play in Slovakia is valued at $2 billion in situ of ore at today’s Antimony spot prices. And that’s only one of its new antimony acquisitions. When you add the potential of West Gore in Nova Scotia, valuations could get even more attractive.This is not mere speculation—the U.S. government has already begun significant investments to secure domestic sources of critical minerals and is actively working to restore the production and refining of key metals, such as antimony, within North America. With billions of dollars allocated toward strengthening domestic mineral supplies, companies like Military Metals (CSE: MILI, OTCQB: MILIF) are positioned to receive substantial financial backing. 2. Central Banks Drive 2024 Gold Rush Gold’s role as a safe haven asset has been on full display in 2024, with prices surging to an all-time high of almost $2,800 per ounce—a 37% increase since the start of the year. This ascent has been driven by a number of factors, with escalating geopolitical tensions at the forefront. As the specter of an all-out global conflict looms larger than ever, the metal’s historic reputation as a safe haven has drawn both institutional and retail investors seeking shelter from the storm. Central banks have been key players in this gold rush, particularly those in emerging markets. In the first half of the year alone, they purchased a record 800 metric tons of gold. That’s 112 fully loaded Boeing 737 aircraft with the famous 400 oz. gold bars. This buying spree reflects not only a desire to hedge against the depreciation of fiat currencies but also a broader effort to reduce dependency on the U.S. dollar. One company uniquely positioned to benefit from this environment is Barrick Gold, (NYSE: GOLD) while the company reported third-quarter earnings below Wall Street estimates, primarily due to increased costs and reduced production at its Nevada operations. The company's all-in sustaining costs (AISC) for gold—a comprehensive industry metric—rose to $1,507 per ounce from $1,255 per ounce in the same quarter last year. Despite these challenges, Barrick's realized gold price increased by 29.4% to $2,494 per ounce, reflecting a surge in bullion prices following a 50-basis-point rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and heightened safe-haven demand amid Middle Eastern conflicts. Additionally, Barrick indicated that full-year production at its Loulo-Gounkoto project in Mali is expected to reach the upper end of its forecast, even as the company navigates ongoing disputes with the Malian government.Investors are now turning their attention to the monetary policy outlook following a report indicating that US business activity is growing at its fastest pace since April 2022. Swaps traders currently assign less than a 50% probability of the Fed cutting rates next month. Most banks remain optimistic, with Goldman Sachs and UBS projecting further gains in 2025. 3. Bitcoin: The Cryptocurrency King Is Back Bitcoin’s ascent in 2024 has been nothing short of spectacular, breaking past the $100,000 mark and doubling in value since the year began. Unlike traditional commodities like gold and antimony, Bitcoin’s rise is fueled by its growing integration into the global financial system and its evolving role as a hedge against economic instability. What was once dismissed as a speculative asset has matured into a cornerstone of institutional investment portfolios and a lifeline for economies grappling with failing currencies. A major driver of Bitcoin’s rally has been the advent of institutional-grade financial products. This year, investment giants such as BlackRock and Fidelity launched Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), making it easier than ever for both retail and institutional investors to gain exposure. These ETFs have brought Bitcoin into the mainstream, sparking a wave of inflows from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and individual investors seeking alternatives to fiat currencies and traditional assets.A standout beneficiary of Bitcoin’s remarkable year is MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), the software company that transformed itself into a corporate Bitcoin giant. With over 200,000 Bitcoin on its balance sheet, the company’s fortunes have risen in tandem with the cryptocurrency’s meteoric rise. This bold strategy has not only paid off for its shareholders but also positioned MicroStrategy as a bellwether for Bitcoin’s broader adoption. Its success underscores the transformational potential of Bitcoin as both an asset and an idea—one that continues to reshape the financial landscape in 2025 and beyond. MicroStrategy’s co-founder Michael Saylor revealed in a recent interview with CNBC that the company is generating $500 million daily as Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 milestone for the first time. In an interview with CNBC, Saylor detailed the company's gains, stating, "We're making $500 million a day. I'm staring at my screen and we're selling dollar bills for $3, sometimes a million times a minute." To provide context, MicroStrategy's stock surged an impressive 97% over the past month, while Bitcoin rose nearly 47%. Year-to-date, the company's stock has skyrocketed by over 515%, compared to Bitcoin's 122% gain. For comparison, Nvidia, the AI leader and the world's most valuable company by market capitalization, has seen its stock rise by nearly 195% in the same period. Saylor summed up MicroStrategy's performance, saying, "We may very well be the most profitable company in the U.S. growing the fastest right now. There's not many companies making $500 million a day.

Title: Bitcoin falls below $100,000 after reaching the milestone level for the first time

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time The price of bitcoin soared past the long-awaited $100,000 benchmark for the first time ever late Wednesday evening. By Thursday afternoon, the flagship cryptocurrency pulled back from the milestone. It was recently higher by 0.28% at $99,140.00, according to Coin Metrics, trading at the lows of Thursday’s trading following some profit taking by investors. On Wednesday night, it rose as high as $103,844.05. The move came after President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to nominate Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The appointment could fulfill Trump’s most important campaign promise to the crypto industry: to replace Gary Gensler, who has become something of a villain in crypto for the agency’s regulation-by-enforcement approach to the industry under his leadership. Trump congratulated bitcoiners in a Truth Social post Thursday morning, saying “you’re welcome” for his part in helping send bitcoin to $100,000 and that “together, we will make America great again.” It’s a day of celebration for longtime bitcoin investors, who have held on for dear life, or “HODL’d” through several of the cryptocurrency’s boom-and-bust cycles, during which government and financial institutions remained dismissive — and even hostile — toward the asset class. That’s largely because of the cryptocurrency’s anti-establishment roots. The original idea for bitcoin was proposed at the height of the 2008 financial crisis: a “peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution,” its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote in the Bitcoin Whitepaper. In recent years, however, the industry has demonstrated the value of bitcoin to much of the institutional investing world. BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco and others launched the first spot bitcoin ETFs at the beginning of this year — bitcoin’s “IPO” moment — and the growing demand for them by institutions has helped drive the price higher. In November, Rick Wurster, the incoming CEO of Charles Schwab, said the firm is preparing to enter spot crypto trading, pending regulatory changes expected in the next Trump administration. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said bitcoin is “just like gold, only it’s virtual, it’s digital,” speaking at the DealBook conference. He further clarified that “people are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store of value” and that “it’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold.” “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream,” Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, told CNBC. Bitcoin had been widely expected to reach the landmark $100,000 level since the U.S. presidential election. However, excited investors sent bitcoin closer to this mark much sooner than initially anticipated; it rose as high as $99,849.99 on Nov. 22. There is much hope that Trump will deliver on several pro-crypto initiatives in the year ahead — including the establishment of a national strategic bitcoin reserve or stockpile, no taxes on crypto transactions and opening up the crypto public equity markets with more IPOs. “Over the long term, I’m bullish,” Novogratz added. “It won’t be a straight line up, and investors should always consider taking gains off the table. But, with a pro-crypto administration about to take charge in the U.S., it’ll be hard for the rest of the world not to take notice.” Bitcoin is now up more than 133% in 2024 and 42% since the election.

Title: Microsoft Ignite Showcases Diverse Approach To Enterprise AI
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2024/12/05/microsoft-ignite-showcases-diverse-approach-to-enterprise-ai/
Time Published: 2024-12-05T22:21:53Z
Full Content:
At Microsoft Ignite, the company presented its diverse enterprise AI offerings in a three-part ... [+] portfolio. At the recent Microsoft Ignite event in Chicago, CEO Satya Nadella and his team told what I thought was a strong, cohesive story to pull together the complex strands of enterprise AI. The company still managed to make many separate announcements during the three-hour keynote — I’ll spare you the rundown of every single detail — but there was a unifying arc to it that I think positions Microsoft well as AI continues its move from hype generator to value generator in the enterprise. Let me reiterate the obvious: enterprise AI is really complex. That holds even more for a company the size of Microsoft, which came out of the gate early in 2023 with AI-driven search, quickly got into copilots (and launched Copilot) and is now helping to fundamentally change personal computing with the Copilot+ PC. That’s before we get to Microsoft Azure’s role as the second-largest cloud service provider in the world. So it only makes sense for the company to commit itself to innovating in AI in myriad ways. As he kicked things off at the event, Nadella emphasized that the company’s AI efforts aren’t pursuing tech for the sake of tech, but to achieve real outcomes for business. In part this is an answer to the recent chorus of criticisms from Wall Street that the tech industry and its enterprise customers are overbuilding AI without having solid ROI to show for it. But from everything I can see, it also reflects Microsoft’s genuine intentions with AI: to empower people and companies to do more with multi-model (and multi-modal) AI, better reasoning and planning capabilities and richer context for greater accuracy and relevance. Nadella did point out some impressive technical achievements: AI performance is doubling every six months, consumption of Azure’s AI models has also more than doubled in the last six months, Copilot is now twice as fast while delivering 3x higher user satisfaction and so on. But there was a louder drumbeat of business results, starting with an example in the opening video that described an AI use case worth $50 million annually to the customer. Later on, Nadella and other presenters went through countless AI use cases, from monitoring legal contracts to shortening customer-service calls to accelerating protein research by 5x. While I absolutely agree with the shareholder perspective that any major area of investment must justify itself with meaningful returns for the business, I’m also seeing more and more real-world examples of quantifiable — and often large — ROI on AI investments reported by disciplined, no-nonsense companies including Microsoft, Lenovo, HPE, Adobe and others. During the keynote session, Nadella introduced a three-layered diagram to explain Microsoft’s approach to AI: Copilot is one layer, Copilot-powered devices are another, and Copilot in the AI stack is the third. This organizing rubric is another reminder of Microsoft’s reach among both consumers and businesses, because ongoing improvements to Copilot ripple out across the largest installed base of productivity software in the world (as well as enterprise apps including Power BI and Dynamics ERP), plus Microsoft can introduce whole new classes of computing devices (more on that below) — and then there is all the heavy-duty enterprise IT, especially via Azure. First, Copilot. What started with essentially a chatbot is now far more than that, crucially incorporating AI agents at every step. Nadella emphasized that expanding Copilots with agents is fundamental to Microsoft’s approach; one Copilot can employ thousands of agents for all kinds of tasks — think anything that involves automation, monitoring, scheduling, planning or collaboration. More than that, agents can be allotted specific roles and permissions tied to job duties, for example by restricting access to certain systems or data to IT or HR staff. Tools within the Copilot ecosystem can ingest many different multi-modal inputs: numerical data from spreadsheets or your ERP, text or diagrams in documents, social media feeds, e-mails and on and on. The outputs can likewise be almost anything you want: graphs, draft reports, project reminders, webpages, e-mails etc. One presenter even demoed Copilot creating a customized article to help him plan a camping trip, complete with recommended products to buy — all executed onstage in the moment in response to his verbal commands. The potential productivity gains are pretty compelling. Nadella and other presenters gave examples of synthesizing thousands of reports for risk analysis (saving weeks of laborious reading and collation); helping a salesperson monitor their pipeline and find upsell opportunities; answering questions about a presentation in Teams; extracting information from SharePoint; or, as Nadella himself does, organizing e-mail and prepping for meetings. Copilot Studio can help you make your own agents, and there was a big point made that creating a basic AI agent should be as easy as creating a Word document. For more advanced functions and more technical uses, there are also Copilot dev tools and coding-friendly agent creation services. In a separate meeting for analysts, Nadella pointed out that office work hasn’t meaningfully changed since the widespread adoption of the PC; things have gotten incrementally better, of course, but haven’t changed fundamentally. He sees Copilot upending this. From the Ignite stage, he said, “Every employee will have a Copilot that knows their work, helping them unlock productivity, enhancing creativity and saving time.” Importantly, Copilot now includes analytics that will show you exactly what Copilot is doing for your top and bottom line. In the analyst meeting, Nadella also said that a big first step is agents that can connect organizational silos. During the keynote I was particularly impressed with how Copilot can now connect not only with pre-built or custom agents created using Microsoft, but also with agents from Adobe, SAP, ServiceNow, Workday and even Cohere. This would allow you to keep Copilot as your main AI assistant, but take advantage of all the other agents that may be available through your enterprise systems. Besides connecting silos, this could be a potential solution to the AI agent version of app sprawl that we’re starting to see. This is highly relevant because the enterprises and global systems integrators I have talked with are having a very tough time integrating these silos of data to be able to do all this magic, and Microsoft is offering solutions to help. Microsoft is in a position to provide compute everywhere from Azure datacenters to the edge to the device in your hand, and in many cases the company is either making the hardware itself or intimately involved with creating the hardware’s architecture. This of course includes Copilot+ PCs, for which the company has collaborated with all the big PC OEMs, Qualcomm and increasingly AMD and Intel. At Ignite, Microsoft used this opportunity to talk up the benefits of moving your enterprise to Windows 11 — and let me say that if your company is not yet making that move, that’s something you need to fix immediately. From my perspective, Microsoft has removed every single objection to making this transition. At the event, Microsoft also announced a new piece of hardware called Windows 365 Link. It’s essentially a compute puck that delivers a virtual Windows experience from the cloud. Microsoft has already offered Windows 365 for a few years; the kicker here is that there’s absolutely zero maintenance and zero management of this client, which is adminless, passwordless, cannot be turned off, stores no data and uses the cloud for literally everything. Thinking strategically, I believe that Windows 365 and hardware like the Windows 365 Link are the future of Windows over the next decade. I need to get more information about the Link product, and maybe even get hands-on with it to test the experience, because what broke virtual desktop infrastructure from scaling was the user experience. Windows 365 isn’t VDI, as it’s a managed service — but latency cannot be variable. A lot of the hyperscalers (starting with AWS) and even some of the on-prem vendors (Dell, HPE, Lenovo — each in collaboration with Nvidia) are setting up their own AI factories under one name or another. For Microsoft, it’s the Azure AI Foundry, which I believe makes a big statement about the company’s strategic approach in this area and its dedication to multi-model AI. We’re talking about more than 1,800 models, including all of the latest ones from OpenAI plus open-source models from Meta, Mistral and others. In this context, I was fascinated to hear about the 20-plus specialized vertical models Microsoft has developed with partner companies outside the tech sphere, including heavy hitters like Bayer, Rockwell and Siemens. This is a very cool phenomenon of companies we don’t consider as high-tech getting into an emergent aspect of the high-tech market to create differentiation. Bigger picture, Azure AI Foundry unifies everything enterprises need in one place, complete with all the apps and tools to put AI to work. Within it, you can evaluate models, customize them, govern them. And of course it’s built to play nicely with Microsoft’s many other services, from GitHub to Copilot Studio. You can also use it to fine-tune your models with RAG or other methods, and fine-tuning is only growing more important for enterprises as they work to get the most out of their AI investments. But the number one impediment to enterprise AI adoption and effectiveness? Data. Data is everything, but it presents a lot of sticky problems for enterprise AI. The reason is very simple. When business AI was dominated by machine learning, the data you needed came from inside the stack. You created new efficiencies in your supply chain, for example, by analyzing the structured data in your ERP and SCM systems. But in this era of generative AI, there’s way more data, it comes from everywhere, and it’s often a mess. Again, every show I attend where I talk to enterprises and integrators, they say they are struggling with integrating their data silos. The need to harness all that data to make it usable is what led Microsoft to launch Fabric, its unified data platform, last year. All of the hyperscalers have something like this, plus many customers achieve parts of this functionality from more specialized vendors such as Cloudera, Snowflake and Databricks. Even though it’s only been in GA since last year’s Ignite conference, Fabric already has 16,000 customers, including 70% of the Fortune 500. Microsoft bills it as an enterprise data platform for all use cases, bringing together operational and analytical workloads in one place. At Ignite 2024, Microsoft announced a significant advance for the platform called Fabric Databases. This brings SQL Server natively into Fabric, which I think will give enterprises an “easy button” to simplify and optimize their databases for AI use. If we take a broader view of all the experiments in enterprise AI across the two years since the AI hype cycle began, the painful truth is that many of them yielded no meaningful results — and in lots of cases maybe shouldn’t have been built in the first place. By contrast, Microsoft was very early with its investments in generative AI (especially through its support of OpenAI), and since early 2023 it has taken an aggressive but very steady approach to making AI a genuine source of value, for itself and for its customers. It’s no accident that today big names as diverse as Toyota, Blackrock and NASA are using Microsoft’s AI stack. It’s also no accident that Microsoft has done the hard, unglamorous work of building a data management platform like Fabric, which appeals mainly to IT geeks — but which could be a boon for scaling AI beyond experiments and into pervasive operational deployments. To be sure, the company has to watch out for over-hyping its capabilities, yet still be inspiring enough to motivate enterprises to move more quickly. The biggest thing Microsoft needs to address is something it didn’t at the show related to data. With 70% to 80% of enterprise data on-prem or on the edge, how does Microsoft maximize its play with AI? From my vantage point, the talking point so far is “Move the data to the public cloud.” Yet we’re 17 years into the public cloud, the on-prem stacks from VMware, RedHat and Nutanix are getting better, and I don’t see a mass public-cloud migration anytime soon. Microsoft can more directly address this. On the plus side, Microsoft seems to grasp how quickly AI is evolving, from models to apps to use cases to user experiences. And the company certainly doesn’t lack ambition. At the analyst session during Ignite, the question arose of how ubiquitous Nadella thinks Copilot could be. His answer: “How many Excel spreadsheets are there in your organization?” Based on what we saw at Ignite, I think Microsoft’s odds of achieving that are pretty good.

We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December.In this article, we are going to take a look at where McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) stands against the other stocks that can do well in December according to Jim Cramer. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared a list of ten stocks he believes will perform well in December. He pointed out that stocks that do well in November tend to continue their strong performance into the final month of the year. Cramer explained that the beginning of a new month brings attention to the previous month's performance, and with that, a significant influx of money flows into the market. This money, he said, tends to validate the moves of the largest stocks, creating a cycle where money is immediately put to work, often benefiting the Magnificent Seven. READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer Thinks These 13 Stocks Will Benefit From the New Administration Cramer also highlighted a common pattern at the end of the year, noting that people tend to make contributions to their retirement accounts when the year is going well. He emphasized that this trend is already visible in the market. When asked why a strong November often translates into a positive December, Cramer pointed to the mechanics of money management. He said that this pattern isn’t new for him, elaborating: “Before I started my Charitable Trust more than two decades ago, I ran a hedge fund. I was always looking for an edge, and one of the most reliable patterns I found is that, when December rolls around, you mimic the biggest winners of November.” Cramer recalled how, during his hedge fund days, he would focus on the top-performing stocks of November, buying heavily into those picks and letting them continue to perform through the end of the year. He remarked that this approach has proven to be successful year after year. In addition to the stocks he recommended, Cramer also noted a category of stocks tied to travel. He mentioned that travel-related industries, including airlines and cruise ships, were particularly strong in November and could continue to show promise in December. “Now, there are other[s] underneath this list, ones that involve traveling. To me, that means you could buy anything connected to travel, including the airlines… Cruise ships work… But the bottom line: If you want to know what I think could do best in the month of December, or simply what worked best in the month of November, so now you got your marching orders and I say (buy, buy, buy).” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during a recent episode of Mad Money on December 2. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A successful pharmacist in front of shelves of drugs in a community-based oncology pharmacy. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 57 Cramer called McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) a “traditional middleman” and said: “Ninth is McKesson, a traditional middleman between the drug companies and the drug stores. Now it's a Trump stock, not because Trump loves the drug distributors, but because I think it was only a matter of time before the Biden-Harris regulars went after these guys. There's a widespread belief that McKesson… got a big reprieve, rightly or wrongly.” McKesson (NYSE:MCK) provides healthcare services, including the distribution of pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and logistics, while offering technology, consulting, and support solutions for healthcare providers, biopharma companies, and patients. As seen in its recently reported second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings, the company’s largest unit by revenue is the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. It specializes in distributing drugs for the treatment of complex conditions, such as cancer. In the second quarter, sales in this segment grew by 23% to reach $85.7 billion, driven by higher prescription volumes, specialty products, and GLP-1 medications. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported a total revenue of $93.65 billion, which surpassed analysts’ expectations. This growth was primarily fueled by strong performance in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. Looking ahead, McKesson’s (NYSE:MCK) fiscal 2025 guidance anticipates a 16% to 19% increase in revenue from the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, along with a 9% to 11% rise in operating profit. Overall MCK ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks that will do well in December according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of MCK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 Cramer discussed Palantir Technologies Inc.’s (NYSE:PLTR) recently reported impressive quarter, and federal contracts and mentioned he liked its defense business. “Why don't we start with Palantir, which reported one of the best quarters of the year, fantastic growth, fantastic gross margins. That's right. growth and gross margins together, that is fabulous. And they're killing it with federal contracts, including some important work for the Pentagon. Palantir’s people… tend to win almost everything that they tender for. They also have a great commercial group, but I like their defense work. It's a, what I used to call a total up stock.” Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a prominent developer of advanced software platforms that specialize in integrating and analyzing complex data to aid in decision-making. Known for its work with government agencies, it provides essential tools for data-driven operations. Earlier this year, the company secured a significant $480 million contract from the U.S. Department of Defense to develop a prototype called the Maven Smart System. This contract, expected to be completed by May 2029, marks a further deepening of the company's relationship with the Pentagon, following a sole-bid solicitation from the Defense Department. Additionally, we talked about the company’s third-quarter earnings report in our article, Jim Cramer’s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks. Here is an excerpt from the piece: “Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) saw particularly strong growth within its government business. Revenue from government contracts rose 33% year over year to $408 million, with U.S. government revenue alone surging by 40%, reaching $320 million. This marked the highest growth the company had experienced from its largest customer in 15 quarters.” In November, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) entered into a partnership with Anthropic and Amazon Web Services to offer U.S. intelligence and defense agencies access to the Claude 3 and 3.5 model families on AWS. The integration of these Claude models within Palantir's data analytics platform will help government agencies process large amounts of complex data rapidly, identify patterns more effectively, streamline document review, and assist in making informed decisions during time-sensitive situations. Overall PLTR ranks 7th on our list of the stocks that will do well in December according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed 10 Stocks That Can Do Well in December.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) stands against the other stocks that can do well in December according to Jim Cramer. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared a list of ten stocks he believes will perform well in December. He pointed out that stocks that do well in November tend to continue their strong performance into the final month of the year. Cramer explained that the beginning of a new month brings attention to the previous month's performance, and with that, a significant influx of money flows into the market. This money, he said, tends to validate the moves of the largest stocks, creating a cycle where money is immediately put to work, often benefiting the Magnificent Seven. READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer Thinks These 13 Stocks Will Benefit From the New Administration Cramer also highlighted a common pattern at the end of the year, noting that people tend to make contributions to their retirement accounts when the year is going well. He emphasized that this trend is already visible in the market. When asked why a strong November often translates into a positive December, Cramer pointed to the mechanics of money management. He said that this pattern isn’t new for him, elaborating: “Before I started my Charitable Trust more than two decades ago, I ran a hedge fund. I was always looking for an edge, and one of the most reliable patterns I found is that, when December rolls around, you mimic the biggest winners of November.” Cramer recalled how, during his hedge fund days, he would focus on the top-performing stocks of November, buying heavily into those picks and letting them continue to perform through the end of the year. He remarked that this approach has proven to be successful year after year. In addition to the stocks he recommended, Cramer also noted a category of stocks tied to travel. He mentioned that travel-related industries, including airlines and cruise ships, were particularly strong in November and could continue to show promise in December. “Now, there are other[s] underneath this list, ones that involve traveling. To me, that means you could buy anything connected to travel, including the airlines… Cruise ships work… But the bottom line: If you want to know what I think could do best in the month of December, or simply what worked best in the month of November, so now you got your marching orders and I say (buy, buy, buy).” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during a recent episode of Mad Money on December 2. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of diverse group of people wearing the company's small leather goods. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Cramer noted that Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) has been prospering since the FTC blocked its deal to acquire Capri Holdings. “Tapestry's a rebounding apparel company and its stock is on fire thanks to Lina Khan, FTC. Yes, something you almost never hear, something positive. See, she blocked or the FTC blocked Tapestry from acquiring Capri Holdings, which owns Michael Kors. Jimmy Choo, Versace. The market hated that deal. So when Wall Street cheered, when Lina Khan shot it down, and that's allowed, well, it's allowed Tapestry to prosper. It's become an up stock.” Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) is a luxury goods company offering a wide range of branded lifestyle products, including handbags, accessories, footwear, fragrances, jewelry, home goods, and apparel. In November, it announced the termination of its merger agreement with Capri Holdings Limited. Both companies mutually agreed that halting the merger was in their best interests, given the uncertain legal outcomes and the unlikely resolution of the matter by the February 10, 2025 deadline. Joanne Crevoiserat, CEO of Tapestry (NYSE:TPR), expressed confidence in the company’s current position, stating that investing in its own stock was the best option at this time. On November 22, the company revealed that it had entered into Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) agreements to repurchase $2.0 billion worth of its common stock. These agreements are part of the company’s broader $2.8 billion share repurchase program. As part of its plan, the company expects to return over 100% of its free cash flow for fiscal 2025 to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. The final settlement of the ASR agreements is expected by the first quarter of fiscal 2026, which ends on September 27, 2025. Overall TPR ranks 9th on our list of the stocks that will do well in December according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of TPR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TPR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: OpenWeb's ousted CEO who refused to quit speaks exclusively with BI about his battle with the board
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nadav-shoval-ouster-tech-startup-openweb-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-05T19:18:01Z
Full Content:
Nadav Shoval says the conflict that culminated in his dramatic ouster from OpenWeb, the company he cofounded, started with a disagreement over a prospective BlackRock investment. In his first interview since his removal as CEO, which is still playing out in court, Shoval told Business Insider that tensions with OpenWeb's board bubbled up when the company received "several term sheets" for further investment in mid-2024, including an offer from BlackRock. OpenWeb, which provides tech to publishers to help manage the comment sections of their sites, create newsletters, and sell advertising, had previously raised $392 million and was last valued at $1.5 billion. BlackRock's capital infusion, Shoval said, would have been a "game changer," allowing the company to make its fourth acquisition and advance toward an initial public offering. But it hit a roadblock. "We brought in some of the best bankers in the world to support the process, and everybody was very excited until we started to see that one of the board members, specifically, one of the funds, was really pushing against taking this money," Shoval said, without naming the fund. Two people familiar with the discussions said some board members had concerns about the conditions tied to BlackRock's proposed investment. They asked for anonymity to discuss private conversations. Their identities are known to BI. BlackRock declined to comment. OpenWeb's big-name investors include Insight Partners and Georgian Partners. It has also attracted investments from Samsung's Next investment group, The New York Times, and the famed NYU Stern professor and podcaster Scott Galloway, who sits on the company's board. Shoval's relationship with his board of directors went rapidly downhill from there — and was thrust into public view. Tensions boiled over in mid-2024 when OpenWeb's board changed Shoval's reporting line, a move he felt breached his contract. He sent an ultimatum to reverse the change to the board, which responded by firing him. Then the company announced to staffers that Shoval would be replaced with an interim CEO, OpenWeb's former chair Tim Harvey. Shoval went on a rampage. Cut off from his business accounts, he used his personal Gmail to send a companywide email saying that he refused to step down. He also took to LinkedIn, writing: "I do not accept these actions. I will continue to fight for OpenWeb's mission and purpose alongside our team." Two former colleagues of Shoval and four people who have worked closely with him described him as a force of nature who's extremely passionate about the publishing industry. They said he could also be hotheaded and sometimes lacked the willingness to listen to others, including the board. They declined to be named to protect business relationships. Their identities are known to BI. In October, Shoval sued OpenWeb and many of its board members in a Tel Aviv, Israel, court, alleging he had been the victim of an illegal boardroom coup enacted so investors could seize control of the company. His complaint argued that he should be reinstated as CEO and able to appoint two new board directors of his choosing. The litigation is ongoing, and OpenWeb is seeking to have the case dismissed. BI has reviewed copies of some of the related court filings, translated from Hebrew to English. In denying Shoval's claim for a temporary injunction against his firing, Ariel Zimmerman, the Tel Aviv judge presiding over that case, said the chances of Shoval succeeding in his claim for reinstatement as CEO "do not appear promising, to say the least." In response to Shoval's suit, OpenWeb said in court filings that the case was a classic situation in which the board of directors had lost confidence in its CEO. OpenWeb said Shoval was trying to extract money that was not owed to him and that he had chosen to give up control of the company when he brought in investors. In a statement to BI, a spokesperson for OpenWeb said the company was excited about the steps it had taken to set it up for long-term success. "The company is moving forward without distractions, fully committed to the success of our employees, partners, and the broader community we serve," the statement said. Shoval told BI he's optimistic that "justice will come" as he continues his legal fight. He said he hoped his story would serve as a lesson to other founders to vet the funds and directors they work with closely. "No one wants to see the behind the scenes of restaurants," Shoval said. "This is what I feel like I've seen about the VC industry." Shoval said he's used to defying the odds. He often describes how he came close to death when he was 2 years old from Kawasaki disease, a rare condition that causes swelling of the blood vessels and can lead to heart problems. The disease, Shoval said, affected his motor skills, making it difficult to write. He later struggled with dyslexia and didn't finish high school. After serving in the Israel Defense Forces' elite Maglan commando unit — famed for going behind enemy lines — he moved to New York City in 2012 at the age of 21. There he cofounded OpenWeb, then known as Spot.IM, alongside two other cofounders who have since left the company. Shoval said he had noticed that publishers and content creators were "under massive threat" from Big Tech companies that wouldn't compensate them for their content. The startup sought to build tech to keep people more engaged on publishers' websites. It began with the comment section, providing community-management tools and analytics to help make online conversations less toxic. It later acquired three other companies to help publishers in other areas, like advertising and newsletter building. OpenWeb grew to more than 370 employees and says it reaches more than 150 million active monthly users across sites such as Fox News, CNN, and Yahoo. Through secondary transactions, as OpenWeb raised more capital, Shoval diluted his stake in the company, leaving him with less than 2% of issued shares and a remaining 5% in unvested options, per OpenWeb's legal filings. The sales, which OpenWeb calculated earned Shoval tens of millions of dollars, resulted in him ceding his control of the company to its investors. Shoval said in legal filings that OpenWeb's sudden decision in mid-2024 to change his reporting line was an illegal move that hindered his management capabilities and diminished his role. The board had decided he would start reporting to a newly appointed temporary executive chair, Omer Cygler, the managing partner of its investor Lion Investment. Shoval had previously reported to the entire board. Furious, he sent a letter in September to the board demanding it reverse the decision. OpenWeb's legal filing said Shoval's letter had also set out "excessive and baseless financial demands" amounting to tens of millions of dollars in exchange for his continued appointment as its chief executive. In an attachment to his letter, Shoval mapped out a scenario where he would resign as CEO and help with the search for a replacement until summer 2025, on the condition that the investors bought his shares and accelerated the vesting of his options. The board called his bluff. Board members convened an urgent telephone meeting in which the directors who attended, including those appointed by Shoval himself — Galloway and Cygler — unanimously voted for his dismissal. In the statement to BI, OpenWeb said: "OpenWeb is laser-focused on continued growth and advancing our mission to foster healthier online discourse — creating a web that is safe for users, profitable for publishers, and fair for advertisers." Looking forward, Shoval told BI he remained committed to fixing toxicity in online discourse and promoting independent journalism. Shoval didn't start the company "for a small secondary," he said, referring to money he might have taken off the table were the company to raise a further investment round. "It's not a nonprofit. I'm here also for everybody to make money, but it's not the only reason why I started the business. I'm an extremely mission-driven person. I love what we do." Shoval maintains that OpenWeb board meetings and decisions were conducted improperly and that he still has the right to appoint two new board directors of his choosing. He said that he wanted to impart a lesson to other founders: There can be some occasions in startups when "there is inherent conflict between the fund and the founder." After the huge investment boom of 2021 amid a stock-market rally and low interest rates, many startup valuations plunged in the following years, and IPO and M&A activity dramatically slowed. "When those funds are successful, they act like a cheerleader," Shoval said. "They agree with you. They follow your strategy. As soon as market conditions change — and it really, really changed — some of those people change." Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other AI stocks that will skyrocket. Some investors are heavily scrutinizing Big Tech’s AI spending. Despite these hefty expenditures, Big Tech has been enjoying solid revenues and earnings growth. Yung-Yu Ma, CIO at BMO Wealth Management, recently joined Yahoo Finance to shed light on the overall AI sector outlook heading into 2024. Ma believes that companies are increasing their investments in AI in anticipation of higher returns. He said that it makes sense that the market is less likely to be enthusiastic about this situation. Ma argued that while spending on AI is likely to increase, there is a certainty that the results will soon show, maybe by the end of 2025. He added that the market will probably see healthy earnings growth in 2025. Spending is broadly going to drive these earnings, particularly AI and its different use cases such as data centers, electricity grids, and other infrastructure. He expects an overall growth in valuation and shared that Big Tech is extremely confident and committed to pouring investment into the sector. 2024 has been quite a year for artificial intelligence. Existing startups like Anthropic and Databricks have been performing exceptionally well and transforming the industry. Anthropic is an AI safety and research company behind the OpenAI rival, Claude. On November 24, Anthropic extended its partnership with AWS, involving another $4 billion investment, bringing the total to $8 billion. The partnership also positions AWS as Anthropic’s primary cloud and training partner. Keeping up with the partnership, on December 4, Anthropic began optimizing Claude models to be able to run on AWS Trainium 2. Databricks, the data and AI company, is another AI startup crucial to the AI revolution. Some of the products by Databricks include data management solutions, data warehousing, real-time analytics, data sharing, and data governance. The company is expanding to new heights. On November 6, the company partnered with KT Corporation to boost data and AI innovation in Korea. Following the trend, on November 20, Databricks announced it saw 70% annualized growth in its French business and has launched a new office in central Paris. Our Methodology To come up with AI stocks that will skyrocket, we consulted media reports to shortlist stocks that are expected to perform exceptionally well according to analysts and strategists. After consulting 10 similar rankings on the internet we examined the Street-High upside for each stock and picked the ones with the highest upside, as of December 3, 2024. Our list is in ascending order of the street high upside as of December 3, 2024. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Street High Upside as of December 3, 2024: 76% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 107 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks third on our list of AI stocks that are expected to skyrocket. The semiconductor company makes accelerators that are capable of managing complex AI workloads. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has witnessed solid financial growth in 2024 due to the increasing demand for AI. In the third quarter of 2024, the company generated $6.8 billion in revenue, up by 18% year-over-year, thanks to strong growth in its data center and client segments. Net income also grew by a staggering 158% year-over-year. To keep up with the demand for its chips, on October 10, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) launched new processors for the next generation of commercial PCs and high-performance computing solutions for the new age of AI computing. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is expected to lead the AI and technology wave with its advanced accelerators and processors, especially in the data center segment. Analysts are bullish on the stock and the Street high price target implies an upside of 76% from current levels. Overall, AMD ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks that will skyrocket. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin at $100K: The Financial World Reacts
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/12/05/bitcoin-at-100-k-industry-reaction
Time Published: 2024-12-05T17:44:37Z

There were many crypto firsts in 2024: the first spot bitcoin ETF, the first spot ether ETF, the first time a pension fund invested in the asset class. But as the expression goes, they saved the best for last: In the waning days of the year, bitcoin (BTC) hit six digits for the first time. The cryptocurrency surged past the $100,000 mark early Thursday UTC time, mushrooming from zero value into a $2 trillion asset in a little over a decade and a half. It's a milestone that was difficult to imagine not long ago. Just two years ago, the entire cryptocurrency space was reeling from the cataclysmic implosions of FTX, Celsius and the Terra-Luna ecosystem. In the eyes of the general public, a toxic cloud hung over the whole industry. Bitcoin sank to around $15,000 and, to many mainstream observers, was wheezing in its final breaths. Now, bitcoin has soared more than 500% from the desperate days of November 2022 when Sam Bankman-Fried's empire collapsed. A big difference between prior boom-bust cycles: Wall Street is firmly participating in this year's rally. The newly approved ETFs have lured institutions. Salesforces at mighty traditional financial giants like BlackRock are hawking crypto-related products. The soon-to-be U.S. president, Donald Trump, supports bitcoin and digital assets; he even has a DeFi project. Whether it’s long-term believers, newly converted enthusiasts or even heads of state, many are taking victory laps — and longtime skeptics and permabears are coping. Here's what prominent people are saying about BTC hitting $100,000: Donald Trump, U.S. president-elect: "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy: "$100,000 Bitcoin. A milestone that represents more than price—it’s proof of adoption, belief, and a community that has carried this revolution from 0 to 100. With world leaders leaning in and a generational wealth shift underway, this is just the beginning." Peter Schiff, prominent gold and stock investor, and bitcoin skeptic: "It's ironic that bitcoin only hit $100K by buying off politicians and getting in bed with government. Without expected government intervention, this milestone never would have been hit. What couldn't be done in a free market was achieved through the cohesive power of the state." Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase: "If you bought $100 of Bitcoin when Coinbase was founded in June 2012, it would now be worth about $1,500,000. If you kept the $100 USD you'd only be able to purchase about $73 worth of goods today. Bitcoin is the best performing asset of the last 12 years, and it's still early days." Anthony Pompliano, founder & CEO of Professional Capital Management: "What an epic milestone. … Bitcoin continued to be highly volatile, it went up a lot and it went down a lot too. There’s been multiple 30%, 50% or 90% drawdowns. That type of volatility would usually scare off many people. … It was one of the greatest selfless acts that I can think of." Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador He posted a screenshot of El Salvador’s bitcoin portfolio, then the "it ain’t much but it’s honest work" meme after Elon Musk called it impressive. Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group: "We believe the Fed Chair’s comparison of bitcoin to gold is a significant development as it introduces another level of credibility to bitcoin as a major asset in global markets. The fact that gold is still about 10 times larger than bitcoin should offer additional insight into how much more room there is for bitcoin to grow from current levels." Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares: "Bitcoin has made unbelievable strides this year. Amid the launch of the spot bitcoin ETFs, election of a pro-crypto administration — and specifically Trump’s recent appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC chair — proposals for crypto-friendly legislation, and accelerated growth in the crypto ecosystem, BTC has more than doubled — all in a span of 10 months. This momentum has pushed bitcoin past $100K. This milestone is likely to attract a new wave of investors, as many who had been sitting on the sidelines watching bitcoin's ascent are now reengaging with digital assets, spurred by this historic breakthrough." James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk: "2024 has been an inflection point for bitcoin. We have witnessed the most successful ETF launch of all time. MicroStrategy issued the largest at-the-market offering in history of $21 billion. We are seeing more publicly traded companies issuing convertible notes in order to buy bitcoin. When bitcoin first broke $10,000, I thought the financial capital markets would change forever. I was slightly too early on my call. But $100,000 most definitely does." Financial Times AlphaVille: "Nevertheless, with bitcoin’s price recently crossing $100,000, a significant number of commenters seem to feel they deserve an apology in light of our longstanding cynicism, so here it is: We’re sorry if at any moment in the past 14 years you chose based on our coverage not to buy a thing whose number has gone up. It’s nice when your number goes up. And we’re sorry if you misunderstood our crypto cynicism to be a declaration of support for tradfi, because we hate that too." Allen Farrington, author/venture capitalist: "In purely psychological terms, there is now no rational price between this and gold parity." Preston Byrne, managing partner, Byrne & Storm: "Price is an indicator, not an objective. This has always been the case and whilst adding another digit to the price is psychologically and symbolically significant, it is no more relevant to my day-to-day than 90k, 70k, or 50k before it. A rising price tells me [that] the wider markets are starting to also believe in longtime crypto believers' thesis in a fairly significant way. ... The expected end of the U.S. war on crypto business in the new year has driven a wave of optimism among current industry participants and new entrants. Regulatory normalization of crypto products in the world's largest economy was always a necessary prerequisite for widespread global adoption, and now it looks like we're going to get it." Des Dickerson, CEO of Thundr Games: "Bitcoin hitting $100K is a milestone that represents more than just a price point — it’s a testament to its growing adoption and resilience. It underscores the incredible potential of Bitcoin as the foundation for a new era of global, seamless digital payments. It's a signal to the world that we're building on solid, transformative technology that's here to stay. It's a perfect storm of hopium and recognition of Bitcoin's value prop as the most secure, decentralized, and globally accessible digital asset. How far will the price go next year? It's Bitcoin, so we should expect some bumps along the way. I am setting my sights on $200k, on our way to $1M!" Andy Baehr, managing director, CoinDesk Indices:"It was a champagne moment, served at a champagne hour. At 9:33pm and 41 seconds, the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index read 100,000. By 10:08:42, the current ATH of 103,633.70 was hit. Among blockchain assets, bitcoin stands to gain the least from improvements to regulatory pavement. It has futures, ETFs, and options. It is available widely in the United States and around the world. Bitcoin's adoption momentum, bolstered by a thoughtful mention by Fed Chair Powell and a news cycle rich with positive sentiment, helps more investors feel like they've waited long enough; it's time to get involved. Optimism about better, more dedicated regulatory agencies and support have been a boon for "future-of-finance" blockchain assets."The CoinDesk 20 Index has doubled since the day before Election Day, outpacing bitcoin. In fact, 10 of the 20 constituents in CoinDesk 20 have doubled (or better) this year. What lies ahead? Bitcoin becomes a staple, and its narrative will get detached from other blockchain assets, as improvements to everyday activities, financial and otherwise, proliferate. Ethereum's status as a clearinghouse for the most important on-chain activity will take better shape. CoinDesk 20 names, current and future, will take advantage of improved support and regulatory clarity."Nolan Bauerle, host of the "American Bitcoin Citadels" podcast: "A movement that started with a few people inspired enough or pissed off enough to give up their free weekends and evenings has taken over earth in a few short years. Bitcoin continues to be the most interesting story on the planet, and now it’s headed for the moon." Cory Klippsten, Swan Bitcoin:"The surge past $100,000 underscores bitcoin's resilience and its role as a digital store of value."

Title: What Year-End CFO Moves Say About Finance Role’s Evolution
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/cfo/2024/what-year-end-cfo-moves-say-about-finance-roles-evolution/
Time Published: 2024-12-05T17:02:33Z
Full Content:
The year end is often a time for chief financial officer (CFO) appointments, resignations or transitions. And as the 2024 fiscal year draws to a close, a flurry of C-suite announcements from companies including Miracle-Gro, Humana, Chipotle, Dollar Tree and more reveal an intriguing narrative: the CFO role is undergoing a seismic shift and evolving beyond financial stewardship to encompass strategy, digital transformation and risk management at the highest levels. Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung, who has been at the company since 2002, was originally planning on retiring after nearly 25 years but decided to stay on “indefinitely” as president of strategy, finance and supply chain after the company switched CEOs. Healthcare company Humana announced Tuesday (Dec. 3) that it was bringing on as its new CFO the former finance chief of Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), an infrastructure fund manager recently acquired by BlackRock. Humana’s new CFO, Celeste Mellet, was formerly CFO, MD and EVP at investment banking advisory firm Evercore; CFO at Fannie Mae; and before that was global treasurer at Morgan Stanley. Both Dollar Tree and Miracle-Gro have announced CFO departures and started executive searches. In the meantime, Dollar Tree’s COO has taken on CFO responsibilities, while Miracle-Gro has elevated its current treasurer. The common thread linking the various executive announcements is their underlying message that the CFO role is no longer confined to the back office. It is a front-line position, driving strategy, innovation and resilience in an era of constant change. Read also: Why There Are No Sacred Cows for Today’s CFOs Historically, CFOs were perceived as gatekeepers of financial discipline, focused primarily on balance sheets, compliance and cost management. While that all remains true today, the CFO is increasingly seen as a strategic partner to the CEO, a change agent driving organizational growth. “Different industries have seen transition happen at different paces, but 20 years ago, the CFO was the senior accountant at the company … but now, the majority of companies need their CFO to be a strategic leader and trusted adviser, a crucial player in shaping the direction of the organization,” XiFin CFO Erik Sallee told PYMNTS in June for the series “A Day In The Life of a CFO.” One of the most significant drivers of this shift is digital transformation. With technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time data analytics reshaping industries, CFOs are expected to spearhead initiatives that integrate these tools into financial operations. According to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “60 CFOs Can’t Be Wrong … AI Can Help Accounts Payable,” technology has reshaped CFOs’ responsibilities, necessitating a broader skill set and a more strategic approach to financial management. Creating data visualizations or reports is the most common use of generative AI, according to findings detailed in a separate PYMNTS Intelligence report, “Most CFOs See Limited ROI From GenAI, but Boost Its Investment.” “The finance department exists to fuel decision frameworks,” ABBYY CFO Brian Unruh told PYMNTS in June, noting that the “timely, accurate and multidimensional data” finance teams provide daily to the rest of the business is ultimately what helps define and accelerate internal growth drivers.

To remain competitive and drive growth in 2025, CFOs are focusing on several key areas, including cybersecurity, digital transformation, compliance and risk management, talent development and upskilling, real-time liquidity and working capital management, and cross-border expansion. As PYMNTS Intelligence found in the first two editions of “The 2024 Certainty Project” has found, the top four concerns of today’s middle-market financial leaders and their businesses include: Companies grappling with slowing growth, supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are looking to CFOs to ensure financial stability while fostering innovation. As we enter 2025, the CFO role will likely continue to expand in scope and influence as corporate and enterprise operations demand dynamic and adaptable financial leadership. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: From $94,870 to $103,679: Assessing the factors behind Bitcoin’s rally

Bitcoin’s $100K milestone seems to bedriven by institutional interest, crypto-friendly policies, and growing global support. Bitcoin [BTC] has crossed the $100,000 mark, achieving a major milestone for the crypto market. The price surge has drawn attention to factors such as institutional interest, regulatory developments, and global support for digital assets. Below, we explore the main reasons behind this rise. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $102,570 with a 24-hour trading volume of $141.34 billion. Over the last 24 hours, its price has risen by 6.19%, while a 6.78% gain has been recorded over the past week. Bitcoin’s market capitalization now stands at $2.01 trillion, based on a circulating supply of 20 million BTC. Bitcoin’s trading range over the last day spanned between $94,870 and $103,679, marking a new all-time high of $103,679. BTC exchange reserves have also been falling, indicating reduced selling activity. This suggests that investors are choosing to hold their assets. Source: CryptoQuant Institutional interest has played a significant role in Bitcoin’s rise past $100,000. A major contributor has been BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which recently crossed $50 billion in assets under management. Notably, IBIT achieved this milestone within just 228 days, far faster than traditional ETFs, some of which have taken years to reach similar levels. The rapid growth of IBIT illustrates the increasing demand for Bitcoin among institutional investors. BlackRock has also integrated Bitcoin exposure into its traditional funds, further demonstrating its faith in the cryptocurrency’s potential. As more institutions adopt BTC as a key financial asset, the market continues to show strength. Regulatory changes have further fueled Bitcoin’s momentum. On 4th December, Donald Trump announced Paul Atkins, known for his crypto-friendly stance, as the new SEC chair, replacing Gary Gensler. This move has created optimism within the crypto industry, as it raises expectations for clearer and more supportive regulations in the U.S. Additionally, Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed strong support for BTC during the Russia Calling Investment Forum. Putin noted, “These tools will develop one way or another because everyone will strive to reduce costs and increase reliability.” His remarks highlight the global recognition of Bitcoin as a transformative financial technology, contributing to the ongoing rally. The derivatives market has also experienced significant growth alongside Bitcoin’s price surge. Open interest in Bitcoin futures has climbed to $64.70 billion, indicating heightened activity among both institutional and retail traders, according to an AMBCrypto report. The rise in open interest suggests continued confidence in BTC, even as profit-taking may occur in the short term. This uptick in futures trading activity reinforces BTC’s position as a sought-after asset in both spot and derivatives markets.

Title: Ethereum Breaks Barriers, Targets $6K Amid Record ETF, TVL Activity

The increasing prominence of Ethereum is once again in the spotlight, as recent data indicates a substantial inflow of funds into Ether-based ETFs. These products have experienced a remarkable $133 million in net inflows over the course of seven days, indicating a significant increase in institutional interest and investor confidence. Ethereum isn’t just optimistic about exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts are making big price predictions for the cryptocurrency right now. This is because its network is being used more and more in decentralized finance (DeFi) and technical signs are showing that it will continue to rise. On December 3, the total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETFs was $133 million, and net inflows continued for 7 consecutive days. The net inflow of Fidelity ETF FETH was $73.7239 million, and the net inflow of BlackRock ETF ETHA was $65.2929 million. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg pic.twitter.com/HOPyOqmXGU — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 4, 2024 A lot of people are interested in the Ethereum spot ETFs. Over $714 million has come into the top altcoin in the last week, showing that both institutional and individual buyers are becoming more interested in it. The ETHA ETF from BlackRock and the FETH ETF from Fidelity are leading the charge. Together, they have brought in about $140 million. The support of major financial institutions is boosting activity and demonstrating that Ethereum is becoming popular in the conventional finance sector. This flood of capital demonstrates how Ethereum may unite centralized and decentralized financial systems. According to market experts, the level of support for Ethereum stands at $3,300. This is a safe place for investors to start because it strikes a good balance between risk and return. Analysts propose a mid-term price target of $6,000 in case Ethereum continues its ascent. Some analysts even anticipate a long-term price of $10,000. If #Ethereum $ETH experiences a pullback, keep an eye on the $3,300 support level — a potential buying opportunity. Our mid-term target remains $6,000, with a long-term outlook of $10,000! https://t.co/mQQOjrKBFM pic.twitter.com/OEvDIV0ZpD — Ali (@ali_charts) December 4, 2024 Meanwhile, CoinCodex predicts that the price of Ethereum will have gone up by 6.17 percent to $4,052.34 by January 4, 2025. With an Extreme Greed number of 78 on the Fear & Greed Index and other technical indicators, it’s clear that people are planning to buy. Extreme confidence in the market suggests significant growth potential, but it is still important to take into account the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency investments. In the past 7 days, #Etherum‘s TVL increased by $4.81B, #Base‘s TVL increased by $302.02M, and #Hyperliquid‘s TVL increased by $290.21M. Funds have flowed into #Ethereum, #Base, and #Hyperliquid. pic.twitter.com/YDZOGU0Esc — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 2, 2024 The dominance of Ethereum in the DeFi market was cemented when its total value locked surged by $4.81 billion within a period of one week. However, while other networks, including Base and Hyperliquid, had their TVLs rise, Ethereum is still viewed as the leader. Ethereum’s trajectory appears optimistic due to its robust ETF inflows, bullish technical outlook, and increasing TVL. Although it may require some time to accumulate $6,000, the narrative is compelling due to institutional support and steady momentum. Ethereum remains a fundamental component of the cryptocurrency market, combining investor confidence with innovation.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Waymo outsources fleet operations to African fintech Moove in Phoenix and Miami | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Waymo is partnering with Moove, an African mobility fintech that offers vehicle financing to gig workers, to handle fleet management operations for its robotaxi service in Phoenix and, soon, Miami. The partnership marks several firsts. It will signal Waymo’s entry into Miami. And it’s also the first time Moove will enter the U.S. market and work with autonomous vehicles. Today, Moove operates in various cities across Africa, the Middle East, India, and the U.K., and it has raised over $400 million from backers like Mubadala Investment Company and BlackRock. Earlier this year, Moove scored $100 million in a round led by Uber. The partnership with Moove signals that Waymo is keen to outsource more of the commercial side of the business and focus on developing the self-driving technology as a driver-as-a-service model. Waymo has been offering a commercial ride-hail service in Phoenix for years, and began offering its robotaxis on the Uber app there alongside Waymo’s native app, Waymo One, in October 2023. In early 2025, Waymo’s robotaxis will be exclusively available on the Uber app in Austin and Atlanta. Waymo co-CEO Tekendra Mawakana wrote in a recent LinkedIn post that as the company scales autonomous vehicle operations, it intends to create an ecosystem of industry partners, including “charging infrastructure partners; fleet maintenance partners; full-electric automotive partners like Jaguar Land Rover…” Moove falls under the fleet maintenance partner umbrella. Waymo will still operate Waymo One in Phoenix and Miami, but Moove will take over fleet operations in Phoenix and help the company build out the necessary charging infrastructure and depots for its fleet of Jaguar I-Paces in Miami. Waymo intends to transition operations to Moove in Phoenix early next year. In Miami, Waymo will start small-scale testing in early 2025, with a goal to launch a fully driverless commercial ride-hail service in the city in 2026. As the company tests, Moove will build out the infrastructure Waymo needs to deploy in Miami, per a Waymo spokesperson. Waymo’s playbook for expanding into a new city usually begins by manually testing a small fleet, mainly for mapping purposes, before testing autonomously with a safety operator behind the wheel. Then Waymo pulls the driver out and invites employees to ride before launching commercially. Waymo would not share which neighborhoods the company is targeting in Miami, nor what the financial arrangement with Moove would be. A spokesperson for Waymo told TechCrunch that Moove’s global fleet management experience made the startup an attractive partner for handling robotaxi fleet operations. As established, the partnership marks a significant milestone for Moove: expanding its services to include autonomous vehicles and establishing its presence in the U.S., a process the startup began nearly four months ago, per job listings on LinkedIn. Since its launch, Moove has been an exclusive fleet partner for Uber, purchasing vehicles and leasing them to drivers who pay weekly until they own the cars. In 2022, Moove, talking up plans to become the largest EV partner on Uber’s platform in London, said it’ll deploy up to 10,000 EVs and over 6,000 charging points by the end of 2025, aligning with Uber’s goal of becoming an all-electric platform in the U.K. capital next year. While Moove may be looking to secure new partnerships (such as this one with Waymo) globally to diversify from Uber, its experience working with the mobility giant this long will prove helpful. It certainly helped secure Waymo as a customer. That said, for Moove, managing operations for Waymo’s autonomous fleets in two major U.S. cities is a big step. It expands the company’s global reach into the biggest leagues – as it diversifies its offerings beyond Africa and emerging markets – and showcases its ability to handle complex fleet operations in various markets. Moove has other plans in the U.S., based on job listings on the company’s website. There are several listings for a potential service in Los Angeles, although the nature of that is unclear. A Waymo spokesperson said the two don’t have plans to launch together in LA, where Waymo currently runs a commercial service. When asked, a Moove spokesperson confirmed that the company is recruiting for its burgeoning U.S. team, but declined to provide specifics.

Title: Stock market today: Indexes trade mixed after hitting records as traders eye upcoming jobs report

Indexes traded mixed on Thursday after hitting record highs on Wednesday as traders turned their focus to the upcoming November jobs report. The data, due from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday morning, is expected to show the US economy added 215,000 new hires, according to data from FactSet. That's a sharp uptick from October's reading of just 12,000 new hires, with the stark downtick resulting from the month's hurricanes and labor strikes. "We recommend market participants tread carefully," Bank of America analysts said in a note earlier this week. "We suggest taking the first print with a pinch of salt and putting more faith in the first and second revision when more data has been collected." Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Wednesday: Bitcoin hit an important milestone on Wednesday night, crossing the key $100,000 threshold for the first time. The latest uptick came after President-elect Donald Trump appointed crypto advocate Paul Atkins to replace Gary Gensler to run the Securities and Exchange Commission. The coin is now trading at $102,350.90 as of Thursday morning, while crypto-linked stocks like MicroStrategy and Coinbase have also benefited from the latest move higher. The currency has skyrocketed in recent weeks amid expectations that Trump will loosen regulations and pursue policies to boost the market, such as establishing a national bitcoin reserve. Traders also continue to digest comments from members of the Federal Reserve, including Chair Jerome Powell, who spoke at The New York Times' DealBook Summit on Wednesday. Relevant to bitcoin, the Fed chief said that while the token isn't a competitor to the dollar, it's a digital version of gold. Powell also appeared optimistic about the strength of the US economy, pointing to healthy growth but increased caution when it comes to cutting interest rates. "Growth is definitely stronger than we thought, and inflation is coming a little higher," Powell said, adding, "The good news is that we can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral."

Title: How Citi CMO Alex Craddock Balances AI’s Power With Human Creativity

Your favorite social media marketing event is headed to NYC this May 12–14! Register for Social Media Week before December 16 to lock in early-bird rates and save 50% on your pass. Citibank’s chief marketing and content officer Alex Craddock believes that despite the power of AI, the magic of great creative still comes from humans. Craddock joined Citi in May from BlackRock after a restructure to oversee its marketing department and set a new strategy for original content and thought leadership, ADWEEK reported at the time. He said that Citi is in the early stages of using AI and is focused on three things: content creation, personalization, and validation. Speaking at the AI Trailblazers Growth Summit alongside former LendingTree chief marketing officer Shiv Singh, Craddock shared how AI is reshaping marketing and content strategies at Citi. Craddock believes that the biggest benefits of generative AI specifically are the impact, and therefore revenue, it can drive. The banking company recently rolled out new AI tools to its employees across eight countries including the U.S., U.K., and Canada. For example, Citi Assist aids in searching internal bank policies while Citi Stylus can summarize, compare, or search documents simultaneously. Citi is also using user data from its apps to personalize messaging. Craddock said the company is in the beginning stages of incorporating AI into its workflow. However, his goal is to continue using the tech to create more effective marketing and anticipate the needs of Citi’s customers in real time. “Yes, you’ve got regulations, rules, and guidelines that you have to work with, [but] they shouldn’t stop you [from] thinking with a vision,” he said. When it comes to concerns about AI’s threat to jobs, Craddock said people should think of it as an “enabler” and consider how it can be used to assist with mundane tasks, like writing emails. “It should not replace the human touch,” he said. “The magic is in humans, and I think if we forget that, we will end up in a dreadful world where bots are speaking to us all the time.” In early October, Citi shared its gen AI strategy, including how it is training its workforce to use the technology and how it is using it to provide better experiences for its clients. OpenAI Finds Its First CMO In Ex-Coinbase Marketing Chief Kate Rouch Cydney Lee is ADWEEK's advertising news reporter based out of NYC. Prior to joining in Aug. 2024, she was editorial assistant at Billboard. Her work has also appeared in W Magazine, GRAMMY.com, Pigeons & Planes, Vulture and more.

Title: What next for Bitcoin after bursting $100k barrier?

Time Published: 2024-12-05T13:15:13Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin's price has blasted through the much-anticipated threshold of $100,000, raising questions about how much higher it could go - and whether it can shake off its notorious volatility. The world's largest cryptocurrency rose to around $103,400 shortly after 04:00 GMT on Thursday, before falling slightly. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, described it as a "magic moment" for the cryptocurrency and said it had a "clear link" to Donald Trump's election victory. Trump took to social media to celebrate the milestone, posting "congratulations Bitcoiners" and "you're welcome!" The president-elect had previously pledged to make the US the "crypto capital" and "Bitcoin superpower" of the world, helping to push Bitcoin's price higher once he was elected president. It broke through the $100k barrier after Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to run the Wall Street regulator. Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head, Gary Gensler. "Clearly there is anticipation that the new administration is going to be somewhat more favourable to crypto than the old administration was," said Andrew O'Neill, digital assets expert at S&P Global. "So for the price of Bitcoin, I think that that's what's driven the trend so far [and it will] likely continue into the new year," he added. However, Bitcoin has a history of sharp falls as well as rapid rises - and some analysts have cautioned that is unlikely to change. “A lot of people have got rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn’t suitable for everyone," said Mr Coatsworth. "It’s volatile, unpredictable and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment." During the US presidential election campaign, Trump sought to appeal to cryptocurrency investors with a promise to sack Gary Gensler - chair of the US financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) - on "day one" of his presidency. Mr Gensler's approach to the cryptocurrency sector has been decidedly less friendly than Trump's. He told the BBC in September it was an industry “rife with fraud and hucksters and grifters”. Under his leadership, the SEC brought a record 46 crypto-related enforcement actions against firms in 2023. Mr Gensler said in November he would step down on 20 January - the day of Trump's inauguration. The choice of Paul Atkins to replace him at the helm of the SEC has been welcomed by crypto advocates. Mike Novogratz, founder and chief executive of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital said he hoped the "clearer regulatory path" would now accelerate the digital currency ecosystem's entry into "the financial mainstream." Bitcoin has seen fewer drastic falls in value during 2024 than in previous years. In 2022 its price fell sharply below $16,000 after crypto exchange FTX collapsed into bankruptcy. A number of key events besides Trump's victory in the election have helped boost investor confidence that its value will keep going up. The SEC approved several spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) allowing giant investment firms like Blackrock, Fidelity and Grayscale to sell products based on the price of Bitcoin. Some of these products have seen billions of dollars in cash inflows. But its potential to suddenly plummet in value serves as a reminder that it is not like orthodox currencies - and investors have no protection or recourse if they lose money on Bitcoin investments. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told BBC News that fear of missing out (FOMO) among younger people will see Bitcoin's price continue to rise. But she added that while this could spark a rise in other cryptocurrencies, many of the younger investors investing in meme coins are losing money. Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of another cryptocurrency - Tezos - also had a word of caution for those tempted to invest in Bitcoin. "These are markets that tend to move on momentum so you need to be extraordinarily cautious with it," she told the BBC. Haliey Welch's "Hawk" digital coin shot up in price then lost 95% of its value just hours after it launched. James Howells believes the hard drive is now worth about £600m since the recent Bitcoin surge. Ann Jensen, from Salisbury, was tricked into investing by a deepfake of Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Justin Sun described Maurizio Cattelan's infamous 2019 work as "much better than other bananas". New evidence suggests the YouTuber promoted investments without revealing his financial interest in them. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

Mr Gensler's approach to the cryptocurrency sector has been decidedly less friendly than Trump's. He told the BBC in September it was an industry “rife with fraud and hucksters and grifters”. Under his leadership, the SEC brought a record 46 crypto-related enforcement actions against firms in 2023. Mr Gensler said in November he would step down on 20 January - the day of Trump's inauguration. The choice of Paul Atkins to replace him at the helm of the SEC has been welcomed by crypto advocates. Mike Novogratz, founder and chief executive of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital said he hoped the "clearer regulatory path" would now accelerate the digital currency ecosystem's entry into "the financial mainstream." Bitcoin has seen fewer drastic falls in value during 2024 than in previous years. In 2022 its price fell sharply below $16,000 after crypto exchange FTX collapsed into bankruptcy. A number of key events besides Trump's victory in the election have helped boost investor confidence that its value will keep going up. The SEC approved several spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) allowing giant investment firms like Blackrock, Fidelity and Grayscale to sell products based on the price of Bitcoin. Some of these products have seen billions of dollars in cash inflows. But its potential to suddenly plummet in value serves as a reminder that it is not like orthodox currencies - and investors have no protection or recourse if they lose money on Bitcoin investments. Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told BBC News that fear of missing out (FOMO) among younger people will see Bitcoin's price continue to rise. But she added that while this could spark a rise in other cryptocurrencies, many of the younger investors investing in meme coins are losing money. Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of another cryptocurrency - Tezos - also had a word of caution for those tempted to invest in Bitcoin. "These are markets that tend to move on momentum so you need to be extraordinarily cautious with it," she told the BBC. Haliey Welch's "Hawk" digital coin shot up in price then lost 95% of its value just hours after it launched. James Howells believes the hard drive is now worth about £600m since the recent Bitcoin surge. Ann Jensen, from Salisbury, was tricked into investing by a deepfake of Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Justin Sun described Maurizio Cattelan's infamous 2019 work as "much better than other bananas". New evidence suggests the YouTuber promoted investments without revealing his financial interest in them. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

More Info Private equity firm EQT is creating a new energy transition fund, EQT Transition Infrastructure, which will look to invest in clean energy companies in Europe, North America, and the Asia Pacific. The first acquisition of the Sweden-headquartered private equity firm with $259 billion (246 billion euros) in total assets under management is Germany’s ju:niz Energy, a battery energy storage system developer and operator, EQT said on Thursday. The German company will be the EQT Transition Infrastructure strategy’s first highly thematic investment, which will be acquired with capital from EQT’s balance sheet, the firm said without disclosing the value of the deal. EQT Transition Infrastructure plans to provide capital, as well as industrial, technological, and sustainability expertise to scale businesses and support the transition to a decarbonized and climate-resilient future, the private equity firm said. The EQT Transition Infrastructure strategy will be led by Jan Vesely, Head of EQT Transition Infrastructure in New York, and Asis Echaniz, Head of EQT Transition Infrastructure Europe in Madrid. The strategy will be chaired by Francesco Starace, who joined EQT in 2023 from his position as CEO of Italian electric utility giant Enel. “EQT Transition Infrastructure will help emerging but proven solutions and businesses scale, to create the next generation of sustainable energy infrastructure,” said Jan Vesely, Partner and Head of EQT Transition Infrastructure. Earlier this week, the EQT Active Core Infrastructure fund and global investor GIC announced an agreement to buy a majority stake in Calisen Group, the UK’s leading independent smart metering company, from funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a part of BlackRock, the Infrastructure business of Goldman Sachs Alternatives and Mubadala Investment Company. “Long-term investment by EQT and GIC to support Calisen’s growth ambitions in the UK smart meter market and abroad, as well as expansion into adjacent sectors,” EQT said upon announcing the deal.

Title: BlackRock sees 'exceptionalism' powering US stocks higher in 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks have led the equity market in recent years and strategists at BlackRock's Investment Institute don't see that narrative changing in 2025. "Currently, across all the scenarios in the outlook, the platform is gravitating towards the US corporate strength scenario, which is another way of calling for US exceptionalism," BlackRock Investment Institute chief investment strategist Wei Li said during a media roundtable on Wednesday. Li cited stronger earnings growth seen in the US this year and the expectation that earnings growth will continue to broaden outside of the "Magnificent Seven" names that have powered the stock market higher over the last two years. This view has been a common refrain from Wall Street firms offering bullish outlooks for 2025 over the last month. "Earnings is almost everything when it comes to longer-term equity returns," Li said, adding the strongest revisions for next year have come from the US and Japan, where BlackRock is also overweight equities. BlackRock's call for continued US exceptionalism has been echoed at other firms on Wall Street during 2025 outlook roundtables. On Monday, Bank of America senior US economist Aditya Bhave told Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal the US economy will likely outperform in 2025. In October, the team at JPMorgan Asset Management said it believes the US's role in the rise of artificial intelligence will help its economy outpace others around the world. The firm said this will result in US equities continuing to dominate globally over the next decade. "We expect extraordinary earnings growth will settle at still-elevated levels for mega-cap tech while reaccelerating in other areas of the market," JPMorgan Asset Management's chief global strategist David Kelly wrote in his team's 2025 outlook. "This broadening, coupled with resilient economic fundamentals, policy tailwinds, and secular trends, should support a more inclusive rally in the year ahead." On a sector level, BlackRock noted Wednesday that Utilities (XLU) should be set to benefit from the broadening of the AI trade due to the increased power demands to operate AI servers. All of this puts BlackRock further overweight US equities headed into 2025 and betting on a "pro-risk" environment in 2025. "In an environment where there's spirit animals that are poignant, it's not clear exactly who's going to take away the punch bowl in this environment," said Jean Boivin, the head of BlackRock's Investment Institute. "We're constructive, we're pro-risk ... But I think we need to be mindful of excessive risk-taking at some point as well down the road." And while BlackRock doesn't issue an S&P 500 target for the year ahead, its bullish stance on US stocks has been reflected across Wall Street's 2025 outlooks. Strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance have issued 2025 year-end S&P 500 targets as low as 6,400 and as high as 7,007. The index closed at 6,086 on Wednesday, meaning the low-end 6,400 target represents about a 5% upside in the benchmark index over the next year. Meanwhile, the high end of forecasts is calling for another 15% gain in the S&P 500 over the next 12 months. Strategists believe another strong year of growth in both the US economy and corporate earnings, combined with a pro-business administration in the White House and Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, will propel stocks higher. In a Tuesday research note detailing his Street-high 7,007 S&P 500 target, Wells Fargo equity strategist Christopher Harvey wrote the data "did not support" a weak or negative year for the S&P 500. "2025 is likely to be a solid-to-strong year," Harvey wrote. Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer.

Title: W.Va. Rep.-Elect Riley Moore: How GOP Can Deliver for Working-Class Families

Send an email to Bradley. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election marked the first time in 20 years that a Republican presidential candidate won the popular vote in addition to the electoral vote. The commanding fashion of Trump’s historic comeback was further proof that the political realignment Trump started nearly a decade ago—transforming the Republican Party into the party of the working class—is being further cemented. And it’s no surprise, then, that victors of down-ballot elections are increasingly representing the coalition that now makes up the Republican base. Rep.-elect Riley Moore, R-W.Va., is a perfect example, and he joined me on this week’s episode of “The Signal Sitdown.” Now that the GOP has rebranded itself as a multiracial, working-class party, our conversation particularly focuses on how Republican lawmakers in Washington, D.C., can deliver for their supporters. “People don’t want to monkey around,” Moore said of the incoming Congress. “They don’t want to horse around on any of this stuff. They just want to go. President Trump has got the mandate, and President Trump has got the vision, and that’s what we’re going to work on.” This vision is not only important to the president, but to the American people who, for the first time since President Grover Cleveland in the late 1800s, have sent a former president back to the White House. Though Moore will be a freshman member of Congress, he has experience delivering policy victories for a constituency made of working-class voters as the state treasurer of West Virginia. The Mountain State, which voted 70% for Trump in the 2024 election, is a good encapsulation of the ethos that propelled Trump to the forefront of American politics. His Make America Great Again movement has always felt more like West Virginia than Texas, and for good reason, as West Virginians have shouldered much of the burden for Washington’s globalist immigration, trade, and foreign policies. “We’re tired of being lied to, and we’re tired of being taken advantage of,” Moore said of West Virginians. “I mean, we mine the coal that forged the steel that built the buildings, that built the airplanes and the warships and the rails and everything else that built the United States.” “And what do we get?” Moore added. “An opioid crisis and destroying our coal industry.” For too long, Washington, D.C., has had a “total disregard for the feelings of the people of West Virginia,” Moore told me. “It dates back to [the North American Free Trade Agreement], particularly in my district—northern panhandle specifically would be a great example—where we do a lot of steel manufacturing,” Moore explained. “We had tens of thousands of people working in that industry, obviously. That’s not the case now due to globalization and offshoring and dumping of cheap steel, which, for some reason, people of this town have allowed to happen for successive decades. Letting China into the World Trade Organization, most favored nation status, and all these other things piled on top of it that has really crushed a state like West Virginia.” Fast-forward to President Barack Obama’s tenure, and the destruction accelerated. Due to what Moore calls “environmental extremism,” West Virginia “lost 30,000 coal mining jobs in just a few years due to the Obama administration.” The continued leftward lurch of economic policies from both public and private institutions has only compounded some of West Virginia’s woes. “We had coal operators coming to me saying, ‘I’m losing access to capital. We can’t finance our stuff. No one will bank with us. We’re getting debanked all over the place,’” said Moore, adding: “This [environmental, social, and governance] movement that was destroying West Virginia.” West Virginia responded by chasing out as many ESG-promoting financial institutions from the state as possible, particularly by divesting West Virginia taxpayer dollars from companies like BlackRock. “The working class in West Virginia was like, ‘Yes! Thank you for doing this: fighting for our jobs, fighting for our economy, fighting for our way of life,’” Moore said. Moore said he’s bringing the same mindset with him to Washington. “They did not elect me to get on television and tell them that they’re getting screwed. They already know that. They know that. They elected me to do something about it.” Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences. By supporting The Daily Signal Institute today, you will help cut through the liberal media spin and provide honest, thorough, and responsible reporting to millions of Americans and decisionmakers in Washington.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against other AI stocks that will skyrocket. Some investors are heavily scrutinizing Big Tech’s AI spending. Despite these hefty expenditures, Big Tech has been enjoying solid revenues and earnings growth. Yung-Yu Ma, CIO at BMO Wealth Management, recently joined Yahoo Finance to shed light on the overall AI sector outlook heading into 2024. Ma believes that companies are increasing their investments in AI in anticipation of higher returns. He said that it makes sense that the market is less likely to be enthusiastic about this situation. Ma argued that while spending on AI is likely to increase, there is a certainty that the results will soon show, maybe by the end of 2025. He added that the market will probably see healthy earnings growth in 2025. Spending is broadly going to drive these earnings, particularly AI and its different use cases such as data centers, electricity grids, and other infrastructure. He expects an overall growth in valuation and shared that Big Tech is extremely confident and committed to pouring investment into the sector. 2024 has been quite a year for artificial intelligence. Existing startups like Anthropic and Databricks have been performing exceptionally well and transforming the industry. Anthropic is an AI safety and research company behind the OpenAI rival, Claude. On November 24, Anthropic extended its partnership with AWS, involving another $4 billion investment, bringing the total to $8 billion. The partnership also positions AWS as Anthropic’s primary cloud and training partner. Keeping up with the partnership, on December 4, Anthropic began optimizing Claude models to be able to run on AWS Trainium 2. Databricks, the data and AI company, is another AI startup crucial to the AI revolution. Some of the products by Databricks include data management solutions, data warehousing, real-time analytics, data sharing, and data governance. The company is expanding to new heights. On November 6, the company partnered with KT Corporation to boost data and AI innovation in Korea. Following the trend, on November 20, Databricks announced it saw 70% annualized growth in its French business and has launched a new office in central Paris. To come up with AI stocks that will skyrocket, we consulted media reports to shortlist stocks that are expected to perform exceptionally well according to analysts and strategists. After consulting 10 similar rankings on the internet we examined the Street-High upside for each stock and picked the ones with the highest upside, as of December 3, 2024. Our list is in ascending order of the street high upside as of December 3, 2024. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Street High Upside as of December 3, 2024: 42% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) is a semiconductor company that ranks sixth on our list of AI stocks that are expected to skyrocket. The company is one of the largest suppliers of microprocessor technology, graphics and camera technology, and physical IP and processor implementation solutions. Since 1990, the company has shipped more than 300 billion chips, positioning it as a leader in the industry. On the AI front, the company is making significant advances. In the fiscal second quarter of 2025, Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) partnered with Meta to optimize Llama and other models for generative artificial intelligence from the data center to edge devices. On October 23, the company announced a collaboration with MediaTek and Vivo to help enhance AI experiences on smartphones. In addition to that, the incidence of AI is significantly increasing the demand for ARM’s energy-efficient compute platform. Overall, Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) holds dominance in the AI market, especially for mobile, cloud compute, automotive, and IoT use cases. Some of its leading partners in the AI industry include SoundHound AI, Weetaq, Embedl, ENERZAi, and Doulos, to name a few. Analysts are also favoring the stock and their high price target of 200 represents an upside of 42% from current levels. Overall, ARM ranks 6th on our list of AI stocks that will skyrocket. While we acknowledge the potential of ARM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.
