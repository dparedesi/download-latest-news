The DeFi sector is “substantially undervalued,” Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said Tuesday in an interview with Decrypt, arguing Layer-1 blockchains such as Sui and Aptos “definitely tick the boxes” for courting institutional investors. The executive said he sees a case for issuers launching SUI and Apots ETFs in the U.S.—a development that may bring renewed investments into those altcoins. The asset manager already filed for an Aptos ETF earlier this month, but it has no such application pending for a SUI-based fund. Still, projects led by ex-Meta stablecoin team members “definitely tick the boxes of serious team, serious technology [and] technological differentiation,” Hougan said, referencing a few of Bitwise’s requirements for the assets held by its funds. “I wouldn't put 100% of my portfolio in Sui, but I wouldn't put [in] zero,” he said. Bitwise is one of several investment firms that has filed a flurry of crypto ETF applications with federal regulators in the U.S. The spate of applications comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission— the crypto industry’s main regulator in the U.S.—has signaled its willingness to adopt a more crypto-friendly stance under recently elected President Donald Trump. Issuers have requested to roll out funds tracking the prices of a wide range of cryptos, from meme coins such as Bonk and Dogecoin to larger market-cap assets like XRP and Solana to Official Trump. Bitwise itself is in the process of securing approval for single-asset ETFs that track XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin—tokens that are especially popular with DeFi proponents. Although those altcoins are down from the highs they brushed last January, Hougan believes changing tides in the U.S. regulatory climate could boost DeFi tokens and the projects to which they are linked. “The market hasn’t come to grips with the fact that these tokens could change their tokenomics and be money printing machines in a new regulatory environment,” Hougan said, citing Uniswap, Ondo, and Aave as projects with enormous potential for growth. That new regulatory climate may allow utility tokens with value drivers to thrive, he said, eliminating a major issue in DeFi—the pervasiveness of “squishy governance tokens.” According to Hougan, that potential for growth could render DeFi tokens and other non-blue chip assets well-suited for inclusion in ETF wrappers in the future. Increasing access to crypto-based ETFs Although Bitwise is hardly “throwing spaghetti against the wall” when it picks assets to include in its funds, Hougan noted that Bitwise and other issuers aims to file for new ETFs often. “In ETF land, not in crypto land, this is normal,” Hougan said. “ETF issuers file for a lot of ETFs all the time. Although Hougan declined to specify which assets Bitwise's future funds could track, he said the firm is looking at tokens linked to “high quality” and “interesting” projects with “real potential” to track in single-asset ETFs. The asset manager also listens to its clients when deciding which assets it should offer in ETF wrappers. The firm’s idea, he said, is to give its clients ample options for where to put their money. “I don't want to be paternalistic about what they should access,” Hougan said. The executive said it’s reasonable for issuers to provide clients exposure to all kinds of assets—even those they might not highly recommend—as long as those assets aren’t linked to rug pulls or scams. “Blackrock offers a lot of bond funds, but I wouldn't buy a 30-year Treasury fund if you held a gun to my head,” Hougan said. He added, “I'm not going to tell anyone to invest in Doge, but I could tell someone if you're going to invest in Doge, it's probably cheaper to do in the ETF, and there's probably less risk.” Edited by Sebastian Sinclair Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: MakerDAO’s Spark to invest $500 million in BlackRock’s BUIDL fund

The Tokenization Grand Prix aims to diversify Spark's stablecoin reserves by investing $1 billion in tokenized funds. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Spark has announced that BlackRock, Superstate, and Centrifuge are the winners of its Tokenization Grand Prix. The goal is to allocate $1 billion in tokenized assets, with BlackRock’s BUIDL fund set to receive half of it. The competition, launched in July 2024, allocated funds through the Spark Liquidity Layer (SLL). The initiative aimed to integrate real-world assets (RWAs) to diversify Spark’s balance sheet while expanding stablecoin adoption in DeFi. The final allocation remains subject to Sky (formerly MakerDAO) governance approval, with a vote scheduled for April 3. If approved, the initiative will also invest $300 million in Superstate’s USTB and $200 million in Centrifuge-Anemoy Janus Henderson’s JTRSY. Currently, the Spark Liquidity Layer holds USDC, USDS, sUSDS, USDe, and sUSDe. The protocol will use these stablecoins to add BUIDL, USTB, and JTRSY. The competition attracted 39 applications, reviewed by Steakhouse Financial, a firm specializing in RWAs within the Spark ecosystem. Applicants were assessed based on pricing transparency, liquidity levels, and strategic alignment with Spark’s objectives. Spark picked each of these RWA tokens backed by US Treasury securities, suggesting a preference for liquid and conservative assets. BUIDL is offered by BlackRock and tokenized by Securitize. The money fund invests in US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements, and cash. BUIDL is the largest tokenized money fund, with over $1.2 billion in market cap as of March 18. Spark’s incoming investment could propel it close to $2 billion. Meanwhile, Superstate’s USTB focuses on short-duration US Treasury bills maturing in six months or less, ensuring a predictable and secure yield. It is significantly smaller than BUIDL, with $370 million participation in the market. Lastly, Centrifuge-Anemoy Janus Henderson’s JTRSY allocates money to a short-duration US Treasury fund that reinvests in new issuances as existing securities mature. With a market cap of $32.4 million, JTRSY is also the smallest of the three tokenized funds potentially to receive Spark’s investment. If approved, Spark’s investments in BlackRock/Securitize, Superstate, and Centrifuge will mark a significant step in integrating tokenized RWAs into DeFi infrastructure.

Title: Breaking Down Strategy’s Recent Preferred Stock Offerings

ByMauricio Di Bartolomeo ByMauricio Di Bartolomeo , Contributor. MIAMI, FLORIDA - JUNE 04: MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor speaks at the Bitcoin 2021 Convention, ... [+] a crypto-currency conference held at the Mana Convention Center in Wynwood on June 04, 2021 in Miami, Florida. The crypto conference is expected to draw 50,000 people and runs from Friday, June 4 through June 6th. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Strategy, the rebranded MicroStrategy and the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, made headlines earlier today as it unveiled its latest preferred stock offering, STRF. The company launched a public offering of 5,000,000 shares of its Series A Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock (ticker: STRF), subject to market conditions. The new offering aims to raise capital for general corporate purposes, with a significant portion earmarked for Bitcoin acquisitions and working capital. The new STRF offering introduces a hybrid security designed to appeal to investors seeking lower volatility compared to Strategy’s volatile common stock (MSTR). The STRF shares will be sold at market price. Strategy offers a liquidation price of $100/share. The liquidation price offered by the company is the amount per share that preferred shareholders are entitled to receive in the event of the company’s liquidation or dissolution, after satisfying debts but before distributing anything to common shareholders. It represents the preferred stock’s claim on assets. The STRF stock’s dividends compound at an initial rate of 10% annually plus 1% for unpaid amounts, escalating by 1% per period up to a maximum of 18% per annum until settled. The dividend is payable quarterly in arrears starting June 30, 2025, if declared by Strategy’s board of directors. Assuming the full offering is executed as planned, the company would take on a potential $50,000,000 annual dividend obligation. This is Strategy’s second preferred offering that offers a dividend. Earlier this year the company issued 7.3 Million of Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock, STRK, offering a fixed annual dividend of 8%. This issuance netted the company $563.4 million in proceeds and represents a potential total annual dividend obligation of approximately $58,400,000. Strategy’s potential cumulative annual dividend obligation from the STRK and STRF offerings, if both are fully executed as outlined, is approximately $108.4 million ($58.4 million for STRK and $50 million for STRF). This figure assumes full issuance and declared dividends. Actual payments depend on board decisions and financial health, making the obligation conditional rather than fixed. The actual dividend amount to be paid may also be higher if dividends go unpaid and triggers rates to escalate from the initial 10%. The nature of these instruments has sparked a debate online regarding Strategy’s ability to pay the dividends, methods through which it could do so, and what happens if the company doesn’t generate the necessary cash to pay down the preferred stock dividends offered. First, it’s important to note that, based on the offering details, Strategy has no obligation to issue or pay the dividends. They are all subject to board approval. While it is an option available to the company, not declaring or paying the dividends could impact the share prices significantly. Second, we can contrast the potential dividend obligations with the company’s operating cashflows from its software business. Strategy’s Q4 2024 earnings report notes $126.6 million in total revenue for the year, but this likely includes some Bitcoin-related adjustments post-adoption of FASB ASU 2023-08 (effective January 1, 2025), which mandates fair value accounting for Bitcoin. Excluding Bitcoin gains, the software business’s contribution to cash flow is likely in the range of $100–150 million annually, based on historical adjusted EBITDA figures. For further context, these were $80-$100 million in 2022-2023, per earlier filings. If we assume that Strategy’s software business is generating ~$100-$150 million in operational cash flow contributions, the fact that they have just taken on a potential $108.4 million dividend commitment has prompted some investors to ask “what happens if they need to come up with more cash to pay the dividend?”. The answer is that a) the company is not obligated to declare or pay the dividends and b) it could resort to issuing more common shares or selling bitcoin to raise the cash it needs to pay the dividends. Since Strategy’s first preferred offering, STRK, started trading on February 1st 2025, the stock is up +6%. In that same period, Strategy’s common stock, MSTR, has traded down -16.44%, signalling that investors like the potential yield and protection that the preferred offering provides. Importantly, Strategy’s common shares and preferred shares have both outperformed bitcoin and the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) since February 1st 2025, with spot bitcoin and IBIT being down -19% in the same period.

Title: Hong Kong’s leader takes swipe at Trump but avoids criticism of deal to sell Panama assets

Subscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics newsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else. Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Kanis Leung, Associated Press Kanis Leung, Associated Press Leave your feedback HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong’s leader has waded into a controversy over a prominent conglomerate’s decision to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium including American investment bank BlackRock Inc., a deal that has angered Beijing and highlights how escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington can leave the Chinese financial center’s business leaders trapped in the middle. Chief Executive John Lee told reporters at a weekly news briefing that CK Hutchison Holdings’ in-principle agreement to sell its controlling stake in a company operating ports at both ends of the Panama Canal was being discussed extensively and concerns raised about the deal deserve serious attention. He did not specify what the concerns were. “(The) government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises,” he said. “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.” Lee avoided a direct mention of U.S. President Donald Trump and also stopped short of criticizing CK Hutchison or tycoon Li Ka-shing’s family, which owns a controlling stake in the conglomerate. His comments followed a somewhat veiled backlash from Beijing. Since last Thursday, Beijing’s offices handling Hong Kong affairs have reposted two commentaries by a Beijing-backed local newspaper that blasted the deal. That has raised questions over the sale. One of the newspaper commentaries suggested the deal is a betrayal to all Chinese and disregards national interests. The other described great entrepreneurs as patriots, but suggested that businesspeople who “dance with” predatory American politicians to reap quick profits were doomed to infamy. The articles signaled Beijing’s disapproval of the deal, though its actual impact remains unclear. Posting of the articles has been seen as an indirect attack on the conglomerate by Chinese leaders. Trump, who has alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane, hailed the deal, saying his administration would “reclaim” the Panama Canal. Panama President José Raúl Mulino accused him of lying. Lee said any business transaction must comply with Hong Kong’s laws. The city will handle it according to the law, he said without elaborating. Increasing influence from Beijing is adding to pressure on business leaders in the former British colony, that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. CK Hutchison did not comment on Lee’s remarks or the articles. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it did not plan a news conference. In Beijing, when asked about reports that China authorities are investigating the potential sale, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said reporters should ask other Chinese authorities. WATCH: ‘We’re taking’ back the Panama Canal, Trump says “I would like to stress that in principle, China has been firmly opposing infringing on or undermining other countries’ legitimate rights and interests with economic coercion and bullying,” she said. The company surprised market watchers when it announced March 4 that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial and unrelated to other developments surrounding the Panama Ports. The deal, if approved, will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the Panama Canal. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. The transaction requires approval by Panama’s government. It does not affect a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong or any other ports in mainland China. Panama says it has full control over the shipping lane and Hutchison’s operation of the ports does not amount to Chinese control over the canal. Selling it to a U.S.-based company does not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal, it says. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s, seeking a faster way for commercial and military vessels to travel between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports.

Title: China, Hong Kong threaten to thwart sale of Panama Canal ports to America's BlackRock

Gordon Chang, expert on U.S.-China relations, details how Beijing can 'make life very difficult' for firms involved in sale of Panama Canal from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to U.S.-based BlackRock. A deal for the U.S. to "reclaim" the Panama Canal is increasingly under fire from authorities in China and Hong Kong. Earlier this month, BlackRock announced a $23 billion deal with CK Hutchinson to take ownership of the Panamanian ports of Cristobal and Balboa, which are located at the Atlantic and Pacific ends of the canal, respectively. It would also take over Hutchinson’s controlling interest in 43 ports in 23 other countries. However, Hong Kong and Chinese leaders could seek to stand in the way. John Lee, the leader of Hong Kong, stated his concerns about the deal on Tuesday, saying it deserved "serious attention." The agreement between the two conglomerates was seen as a solution to President Donald Trump’s threats to take back the canal after he argued that China was using it to "rip off" U.S. ships through entry fees.

(REUTERS/Carlos Jasso/File Photo) Trump touted the BlackRock deal as the U.S. "reclaiming" the port when it was first announced. Now, Beijing has opened up investigations into potential antitrust and national security concerns about the deal through various agencies, including its State Administration of Market Regulation, Bloomberg reported. "If Beijing stops this deal, that’s a direct challenge to the president of the United States on an issue which he really cares about," said U.S.-China relations expert Gordon Chang. "That is not going to go down very well." The lucrative waterway sees 5% of global maritime trade pass through. CK Hutchison’s stock price fell 3% on Tuesday after Lee’s comments, and the company canceled press and investor briefings that were scheduled for this week when it releases its financial report. CHINA SLAMS TRUMP-IMPOSED ‘ARBITRARY TARIFFS,’ VOWS RETALIATION AGAINST US Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said the Panama deal "deserved serious attention." (REUTERS/Joyce Zhou) "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations," Lee had said in an apparent jab at Trump. Commentaries published in Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper owned by the Chinese government, claimed the Hutchison-BlackRock agreement would allow the U.S. to "use [the canal] for political purposes and promote its own political agenda" and would make Chinese trade and shipping "subject to the United States." CK Hutchison is owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing. Lee has said any business transaction must comply with Hong Kong law, and the city will handle the deal according to law. "I suspect that the Hong Kong government is not going to take on Li Ka Shing and Hutchison, but you never know because the environment in Hong Kong is changing. It's not getting better," said Chang. PANAMA PLEDGES TO END KEY CANAL DEAL WITH CHINA, WORK WITH US AFTER RUBIO VISIT Some 5% of global maritime trade passes through the Panama Canal. (REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo) China’s presence in the canal zone allows it to block U.S. access at will. That could mean in the outbreak of war in the Indo-Pacific, it could prevent the U.S. Navy from surging ships from the Atlantic to the Pacific through the canal. However, the canal could also be used as leverage for China in its push for Trump to alleviate tariffs. Trump said Monday that Chinese President Xi Jinping would be visiting the U.S. in the "not too distant future." Trump at first put a blanket 10% tariff on all Chinese goods. In March, he upped it to 20%, arguing China was still not doing enough to address fentanyl flowing from its country through U.S. borders. CK Hutchison’s ownership of the canal also faces a constitutional challenge in Panama, which could be a factor in its intent to sell. Panamanian Attorney General Kenia Isolda Porcell Díaz has filed a submission in support of two lawsuits against renewal of a 25-year contract for Hutchison to own the ports, arguing the contract is "unconstitutional" because it "improperly agree[s] to transfer exclusive rights of the Panamanian State." When asked about the reports that China was investigating the sale, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the questions should be directed at other agencies.

Title: JD Vance: Cheap Labor Is Bad for U.S. Productivity, Innovation, Society
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/03/18/jd-vance-cheap-labor-is-bad-for-u-s-productivity-innovation-society/
Time Published: 2025-03-18T17:59:37Z
Full Content:
The lure of cheap labor is bad for innovation, productivity, civic solidarity, and national strength, Vice President JD Vance told business leaders at the American Dynamism Summit on Tuesday. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vance told his audience of investors, adding: Both our working people, our populace, and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy and the solution, I believe, is American innovation. “Real innovation makes us more productive, but it also, I think, dignifies our workers. It boosts our standard of living. It strengthens our workforce and the relative value of its labor,” Vance said in a short speech. The statement shows how Vance is trying to repair the political bridge between the party’s voters and business leaders that was deliberately demolished by ruthless pro-migration policies pushed by the two Bush presidencies. The two Bush presidencies dramatically expanded legal and illegal migration to inflate the stock market with cheap labor, more consumers, and more renters. “There were two conceits that our leadership class had when it came to globalization,” Vance said: The first is assuming that we can separate the making of things from the design of things. The idea was that rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things. You would open an iPhone box and it would say “Designed in Cupertino, California.” Now the implication, of course, is that it would be manufactured [in China] or somewhere else. And yeah, some people might lose their jobs in manufacturing, and they could learn to design, or to use a very popular phrase, and “learn to code.” But I think we got it wrong. Turns out that the geographies that do the manufacturing get awfully good at the designing of things. There are network effects, as you all well understand, the firms that design products work with firms that manufacture. They share intellectual property, they share best practices, and they even sometimes share critical employees. Now we assume that other nations would always trail us in the value chain, but it turns out that as they got better at the low end of the value chain, they also started catching up on the higher end [so] we were squeezed from both ends. Now that was the first conceit of globalization. I think the second is that cheap labor is fundamentally a crutch, and it’s a crutch that inhibits innovation. I might even say that it’s a drug that too many American firms got addicted to. Now, if you can make a product more cheaply, it’s far too easy to do that rather than to innovate. And whether we’re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies, or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I’d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you’ve seen productivity stagnate. That’s not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct. Now, one of the debates you hear on the minimum wage, for instance, is that increases in the minimum wage force firms to automate. So a higher wage at McDonald’s means more [service] kiosks. And whatever your views on the wisdom of the minimum wage, I’m not going to comment on that here … [we think] companies innovating in the absence of cheap labor is a good thing. I think most of you are not worried about getting cheaper and cheaper labor. You’re worried about innovating, about building new things, about the old formulation of technology is doing more with less. You guys are all trying to do more with less every single day. And so I’d ask my friends, both on the tech optimist side and on the populist side, not to see the failure of the logic of globalization as a failure of innovation. Indeed, I’d say that globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation. Both our working people, our populace, and our innovators gathered here today have the same enemy and the solution, I believe, is American innovation. … Our goal is to incentivize investment in our own borders — in our own businesses, our own workers, and our own innovation. We don’t want people seeking cheap labor. We want them investing and building right here in the United States of America. Breitbart News has posted many articles about migration’s harmful impact on productivity and innovation, and how tight labor markets and rising wages pressure companies to invest in wage-boosting automation and productivity. For example, the Fortune 500 has increasingly imported foreign white-collar labor to cut costs. But the programs created by Congress and the executive — such as the H-1B, J-1, L-1, CPT, and other visa programs — have imported debilitating Indian-style office politics into a wide range of critical U.S. companies, including Intel, IBM, Twitter, and Boeing. The damage was recently spotlighted by Citibank, which announced it would sharply reduce its reliance on foreign contractors after the contractors cost the company at least $600 million in routine operations and regulatory incompetence. The decision means Citibank will begin hiring at least 10,000 American technology professionals for jobs held by supposedly cheaper Indian visa workers. In 2024, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that President Joe Biden’s migration policy would reduce productivity growth in the United States. Vance told his listeners that elites’ demand for cheap labor also fractures societies: I think the populists, when they look at the future, and when they compare it to what’s happened in the past, I think a lot of them see alienation of workers from their jobs, from their communities, from their sense of solidarity. You see the alienation of people from their sense of purpose. And importantly, they see a leadership class that believes welfare can replace a job and an application on a phone can replace a sense of purpose. … Now, I remember a Silicon Valley dinner in particular, back when I was in — in my tech days, where my wife and I were sitting around talking to some of the leaders of — of the important technology firms of the United States … And I remember one of the tech CEOs who was there that — you know, CEO — you would know his name if I mentioned it. He was the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company. He said, “Well, I’m actually not worried about the loss of purpose when people lose their jobs.” And I said, “Okay, well, what do you think is going to replace that sense of purpose?” And he said, “Digital, fully immersive gaming.” The same economic and civic problem has occurred in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany, where national leaders are inflating the economy with immigrants, dragging down average income and prosperity. For example, immigration forces nations to divert investment to housing and consumerism and away from factory automation and high-tech research. The economic damage has been noted by some business leaders who face competing temptations to either raise short-term profit via migration or raise long-term productivity and innovation via investment in American employees. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

Title: Larry Fink Reminds Leadership About That Other Retirement Crisis

Time Published: 2025-03-18T15:56:23Z

ByMichael Peregrine ByMichael Peregrine , Senior Contributor. There are growing concerns as to whether Americans have enough savings for retirement. Most consumers are focused on the retirement crisis that has been sharing them right in the face as of late: the dramatic swings in the financial markets that have led to insecurity over individual savings plans, and eroding credibility in the economy and in the viability of Social Security. That retirement crisis, just about everyone gets. But in the midst of this Larry Fink, the influential chairman of the investment management firm BlackRock, is reminding corporate leaders of the potential for a different, less familiar, more long term crisis. It’s the tremendous strain confronting the U.S. retirement system ‒ and the unpreparedness of many employees and retirees for their financial security. And it’s a strain that corporate leaders may have a role in easing. Fink’s perspective is that only those employees of Fortune 500-type companies are truly supported by satisfactory retirement planning, which is an unsustainable social circumstance. In a recent interview with CNN, he ascribed much of the current anxiety in the nation to the fear of retirement. “We see less mobility in America because people have to stay closer to their family because of inadequacy of savings.” This concern for broad-based retirement security is grounded in both a recognition that people are living longer lives (which requires greater financial security) and in a firm belief that investment through the capital markets can provide that greater security. As Fink noted in his most recent letter to BlackRock investors, “We focus a tremendous amount of energy on helping people live longer lives. But not even a fraction of that effort is spent helping people afford those extra years.” To address this challenge, Fink proposes “an organized, high level” national conversation to help ensure that future generations are able to live out their senior years in a dignified manner. This conversation would examine the retirement crisis through three different perspectives: (i) That of a current worker, trying to save for retirement; (ii) Someone who has already retired and has savings, but is worried that the funds may run out; and (iii) the demographic concern ‒ what’s the issue for the population as a whole? To kick-start the “national conversation”, Fink calls on companies and their leadership to assume a greater role in helping workers confront retirement. That might include providing some level of matching funds for retirement plans, offering more financial education on plan contributions, and helping workers to transfer their 401(k) savings when they change jobs. Themes such as “affording older age” and “building retirement savings” for workers may more readily resonate with corporate leaders than themes of sustainability and social engineering. To be sure, this isn’t the first time Fink has raised concerns about a retirement crisis. In both his 2019 and 2024 letters to CEOs and investors, he called on companies to re-establish their traditional leadership role in helping workers navigate retirement. He warned that the failure to address the retirement crisis will leave far too many workers unprepared for retirement, eroding the country’s financial security. But the timing of his current warning may be propitious. The recent, broad-based concern with the security of retirement savings may be an appropriate time to refocus attention on the current system of worker retirement. And it might be a particularly appealing message for corporate leaders who are searching for ways to address growing economic anxieties within their workforce. Fink worries that the retirement message that companies and business send to workers shouldn’t be “you’re on your own.” Business leaders have an opportunity (if not an obligation) to change that message, by applying their expertise and innovative spirit towards solving this “other” retirement crisis.

Tokenized Treasury products of BlackRock-Securitize, Superstate and Centrifuge are poised to receive allocations from $1 billion investment plan initiated by Sky, formerly MakerDAO, an initiative designed to accelerate the adoption of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization on Sky-adjacent decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Spark. BUIDL, issued by BlackRock and Securitize and backed by U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements, is set to receive $500 million allocation. Superstate's USTB will get a $300 million. Centrifuge's JTRSY, a T-bill fund in partnership with asset managers Anemoy and Janus Henderson, set to receive $200 million. The selection process saw 39 applicants evaluated by advisory firm Steakhouse Financial, a key player in Spark’s ecosystem specializing in RWAs. Winners were chosen based on criteria including liquidity and capital efficiency. The final allocations will be market-driven and capped at $1 billion, Spark said in a press release. Pending governance approval, the selected tokenized assets could be used as collateral for Sky’s native stablecoin USDS and its yield-bearing counterpart, sUSDS. The protocol's move is part of a larger trend of blockchain-based protocols integrating tokenized versions of traditional financial assets, or real-world assets, like bonds, funds and credit. In 2024, Sky announced plans to invest $1 billion in tokenized U.S. Treasury bills, attracting interest from a wide range of issuers.

Title: This ‘Unpatriotic’ Trade Nets You A 9.1% Dividend

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Closeup of an American flag in a row. Memorial day, Independence day, Veterans day, patriotic ... [+] concept. Copy space. For years, it’s been a struggle to try to convince many U.S. investors to spread some of their money abroad. It’s only natural: We simply tend to favor the familiar—our home country—over others. Investors the world over have this natural bias. But that’s been slowly changing in recent months. Which is great news, because diversifying internationally is a particularly smart move in times like these. Moreover, when you diversify—especially through 8%+ yielding income investments like closed-end funds—you can easily rebalance your holdings in line with changes in the market, moving more into U.S. stocks when they’re low, say, and international assets are high. And doing the reverse when that situation flips back. When it comes to recommending the U.S. over the rest of the world in recent years, it’s really just been a case of following the facts: The data simply tells us that U.S. stocks have been the best performers, as a mix of poor policy decisions and inefficient markets in Europe and Asia made those regions less compelling. The market performance really does speak for itself here, with the S&P 500 handily beating global indices over the long haul. We can see that very clearly when we look at the long-term performance of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), in purple below, and the Vanguard FTSE All-World Ex-US ETF (VEU), in orange, over the last decade. SPY Total Returns Lately, however, something quite different has been happening. In 2025, every stock market in the world has been moving up except for America’s. Journalists and bankers have taken notice; the Financial Times recently reported that this is shifting investors’ demand for assets: “Importantly, this seems to be generating real investor interest, with a lot of sell-side analysts recently mentioning how many questions they’re finally getting about Europe,” the FT recently wrote. Of course, stock-market volatility means that an asset (or collection of a country’s assets) might outperform in the short term but underperform in the long run. But this time, it is possible that foreign stocks, just as a sheer matter of reverting to the mean, could recover while American stocks slip further. This is why one of the best tools in an investor’s toolbox is diversification. It isn’t a matter of choosing either America or foreign stocks. It’s about having both and strategically buying more of one when it’s a better buy than the other. This is why we hold the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust (BGY) in the portfolio of our CEF Insider service. The fund mostly holds large cap international stocks like pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca PLC (AZN), luxury-goods maker LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and German software firm SAP SE (SAP). The fund also generates an extra income stream by selling covered-call options on its portfolio. Under this approach, BGY sells investors the right to buy its stocks at a fixed price and time in the future. No matter what ultimately happens with these trades, the fund keeps the fee it charges for this right. In a Dec. 12, 2024, Contrarian Outlook article, I pointed out that it was an opportune time to add more BGY to your holdings with the following commentary: Since then, BGY has outperformed SPY by a significant margin. BGY Outperforms BGY is being driven by the overall momentum in international stocks, of course, even though it’s behind some of the higher-flying international ETFs out there. But we still prefer this fund, for two reasons: the dividend (current yield: 9.1%) and the discount, which points to the further “baked-in” price gains ahead. Let’s take that second point first. Unlike ETFs, which always trade very close to par value, CEFs can (and regularly do) trade at different values on the market in relation to their underlying portfolios—a measure called the discount to net asset value (NAV). That’s mainly because, unlike ETFs, CEFs tend to have a fixed share count for their entire lives. As I write this, BGY trades at a 7.8% discount. That means we’re getting international assets for cheaper than we would through an ETF. Plus, BGY’s discount has been much smaller in the past, when demand for foreign assets was higher, which means we won’t just get profits as BGY’s holdings appreciate in value. Those gains will also be compounded as market demand for international assets causes BGY’s discount to shrink. Indeed, that has already been happening at a slow pace over the last year. Secondly, the dividend. As mentioned, BGY yields 9.1%, which means the fund will give you a large portion of its profits in cash (I should point out that BGY pays dividends monthly, too). That means you can use that cash to rebalance into US stocks when they slide in value so that in the long term you get profits from both the short-term gains in foreign stocks and the long-term gains in U.S. stocks as they recover. And, of course, you always have the option to use the $76 per month you get for every $10,000 invested in BGY to do other things, like pay your bills. This scenario really does highlight many of the greatest things about CEFs: They allow you to diversify—making rebalancing easier in times of volatility and market stress—and give you a large cash stream you can use to be more financially independent. The topper? In the case of BGY, these benefits come our way at a nearly 8% discount, too. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

03/19 update below. This post was originally published on March 18 Bitcoin has been stuck in holding pattern in recent weeks, struggling to regain momentum after “panic selling” raised fears of a major bitcoin price crash. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has dropped from its all-time high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin, plummeting to around $80,000 despite a leak revealing Russia is quietly leaning into bitcoin and crypto. Now, as traders speculate Donald Trump’s White House could be gearing up to buy as much bitcoin as possible, closely-watched crypto trader Arthur Hayes has predicted the Federal Reserve is about to step in to stabilize markets, potentially triggering a bitcoin price boom. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell could step in to support markets, including the bitcoin price ... [+] and cryptocurrencies, according to BitMex cofounder Arthur Hayes. “When there’s financial distress, they always print money. It doesn’t matter the political leanings,” Hayes, the cofounder of crypto deivatives pioneer BitMex who went onto launch the Maelstrom investment company, said in a wide-ranging interview with Bitcoin News. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market has followed stock markets lower in recent weeks as traders react to U.S. president Donald Trump’s on again-off again international trade tariffs and the rising risk of recession. 03/19 update: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is "between a rock and a hard place," Wells Fargo’s chief economist has told the Wall Street Journal, with the Fed likely to hold rates steady today as it grapples with the prospect of Donald Trump’s trade war fueling an inflation bump but also dampening economic growth. Traders are whispering that Powell could announce an end to the Fed’s balance sheet runoff program, known as quantitative tightening, which could boost the bitcoin price, crypto and stock markets. “Our rates strategists expect the statement to indicate that the Fed is pausing quantitative tightening until the debt ceiling is resolved, as suggested in the January meeting minutes,” Bank of America analysts wrote in a note seen by Coindesk. “They do not expect to restart after the debt ceiling is addressed, but the announcement won’t be made until later this year.” The Fed will announce its interest rate decision at 2pm ET, followed by Powell’s 2:30pm ET press conference. "Late last year, Fed chair Powell hinted that the end of [quantitative tightening] was coming in 2025. If he mentions it in [today’s statement or press conference (I imagine someone will ask him), that would end up signalling that we’re in a new monetary regime, and that the Fed stands ready to resume additional debt purchases should [quantitative easing] become necessary again," Noelle Acheson, editor of the Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, wrote in an emailed note. "While renewed [quantitative easing] is unlikely any time soon, the additional liquidity from a large buyer (the Fed) coming back into the market to replace maturing holdings would be good news," Acheson wrote, adding the Treasury market is facing $9 trillion in debt maturity this year that quantitative tightening could disrupt. "When the floodgates open, it’s go time,” Hayes said, referring to the return of liquidity to the market, and predicting “they’re going to reflate and print more money than anyone’s ever printed before.” The last bitcoin price boom that saw the bitcoin price climb to around $70,000 in late 2021 came in the aftermath of huge Covid-era government stimulus spending and money-printing. “We are experiencing a low in liquidity fiat money generation,” Hayes said. Hayes has predicted the bitcoin price will reach $250,000 by the end of the year as the Fed is forced to flip dovish and move to prop up the economy and asset prices.

The Federal Reserve today begins its two-day policy meeting, with the Fed’s latest interest rate decision due tomorrow—expected to see interest rates left unchanged despite president Trump’s campaign to see them brought down. Traders are pricing in two or three rate cuts later this year but that could change with Fed chair Jerome Powell’s all-important, post-decision press conference.

Title: China says Panama ports sale to BlackRock is an example of ‘economic coercion.’ Investors are spooked | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Officials in Beijing and Hong Kong spoke out Tuesday against a proposal to sell ports in the Panama Canal to a consortium led by BlackRock, sending shares in the Hong Kong-based conglomerate that owns the ports plummeting. It’s unclear how regulators could interfere with the plan, which was announced earlier this month, given that the ports that CK Hutchison intends to offload to the group led by the US investment giant are located outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. However, observers have said Beijing’s sharp criticism of the deal means it may not ultimately go through. When asked at a regular press conference whether China was investigating CK Hutchison’s planned sale, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, declined to answer directly. But she made Beijing’s view clear. “I would like to emphasize that China has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying to infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other countries,” she said. Her comments echoed those of John Lee, Hong Kong’s leader, who earlier on Tuesday said: “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international, economic and trade relations.” On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that several Chinese government agencies, including the top market regulator, had been instructed by state leaders to study the deal for any potential security breaches or antitrust violations. CNN has reached out to CK Hutchison for comment. Its shares fell as much as 5% Tuesday due to jitters about the future of the proposal, which is currently an “agreement in principle.” Earlier this month, the group of investors led by BlackRock said it would spend $22.8 billion to buy the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the Panama Canal from CK Hutchison, as well as its controlling interest in 43 other ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. Hong Kong is a former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a special arrangement with Beijing, which granted the city autonomy and wide-ranging freedoms unavailable in mainland China. But a national security law that came into effect in 2020 has transformed Hong Kong’s political, legal and business landscape. CNN’s Fred He and Chris Lau contributed reporting.

He supported HTS in Syria mainly to teach Assad a lesson and to get him to Do Something about Syrian refugees in Turkiye, as in take a lot back. The plan, or at least his plan, was not to topple Assad. This action would be a massive double-crossing of Erdogan by Israel, since Turkiye has stood pat as Israel has chewed up Syria. An expulsion into Syria would lead to a new refugee influx into the much less bad off Turkiye. But Turkiye has been too chicken-shit to cross the US.

From the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the call: During the conversation, Marco Rubio informed him of the US decision to launch a military operation against the Houthi forces in the Red Sea region. Sergey Lavrov, in response to the arguments by the American representative, stressed the need for all parties to immediate cease the use of force and the importance for all sides to engage in political dialogue so as to find a solution that would prevent further bloodshed. Note much of the press is not clearly reporting that the Houthis had stopped attacks while the ceasefire was on and merely said they’d resume them if the ceasefire failed and food was not let in, ie, the Trump strikes were pre-emptive.

Alex Christoforou pointed out in his latest video that this power plant is actually in Zaporizhzhia Oblast which voted and did join the Russian Federation. The Russian Constitution will not allow Putin to sell it off or give it away to Trump as it is Russian territory. I could see Putin offering to sell electricity generated there to the Ukraine as much as their electrical grid is ash right now however. So either Trump is just spouting his latest bs lines or he thinks constitutions are just like contracts – always up for renegotiation – and expects Putin to get in line. High hopes. Trump will give Russia Crimea because Tennyson! \sarc\ Trump will get back Donbass, while giving them the last Kursk “pocket”. \sarc\ Russia will offer to negotiate the shape of the table in Paris starting next December. \sarc\ Ukraine has nearly gone through all 500 gifted ATACMS; got no advantage from them and wants 500 more to get no advantage.

By the way, I suspect this is the template for the Russia-Ukraine war – they’ll lie about a ceasefire being “on the 10 yard line” for about a year, then when it finally happens, it will implode after fewer than 60 days. The lying liars just love to lie, lie, lie! They are non-agreement capable, the whole rotten lot: Blinken, Biden, Trump, Witkoff, Rubio When an Israeli spokesman appears on TV these days, I just switch myself off. Nearly everything that they say is a lie so what is the point of listening to what they have to say? Their word means nothing. Please apply the same filter to Trump and Witkoff. They are nothing but liars. Rapid Onset Political Enlightenment Tablet. A must read. …the newly minted digital variant of “public opinion” was rooted in the algorithms that determine how fads spread on social media, in which mass multiplied by speed equals momentum—speed being the key variable. The result was a fast-moving mirror world that necessarily privileges the opinions and beliefs of the self-appointed vanguard who control the machinery, and could therefore generate the velocity required to change the appearance of “what people believe” overnight… Every form of totalitarianism is unique….Soviet cynicism was a natural product of how the Soviets decided to rule, which was to demand absolute external compliance to party dictates in word and deed while at the same time allowing its subjects a separate space to think their own thoughts—provided that they never acted on those thoughts. The natural outcome of the Soviet system was compliance without belief… Musk, meanwhile, was entirely and sincerely his own man—a privilege that came in part from being the richest man in America, and in part from the nature of his businesses, which the Obama cadres appear to have misunderstood. Musk may have paid twice as much as the next-highest bidder for Twitter, if such a bidder actually ever existed. Netanyahu’s decision to invade Rafah on May 6, 2024, was the culmination of two long and otherwise separate chains of events whose consequences will continue to reverberate throughout the Middle East, and also at home. Netanyahu had been promising to invade Rafah since February. The fact that he had not done so by May had become both a symbol of Israeli weakness and indecision in the face of a global onslaught of Jew-hatred, as well as the continuing solidity of the regional power structure established by Obama’s Iran deal. Too much to unpack without a re-reading and careful deconstruction. But, some items stand out. True enough there is a “new machinery” in place from when the days of Lipmann, and that each “form of totalitarianisms is unique,” but to say that “Musk is his own man” I think is false, just ask Bibi and those who control his military contracts, which may be the same group. As for “global onslaught of Jew-hatred,” it’s very wide, too wide a paint brush that the author uses. The images I saw this morning of 300 dead Palestinians make me hate the state of Israel, Christians, atheist, Buddhist, Taoist, Maoist, gays, lesbians, straights or any other designation you wish to make including Jews, that supports this indiscriminate bombing of women and children. Too bad Samuels’ derangement on Iran derails an otherwise interesting examination of “the blob” and its use of 21st Century communications technology to “manufacture consent.” Going to grab a cup and read. I hope it mentions that he Soviets were also telling the people that computer programs were making the govt and businesses more efficient by figuring out what needed to be manufactured, etc ! I personally was struck by the language around the COVID lockdowns. Being a “bad” thing, that is, foisted upon us by Obama’s “permission structure machine” or suchlike. Without going into a long and detailed breakdown, because it is far, far too early in the morning, and because there are other subjects I would much, much rather write an essay on at the moment. My OVERALL reaction to the piece is that the author a) tries too much to pretend that the media and propaganda environment of the 2010s and early 2020s was COMPLETELY AND RADICALLY DIFFERENT from the past, and b) asserts, more or less out of thin air, that it is now done, finished, kaputski. I’ve done a lot of reading, and watching, of Cold War-era propaganda, for my own edification – because I feel that you cannot study the Cold War era as a whole without so doing. What may be different, to some extent, between today and, say, the 1950s, is the structure of the media landscape through which propaganda is applied, as well as the attendant terminology. But the basic idea of constructing a cage around one’s public actions and statements, of enforcing endless re-pledging of fealty – dare I say, of allegiance – through both positive and negative reinforcement, of flooding the voters’ brains with easy to remember slogans that catch on like fads and have no rational basis in reality? I mean, been there, done that, many times? And I won’t even touch the whole “where, oh where has objective journalism disappeared off to with Russiagate” thing with a ten foot pole. Instead, I recommend a book – “Selling the Korean War”, by Steven Casey, and another one, “Second Front – Censorship and Propaganda in the 1991 Gulf War”, by John Macarthur. Snapshots in time of exactly how that sort of “objective journalism” was managed by the Powers That Be long, long before Axelrod and Obama were doing their tango. Yes, Wisner’s “Mighty Wurlitzer” got a digital upgrade. And Obama was born into Wizner’s “family”. In some ways very insightful, this is a “limited hang out.” Despite its length Samuels’ Rapid Onset article is worth a read because it lays out useful bits of the expansion of propaganda techniques in national politics. Obama and Axelrod certainly deserve lots of criticism, but because he wants to focus his story on them he misses enormously important context. Samuels makes zero mention of propaganda techniques prior to Axelrod, so he can portray him as a huge innovator. No mention of the long war of corporate/libertarian interests against hugely popular New Deal policies. No mention of the massively funded Koch type programs to push neoliberal Democrats, mainstream media, academics and the judiciary to support policies that had little electoral support. Zero mention of longstanding propaganda techniques such has heightening tribalism by reducing everything to good-versus-evil narratives that demonizing opponents. Zero mention of how this fueled the PMC takeover of the Democratic Party and the PMC’s complete abandonment of broad New Deal-type coalitions. In this context Obama and Axelrod weren’t driving major changes but were continuing ongoing shifts. And were doing a lousy job on the propaganda front, because they weren’t tapping into or solidifying any portion of the Democratic base, and weren’t directing the base’s anger at political opponents. Samuels mentions some political failures (healthcare) and ignores others (abortion, immigration, gutting antitrust) but these don’t fit his larger thesis that Obama and Axelrod were masters at creating support for policies voters didn’t really like. Because Samuels ignores the longer, bipartisan history of manipulative propaganda, and ignores the PMC issues, he misses that Trump gains are largely explained by his ability (however cynical) to tap into the electorate’s more populist concerns, why the Dems aggressively expunge anyone not totally dedicated to the interests of large donors. Samuels assumes that (but does not explain why) an Israeli-Saudi total victory over Iran and the Palestinians would be a wonderful thing. This leads to the perverse conclusion that Obama’s Iran deal had nothing to do with stabilizing an ugly Middle East and reducing the chance of wars that US voters had absolutely no interest in. Instead, Samuels insists that the Iran deal was a cyncical Obama ploy to reduce the power of Jews within the Democratic Party. Yes Israel/Iran issues are very complicated, and there are a range of plausible arguments on all sides, but Samuels falls into the exact same tribal/good-versus evil propaganda framing he is attacking Axelrod for. Zero mention of the enormous power of AIPAC type money on the Democratic Party, and zero mention that the huge growth of political donations might have had a bigger impact on imposing unwanted policies on the electorate than any of Axelrod’s campaign techniques. Thank you for taking the time to write this! Great comment. Per my mighty wurlitzer comment above, there’s been in place somewhere in the bowels of the Blob since at least when Keenan wrote his “Political Warfare” memo a sophisticated propaganda machine organized along the principles of Norbert Wiener’s “cybernetics”. Increasingly and particularly since Reagan this machine has been targeted domestically and it has always existed primarily in the service of capitalist oligarchic interests. We’re now seeing various factions taking form amongst erstwhile capitalist oligarchs as the inertia of the State is degraded by DOGE and Lawfare. Zionism appears to be heavier in one faction, but there may suddenly be many factions rather than our habitual two. There is a unique data person in the news recently involved in identifying many of the linkages and impacts of federal budgets and programs, like USAID and campaign finance. She goes by the name DataRepublican (small r), and here is an interview with her. I want to say thank you for your comment as well. I stopped reading as soon as Samuels starting talking about the Hamas ‘army’ attacking, killing, and raping Israelis in October 2023. Maybe the ‘permission structure’ has led me to false beliefs. But I thought many of the Israeli dead and injured were in fact from Israeli military (including IDF helicopters) action, not Hamas. At least, he didn’t mention Hamas’ reported beheading of infants. It seems to me that Samuels’ essay is every bit as much propaganda as the Obama/Axelrod form. As for Musk, I think that he has used Twitter, now X, as the platform to take the ‘permission structure’ to the next level. Not at all reassuring for our future. >Minnesota Republicans seek to codify ‘Trump derangement syndrome’ as mental illness It’s funnier than The Babylon Bee. Funny like “this meat smells funny”, or “we have a funny kind of democracy”. I guess if one is critical of Trump one can be committed to the “funny farm”. Good times. I suppose that there are two types of “funny.” There is funny funny and there is funny strange. Two different meanings. It’s all about context. I believe the saying goes “as in funny ha-ha or funny strange” I’ve heard both. The British version is funny ha-ha or funny peculiar, which is more sinister, more… Lovecraftian. “It’s a funny old world.” Yes. Not that I was a fan of “Thatcherism”, but it sure looks manageable from today’s perspective. I don’t know. One of my friends has a bad case of TDS. Throughout Biden’s term the guy was always mocking election deniers. When we were hanging out this weekend, he was telling me all about how Trump rigged the 2024 election. When I pointed out that I was not interested in his election denialism, a position he formerly mocked, he replied that this was different because there was evidence. I asked him about his “evidence.” Needless to say, it was a screed about how Elon has hackers and Trump said we “would never have to vote again” but drawn out into a five minute rant. I’m finding it less funny by the day. Funny how?! MAGA folks or liberals? They each have their own type. OpenAI Says It’s “Over” If It Can’t Steal All Your Copyrighted Work – Futurism Fair use isn’t claiming the work and thoughts of others is some computer program “thinking”. These f’ers from A to Z (Altman to Zelensky) are out of ideas except asset-stripoing and looting. I refused Cambridge University Press permission to turn over my textbook to the AI things. They COULD very logically and easily conclude that the open access stuff by me is worth scraping instead. It would be a pity if I copied over all the main orthogonal main effects plans and balanced incomplete block designs to my public website with any “minor unintentional copy-paste mistakes” and these got scraped and thus shone like the beacons of Gondor in studies that used those ;-) I don’t find the framing of this very convincing. If training materials for AI are regarded as not being covered under fair use, the biggest beneficiaries would be publishers like Elsevier and Penguin as well as major IP holders like Disney. Artists and authors would benefit negligibly, if at all, regardless of whether the copyright for their works is held or managed by a corporation. At best, I could see a “Spotify model” being implemented, but, for the vast majority of artists, the earnings from streaming services are a pittance (for them), and it’s hard to imagine artists not associated with publishers benefiting much. More likely, many will still end up included in the training datasets while being given legal tools they can’t feasibly use.

Artists and authors would benefit negligibly, if at all, regardless of whether the copyright for their works is held or managed by a corporation. Yes and that’s the unfortunate price a lot of us paid to get our books published. Is it fair? No. I get on average GBP80 p.a. royalties for my textbook, all of which goes to my accountant since I am required to do a self-assessment for tax, for which my accountant charges around GBP80. But I never did this for the money. Flaw number one in your reasoning. At best, I could see a “Spotify model” being implemented, but, for the vast majority of artists, the earnings from streaming services are a pittance (for them), and it’s hard to imagine artists not associated with publishers benefiting much. Again, I didn’t do it for the money. I always knew I’d gain only a pittance. Let me give you some insights (which I’ve stated here before) as to the purpose of my textbook, which gives flaw number two. I, along with the two most esteemed academics in my field at the time (RIP both now) wrote this book not in the expectation that it’d become the “default textbook” in ANY course in ANY country in the world. Why would it not? Because it is absolutely antithetical to big companies who offer consultancy services in discrete choice modelling. If you’re an academic who wants the dosh, you’re probably going to want to stay sweet with such companies. Thus, do NOT recommend to students a book which “opens the black box” and tells them how to do all this stuff themselves. More likely, many will still end up included in the training datasets while being given legal tools they can’t feasibly use. See my point below. The whole point about discrete choice modelling is that you NEED statistical design matrices, which don’t stay up on the internet for long (for various reasons, but NOT for any copyright/legal infringements etc). If AI want to scrape my stuff they’re welcome. The stuff “owned” by CUP might not be scraped, and even if so, AI will struggle. Why? Because what I and colleagues did was NOT stuff on what economists call the “production possibilities frontier”. By definition it was work to move beyond this using well designed experiments that are NOT out there to “scrape”. As a final note, our book merely gives the reader all the statistical and survey method tools to do the types of discrete choice models we pioneered. I spent 5 years working hard in peace from funders before I got my “key paper” published. Then on EVERY single project since I have been employed I have tried to be humble in recognising that I have an equation with two unknowns and therefore potentially infinite solutions. The only way to hone in the likely correct one is to spend a LOT of time among a multi-disciplinary group including experts who “work at the coal face” to get an idea as to which is the REAL maximum in the maximum likelihood function. AI can’t give you that in any area beyond an incredibly narrow number of applications for which we already know the answer. I do not fear AI. Because what I did was based on 20 years’ of experience “thinking outside the box”. Furthermore I never did it for the cash, I did it (stupid and naive those this makes me sound) to enable followers to know the general “path” towards a solution. To GET a solution, they still must do a lot of HUMAN work. Since I’m the last remaining expert in my my field, with h-indices, and an Erdős number better than any health economist I’ve ever known (who didn’t get it purely by being someone I taught), I’m fairly sure my work will get scraped. This won’t help people, however and I’m relaxed. As a final note, if you want proof as to the shenanigans that go on in “academics versus business”, look up the edit history on wikipedia of the maxdiff model. When it stopped being an advert for a company and instead started being the definition of a long-standard mathematical model, that’s when I, under tutelage of one of my colleagues, began to put things right. Our “back and forth” with certain people ended when we got our book published and a certain wiki sub-editor who knew their stuff put a stop to editing by certain people for a while. “Because what I did was based on 20 years’ of experience “thinking outside the box”. The LLMs have provided a literal meaning to “thinking outside the box”. Yeah, trouble is what it actually is, is “making shit up” when they must think outside the box. One of my oldest undergrad friends works in AI at Google. He refuses to say exactly what he does. But he did quiz me a LOT 5-10 years ago about what I was doing in my research. I think (personally) he got the “idea” of what I did (moving beyond the PPF) but never really understood what AI needed to do to “really” think outside the box. Which has made me think AI is actually nowhere near genuine proper artificial intelligence. The “Google et al AI” is not thinking outside the box in the way a human would do AT ALL. It is still rooted in predictive algorithms. Its version of “intuition” is “just making shit up”. “Thinking outside the box” only has true meaning for humans. It really has no meaning for computer programs. yep! Schrödinger’s AI coming soon? :) Almost everybody is forgetting that computers are actually just very sophisticated adding machines. I’m also thinking the copyrights of others would be collateral for debt. This is not snark……I’m genuinely wondering…….maybe I’m being dumb but could you expand upon your point (without making a load of work for you!)? I don’t get your point :( I’m taking a leap of thought into a future where there are copyrights claimed that are not theirs. Right now they’ve managed to limit copyright filing to people. For now. ah thanks. I wonder what kinda “power levels” there are. Cambridge University (as a Federal institution) is a lot more powerful than it was in my day in the 1990s thanks to “Gates Business Park” etc. However, the Colleges own HUGE swathes of land, e,g, the entire port of Folkestone….. Wonder what a battle of the “land barons” vs the “new AI tech companies” would play out? I objected to the Cambridge IP land grab, when they stripped academics of absolute ownership of their patentable inventions (IIRC, they did not dispossess them of copyright because they needed the useful idiot arts faculty to vote for the patent changes) The late Ross Anderson at the Comp.Sci.Department and I worked up my idea to organise all academics to donate their IP to a company which would licence it back to them provided the Uni was not a co-owner or a sublicensee etc. It was going to be called “Non Placet Limited”, it does not please (what is said to vote against against a motion in the Senate)…. Good for you! A pity it didn’t work. As AI nurses reshape hospital care, human nurses are pushing back – Associated Press “The group raised new alarms in January when Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the incoming health secretary, suggested AI nurses “as good as any doctor” could help deliver care in rural areas.” I want to see all the Kennedys and their ilk using AI nurses and doctors – without questioning the BS. Let it be tested on them. They eant it so badly. Be the guinea pig. I’m sure that before you used one of those AI nurses, that they would make you sign a waiver absolving them of any resulting bad incident up to and including death. And if you refused, then you can’t see that AI nurse. Can’t see a real doctor or nurse either though as that AI nurse replaced them and they no longer work their. Real doctors and nurses are for those who can afford them. Sounds about right “Up to 90% of arms, munitions destroyed in Kursk Region belong to NATO — Russian diplomat” To be expected. For months now Zelensky has thrown his best formations into Kursk to try to get a breakthrough but they have all been stopped cold. In addition, Zelensky was sending the last of his best equipment to Kursk as well up to and including Abram tanks. As this pocket started to shrink, I would have expected NATO to pump in any and all weaponry that they could scrounge to try to stop Kursk from collapsing altogether. Now that it is mostly over, I am not surprised to see huge stocks of NATO weaponry being picked up by the Russians. Makes you wonder though. Like with Afghanistan, will Trump demand that Russia hand back all that NATO weaponry or face sanctions? But I think that his teeth will grind when he sees all those tanks and weapons – especially American ones – on display in military museums in Moscow. I’m curious how much of that weaponry can be re-furbished and re-purposed by Russia for the battlefield. It would be hilarious to see an Abrams tank with a Russian flag rolling into Kharkov. Or an Aussie Bushmaster vehicle with the SMO markings used to storm Kherson. Kiev will sell parts and ammunition. Finding spare parts is a problem the western stuff breaks so often. The black market will work. Would be more hilarious to copy what the UK/EU countries do and take a tank or vehicle from one of those countries that was donated to the Ukraine & captured and park it outside their Embassy in Moscow. After all, turnaround is fair play. Some of them will be sent to Iran. Since the Iranians are masters of reverse engineering, they may be able to create new weapons for the Palestinian resistance. >>>Ultra-processed babies: are toddler snacks one of the great food scandals of our time? of course. I don’t need the Guardian to tell me that. Reminds me of my, ostensibly “health-conscious,” cousin. She spends a fortune at Whole Foods….only to stock her pantry w/the Whole Foods-brand, organic versions of shelf-stable snacks, and plastic sippy pouches (high salt, high sugar, high industrial seed oils, low satiety). Of course, I’m never going to give her the “errr, aware you aware that….” lecture, lol. I’ve always wondered if those plastic applesauce-yogurt sippy-pouches are one of many sources of BPA, etc. I suppose you could make raw snacks out of babies, but public acceptance is probably improved by ultra-processing. Terrific antidotes today, thank you. Of course fox loves music! I have a PhD student who gives guitar concerts to moose at night in the field. They are quite appreciative and curious. Orpheus was real;^) moose – guitar fox – banjo elephant – piano cow – trombone David Samuels, Rapid Onset. Tablet. Important for its attempt to bury Obama rather than to praise him. This observation alone is worth the time you spend on the long essay: ‘The Obama Democratic Party (ODP) was a kind of balancing mechanism between the power and money of the Silicon Valley oligarchs and their New York bankers; the interests of bureaucratic and professional elites who shuttled between the banks and tech companies and the work of bureaucratic oversight; the ODP’s own sectarian constituencies, which were divided into racial and ethnic categories like “POC,” “MENA,” and “Latinx,” whose bizarre bureaucratic nomenclature signaled their inherent existence as top-down containers for the party’s new-age spoils system; and the world of billionaire-funded NGOs that provided foot-soldiers and enforcers for the party’s efforts at social transformation.’ Also important for Samuels’s own hobbyhorses and his failure to break new ground. To wit: –Obama did all of this more or less on his own, somehow? I don’t believe in the Great Man excuse for history. –Obama is a product of the Democratic Party, rather than leading an incursion from outside. So the Clintons are involved in here somewhere, eh? –The author seems to be much too convinced that his rubric is “airtight.” Yet the current war (and genocide) in Ukraine is a proxy war based on Western lies and very much on the unwillingness of the Russians to publicize much. The West is spilling secret information constantly, announcing its addled plans, and screaming its soon-to-be-made mistakes. The Russians don’t say much. The Russian concession to the digital world is to send out the wildly intelligent and witty Maria Zakharova – but she was invented by Jay Ward way back when as Natasha Fatal –The author slips on the “genocide in Gaza,” which he offers as a meme. What happened here is very interesting: The Palestinians were finally able to get the world to see them on social media. The exception that tests the rule? Or is Samuels’s too-clean structure a hollow figure made from pipe cleaners? See below in which Netanyahu becomes a savior. Oh. –David Axelrod as evil genius? –Elon Musk as one of three saviors? “Musk, meanwhile, was entirely and sincerely his own man—a privilege that came in part from being the richest man in America, and in part from the nature of his businesses, which the Obama cadres appear to have misunderstood.” –And then the Holy Book of Netanyahu. Sheesh. –Obama may deserve revenge. This essay isn’t it. –And I’m Saint Joseph, the father of god (feastday tomorrow: Send adoration.) Yeah, it might have been a tad more palatable if the writer had used Obama Administration as the subject throughout the story instead of just Obama. Like Trump Administration should be used instead of Trump. Yup, he lost me once his priors on Covid, Musk, Israel and Iran took over what had been a ln interesting article with some valid observations. Still worth the read, but with critical thinking and a spoonful of informed skepticism. I thought this essay was brilliant, right up until this gem: “the idea that Iran was itself a formidable adversary—was a mess of lies. Iran was not and never was a regional power, capable of “balancing” traditional American allies. It was a totalitarian shit hole regime that is deeply hated by its own people and throughout the region, entirely dependent on American backing in its efforts to gain a nuclear bomb.” Frankly, the essay up to that point *is* briliant and it has given me a new way to think about Obama, about Musk/Twitter and about David Samuels…. I overlooked the Covid points because he isn’t necessarily wrong in writing about how the digital false consciousness manufactured “consent” to unreasonable measures (the relatives of the dying could have been FFP3 masked and allowed to visit and enforced to quarantine at properly ventilated and invigilated facilities rather than leave their loved ones to die alone…). Also… autistic traits and possibly ADHD are a superpower. You cannot manufacture consent with people who don’t give a shit about other’s feelings but really have to know THE FACTS. Could non-autistic Elon – say, Tim Cook or Larry Ellison – have bought twitter? This article is the high-blown answer to Armchair Warlord’s simple question: why is the twiiterverse of commentary on Ukraine from people with anime pictures in their bio’s (and no Ukraine flags) so much more right on all the big questions than MSM and the entire pllkitucsl class. Because they are immune at least in part to external voices, either because they hear only their own (autism) or they hear loads of others (ADHF, not stable internal monologue but a cacophany). The video of Katherine Franke (“police state watch”) explaining the extortion technique Trump uses when “negotiating” is a must watch. “Introduction of brownshirts” is now officially on my bingo card. I’m with you on the “Brownshirts” issue. It is the next logical step. We must also remember that the Brownshirts were part of a larger ecology of violent militias at the time. Who today remembers that the Communists also fought “in the streets” back then? It is also instructive to remember that most of the brawlers doing the fighting in the streets then were ex-military veterans of the Great War. All that is needed to make the analogy complete is for America to lose a decently sized war. “Beware the Ides of March — Are Trump and Netanyahu, Acting in Tandem, Committing Political Suicide?” It’s amazing in its own way. Trump has this huge agenda in how he wants to reshape America into his idea of what America should look like. Probably something like 1890s America – but without all that industry. Now after only two months, he is ready to jump into the Ukrainian rasputitsa at the instigation of the UK and France instead of just walking away. This could very easily now become Trump’s war. And if that wasn’t enough, it looks like at the instigation of Israel that he wants to get involved in a shooting war in the Middle east. For now it it is Yemen but he is already threatening Iran. That aborted attack on Iran last year should have shown him that that may not be so easily done. Trump probably think that in any room, that he is the smartest one there but that ain’t necessarily so. That would have to be a pretty small room, or one with only a handful of people in it. Trump Administration. The reality TV star isn’t thinking of all of this himself. – ‘The European Parliament Confirmed Poland’s Centrality To The Bloc’s Eastern Security Strategy’ – Andrew Korybko There are many important issues embedded in this article, as well as the others by Korybko that he cites in the text. I note two here. First, his “New Iron Curtain” terminology emphasizes a key point that isn’t discussed often enough in the face of Russia’s impending “defeat” of Ukraine. This is that the NUMBER ONE priority of this long-planned proxy war was to *sever the ties between Russia and Europe* that had been developing since the end of the Soviet Union. Atlanticist-oriented neocons have been writing about this since the 1990s. Their fear was not just the re-emergence of a Russia that might challenge US military supremacy someday, but the economic challenge of a Europe – especially Germany – reintegrated with Russia. The Nordstream pipeline was the ultimate symbol of this danger. Far from a “defeat” for the US/NATO alliance, in terms of severing these ties and building a “new Iron Curtain,” the Ukraine war has been an unqualified success. Mission accomplished! So much for “keeping Russia out and Germany down.” How about the “keeping America in” part? This is another area in which a lot of people seem to be celebrating a bit prematurely (with Yves and a few others being significant exceptions). Many commentators, even those critical of the US/NATO project like Korybko, simply assume that Trumpian “populism” has won in the US and we are getting out of Europe, leaving our poor European “allies” high and dry. Now they’ll have to defend themselves, while the US withdraws, perhaps to concentrate on warmongering with China or finishing our destruction of the Middle East. But there is a very powerful and bipartisan Atlanticist Establishment in the US. There are some factional disagreements, but they all — neoliberals; neoconservatives; the huge arms industry, its lobbyists, and Congressional lackeys: the national security apparatus: the Europhile liberal media/academia complex – all of them, have a massive material and/or ideological investment in the Atlanticist project. They’ve managed to capture (almost) all of the European political class. They spent 8 years carrying out war against Trump for this reason. Do people really think they are going to give up now? Are the “populists” now in control? Really? Lots of other issues suggested in this piece (e.g. the centrality of Poland in the New Cold War). But these two are the most striking to me. European Russophobia and Atlanticism are two sides of the same coin. Like Janus. And all those in the Trump Administration talking about the “stock market doesn’t matter’…. What are their short and put positions? “Vote crow next general election.” Never. Rook voter for life. Crow is fur eatin’, not votin’. https://fortune.com/2025/03/14/elon-musk-tesla-cybertruck-delivery-halt-owners-complain-of-metal-sides-falling-off/ Elon Musk’s Tesla reportedly halts Cybertruck deliveries as owners complain of metal sides falling off I’ll guess it’s 80% incompetence and 20% malice. (This is who programs are being cut for so that more govt money can go to his businesses?) https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-discovers-magic-money-computers-or-how-the-u-s-financial-system-actually-works-43a21350?mod=home_lead/ “….Going back to Musk, what he’s said to have found is that the government doesn’t track terribly well the money it spends — for example, not coding each payment for precisely what it’s going toward. He told Cruz that he attributes 80% of that sloppiness to incompetence and the other 20% to malice.” ‘Elon Musk’s Tesla reportedly halts Cybertruck deliveries as owners complain of metal sides falling off’ Very much looking forward to the day that their fronts fall off – and the comments that will flow from that. Beat me to it! To state the obvious, if you were actually interested in cutting “waste, fraud, and abuse” … seems I have been hearing that phrase for the last 60 or 70 years … the logical place to start is the so-called defense budget. It is the largest slush fund. But no, we must go after Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare as there are the largest pools of money that might be put into private hands so the greedy bastards can suck out as much as they can get away with. Since we have a government of, by, and for the rich, the fat cats, the plutocrats, the oligarchs, the looters … I cannot decide the most descriptive word for them … they must be allowed to belly up, elbowing their way in. Is the appropriate emotion here disgust or rage? Both at the same time? I receive Social Security and Medicare. I paid whatever taxes were required. And now some ginned up department fronted by a really rich guy wants to blow up long established programs that work reasonably well in the name of what the profit driven call efficiency? The definition of efficiency that fuels private equity? The definition that has seen so many businesses sucked dry until the husk resembles what remains when a spider has finished a meal. Welcome to the American Nightmare. Aljazeera repeating a lie by Marco Rubio, that the US “coordinated with Russia” on the Yemeni attacks. This sort of thing at the margin is not helpful to the US improving relations with Russia, let alone getting to any sort of big deal. From the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the call: During the conversation, Marco Rubio informed him of the US decision to launch a military operation against the Houthi forces in the Red Sea region. Sergey Lavrov, in response to the arguments by the American representative, stressed the need for all parties to immediate cease the use of force and the importance for all sides to engage in political dialogue so as to find a solution that would prevent further bloodshed. Does that really qualify as total denial of Rubio’s claim? “Stressing the need for” and “totally objecting to” are different…IMO. First, the text was from the official Russian readout. It is vanishingly unlikely that it was issued to rebut Rubio. Second, “coordinated with Russia” = Russia participated in the planning. In reality, Rubio presented the US plan to Russia. Third, Russia objected to the attack by calling for diplomacy instead. So yes, Rubio lied. If the Russians leave any room for misinterpretation (or lies), it will be taken. I doubt Rubio cared one iota what the readout said. He had his story. No one reads readouts, including journos who ought to. You don’t seem to begin to get how offensive it is, and more important, disruptive to Russia’s relationships, to depict Russia as being on board with US shelling of Houthis when it absolutely is not. Rubio, the asshole he is, was probably relying on Lavrov not correcting Rubio publicly due to not wanting to sour the Trump-Putin phone call. Some poor Russian MF junior probably had to call all over the Middle East correcting the Rubio fabrications. I further do not understand why you defend America persisting in bad faith behavior. I don’t defend it. I just point it out. Basically, I’m not thinking anything has changed until I see it changed. Until Russia gets a security agreement that makes sense to them, it still seems like the plan to extend Russia is game on. “The Kingdom of Judea vs. The State of Israel” Just through demographics alone, I could very easily see a situation where secularists in Israel will become an oppressed minority but am not sure how that would work out as they pay nearly all the taxes, man nearly all the military and fill all the civil service jobs. So maybe a tolerated minority? The position of women would sink as the religious right would demand that all women leave the Israeli military and go back home to be out of sight and out of mind. You think that I am joking but when Hillary was SecState and went to Israel, a major religious publication airbrushed her and any other women out of the official photos taken. It is that weird and now these same people want to run the country. I don’t see an eventual Israeli civil war – maybe – but I can see a collapse of the State as professional Israelis will just bail out of the country. “Magnolias are so ancient they’re pollinated by beetles — because bees didn’t exist yet” This is an amazing story this and one that I would never have suspected. Magnolias were contemporary with the dinosaurs? And they are pollinated by beetles? Before bees I suppose that having beetles pollinate flowers was common but it looks like magnolias surviving all those time shows us the proof of this being so. So years ago we lived in Kentucky and often visited The Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill (https://shakervillageky.org/) outside of Lexington where I fell in love with Southern Magnolias, the big evergreens. I have been trying to grow a couple of supposedly cold-tolerant varieties here in central NY and two years ago (thanks to global warming?) I finally had a few big, waxy, lightly fragrant blossoms. And yes I noticed tiny black beetles in the flowers. I too am delighted to know more about their phylogeny. Magnolias are also pollinated by slugs. They and Old Dixie have a good PR team. Strange fruit…. Trump hypes up tensions with Iran Indian Punchline. Important Trump had shorter peacemaker stint than Obama. – ‘Every Administration Since Obama Has Been Bombing Yemen, Yet…’ – Ian Welsh (Micael T) – “Scott Ritter Should Be A Nobel Prize Winner…” It probably won’t shake my fundamental pessimism, but I’ve been struck by the very harsh criticism of Trump over the Yemen bombing by anti-war conservatives like Judge Napolitano and Larry Johnson. I saw Johnson on Nima’s Dialogue Works yesterday, and he really lit into Trump and defended AnsarAllah in terms very similar to Ian Welsh, as the only entity with the guts to stand up against the Israeli genocide. It does make you wonder what effect, if any, Trump’s apparent doubling-down on the MIGA project will have on his support. I guess we are seeing whose support is most important to him. What a world. See my Patrick Lawrence link below. And Gilbert Doctorow–who says he knew someone in Trump’s real estate operation–continues to defend Donald as an underappreciated if not totally stable genius. https://gilbertdoctorow.com/2025/03/18/why-alternative-media-are-down-on-trump/ If you ignore everything that comes out of Trump’s mouth and his all caps tweets then maybe that has weight, but personally I don’t believe a word of it. Lawrence says we may come to prefer Trump 1 to Trump 2. Trump is no genius but he is different from all the wonks. Fingers crossed that disaster doesn’t loom. Of course for Gazans it’s happening right now. I agree. The Lawrence piece is excellent as usual. And Doctorow misunderstands the Trump phenomenon in my opinion. About Trump’s “political skills” he says this: “One big factor in the underappreciation or miscomprehension of what Trump is doing comes from the underappreciation of his political skills. These skills should have been crystal clear from the very first days of his administration when he successfully pushed through the confirmation process ALL of his candidates for the top slots in his administration…” “Was this success in the confirmation votes just the result of the outstanding merits of the candidates and of their brilliant testimony in tough hearings? Of course not. It was the direct result of Trump’s marshalling his political skills, calling in chits, i.e. IOUs, issuing warnings of hell to pay in the next electoral cycle if he were to be defied.” Trump’s primary “political skill” is demagoguery – his ability to gain broad public support by pretending to be one of the “people” in opposition to “the elite.” This was made much easier by the entire Establishment joining together to oppose him, playing to his strengths. So Doctorow is not wrong in pointing to fear as Trump’s main weapon; most Republicans would not support him if they weren’t deathly afraid of how their constituents would view any opposition. But when it comes to his “titanic struggle with the Deep State” at home or abroad he is a rank amateur. As far as providing an improvement on foreign policy, he is guided by no principles or philosophy or real understanding that I can see. My prediction is that the Blob will be able to undermine any positive tendencies toward reducing tensions in Ukraine (see my above comment). And regarding Israel – Lawrence covers that well. Is this due to bribery? Blackmail? Some delusional belief in an “Abraham Accords” solution to the Middle East? Who knows. But I would better appreciate his ability to reduce Congress to sniveling sycophants if that actually lead to something positive. Unfortunately, I’m leaning more toward the disaster side right now. The video about the Federal negotiations with Columbia strikes me as an example of Trump being able to count, although here not votes but cashflow. The tactic of putting your counterparty’s financial balls in a vice until they sign your deal is scorched earth negotiation 101, i.e. pure NY real estate. He has no third term and he has no afterlife unless he permanently remakes America to be safe for Trumps (and thus his “allies”)…. One of the features of Western politics over the last decade has been the collapse of the traditional left/right paradigm. Pronouncing someone a left winger or right winger is no longer a reliable guide to what they think. I’m trying to stop using the terms all together, although after decades of use it’s hard to stop. Not only are right wingers hewing to positions that I would have formerly associated with the left (anti-war, respect for treaties and other nations, reverence for human life), but we have also seen nominally left people and parties abandoning traditional left positions in favor of performative activities so they can pile on to Trump and others, and so they can support the increasingly useless and center-right Democratic party. I don’t know if this change is exactly a bad thing, but it does mean you have to examine people and positions on a case-by-case basis. Johnson and Napolitano are good examples of people who don’t conveniently fit into any kind of pre-existing mold. I’m very glad to see this criticism. It has been disturbing to watch people like Taibbi and Greenwald, both of whom I’ve followed for a couple decades or so now, be tarred as “conservative mouthpieces” in recent years for being critical of Biden, when they have been very consistent in their criticisms of those in power over the years no matter who is president. It’s been much more recently that I started following Judge Napolitano and the guests that frequent his and other similar podcasts. They were also highly critical of Biden and hopeful that Trump would be an improvement. I’m heartened to see that they are sticking to their principles too – and it reassures me that I’ve been listening to the right people. On a related note, Greenwald had a good show yesterday, talking about Trump defying the courts, and reminding us that he is far from the first to do so and is following in the footsteps other recent administrations – https://rumble.com/v6qso9y-system-update-show-424.html I agree Greenwald also had an excellent show today, playing lots of clips of Trump campaigning as the peace president” — to cheering crowds — and excoriating him for the bombing of Yemen. MAGA folks or liberals? They each have their own type. My apologies if this has been posted. I did a search and couldn’t find it previously posted. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-10/musk-s-doge-team-sends-private-equity-veterans-to-social-security-agency Musk Taps Private Equity Veterans to Aid DOGE at Social Security Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has sent three individuals with experience in private equity and finance to the Social Security Administration, highlighting the focus that President Donald Trump is putting on rooting out waste and fraud in the nation’s social insurance programs. Among those tapped for the task are Antonio Gracias of Valor Equity Partners, who also served on the board of Tesla Inc. and was an early investor in SpaceX — two of Musk’s companies — as well as Scott Coulter, formerly of Lone Pine Capital, and Michael Russo, formerly of Shift4, according to people familiar with the moves who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss them. And the looting continues. ‘”Any American receiving Social Security benefits will continue to receive them.

A friend who decided to take his SS payments when he was 66 about 6 years ago, was told there must be a mistake-as he’d been getting payments since he hit 62, or I should say somebody else was, unbeknownst to him. Interesting anecdotes. Multiple questions are SOP in both the private and public sectors. They’re being careful. It doesn’t necessarily indicate there’s been “quite a bit” of fraud, whatever that may mean. The Social Security Adminstration indicates there’s been very little fraud, but I suspect that may not mean much to you. So, this proposal is justified? DOGE isn’t interested in fraud. It hasn’t provided any evidence, to my knowledge, of Social Security fraud after Elon and Trump claims (lies) re millions of dead people getting SS. Yet they keep repeating it. DOGE wants to break things so agencies will function poorly, thus justifying eliminating them. When was the last time you were asked what high school you went to and the year of graduation? That was one of the questions, they were playing for keeps~ Safeguards are needed, SSA is using those safeguards, and I’d think they help to prevent fraud. Why do you think they ask them? You said a fraudulent Wukchumi could not have answered those questions. In fact, if they’re being used, and work, there would be a low amount of fraud. I used to get irritated when asked security questions but quickly realized they were helping to protect my interests. And, I know many people who receive Social Security and none have had any fraudulent issues like your friend. So, I suspect that may be a rarity. We’re supposed to trust the richest guy on the planet who thinks Social Security is a Ponzi scheme, is obviously ideologically opposed to it, to ferret out fraud? Pretty much my experience as well. I refuse to sign up for “id.me” or now I guess it’s “login.gov”. VA and IRS want me to use “login.gov” as well, so I guess my online accounts with them will go stale.

In this episode, we’re joined by Professor Steve Keen, Author of New Economics Manifesto, renowned economist and expert in monetary systems, for a compelling discussion about the hidden mechanics of our global financial system and what it means for investors. If you’re curious about the interplay between private debt, government spending, and the real drivers of economic growth in an era of policy missteps and financial risks, this interview is a must-watch. Re: Trump and Putin Talk (per the Grauniad): «18 min. ago. The Kremlin’s readout (in Russian) said Trump put forward “a proposal for the parties to the conflict to mutually refrain from attacks on energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days”. Meanwhile the White House readout said The Kremlin has continually claimed, falsely, that it has never attacked power plants used to generate electricity for civilians. For instance, following last month’s bilateral talks in Riyadh, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said: We clarified [to the US] that we have never threatened systems supplying power to civilians, and that only the sites directly supplying the Ukrainian armed forces have been our targets. [The Grauniad editorializes:] But repeated attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been a key element of Russia’s war effort. … » Devil’s Own Advocate… I get the feeling that a role reversal is in order and we Golden Billionaires are gonna be pauperazzi soon. I see our new role as a human export gig like say Filipinos ending up working elsewhere as the pay at home won’t cut it. But where do we end up going, certainly not to ex-Golden Billionaire haunts? re: Taibbi vs. elite academia Does anyone happen to have read Taibbi´s latest text on hgher education and double standard (as I suspect)? And could briefly summarize the points in it? The Angst of the Well-Endowed One enormous facet of the education controversy remains ignored Matt Taibbi From Thomas Edsall in the New York Times this morning: Marc Andreessen, a billionaire venture capitalist, cryptocurrency investor and pivotal but unofficial adviser to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, made the case in a recent interview that the entire system of American higher education should be shuttered and abandoned… The American university system commands worldwide respect. What would prompt a call for its abolition? At Johns Hopkins, the loss of $800 million in U.S.A.I.D. grants has forced the school to lay off 2,200 foreign and domestic workers… The Trump administration announced that it was cutting $400 million in grants to Columbia University “due to the school’s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.” Twenty years ago, maybe even ten, I’d have found these stories about Elon Von Hitler-Musk detonating thousands of campus-related jobs horrifying. But the education sob stories now flying off the presses are a Burj Khalifa of “needs context.” A gigantic lie of omission is a constant feature of these stories: p.s. I had been argueing along this line. Of course this has been an issue in US educationa for a very long time. So none of it makes the Trump peoples´ current rampage in any way more honest. But to quote Craig Murray´s latest text, it´s the “rot of democracy”. Only where the foundation already was corrupt any of this could be pulled off. In Germany we had a very sad Tuesday. I did intend a comment on that which was however littered with curse words and I luckily fell asleep. So I will spare you that. The decision on the war budget passed with 513 votes. 489 were necessary – 203 voted against. There were none abstaining. FDP wants to go to court over this. Why? Pure lip service. Everyone should know the Constitutional Court is – fucking – w.o.r.t.h.l.e.s.s. Among CDU, GREENS, SPD there were 3 (!!!!) who voted against: Martin Diedenhofen (SPD), Mario Czaja (CDU) Canan Bayram (GREENS) Now that´s real democracy. p.s. Mrs. and Mr. Clinton visiting Berlin. So if you want to throw cream tarts now is the time. Echoes of 1914 and the SPD opening the door for WW I by voting yes on the war bond issue? https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2004/08/spdd-a06.html “Wer hat uns verraten? Sozialdemokraten! Die sogenannten ‘Demokraten’!” And five years later the same sort of people were saying that may the hand of the person signing the armistice wither. Well as far as that is concerned I have come to be thankful for the – I never expected to say this until a few years ago – Russian nuclear and non-nuclear deterrents. i.e. the parallels to 1914 end with the vote for war budget. In fact: Russians have to fight so we don´t have to. Foreign Policy has a new piece on the Oreshnik. I haven´t had time yet to sift through it but it makes me think that FP writing this is the safest sign that Pentagon finally has grasped it and then informed Hegseth´s team and that surfaced eventually with Rubio and Co. FP here: The Latest Russian Missile Is Bad News for NATO Oreshnik is a different beast from its predecessors. By Decker Eveleth, an associate research analyst at CNA, a nonprofit research and analysis organization based in Washington. https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/17/russia-missile-nato-oreshnik-ukraine-war-conventional-weapons/ re: Romania Was trying to post link on Romania.

China and Hong Kong condemn ‘bullying’ following deal struck amid US pressure. China is scrutinising a deal struck by a Hong Kong company to sell ports at the Panama Canal to a United States financial firm. Beijing directed multiple agencies on Tuesday to examine the transaction, according to Bloomberg News. The deal was earlier hailed by President Donald Trump, who has accused China of seeking to control the strategic waterway. Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison said earlier this month that it had agreed to sell most of its global ports business worth $22.8bn, including assets near the Panama Canal, to a group led by US-based investment company BlackRock. A week after the announcement, China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted commentaries, calling the sale a betrayal of China that neglected national interests. The deal, which is yet to be sealed, is now being investigated for security risks and antitrust violations on the orders of senior Chinese leaders, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing said reporters should ask other Chinese authorities about the report. “I would like to stress that in principle, China has been firmly opposing infringing on or undermining other countries’ legitimate rights and interests with economic coercion and bullying,” the spokesperson said. Those words reflected earlier comments from Hong Kong’s leader John Lee. “[The Hong Kong] government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises,” Lee told reporters. “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.” Hutchison did not immediately respond to the reports of scrutiny by Beijing. The company has previously said the deal is “purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports”. The firm agreed to negotiations with the BlackRock consortium on an exclusive basis for 145 days according to a statement. While the deal has not yet been finalised, it was not immediately clear what levers, if any, China could pull to block the deal, given the business that Hutchison is selling is based outside China and Hong Kong, and it is itself based in the Cayman Islands. Trump has previously called for the Panama Canal to be removed from “Chinese control”. Numerous US politicians have criticised Hutchison’s operations at the Panama Canal as a security risk.

Title: Bitcoin Storm Could Be Brewing, Crypto OnChain Options Platform Derive Says

The calm that has returned to the bitcoin (BTC) market may be short-lived, potentially setting the stage for a storm that could trigger significant price volatility, according to insights from the decentralized crypto on-chain options platform Derive. Since March 12, BTC has settled in the $80K-$85K range in a consolidation typically seen after a notable directional move. Prices tanked from $100K to under $80K in preceding weeks due to several factors, including President Donald Trump's tariffs and disappointment about the lack of new purchases in the U.S. strategic BTC reserve. With the latest consolidation, key volatility metrics have declined, nearing monthly lows. Volatility, however, is mean-reverting, meaning the low-volatility regime could soon pave the way for price turbulence, according to Derive. "BTC’s weekly at-the-money (ATM) volatility has dipped below 50% to 49%, approaching monthly lows of 45%. Realized volatility has also dropped from 91% at the start of the month to 54% today," Nick Forster, founder of Derive, wrote in a recent note shared with CoinDesk. It is important to remember that volatility is price agnostic, meaning that the expected increase in volatility does not indicate the direction of the price movement in bitcoin. “Volatility is mean-reverting, so we can expect it to rise soon, likely to levels seen in February (60-70%)," Forster added. Whether prices rise or fall, volatility can increase, suggesting that significant price swings could occur in either direction. According to Derive, several factors could trigger volatility, including "a ceasefire (or lack thereof) in Ukraine, or significant shifts in crypto regulatory policy under the Trump administration." Derive is the world's leading on-chain AI-powered options protocol with a total value locked of nearly $100 million. The protocol has registered a cumulative trading volume of $15 billion to date. Wednesday's Federal Reserve rate decision could move markets as well. The central bank is likely to keep rates unchanged, with traders pricing two to three rate cuts later this year. But a dovish surprise could recharge bulls' engines for a sharp move higher. Potential Fed rate cuts, however, could be limited, according to BlackRock. "Markets have priced in about two to three 25 basis point rate cuts this year, versus expectations for just one earlier this year. We think this reflects U.S. recession fears even though economic condition don’t point to a downturn. Even if prolonged uncertainty hurts growth, we still see persistent inflation limiting how much the Fed can cut," BlackRock said in a weekly note. The expected volatility boom could happen to the downside should equity markets continue to fall, accelerating the decline in crypto prices.

Title: Press release: Sequana Medical Obtains Convertible Financing of EUR 4.0 Million from Major Shareholders and Committed Share Subscription Facility of up to EUR 60 Million from GEM

March 18, 2025 01:45 ET | Source: Sequana Medical NV Sequana Medical NV Sequana Medical Obtains Convertible Financing of EUR 4.0 Million from Major Shareholders and Committed Share Subscription Facility of up to EUR 60 Million from GEM Ghent, Belgium – 18 March 2025 – Sequana Medical NV (Euronext Brussels: SEQUA) (the "Company" or "Sequana Medical"), a pioneer in the treatment of fluid overload in liver disease, heart failure and cancer, announces today that it has secured significant additional financing through (i) the granting of a new unsecured subordinated convertible loan of EUR 4.0 million (the "2025 Convertible Loan") by certain of its major shareholders, namely Partners in Equity V B.V. ("Partners in Equity") and EQT Health Economics 3 Coöperatief U.A. ("EQT"), and (ii) the entering into a share subscription facility agreement (the "Facility") with GEM Global Yield LLC SCS ("GEM") for up to EUR 20 million in cash (with Sequana Medical's option to increase the commitment to up to EUR 60 million in cash, once the aforementioned EUR 20 million has been drawn down) (the "Capital Commitment"). GEM is a USD 3.4 billion, Luxembourg based alternative investment group with offices in Paris, New York, and Bahamas. Pursuant to the Facility, GEM agreed to commit, subject to certain conditions, an amount up to the aforementioned Capital Commitment, within a maximum term of three years in exchange for new ordinary shares in Sequana Medical and subject to certain share lending arrangements being in place. These financing arrangements are expected to extend the Company's cash runway to the end of 2025 based on expected drawdowns of the initial EUR 20 million Capital Commitment under the Facility. In addition, the Company agreed with its existing debt providers to restructure several features of the Company's debt, subject to certain conditions and as further described below. Ian Crosbie, Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical, commented: "2025 is a landmark year for Sequana Medical with the US commercial launch of the alfapump® planned for mid-Q3, following the FDA approval of our PMA for this breakthrough device in December 2024. We are very pleased with the strong feedback we have received from US hepatologists who are eager to offer the alfapump® to their patients, and the potential that it offers to virtually eliminate the need for therapeutic paracentesis and transform their quality of life. Through this financing package, we have the platform to demonstrate the clear market opportunity for alfapump®, and our ability to effectively access this through our small specialty commercial team targeting US liver transplant centers. We are delighted with the continued strong support from our key shareholders and lenders, as well as the new equity commitment from GEM." About the unsecured investor financing of EUR 4.0 million Under the 2025 Convertible Loan, Partners in Equity and EQT will grant a new unsecured subordinated convertible loan to the Company for an initial aggregate principal amount of EUR 4.0 million. In addition to the new EUR 4.0 million loan, any amounts owed by the Company to Partners in Equity and EQT as lenders under the convertible loan agreement entered into on 30 September 2024 between, among others, the Company as borrower and Partners in Equity and EQT as lenders (the "2024 Convertible Loan Agreement") will be rolled-over to the 2025 Convertible Loan together with, in accordance with the provisions of the 2024 Convertible Loan Agreement, a conversion fee of 33% on such amounts. Further, the other lenders under the 2024 Convertible Loan Agreement (the "Remaining 2024 CLA Lenders") will have the option to also accede to the 2025 Convertible Loan within 10 business days from the date of the 2025 Convertible Loan. In case a Remaining 2024 CLA Lender elects to accede to the 2025 Convertible Loan, any amounts owed to such Remaining 2024 CLA Lender plus a conversion fee of 33% on such amounts shall thus be rolled-over to the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement. Any lender under the 2025 Convertible Loan may also at any time increase the amount of loan provided by it thereunder, up to an aggregate principal amount of new money under the 2025 Convertible Loan of EUR 14 million (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding any amounts rolled over to the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement (as described above) and excluding any interest compounded as from the date falling one business day after the date of 2025 Convertible Loan). The principal amount and interest of the 2025 Convertible Loan can be converted (in whole or in part) by the lenders for new shares of the Company at any time before the 2025 Convertible Loan has been repaid, converted or settled, at a conversion price equal to the lower of (i) the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average trading price per share of the Company's shares traded on Euronext Brussels during the period of twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day before the date on which the Company has received the equity conversion exercise notice, minus a discount of 25%, and (ii) the issue price of the new shares issued by the Company at the occasion of the most recent future equity financing before receipt of the equity conversion exercise notice, minus a discount of 25%. A lender, however, cannot acquire more than 29.9% of the outstanding issued shares of the Company through an equity conversion. If the Company enters into a new (subordinated) convertible loan which includes conversion or settlement rights equivalent to those under the 2025 Convertible Loan, each lender will be entitled to convert its 2025 Convertible Loan (in whole or in part) plus a conversion fee of 33% of all amounts owed under the 2025 Convertible Loan into the new (subordinated) convertible loan. In addition, subject to certain conditions, following the hive-down of the DSR® business into a separate entity set-up by the Company ("DSRCo") (which hive-down has already taken place) and in the event of a hive-down of the alfapump® business into a separate entity to be set-up by the Company ("LiverCo"), if the Company obtains a potential equity investment or a convertible or exchangeable debt investment into LiverCo or DSRCo for an amount of at least EUR 15 million and EUR 7.5 million respectively (a "Hive-Down Future Investment"), each lender will have the possibility to have its loan repaid (in whole or in part) by means of a payment in kind, consisting of a transfer by the Company to the relevant lender of shares issued or to be issued by LiverCo or by DSRCo. The number of LiverCo or DSRCo shares to be transferred will be equal to (i) the relevant portion of the 2025 Convertible Loan to repaid in kind (in principal and interest), divided by (ii) the issue price of the new shares which are or will be issued by LiverCo or DSRCo at the occasion of the potential Hive-Down Future Investment, minus a discount of 25%. Unless the 2025 Convertible Loan has been converted or repaid in kind as aforementioned, the respective loans of each lender will need to be repaid in cash in case of default or upon request subject to prior notice, provided, however, that a repayment request may only occur on or after the later of: (A) (x) the date falling one year after the date on which the hive-down of the alfapump® business and the respective Hive-Down Future Investment has been completed; or (y) the date on which the Company and the lenders would determine, in good faith, that the Hive-Down of the alfapump® business is not reasonably likely to occur; and (B) the date falling two years after the date of the 2025 Convertible Loan. The 2025 Convertible Loan bears interest of 15% per annum, which shall be compounded on a monthly basis. In case of conversion or repayment in kind, the minimum amount to be converted for new shares or a new convertible loan will in any event be deemed to be 10% of the aggregate initial principal amount of the loans provided by the relevant lender (minus any compounded and accrued interest which has already been paid, converted or paid in kind to the relevant lender). The proceeds from the loan will be used to finance general working capital requirements (including, without limitation, the implementation of the relevant preparatory steps with respect to each Hive-Down). About the GEM committed share subscription facility of up to EUR 60 million The Capital Commitment will be released on the basis of drawdowns by the Company in the form of subscription request notices that the Company has the right to issue at its sole discretion. Each such subscription request notice shall require GEM, subject to certain conditions, to subscribe for new ordinary shares that are to be issued by the Company. The drawdown amount reflected in such subscription request notices will be determined by the Company in function of certain parameters such as the Company's trading volume during a certain lookback period preceding the relevant subscription request notice, and the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the relevant subscription request notice. The issue price of the new shares to be subscribed to by GEM upon settlement of a subscription request notice will be determined on the basis of 90% of the average volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares during a forward-looking pricing period (ranging between 1 and 20 consecutive trading days following the subscription request notice and ignoring certain knockout days), it being noted that such issue price shall not be lower than a floor price that can be set by the Company in the relevant subscription request notice (and which floor price may be different in each subscription request notice). After the aforementioned pricing period, GEM will have to subscribe for a number of new ordinary shares ranging between a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 150% of the drawdown amount requested to be subscribed for by the Company (subject to certain corrections). GEM agreed not to hold an excess of 19.9% of the ordinary shares of Sequana Medical. Existing shareholders Partners in Equity and LSP HEF Sequana Holding B.V. ("LSP") agreed to adhere to the Facility, and such lending shareholders will provide GEM a number of existing Sequana Medical shares for loan covering the draw down amount reflected in the relevant subscription notice request (the "Share Lending") and subject to certain additional and bilateral arrangements regarding the share lending arrangements provided for in the Facility and as set out in a share provision support agreement (the "Support Agreement"). The aforementioned lending shareholders are not compensated for providing the Share Lending to GEM, but related expenses will be covered by the Company. In consideration for entering into the Facility, GEM is entitled to receive warrants (subscription rights) to subscribe for up to 2,620,000 new ordinary shares of the Company. The Company will seek the approval by an extraordinary shareholders' meeting ("EGM") to issue the warrants. The warrant will give GEM the right to subscribe for new shares of the Company at an exercise price per underlying ordinary share that shall be equal to the lower of (x) EUR 1.95, and (y) 117% of the average volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares during the 10 trading days preceding the date on which the warrants will be issued by the EGM. The warrants will have a term of three years as of issuance, will be immediately exercisable, and will be subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. An affiliate of GEM is also entitled to a commitment fee of EUR 400,000, which will be settled in ordinary shares of the Company at an issue price that is equal to 90% of the average volume weighted average price (VWAP) of the Company's shares during the 10 trading days preceding the trading day preceding the date on which the relevant ordinary shares will be issued. The relevant share issue will in principle occur on the business day prior to the settlement of the Company's first subscription request notice. About the amendments to the existing loan agreements Together with the entering into the 2025 Convertible Loan and the Facility, the Company also entered into an amendment agreement (the "Kreos Amendment Agreement") pursuant to which certain repayment and other terms of the EUR 10,000,000 loan with Kreos Capital VII (UK) Limited (together with its affiliates "Kreos", and such loan the "Kreos Loan")1 will be amended. The main amendments to the Kreos Loan can be summarised as follows (for information purposes): The Company will also enter into amendments in relation to the EUR 4,300,000 partially convertible loan with PMV Standaardleningen NV (formerly known as PMV/z Leningen NV) ("PMV") (the "PMV Loan"). The main amendments to this loan consist of: Based upon the expected drawdowns of the initial 20 EUR million Capital Commitment under the Facility, the Company forecasts this financing package will extend Sequana Medical's cash runway to the end of 2025, while continuing its search for future funding and assessment of potential other options. Sequana Medical has chosen this method of fundraising as it believes it provides flexibility in this crucial year that will be punctuated by major milestones, including the expected commencement of US commercialization in the second half of 2025 through a small specialty sales force that it will establish to target 90 US liver transplant centers. Disclosures in accordance with Article 7:97, §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in relation to the Share Lending The following information is provided, as far as needed and applicable, pursuant to Article 7:97, §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the aforementioned Share Lending by Partners in Equity and LSP, the related adherence to the Facility between the Company and GEM, and the entering into of certain bilateral arrangements in relation to the Share Lending between the Company, Partners in Equity and LSP through the Support Agreement. Partners in Equity and LSP are shareholders of the Company and are represented on the board of directors of the Company. As a result, they could be considered as a "related party" within the meaning of the International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (IFRS), as referred to in Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. In view hereof, the board of directors of the Company applied, as far as needed and applicable, the procedure of Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the approval of the entering into of the Facility, and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending), and the related entering into of the Support Agreement. Ids van der Weij (a director, representing Partners in Equity) and Rudy Dekeyser (a director, representing EQT/LSP) did not participate in the deliberation and voting by the board of directors in relation to the approval of the entering into of the Facility, and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending), and the related entering into of the Support Agreement. Within the context of the aforementioned procedure, prior to this announcement and the entering into of the Facility by the Company and GEM, and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP, a committee of three independent directors of the Company (the "Committee") issued an advice to the board of directors in which the Committee assessed the entering into of the Facility, and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending), and the related entering into of the Support Agreement. In its advice to the board of directors, the Committee concluded the following: "The Committee believes that, under the current circumstances and considering the current immediate, short, and mid-term working capital needs of the Company, the contemplated entering into and execution of the SSFA, and the adherence thereto by PiE and LSP in the framework of the Share Lending (including the contemplated Capital Increases, the Share Lending, and the issuance of the GEM Warrants (although subject to shareholder approval) and the Commitment Fee Shares, which each form an integral part of the SSFA), as well as the contemplated entering into and execution of the related Support Agreement, are in the interest of the Company, its shareholders and other stakeholders. While entailing additional and important potential dilution and value loss for the holders of shares and share options of the Company as a result of the different share issuances contemplated in the SSFA, and while the Investor's trading (in particular sales) in the Company's shares under the share subscription facility reflected in the SSFA may have a downward pressure on the trading price of the Company's shares on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels, ultimately the terms of the SSFA do not seem unreasonable and seem commensurate to the risks of investing in the Company taking into account the refinancing difficulties of the Company and the fact that the SSFA will allow the Company to access equity financing in a fast, flexible and efficient manner to fund its activities and its ongoing working capital requirements, while further assessing financing options and without the obligation for the Company to make use of the relevant share subscription facility. The Committee notes in this regard that if the Company is not able to raise further funding in order to address its funding requirements, the Company's going concern can no longer be guaranteed. The Committee notes in particular that the Share Lending facility by PiE and LSP (who will not receive any compensation in this respect from the Company) will allow the Investor to hedge its risks against the amount that it has committed to subscribe to pursuant to the SSFA. Without the Share Lending facility and the willingness of PiE and LSP to adhere to the SSFA as Share Providers, the Investor would not have been willing to enter into the SSFA (as the Share Lending forms an integral part of the SSFA). On balance, therefore, the Committee is of the opinion that the expected advantages of the contemplated entering into and execution of the SSFA, and the adherence thereto by PiE and LSP (in the framework of the Share Lending), and the related Support Agreement, currently exceed the expected risks and disadvantages thereof. Hence, the Committee believes that the SSFA and the adherence thereto by PiE and LSP (in the framework of the Share Lending) is in the interest of the Company, its shareholders and the other stakeholders, and that it is in any event not manifestly unlawful. In view hereof, the Committee issues a favourable and unqualified opinion to the board of directors of the Company." The Company's board of directors did not deviate from the Committee's favorable and unqualified conclusion. The Company's statutory auditor's assessment of the Committee's opinion and the minutes of the Company's meeting of the board of directors relating to the entering into of the Facility and the adherence thereto by Partners in Equity and LSP (in the framework of the contemplated Share Lending), and the entering into of the related Support Agreement, is as follows: "Based on our assessment, nothing has come to our attention that leads us to believe that the financial and accounting information mentioned in the advice of the Ad Hoc Committee of independent directors dated 14 March 2025, and in the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors dated 14 March 2025, which justify the contemplated transaction in writing and in a comprehensive manner, are not, in all material respects, fair and consistent with the information available to us within the scope of our engagement. Our engagement was solely conducted within the framework of the provisions of article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code, and therefore our report cannot be used in any other context." Disclosures in accordance with Article 7:97, §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in relation to the 2025 Convertible Loan The following information is provided pursuant to Article 7:97, §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the 2025 Convertible Loan granted by Partners in Equity and EQT to the Company. Partners in Equity and EQT are shareholders of the Company and are represented on the board of directors of the Company. As a result, each of them could be considered as a "related party" within the meaning of the International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (IFRS), as referred to in Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. In view hereof, the board of directors of the Company applied the procedure of Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the approval of the 2025 Convertible Loan. Ids van der Weij (a director, representing Partners in Equity) and Rudy Dekeyser (a director, representing EQT/LSP) did not participate in the deliberation and voting by the board of directors in relation to the approval of the entering into of the relevant loan agreements. Within the context of the aforementioned procedure, prior to this announcement and the signing of the 2025 Convertible Loan documentation, a committee of three independent directors of the Company (the "Committee") issued an advice to the board of directors in which the Committee assessed the entering into of the 2025 Convertible Loan. In its advice to the board of directors, the Committee concluded the following: "The Committee believes that, under the current circumstances and considering the current immediate working capital needs of the Company, the entering into and execution of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement is in the interest of the Company, its shareholders, and other stakeholders. While subjecting the Company to increased debt, while entailing greater interest costs for the Company than the current financial indebtedness of the Company (other than the 2024 Convertible Loans), and while entailing additional and important potential dilution and/or value loss for the holders of shares and share options of the Company in case of settlement of the loans, ultimately the terms of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement do not seem unreasonable and seem commensurate to the risks of investing in the Company taking into account the refinancing difficulties of the Company. If the Company is not able to raise further funding in order to address its short term funding requirements, the Company's going concern can no longer be guaranteed. As far as needed and applicable, the Committee has also taken into account the debt restructuring and the entering into of the Share Subscription Facility Agreement that will be announced together with the entering into of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement. The Committee believes that the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement, the Share Subscription Facility Agreement, and the debt restructuring will allow the Company to extend the Company's cash runway and to strategically focus efforts and resources on raising additional and diversified equity or other financing and to implement remedial measures. On balance, therefore, the Committee is of the opinion that the expected advantages of the entering into and execution of the 2025 Convertible Loan currently exceed the expected risks and disadvantages thereof. Hence, the Committee believes that the entering into and execution of the 2025 Convertible Loan Agreement is in the interest of the Company, its shareholders and the other stakeholders, and that it is in any event not manifestly unlawful. In view hereof, the Committee issues a favourable and unqualified opinion to the board of directors of the Company." The Company's board of directors did not deviate from the Committee's favorable and unqualified conclusion. The Company's statutory auditor's assessment of the Committee's opinion and the minutes of the Company's meeting of the board of directors relating to the entering into of the 2025 Convertible Loan, is as follows: "Based on our assessment, nothing has come to our attention that leads us to believe that the financial and accounting information mentioned in the advice of the Ad Hoc Committee of independent directors dated 14 March 2025, and in the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors dated 14 March 2025, which justify the contemplated transaction in writing and in a comprehensive manner, are not, in all material respects, fair and consistent with the information available to us within the scope of our engagement. Our engagement was solely conducted within the framework of the provisions of article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code, and therefore our report cannot be used in any other context."

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical intends to start US commercialisation early in the second half of 2025 through a small specialty salesforce that it will establish to target the 90 US liver transplant centers that perform 95% of liver transplants. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements2.

Title: Hong Kong's leader swipes at Trump but avoids criticism of tycoon's deal to sell Panama Port assets

Hong Kong’s leader says his government opposes coercion by foreign governments, an allusion to comments by U.S. President Donald Trump, but stopped short of criticizing a prominent local conglomerate’s decision to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a... HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's leader has waded into a controversy over a prominent conglomerate’s decision to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium including American investment bank BlackRock Inc., a deal that has angered Beijing and highlights how escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington can leave the Chinese financial center’s business leaders trapped in the middle. Chief Executive John Lee told reporters at a weekly news briefing that CK Hutchison Holdings' in-principle agreement to sell its controlling stake in a company operating ports at both ends of the Panama Canal was being discussed extensively and concerns raised about the deal deserve serious attention. He did not specify what the concerns were. “(The) government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises,” he said. “We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations.” Lee avoided a direct mention of U.S. President Donald Trump and also stopped short of criticizing CK Hutchison or tycoon Li Ka-shing's family, which owns a controlling stake in the conglomerate. His comments followed a somewhat veiled backlash from Beijing. Since last Thursday, Beijing’s offices handling Hong Kong affairs have reposted two commentaries by a Beijing-backed local newspaper that blasted the deal. That has raised questions over the sale. One of the newspaper commentaries suggested the deal is a betrayal to all Chinese and disregards national interests. The other described great entrepreneurs as patriots, but suggested that businesspeople who “dance with” predatory American politicians to reap quick profits were doomed to infamy. The articles signaled Beijing’s disapproval of the deal, though its actual impact remains unclear. Posting of the articles has been seen as an indirect attack on the conglomerate by Chinese leaders. Trump, who has alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane, hailed the deal, saying his administration would “reclaim” the Panama Canal. Panama President José Raúl Mulino accused him of lying. Lee said any business transaction must comply with Hong Kong's laws. The city will handle it according to the law, he said without elaborating. Increasing influence from Beijing is adding to pressure on business leaders in the former British colony, that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. CK Hutchison did not comment on Lee’s remarks or the articles. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it did not plan a news conference. The company surprised market watchers when it announced March 4 that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial and unrelated to other developments surrounding the Panama Ports. The deal, if approved, will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the Panama Canal. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. The transaction requires approval by Panama’s government. It does not affect a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong or any other ports in mainland China. Panama says it has full control over the shipping lane and Hutchison's operation of the ports does not amount to Chinese control over the canal. Selling it to a U.S.-based company does not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal, it says. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s, seeking a faster way for commercial and military vessels to travel between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by then-President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

With New York critics loving his solo show, painter Paul Hughes talks about creativity Paul Hughes worked for Saatchi & Saatchi as a strategist On a Dublin 4 lane, you press the bell, a black metal grille is raised; you cross a courtyard and step into Paul Hughes’s bright studio. Music thrums and pulses. Sometimes it’s Vivaldi and Puccini, sometimes Philip Glass or Irish trad. Today it’s The KVB. The paintings, on the walls or stacked against them, are dazzlingly colourful. On the floor, tubes and tubs of paint. One work in particular – 5m x 2m, and as yet untitled – sings. It’s partly painted with his fingers, a hands-on work, and has a child-like energy and vibrancy that marks a new direction in Hughes’s work. Have you tried Focail and Conundrum?

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs bleed $900M over 5 weeks – Is investor confidence shattered?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-spot-etfs-bleed-900m-over-5-weeks-is-investor-confidence-shattered/
Time Published: 2025-03-17T22:00:29Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin Spot ETFs have been bleeding funds, with $900M in outflows over the past five weeks. Bitcoin [BTC] Spot ETFs have been experiencing a notable decline in inflows, with over $900 million in outflows recorded in the last five weeks. This sharp drop has fueled speculation about whether investor confidence in Bitcoin is beginning to wane. As institutional investors adjust their portfolios amid economic and regulatory uncertainty, Bitcoin’s price has also been affected, dipping nearly 12% in the past month. With market sentiment shifting, a closer analysis of Bitcoin Spot ETF flows, and price trends is crucial to understanding where the market is headed. According to recent data from Sosovalue, BTC Spot ETFs have seen sustained outflows, with the latest weekly figures showing a net outflow of $921.4 million. This marks the fifth consecutive week of declining capital within these funds, bringing the total outflow to approximately $5.4 billion since mid-February. While BTC Spot ETFs initially saw significant inflows after their approval, recent redemptions suggest a shift in investor sentiment. Source: Sosovalue The timing of these outflows has coincided with Bitcoin’s price decline, which has dropped from $84,000 to approximately $77,000. While broader market factors contribute to Bitcoin’s volatility, the persistent ETF outflows indicate that institutional investors might be more cautious toward Bitcoin allocations in their portfolios. One of the key advantages of BTC Spot ETFs is their ability to attract institutional investors into the cryptocurrency market. Prominent asset management firms like BlackRock and Fidelity introduced Bitcoin ETFs, offering a regulated investment option that provided Bitcoin exposure without requiring direct ownership. This led to an initial surge in inflows and contributed to Bitcoin reaching an all-time price high. However, institutional investors often utilize strategic, short-term capital allocation methods. During periods of market uncertainty, they tend to adjust positions swiftly, potentially explaining the current outflows. Analysts suggest that institutional investors could be redirecting funds to traditional assets or higher-yield opportunities as global financial markets react to inflation concerns and regulatory changes. There are several contributing factors to the recent BTC Spot ETF redemptions. One of the most significant concerns is macroeconomic conditions. Rising interest rates and inflation fears have led investors to reevaluate their portfolios, often prioritizing lower-risk assets over volatile markets like cryptocurrencies. With traditional markets offering more attractive risk-adjusted returns, Bitcoin Spot ETFs may face increased competition from traditional investment vehicles. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price volatility plays a role. Historically, large price corrections have triggered sell-offs, and the current price dip may have led some investors to liquidate their BTC holdings to secure profits or minimize losses. Despite the recent outflows, the long-term outlook for BTC Spot ETFs remains positive. The introduction of these funds has already had a positive effect on the cryptocurrency market, and there are indications that institutional adoption will continue to grow. However, in the short term, investors will closely monitor macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim key price levels. If Bitcoin can stabilize above $80,000, it may regain investor confidence, leading to renewed inflows into BTC Spot ETFs. On the other hand, if outflows persist and Bitcoin struggles to find support, a prolonged period of market uncertainty could follow.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) during the "Verdict" podcast sit-down. “They just send money out of nothing.” The computers identified by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, exist at multiple agencies, Musk added, pointing to the U.S. Treasury Department, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of State, and U.S. Department of Defense. Musk claimed his team has found 14 computers with blank-check authority at the federal government, and suggested that they routinely send trillions of dollars to keep Washington up and running. While Musk’s fixation on government spending has been brewing for months, his latest comments on the government’s payment powers alarmed Bitcoin fans who have long viewed it as a hedge against currency degradation. In 2013, the term “magic internet money” became popularized within Bitcoin’s community after a Reddit user created a viral ad using the slogan. The meme’s crudely illustrated mascot has since become the central focus of Taproot Wizards’ line of Bitcoin-based collectibles. Bitcoin’s portrayal as a store of value has often been linked to money-printing. Generally, Bitcoiners believe a government can create as much cash as it wants, while Bitcoin’s supply will never exceed 21 million BTC due to the way that its software was coded. The sentiment has been echoed by influential figures on Wall Street, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. In January, he said Bitcoin appeals to investors fearful of their local currency being debased through government spending, describing Bitcoin as “a currency of fear.” Musk’s attempts to slash costs have contributed to recession fears, as market participants weigh how federal jobs cuts could affect economic growth and consumer spending. However, the accuracy of DOGE’s purported spending cuts has faced scrutiny. As news publications have identified errors in DOGE's savings claims, the cost-cutting team has progressively made data posted to the DOGE website—where Dogecoin’s logo was recently added and then swiftly removed—harder to decipher, according to The New York Times. Musk has said DOGE will “act quickly to correct any mistakes,” but recent savings claims have been made with less data for identifying which contracts have purportedly been cut. Musk took issue with the government’s spending procedures in the podcast published on Monday, but he acknowledged the magic machines are “not totally wrong” in terms of how much money is being spent compared to what's reported. In terms of the amount they spend, they’re “probably off” by up to 10% in some cases, he claimed.

Title: LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault Extends His Own Retirement Age Again to 85
URL: https://observer.com/2025/03/lvmh-bernard-arnault-extend-retirement/
Time Published: 2025-03-17T17:59:52Z

Is 85 the new 65? Bernard Arnault, CEO and chairman of the French luxury conglomerate LVMH (LVMHF), sure hopes so. The 76-year-old billionaire is once again asking shareholders to extend his impending retirement. A proposal to amend LVMH’s bylaws and raise the age limit of its CEO and chairman positions from 80 to 85 will be heard during the conglomerate’s annual meeting on April 17, according to company documents. This isn’t the first time Arnault, who has led LVMH for some 35 years, has attempted to prolong his time in power—back in 2022, he successfully raised the company’s CEO retirement age from 75 to 80.

You can opt out anytime. LVMH owns brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior (CHDRY) and Tiffany & Co. Last year, the group raked in nearly 85 billion euros ($92.8 billion) in revenue. Arnault, currently the world’s fifth richest person with an estimated net worth of $170.9 billion, has remained tight-lipped over which of his five children will take the reins once he finally steps down. Arnault’s four sons and one daughter all currently hold roles within their father’s luxury empire. His eldest child, Antoine, serves as head of communication and image at LVMH, while Delphine is CEO and chairman of Christian Dior Couture. Frédéric, meanwhile, was recently named CEO of the cashmere brand Loro Piana. Alexandre and Jean work as head of Moët Hennessy and director of watches at Louis Vuitton, respectively. The LVMH leader has previously found support in his bucking of traditional retirement ages from the likes of Warren Buffett, who is turning 95 this year. After initially raising his retirement age to 80 three years ago, the French billionaire reportedly received a letter from Buffett saying the new limit was still too low. Buffett, who has run Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) for 60 years, has long praised the seniority of his older executives. During Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in 2024, he quipped that “anybody who wants to retire at 65 would be disqualified from being CEO of Berkshire.” The investor’s thoughts on retirement are admired by fellow billionaire Bill Gates, who is currently 69 years old and last year stated that he’d like to follow Buffett’s lead and continue working for two to three more decades. Such approaches contrast the standard retirement age of 65 in the U.S.—an age that Larry Fink, chairman of BlackRock, thinks should be increased. In a 2024 investor letter that pointed to the increased strain of America’s Social Security Administration amid a rise in retired citizens, Fink noted that it’s a “bit crazy” that the U.S. still abides by a retirement age that originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire. Similar financial issues are underway in France, which recently saw French President Emmanuel Macron raise the country’s retirement age from 62 to 64 to allow pension systems to keep up with its retirees. French citizens, however, don’t appear to share Arnault’s sentiments around extending retirement. They quickly took aim at billionaires like the LVMH head, arguing they should shoulder some of the responsibility for financing pensions. The protests culminated in more than 100 French workers storming LVMH’s Paris headquarters in April 2023. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Blackrock beat Terenure to retain Leinster Schools Senior Cup title

‘72! 72! 72!’ The chant rose into the cloud-covered sky as Blackrock captain Sam Bishti lifted the Leinster Schools Senior Cup after securing the school’s 72nd title at Tallaght Stadium on Monday. On the evidence of previous rounds, the two most physical schools made it to St Patrick’s Day. An early indiscretion by Blackrock offered an attacking platform which Terenure used to spring centres Alvaro Swords and Michael Kennedy. The ball was moved at speed to build momentum and Blackrock edged the kicking contest for a five-metre lineout. Hooker Harry O’Neill’s throw was grabbed by Michael Walsh to secure possession. From the back of the ensuing maul, O’Neill dotted down to give Blackrock a 5-0 lead on eight minutes. Now trailing, Terenure’s Geoff O’Sullivan and Swords led the pushback, breaking tackles to open up the ‘Rock’s defence, but without the vital support runners their efforts amounted to little. A scrum penalty in the 18th minute offered Terenure’s way into the game, outhalf Gareth Morgan striking from 30 metres to make it 5-3. The deficit reduced to two points, Terenure’s confidence in moving the ball grew, O’Sullivan providing the greatest threat. Coming under pressure, Blackrock’s indiscipline cost them when Morgan shot Terenure into the lead with a penalty in the 27th minute. With half-time approaching, Luke McNiff got a hand to a five-metre lineout, offloading to Mikey Smyth who kicked long for James Browne to gather. Jamie Coleman nudged the ball into touch to bring about the break, Terenure holding a 6-5 lead. The even nature of the contest put discipline to the fore. A hand in the ruck was all Paddy Clancy needed to recover the lead for Blackrock, nailing a penalty in front of the posts in the 42nd minute to make it 8-6. The agility of Blackrock flanker Michael O’Sullivan on the floor was good for a penalty and position inside the 22, where a forward pass was greeted with joy by Terenure supporters. But their decision to run the ball out proved costly when Artur Smykovskiy swooped for a penalty on the 40-metre line which Clancy slotted over for 11-6 in the 49th minute. Terenure, however, looked to have put themselves back ahead when Swords, playing with penalty advantage, reached for the line. But it wasn’t to be, the try chalked off for obstruction in the lead up. Instead they had to make do with another penalty from Morgan to make it a two-point game in the 53rd minute. Terenure pushed hard in possession, but when the ball went to ground Albert Lindner smartly tumbled a kick for a 50-22 to Blackrock. Terenure recovered the ball as Blackrock’s concentration slipped under pressure, but Lindner was again on hand, this time snatching an interception. The scramble defence was laudable but not squeaky clean, giving Clancy the opportunity to land a routine penalty to extend Backrock’s lead to 14-9 in the 62nd minute. A scrum penalty offered Terenure a much-needed reprieve. Clancy duly stepped up to the kicking tee on the 40-meter line but his effort, while on target, dropped short. That left Terenure with just one last chance, Swords, O’Sullivan, Ethan Balamash, Senan Gavin, captain Ben Blaney and others combining in search of a late try. Ultimately, Blackrock’s forwards held firm to keep Terenure out. Under pressure, they would not be broken.

Title: Who Is Satoshi? Benjamin Wallace Goes Down the Rabbit Hole in New Book

Full Content:
Who created Bitcoin? More than 16 years ago, on Halloween Day of 2008, an entity by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto sent out the whitepaper for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system to a cypherpunk email list. Bitcoin launched shortly thereafter; it quickly spawned a global cultural movement and a multi-trillion dollar industry. Benjamin Wallace wrote a piece on the phenomenon for WIRED in November 2011, making him one of the very first mainstream journalists to ever cover the crypto space. Back then, nobody seemed to know Nakamoto’s identity, and despite robust efforts, Wallace couldn’t figure it out either. Amusingly, the author of “The Billionaire’s Vinegar: The Mystery of the World's Most Expensive Bottle of Wine” (2009) was sucked back into the enigma in 2022 after receiving persistent emails from an ex-Tesla employee who was absolutely convinced that Elon Musk was Nakamoto all along. Wallace stays clear of that particular theory, but he lays out his own findings in “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto,” a 342-page investigation set for release on March 18.Read more: Marc Hochstein - Satoshi Nakamoto: The Mystery That (Probably) Will Never Be Solved The conclusion? Well, by the end of it, Wallace is forced to admit that he failed to solve the Nakamoto riddle once again. But his obsession yielded a thoughtful survey of Bitcoin’s history with a special emphasis on the cypherpunks whose ideas contributed to the cryptocurrency’s birth. “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto” is a perfect work for crypto veterans and beginners alike who are curious to know more about Bitcoin’s origins; in that respect, it’s comparable to Laura Shin’s “The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze” (2022), which focuses on Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum’s early days. Wallace shuffles through a long list of suspects throughout the book. His favourites include Hal Finney, the recipient of the first-ever bitcoin transaction; Nick Szabo, who designed a digital currency in the 1990s called “bit gold”; Len Sassaman, one of the main developers and operators of the Mixmaster remailer; the relatively obscure cypherpunk James A. Donald; and longtime Bitcoin critic Ben Laurie. One of the things that makes “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto” a fun read is that you can watch Wallace slowly go insane as he bounces back and forth between these names. Each time he narrows it down to one person, a new piece of information rolls in and detonates his theory. Wallace deserves credit for his multi-faceted approach to the affair. He makes abundant use of stylometry for Nakamoto’s emails and code, deeply investigates circumstantial evidence, interviews almost all of the potential candidates, and even learns to code to get a better grasp of what the cypherpunks are talking about. Looming over the investigation, of course, is the debate over whether Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity even matters in the first place. There has been renewed interest in the question lately, between HBO’s “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery” documentary (which came out last fall) and VanEck’s head of digital assets Matthew Sigel stating in February that he believed Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey created Bitcoin. As Wallace notes, Nakamoto’s identity is one of the great secrets of the 21st century. With Wall Street and the White House beginning to fully embrace the crypto sector, there is perhaps a feeling that putting a face on Bitcoin’s inventor is necessary to make the digital asset a little cleaner and safer to integrate into the global financial system. Nakamoto’s identity is crucial because its discovery would impact the way people see Bitcoin, Wallace argues. Crypto folks, he says, prefer to think of Satoshi as a kind of promethean figure that unleashed Bitcoin as a gift to mankind before disappearing for the greater good. But what if Nakamoto was an outright criminal like former cartel boss Paul Le Roux who simply cannot access his private keys because he’s behind bars? Would BlackRock and Fidelity still race to recommend exposure to the cryptocurrency to their clients? Wallace eventually sort of settles on the idea that Hal Finney probably took part in Bitcoin’s creation, but that he likely wasn’t working alone, and that in any case any theory is almost impossible to verify without Nakamoto providing irrevocable proof. But “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto” is crafted intelligently and the lack of resolution does not feel anti-climactic. At the end of the day, it’s all about the chase. “What could we possibly learn from Nakomoto’s biography?” Wallace muses at some point, after a friend of his suggests the story would be better without an answer. “That he was a random professor who’d had a lucky brainstorm? No, what was most interesting about Nakamoto was his absence. He was defined by what we didn’t know about him.” Tom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America.

Title: Home of The Best Meme Coins, Solana, Turns Five

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Solana celebrated its 5th birthday yesterday. In honour of the occasion, we decided to take a look at this blockchain’s journey to becoming a leading platform and the home of the best meme coins. Solana was launched on March 16, 2020, by Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko and Solana co-founder Raj Gokal and his team. That was right around the time the entire world was forced into lockdown by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some 408B transactions and close to $1T in trading on DEXs later, today Solana is second only to Ethereum in terms of total value locked, at $6.85B. Solana was designed to address the scalability issues that plagued the likes of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. And, over the past five years, it has been widely adopted in areas such as DeFi, NFTs, gaming, Web3 applications, and – of course – as the launchpad for some of the best meme coins. The high-speed, low-cost Layer 1 blockchain has had its fair share of ups and downs over the past five years. At the peak of the 2020–2021 bull run, Solana’s market cap surged to $77.8B. However, it plummeted by a massive 96% in late 2022. The Solana price fell to $8.30, and its market cap bottomed out at around $3B. Yet, Solana has proven quite the comeback kid, thanks in large part to the meme coin craze. Last year, the meme coin market exploded, and its collective market cap grew by 330%, according to CEX.io. Solana’s impressive speed (up to 65K transactions per second), low costs, strong community, and developer-friendly environment have made it the go-to blockchain for the best altcoins, giving it a considerable edge over competitors. As Solana celebrates its 5th birthday, it seems good things are in store for this blockchain. For one, US President Donald Trump recently announced $SOL will be included in the country’s proposed strategic reserve. Institutional players are acknowledging Solana’s strong position – with the likes of asset manager BlackRock on the brink of launching $SOL spot ETFs. Solana also has two protocol upgrades in the pipeline. The first, SIMD 0123, proposes a system whereby Solana’s priority fees go to validator stakers. This should boost staking rewards, block off-chain transactions, and improve on-chain processing. SIMD 0228, meanwhile, is a proposal to change how new $SOL tokens are released, in a bid to make token issuance more balanced and efficient. Instead of a fixed schedule, staking rewards would adjust based on how many people are staking. Solana’s ecosystem continues to flourish in the cryptocurrency and Web3 landscape, proving that speed, efficiency, and innovation can co-exist in a decentralized world. That said, the Solana blockchain is still known for traffic congestion and failed transactions. To the rescue comes Solaxy ($SOLX), the meme coin behind the world’s first-ever Solana Layer 2 ecosystem. $SOLX aims to build on Solana’s good points (speed and low transaction costs) by boosting scalability and adding even more speed. As an Ethereum-based token, Solaxy will bridge Solana and Ethereum, meaning $SOLX holders will be able to capitalize on the strength of these two blockchain powerhouses. This is exciting news for the crypto world, and investors are taking note. The Solaxy presale has raised $26.7M since it launched in December last year. Right now, 1 $SOLX costs $0.0016666 (with 153% staking rewards). Being a presale, however, it won’t stay that low for long. If you’re interested in investing in what is potentially a game changer for Solana, the Solaxy whitepaper is a good starting point, as is the $SOLX X channel. Our guide to buying $SOLX will walk you through the steps if you decide this is the investment for you. Remember to do your own research, as we’re not financial advisers. That said, it will be exciting to see what’s in store for the Solana blockchain if the last five years are anything to go by.

Title: BlackRock CEO: Social Security Reform With Private Investment Accounts

[+] change: let Americans invest part of their Social Security taxes into private accounts for retirement. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink put Social Security reform in the spotlight, suggesting a potentially controversial change: let Americans invest part of their Social Security taxes into private accounts for retirement. Speaking at BlackRock’s retirement summit, Fink argued this would allow workers to earn higher returns through the market. "The problem we have now, we have a plan called Social Security that doesn’t grow with the economy," Fink said​ as reported by Semafor, pointing out the current program’s meager bond-bound growth. Fink’s proposal centers on boosting retirees' returns by harnessing the stock market's long-term performance. Today, Social Security's trust funds invest only in special U.S. Treasury bonds with modest yields. By contrast, investing a portion in stocks could let retirement savings "grow with your country," said Fink, as reported in Semafor. .​ "If we create a plan that every American can grow with our economy, they’re going to feel more attached to our economy," Fink added, suggesting that owning a stake in real assets would make workers more optimistic about their golden years than relying solely on a government check. Crucially, Fink isn’t advocating ditching Social Security’s guaranteed benefit. He envisions personal investment accounts as a voluntary supplement to the baseline benefit, not a substitute. This nuance echoes the stance of many retirement experts and aligns with AARP, the nation’s most significant seniors’ lobby. Marie F. Smith, former president of the organization, said to The New York Times in 2004 that the group "adamantly opposes replacing any part of Social Security with individual accounts." However, she added that AARP supported incentives for people to establish personal retirement accounts in addition to Social Security. The organization’s former policy director, John Rother, echoed this view, saying, "We favor private accounts when they are in addition to Social Security, but not as a substitute." Fink's idea aligns with that philosophy – aiming to enhance retirees' overall security without undermining the safety net. The concept of privatizing Social Security isn’t new. In 2005, President George W. Bush proposed letting workers invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in personal accounts. The plan met fierce resistance. Democrats blasted it as an attempt to privatize the program, and even many Republicans got cold feet. Opposition helped wreck Bush’s second-term agenda and the proposal died in Congress. Americans were unconvinced that turning a guaranteed benefit into a market gamble was worth it. Critics warned that diverting payroll taxes to Wall Street could force benefit cuts or balloon the deficit to pay current retirees. Spooked by the risks, the public balked – and since 2005, the notion of privatizing Social Security has been essentially political poison. By floating private accounts, Fink has reopened the long-running debate about risk versus reward in retirement security. Proponents argue that Social Security’s government-run trust fund doesn’t generate enough growth. According to Investopedia, they believe investing even a portion of contributions in equities could "deliver higher benefits for participants" over time. The potential upside is higher returns and personal ownership of retirement assets that individuals control. A recent post on X by David Friedberg, CEO of Ohala, makes the case cogently. “If instead of buying treasuries, OASI [the Social Security Trust Fund] bought the S&P500 index starting in 1971 (the year the US went off the gold standard), it would have a $15.1 trillion balance today and Americans would all share ownership of ~1/3 of America’s best companies, likely supporting increased retirement benefits, lowering taxes, and reducing Federal debt levels while being the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. Instead, OASI has a $2.7 trillion balance today and is projected to go bankrupt in 2032, as retirement benefits swell while annual returns on US treasuries held by OASI have shrunk to <3% per year recently.” Opponents counter with a clear warning: those higher returns come with higher risk. What if the market crashes at the wrong time? Social Security’s great strength is that it guarantees a lifelong benefit regardless of market conditions – a safety net that privatization could weaken. Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), a vocal defender of the program, notes that during the 2008 financial crisis, many 401(k) accounts plunged in value, yet "Social Security never missed a payment."​ To Larson and like-minded critics, exposing the bedrock of Americans' retirement to Wall Street volatility is an unacceptable gamble. They also point to the transition problem: diverting payroll taxes into private accounts leaves less money to pay current retirees, likely requiring painful benefit cuts or large federal debt in the interim. This daunting transition cost is a key reason past privatization efforts faltered. On the other hand, supporters of reform say Social Security's looming financial shortfall means all options should be considered. The program's main trust fund is projected to run out of reserves by 2033, after which it could only pay about 79% of promised benefits​. To advocates of private accounts, harnessing market growth is one way to help fill that funding gap – potentially reducing the need for big tax hikes or benefit cuts. They argue that accepting some market risk now may be preferable to an automatic 21% benefit reduction later. Despite the renewed buzz, Social Security reform that includes adding private accounts faces an uphill battle in Washington. Republican lawmakers, mindful of the 2005 backlash, have mostly avoided endorsing private-account ideas. Polls suggest the idea remains unpopular – a recent survey found that voters across party lines "overwhelmingly oppose" efforts to privatize Social Security​, according to Data For Progress. Still, Fink's high-profile advocacy shines a new spotlight on this once-taboo proposal. His stature as head of the world's largest asset manager lends weight to the conversation, and his emphasis on supplementing (not replacing) Social Security could make the concept more palatable to some. Any serious move toward private accounts would require safeguards to preserve Social Security's guaranteed benefits, and even then, it would ignite fierce debate. Lawmakers must convince a skeptical public that such a reform won't jeopardize the checks seniors rely on. For additional article on Social Security reform and current events:

Title: US exodus drives crypto ETP outflows to record $6.4B but XRP defies downturn

XRP investment products reach $1.2 billion AuM despite crypto sector's outflows of $6.4 billion Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Investment in crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) took a heavy hit last week, with outflows reaching $1.7 billion, according to the latest CoinShares report. This marks the fifth consecutive week of capital flight, bringing total outflows to $6.4 billion—an all-time high. As a result, year-to-date inflows for the sector have now dropped to $912 million. James Butterfill, CoinShares’ Head of Research, highlighted that the market has endured 17 consecutive days of outflows—the longest streak recorded since data tracking of global crypto ETPs began in 2015. According to him, the prolonged downturn has caused total assets under management (AuM) to shrink by $48 billion to $133 billion. Investors in the United States led the exodus, accounting for 93% of the total outflows last week, with $1.16 billion leaving the market. The heavy outflows can be linked to the fact that US spot Bitcoin ETF providers, including BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, and Ark 21Shares, saw outflows of $401 million, $134 million, $317 million, and $68 million, respectively. This resulted in Bitcoin-related investment products recording $978 million in outflows, bringing their five-week flows to a negative $5.4 billion. Short-Bitcoin positions also saw sell-offs, with investors withdrawing $3.6 million amid Bitcoin’s sideways price action. Meanwhile, Ethereum and Solana investment products experienced outflows of $175 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Blockchain equity funds also suffered, with $40 million exiting the sector. Butterfill pointed out that Binance faced a near-total wipeout of its AuM after a seed investor’s departure, leaving only $15 million under management. XRP stood out as a rare bright spot, attracting $1.8 million in fresh inflows last week. This brought its monthly total to $7.4 million, ranking it second only to Solana, which led with $14.2 million in inflows. For the year, XRP remains one of the best-performing assets, with $212 million in inflows—trailing only Bitcoin’s $612 million and Ethereum’s $412 million. The rising demand has driven XRP investment products to a record high of $1.2 billion in total assets under management. Several market factors have fueled this momentum. The long-running legal dispute between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be approaching a resolution, with both parties reportedly working toward a settlement. At the same time, reports also suggest that the SEC may consider classifying the digital asset as a commodity, which could boost the likelihood of approving an XRP-focused spot ETF product.

Title: The Great Un-Wokening Meets the Campus Resistance

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/17/2025 5:32:13 AM PDT by karpov Many of America’s large corporations are beating a retreat from their former commitments to saving the planet from catastrophic climate change. They are also reassessing their earnest allegiance to DEI policies. Indeed, the whole apparatus of ESG (“environmental, social, and governance”) policies in the for-profit sector now looks a bit like the Pacific Palisades after the fire. Not just climate and race stuff, but other progressive causes, including “gender diversity” and “aspirational hiring,” are facing early retirement. The list of companies that are participating in what might be called the Great Un-Wokening is impressively long and, in its way, diverse. State Street (asset management), Warner Bros. (mediocre movies), Paramount (“A Mountain of Entertainment”), Goldman Sachs (investing in everything), BlackRock (ditto), Citigroup (more of the same), Pepsi and Coca-Cola (carbonated beverages), Google (advertisement emporium) and Disney (worse-than-mediocre movies and overpriced theme parks) stand out, but the list is much longer. Exactly why an epidemic of sanity has broken out in the corporate world is a topic for wiser heads than mine. It could be that these companies are tired of squandering money on silly ideological crusades, or it could be a collective reawakening to the wisdom of Adam Smith. Great shifts in the capital spirit seldom occur without responsive echoes in the American academy. And, indeed, in the behavior of some colleges and universities, echoes of the Great Un-Wokening can be discerned. What is especially interesting, however, is how faint these echoes are. It is as if higher education wants to play along with State Street et al., but its heart isn’t really in it. (Excerpt) Read more at jamesgmartin.center ...

* CK Hutchison and sister company to report results on Thursday * State-owned media posts second critical editorial on port deal * China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted commentary By Clare Jim HONG KONG, March 17 (Reuters) - Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison, which is facing pressure from Beijing authorities over a port deal with a BlackRock-led consortium, will not hold earnings conferences this week, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. CK Asset, a property developer in Hong Kong which also has interests in overseas utility assets, told Reuters on Monday it will not hold analyst and media conferences. "This is very rare for a blue-chip company not to hold an earnings conference," said an analyst briefed on the matter, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. "The company has not said anything since the port deal. The stock market could view this negatively." Both companies are due to report their 2024 financial results on Thursday. Neither provided the reasons for their decisions. While CK Hutchison confirmed it will not hold a media briefing when asked by Reuters, it did not say whether it still planned to hold an analyst briefing. They have held analyst conferences for both their semi-annual and annual results for many years as well as media briefings for their annual results. CK Hutchison said this month it had agreed to sell most of its global ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock. It will receive more than $19 billion in cash proceeds under the deal. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for the Panama Canal to be removed from what he says is Chinese ownership, has hailed the deal. China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) on Thursday reposted a commentary criticising the deal as a betrayal of China, sending the conglomerate's shares sharply lower the following day. The article, originally published in Hong Kong-based state-owned newspaper Ta Kung Pao, said the deal neglects national interests and shows CK Hutchison is profit-seeking. HKMAO on Saturday reposted another Ta Kung Pao editorial in which the paper criticised CK Hutchison and said Hong Kong companies must stand with China in the face of what it called "U.S. hegemony".
