Title: Index Funds? Nope. We’re Doing This For 8%+ Tech Dividends And Upside

Investor managing portfolio. Pie chart and candlestick charts. We need to talk about tech stocks. Because, yes, there is a risk of a pullback here. But there’s also a way for us to minimize that risk—and grab 8%+ dividends, plus price upside, as we do so. First off, let me be clear that when I say “tech stocks,” I’m using the NASDAQ 100 as my benchmark. The index is about 60% tech, compared to about a third for the S&P 500. That higher level of tech exposure has allowed the NASDAQ to handily beat the S&P 500 over the long run That outperformance started to slow last year, with the NASDAQ only barely edging out the S&P 500. And as I write this, the NASDAQ’s P/E ratio is 37.2, higher than at any point since the dot-com bubble and well above the S&P 500’s measure of 27.9. Why the stretched valuation? The first thing that comes to mind is AI, which is already driving efficiencies outside the tech sector, such as in manufacturing, law and medicine. Meantime, the existence of open-source models, plus fierce competition between tech firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others, shows that AI will keep falling in cost, which could slow the continued rise of the large-cap AI stocks. This, by the way, is part of our 2025 AI-investing strategy at CEF Insider: Spread our money across high-yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold big-cap AI names and also invest in companies outside tech that are poised to profit from the technology’s continued growth. Our Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), for example, yields right around 9% now and not only holds firms like Microsoft, Alphabet and NVIDIA (NVDA), but also stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which stands to benefit as AI helps its portfolio managers make better decisions. ADX also holds Visa (V), which is using AI to improve fraud detection, lower costs and boost its margins. Another reason we could see a pullback in the NASDAQ this year is due to the resurgence of cryptocurrency driving unsustainable spending in the tech sector. We saw this in 2021, when surges in Bitcoin prices drove upward momentum on the NASDAQ. Then the bubble popped in 2022, and the NASDAQ slumped in sympathy. With Bitcoin surging again, we could be at the start of another, similar cycle. Consider, for example, the inclusion of MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) in the NASDAQ 100. The stock is basically a Bitcoin proxy, and while it did surge on the announcement that it would join the index, it plummeted shortly after. To be sure, one risky, unprofitable stock like MicroStrategy taking a tumble isn’t a major issue on its own (except to the people who own it, of course!). But if the stock is part of a broader index, it’s a risk to anyone investing in that index more broadly. This is a big reason why we prefer CEFs for investing in both tech and across the market—our funds’ active managers can navigate around risks like MicroStrategy, while index funds must hold the entire index at all times. Moreover, looking ahead to 2025, if the NASDAQ falls behind the S&P 500 this year, more investors are likely to look for other ways to get tech exposure, beyond a NASDAQ index fund, and actively managed CEFs, with their high dividends, are likely to have a lot of appeal. Speaking of dividends, tech-focused CEFs yield around 8% on average, as I write this. That high cash payout lets you capture profits from tech stocks more easily than you could with a NASDAQ-100 index fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (QQQ)—current yield 0.5%—where a selloff could erase your “paper gains.” Below we see the market prices of two tech CEFs through 2024: the 8%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple, and the 12%-paying (and private equity–focused) BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in orange. The benchmark index fund, QQQ, is in blue BST Total Returns Looking at this, you might feel dissatisfied that BST underperformed the NASDAQ 100—could that suggest this CEF isn’t worth buying now? Before jumping to this conclusion, remember that we’re looking at the total return–based market prices here (or the returns based on these funds’ prices on the stock market, including dividends). If we look deeper, at our two CEFs’ total return–based net asset values (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios, including dividends received), we see that BST more or less matched the index (while returning a big slice of its gain in cash, thanks to its high dividend), while BSTZ actually trailed a bit: Total Return on NAV It makes sense that BSTZ is slightly behind when looking at these funds based on their portfolios, rather than their market prices, as this fund holds a large portion of private-equity assets that are still lagging as their recovery takes longer to realize. This chart also suggests BST, which sports an 8% discount to NAV (or the gap between its market price and NAV), is a great buy now. But more crucially, both BST and BSTZ have an advantage over the NASDAQ 100 that is now becoming increasingly valuable: They aren’t directly exposed to crypto. Unlike the NASDAQ 100, neither fund has a position in MSTR, and they don’t invest in other volatile crypto firms, either. So if we see 2025 turn into a repeat of 2022 for cryptocurrencies, BST and BSTZ should fare much better than the index. And even if that doesn’t happen, the risks of a NASDAQ downturn are still likely to have a much lesser impact on these well-managed funds.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Liquor Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) stands against the other liquor stocks. Short selling is a strategy where traders profit from the decline in the price of a stock or other securities. It is when traders can borrow shares and sell them, hoping to purchase them back when they are cheaper. The strategy allows traders to capitalize on stocks or markets they feel are overvalued, giving them more opportunities to make a profit. READ ALSO: 7 Best CBD Stocks to Invest In Right Now Short sellers in America had a tough year in 2024, as the broader US market posted gains of over 23%, building on a gain of over 24% from 2023. The two-year uptick of 53% is the highest since the almost 66% rally in 1997 and 1998. As a result, short sellers were down $180.9 billion in last year’s mark-to-market losses, representing a decrease of approx. 15% on an average short interest of $1.2 trillion. The sectors where shorts performed the worst are, unsurprisingly, Information Technology and Communication Services, as tech stocks surged the most last year. However, the European market has recently been a popular playground for short sellers amid the region’s sluggish economic and earnings growth and political instability in France and Germany. The alcohol sector also seems like an attractive option for short selling, especially after the recent advisory by the US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy that consuming alcohol increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colon, and liver cancer. The report claims that alcohol consumption in the US is directly linked to approximately 100,000 cancer cases and 20,000 deaths annually. As such, Mr. Murthy has proposed to put cancer warning labels on alcoholic beverages, signaling a shift toward more aggressive tobacco-style regulation for the sector if adopted. The Surgeon General also called to reassess the guidelines on alcohol consumption limits, so consumers can weigh the risks more accurately. The advisory also managed to impact the financial market, sending down the stocks of several major alcohol players in the country, in some cases by over 3%. This comes at a time when the alcohol sector is already facing some major headwinds, including a downturn in sales following the pandemic boom, threats of looming tariffs, competition from alternative beverages, and the rapidly rising trend of abstinence. More and more Americans, especially the younger generations, are becoming increasingly conscious about health and wellness and saying ‘no’ to alcohol. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, America’s per capita annual consumption of alcohol in 2022 was 2.5 gallons, down from 3.28 gallons in the early 1980s. However, this shift has marked a new opportunity for the alcohol industry, which has responded by flooding the market with a wide range of low- and no-alcohol beverages. The strategy seems to be paying off, as according to Nielsen, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits collectively surpassed $565 million in sales in 2023, up 35% from the year before. There are also doubts over how effective putting warning labels on alcoholic beverages will be since ingrained habits are hard to change and similar labels have done little to curb smoking. Some experts remain optimistic. Paul Gilbert, an associate professor at the University of Iowa College of Public Health, believes that it is unlikely that people will immediately change their drinking habits following the Surgeon General’s report, but it could eventually lead to changes in how people perceive their risk. To collect data for this article, we looked up the 20 Largest Publicly Traded Liquor Companies in the US and then picked out the ones with the lowest short percentage. The stocks are sorted in descending order of their short interest, as of December 13, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up shot of a cannabis plant, showing its intricate details. Short % of Shares Outstanding: 1.77% Next on our list of the Best Alcohol Stocks According to Short Sellers is SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL), the largest private-sector liquor and cannabis retailer in Canada. The company also operates as a licensed cannabis producer and stands as one of Canada’s premier vertically integrated cannabis enterprises. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL)’s liquor business seems to be struggling primarily due to the ‘softness seen across North America’. In Q3 of 2024, SNDL reported a net revenue of $144.6 million from its liquor segment, a decline of $7.2 million or 4.8% YoY. However, the company continues to believe in the long-term potential of the business, which still managed to deliver growth in operating income and gross margin. Like many of its peers in the cannabis business, SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) has been focused on sales growth instead of profits, increasing its revenue by over 1400% between 2020 and 2023. However, the company still hasn’t managed to become profitable over the last four years. It seems like the strategy is changing now as the Calgary-based company announced a restructuring plan in July to help slash its annual expenses by C$20 million ($13.9 million) and finally improve its profitability. Another positive development is that SNDL’s free cash flow was finally positive ($9.2 million) in Q3 2024, supported by ongoing operational gains in gross margin and efficient working capital management. The company is on track to deliver positive free cash flow for the 2024 calendar year, meeting or even exceeding its guidance. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL)’s strong financial position provides it a significant competitive edge over its competitors. The company ended Q3 2024 with a cash balance of $263 million, up from $183 million in the previous quarter, with zero outstanding debt. The company also remains committed to returning value to its shareholders and announced a share repurchase program of around $70.3 million in November. SNDL Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) seems to be attracting attention from institutional investors as well. In the third quarter of 2024, shares of the company were held by 10 hedge funds in the Insider Monkey database with a total stake value of $23.34 million, up 42.5% from the previous quarter. Overall SNDL ranks 6th on our list of the best alcohol stocks according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential for SNDL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNDL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A shelf filled with a variety of bottles of energy drinks, juices, and sodas in a convenience store. Short % of Shares Outstanding: 2.24% Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) engages in the development, marketing, sale, and distribution of energy drink beverages and concentrates. As one of the biggest names in the global energy drinks market, the company is renowned for brands like Monster Energy, Relentless, and Burn. The beverage giant also forayed into the alcohol sector in 2022 when it acquired the CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective in a deal worth $330 million. The acquisition gave Monster ownership of CANarchy’s craft breweries, which now operate under the name Monster Brewing Co. The American energy drinks market is going through an unprecedented slowdown, driven by a reduction in consumer spending and lower foot traffic in the convenience channel. However, despite these macroeconomic headwinds, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has proven to be resilient. The company has managed to outperform its competitors and improve its market share in the domestic market both in volume and dollar terms, indicating that Monster's brand strength and aggressive marketing strategies are effective in maintaining its competitive edge. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)’s venture into the brewing sector still needs time to develop though, as net sales of its Alcohol Brands segment declined by 6% in Q3 of 2024, primarily due to the decreased sales by volume of craft beers. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) remains committed to expanding its footprint on a global level. The company’s international sales now account for approximately 40% of its total revenue, reducing its reliance on the challenging domestic market. The international emerging markets are especially attractive for Monster in particular. As disposable incomes in these regions rise and Western consumer trends gain popularity, the demand for energy drinks is likely to go up. The company’s strategic partnership with Coca-Cola's vast global distribution network also provides it a competitive edge in international markets. However, such aggressive international expansion carries its risks and Monster took a significant revenue hit from the ongoing hyperinflation in Argentina in Q3 2024. Overall MNST ranks 7th on our list of the best alcohol stocks according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential for MNST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Shareholders Urge Mark Zuckerberg to Buy Bitcoin for Meta
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/shareholders-urge-mark-zuckerberg-to-buy-bitcoin-for-meta-3808005
Time Published: 2025-01-11T15:00:26Z

U.Today - Mark Zuckerberg, who famously named his pet goat Bitcoin, was proposed to add Bitcoin to Meta (Facebook) holdings. According to podcaster and CEO of Jubilee Royalty Tim Kotzman, a Bitcoin Treasury Shareholder Proposal has been submitted to Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)., marking a significant development in the adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate asset. The proposal was filed by Ethan Peck, an employee at The National Center for Public Policy Research, on behalf of his family’s shares. This initiative follows similar proposals submitted by the organization to tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The proposal likely advocates for Meta to consider adding Bitcoin to its corporate treasury, aligning with the growing trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. If successful, this move could further solidify Bitcoin's role as a mainstream financial asset and a hedge against inflation. The shareholder proposal submitted to Meta presents a compelling argument for the company to explore adding Bitcoin to its corporate treasury. Ethan Peck, in his supporting statement, outlines the challenges of holding large cash reserves and bonds in an inflationary environment, noting that these assets are diminishing shareholder value over time. He emphasizes Bitcoin’s superior long-term performance as an inflation-resistant store of value, citing its 124% increase in 2024 and a staggering 1,265% rise over the past five years, vastly outperforming traditional bonds. Peck also highlights the alignment of Bitcoin adoption with Meta’s innovative ethos, referencing Mark Zuckerberg’s symbolic naming of his goats, "Bitcoin" and "Max," as well as Meta director Marc Andreessen’s favorable stance on cryptocurrencies. He underscores that major institutional investors, such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), advocate modest Bitcoin allocations, arguing that a similar strategy could benefit Meta’s shareholders. Peck draws attention to broader trends in Bitcoin adoption, including the rapid growth of BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, corporate treasury strategies like MicroStrategy’s and potential government reserves. The proposal calls on Meta’s board to conduct an evaluation of Bitcoin as a treasury asset, positioning it as an opportunity for Meta to remain a leader in forward-thinking asset management. This approach, he argues, would honor the company’s tradition of setting technological and financial trends, rather than merely following them. This marks the company's ninth consecutive weekly Bitcoin purchase announcement, bringing its total holdings to an astounding 447,470 BTC, currently valued at $44.3 billion. MicroStrategy has ambitious plans to raise $2 billion through a preferred stock offering, potentially fueling further Bitcoin acquisitions. With a market capitalization of $93 billion, MicroStrategy now ranks as the 99th largest U.S. company, having leapt 16 spots in a single day. It also became the third most traded equity on Monday, following Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This article was originally published on U.Today

Title: Is Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM) the Best Canadian Dividend Stock to Buy For Income Investors?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy For Income Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) stands against the other Canadian dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are favored by investors not only in the US but also internationally. Canadian dividend companies, known for their robust cash flows, steady dividends, and solid balance sheets, have been particularly popular. However, these stocks lost some appeal in recent years as investors shifted their focus to other asset classes. According to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, there is now a renewed interest in Toronto's dividend-paying stocks, which had been overlooked for over two years. This resurgence is expected to grow as short-term interest rates in Canada continue to decline. An analyst at the bank, Ian de Verteuil, noted in a research report that the shift back to high-yielding equities, such as utilities, REITs, and communications, is just beginning. If interest rates continue to decline, the team anticipates that Canadian investors will redirect approximately $220 billion (US$161 billion) into dividend-paying stocks, moving away from fixed-income products. During periods of higher interest rates in Canada, dividend-paying equities were largely overlooked as investors sought better returns in term deposits, high-interest savings account ETFs, and technology stocks. As a result, the S&P/TSX Composite High Dividend Index has underperformed compared to the broader Canadian and US markets in both 2023 and the early part of 2024, in terms of both price appreciation and total returns. Also read: Early Retirement Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Live Off Dividends The recent underperformance of dividend stocks contrasts with their historical resilience. According to a report by Morningstar, following the 2008 financial crisis, investors gravitated toward income-focused strategies, valuing the perceived safety they offered. In 2008, funds in the Canadian Dividend and Income Equity category experienced a 24% loss, significantly less than the 33% drop in the Canadian benchmark index. Similarly, in 2011, when the TSX fell over 8%, the average fund in this category declined by only 0.8%. The report further mentioned that since 2008, dividend-focused funds have excelled at protecting investors' capital during market downturns, capturing just 65% of the downside. These funds have also performed well during market upswings, capturing 75% of the gains. From January 2008 to June 2015, this category outperformed the broader market, delivering an annualized return of 4.7% compared to 3.7% for the TSX. Concentrating on higher-yielding Canadian stocks would involve increasing exposure to sectors already heavily represented in the index, particularly financials. To achieve high yields, analysts recommend directing investments toward utilities, REITs, telecommunications, and financial sectors. Ian de Verteuil advised that Canadian investors should maintain this shift into these sectors in the future. However, he pointed out that securing high yields in Canada is challenging, as the high-yield bond market is quite restricted. Here are some other remarks from the analyst: “Canadian investors have always struggled to find yield. Unlike the US, there are very few options for ‘high’ nominal yield – there is no Canadian municipal bond market and the high-yield bond market north of the border is extremely narrow.” While Canadian dividend equities present an attractive option for investors, analysts consistently recommend diversifying across various regions to optimize returns. Due to the tendency of dividend investing to result in a heavier concentration of financial and energy stocks—common in the domestic market—income-focused investors should ensure their portfolios are well-diversified and aligned with their income objectives. That said, we will take a look at some of the best dividend Canadian stocks for income investors. Our Methodology: For this article, we scoured the list of S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes Canadian companies with at least five years of dividend growth track records. From that list, we selected stocks that are traded on American stock exchanges and sorted them by the number of hedge fund holders in our database that also had positions in those companies at the end of Q3 2024. This means that these Canadian companies are the most famous among hedge fund investors. The companies mentioned below also have strong dividend histories and healthy balance sheets, which make them reliable investment options for income investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them as of Q4. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) A macro view of a gold mine, with miners hard at work in the foreground. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54 Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) is a Toronto-based gold mining company that explores, develops, and produces precious metals. Gold is known for maintaining its value and is regarded as one of the most reliable investment assets worldwide. This stability is a key reason its demand and prices tend to rise during periods of market uncertainty, such as during wars or significant market downturns. The company gains considerable advantages from operating within this industry. AEM has surged significantly by nearly 62% in the past 12 months. In the third quarter of 2024, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM)'s operational efficiency, cost management, and disciplined capital use enabled it to capitalize on record gold prices for the benefit of its shareholders. During the quarter, the firm successfully repaid $375 million in debt, bolstered its cash reserves, and maintained strong shareholder returns. The quarter also saw robust gold production, with payable gold output reaching 863,445 ounces. Production costs per ounce stood at $908, total cash costs per ounce were $921, and the all-in-sustaining costs (AISC) per ounce amounted to $1,286. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) also demonstrated a solid cash position, with an operating cash flow of over $1.08 billion and a free cash flow of $620 million. The company has remained committed to its shareholder obligation, paying regular dividends since 1983. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 1.90%, as of January 10. With a collective stake value of $973.4 million, 54 hedge funds held positions in Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) in the third quarter of 2024, as per Insider Monkey's database. In the previous quarter, 54 funds held stakes in the company. Overall AEM ranks 1st on our list of the best Canadian dividend stocks for income investors. While we acknowledge the potential for AEM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AEM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

But you may want to tread with caution before euphoria leads you on a hasty buying spree. Bitcoin and other crypto should generally account for just a sliver of investor portfolios — generally no more than 5% — due to its extreme volatility, according to financial experts. Some investors may be wise to stay away from it altogether, they said. "You're not going to have the same size allocation in bitcoin as you would Nasdaq or the S&P 500," said Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management, based in Washington, D.C. "Whenever you have a real volatile asset class, you need less of it in the portfolio to have the same impact" as traditional assets like stocks and bonds, said Johnson, a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, was the top-performing investment of 2024, by a long shot. Prices surged about 125%, ending the year around $94,000 after starting in the $40,000 range. By comparison, the S&P 500, a U.S. stock index, rose 23%. The Nasdaq, a tech-heavy stock index, grew 29%. Prices popped after Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election win. His administration is expected to embrace deregulatory policies that would spur crypto demand. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission also — for the first time — approved exchange-traded funds that invest directly in bitcoin and ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, making crypto easier for retail investors to buy. But experts cautioned that lofty profits may belie an underlying danger. "With high returns come high risk, and crypto is no exception," Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist for Morningstar Research Services, wrote in June. Bitcoin has been nearly five times as volatile as U.S. stocks since September 2015, and ether has been nearly 10 times as volatile, Arnott wrote. "A portfolio weighting of 5% or less seems prudent, and many investors may want to skip cryptocurrency altogether," she said. Bitcoin lost 64% and 74% of its value in 2022 and 2018, respectively. Mathematically, investors need a 100% return to recover from a 50% loss. So far, crypto returns have been high enough to offset its additional risk — but it's not a given that pattern will continue, Arnott said. There are a few reasons for this: Crypto has become less valuable as a portfolio diversifier as it's gotten more mainstream, Arnott wrote. Its popularity among speculative buyers also "makes it prone to pricing bubbles that will eventually burst," she added. BlackRock, a money manager, thinks there's a case for owning bitcoin in a diversified portfolio, for investors who are comfortable with the "risk of potentially rapid price plunges" and who believe it will become more widely adopted, experts at the BlackRock Investment Institute wrote in early December. (BlackRock offers a bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, IBIT.) More from Personal Finance:Why to tweak your investments after lofty stock returnsHow to make the most of crypto in 401(k) plansTarget-date funds don't work for everyone A 1% to 2% allocation to bitcoin is a "reasonable range," BlackRock experts wrote. Going beyond would "sharply increase" bitcoin's share of a portfolio's total risk, they said. For example, a 2% bitcoin allocation accounts for roughly 5% of the risk of a traditional 60/40 portfolio, BlackRock estimated. But a 4% allocation swells that figure to 14% of total portfolio risk, it said. By comparison, Vanguard, another asset manager, doesn't currently have plans to launch a crypto ETF or offer one on its brokerage platform, officials said. "In Vanguard's view, crypto is more of a speculation than an investment," Janel Jackson, Vanguard's former global head of ETF Capital Markets and Broker & Index Relations, wrote in January 2024. Stock investors own shares of companies that produce goods or services, and many investors get dividends; bond investors receive regular interest payments; and commodities are real assets that meet consumption needs, Jackson wrote. "While crypto has been classified as a commodity, it's an immature asset class that has little history, no inherent economic value, no cash flow, and can create havoc within a portfolio," wrote Jackson, now an executive in the firm's Financial Advisor Services unit. Ultimately, one's total crypto allocation is a function of an investor's appetite for and ability to take risk, according to financial advisors. "Younger, more aggressive investors might allocate more [crypto] to their portfolios," said Douglas Boneparth, a CFP based in New York and member of CNBC's Advisor Council. Investors generally hold about 5% of their classic 80/20 or 60/40 portfolio in crypto, said Boneparth, president and founder of Bone Fide Wealth. "I think it could be a good idea to have some exposure to bitcoin in your portfolio, but it's not for everyone and it will remain volatile," Boneparth said. "As far as other cryptocurrencies are concerned, it's difficult to pinpoint which ones are poised to be a good long-term investment. That's not to say there won't be winners." Investors who want to buy into crypto should consider using a dollar-cost-averaging strategy, said Johnson, of Delancey Wealth Management. "I buy 1% at a time until I get to my target risk," Johnson said. "And that way I'm not putting 3%, 4%, 5% at one time and then something happens where it drops precipitously." It'd also be prudent for investors interested in crypto to buy and hold it for the long term, as they would with other financial assets, Johnson said. Morningstar suggests holding cryptocurrency for at least 10 years, Arnott wrote. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Is Thomson Reuters Corporation (TRI) the Best Canadian Dividend Stock to Buy For Income Investors?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy For Income Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) stands against the other Canadian dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are favored by investors not only in the US but also internationally. Canadian dividend companies, known for their robust cash flows, steady dividends, and solid balance sheets, have been particularly popular. However, these stocks lost some appeal in recent years as investors shifted their focus to other asset classes. According to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, there is now a renewed interest in Toronto's dividend-paying stocks, which had been overlooked for over two years. This resurgence is expected to grow as short-term interest rates in Canada continue to decline. An analyst at the bank, Ian de Verteuil, noted in a research report that the shift back to high-yielding equities, such as utilities, REITs, and communications, is just beginning. If interest rates continue to decline, the team anticipates that Canadian investors will redirect approximately $220 billion (US$161 billion) into dividend-paying stocks, moving away from fixed-income products. During periods of higher interest rates in Canada, dividend-paying equities were largely overlooked as investors sought better returns in term deposits, high-interest savings account ETFs, and technology stocks. As a result, the S&P/TSX Composite High Dividend Index has underperformed compared to the broader Canadian and US markets in both 2023 and the early part of 2024, in terms of both price appreciation and total returns. Also read: Early Retirement Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Live Off Dividends The recent underperformance of dividend stocks contrasts with their historical resilience. According to a report by Morningstar, following the 2008 financial crisis, investors gravitated toward income-focused strategies, valuing the perceived safety they offered. In 2008, funds in the Canadian Dividend and Income Equity category experienced a 24% loss, significantly less than the 33% drop in the Canadian benchmark index. Similarly, in 2011, when the TSX fell over 8%, the average fund in this category declined by only 0.8%. The report further mentioned that since 2008, dividend-focused funds have excelled at protecting investors' capital during market downturns, capturing just 65% of the downside. These funds have also performed well during market upswings, capturing 75% of the gains. From January 2008 to June 2015, this category outperformed the broader market, delivering an annualized return of 4.7% compared to 3.7% for the TSX. Concentrating on higher-yielding Canadian stocks would involve increasing exposure to sectors already heavily represented in the index, particularly financials. To achieve high yields, analysts recommend directing investments toward utilities, REITs, telecommunications, and financial sectors. Ian de Verteuil advised that Canadian investors should maintain this shift into these sectors in the future. However, he pointed out that securing high yields in Canada is challenging, as the high-yield bond market is quite restricted. Here are some other remarks from the analyst: “Canadian investors have always struggled to find yield. Unlike the US, there are very few options for ‘high’ nominal yield – there is no Canadian municipal bond market and the high-yield bond market north of the border is extremely narrow.” While Canadian dividend equities present an attractive option for investors, analysts consistently recommend diversifying across various regions to optimize returns. Due to the tendency of dividend investing to result in a heavier concentration of financial and energy stocks—common in the domestic market—income-focused investors should ensure their portfolios are well-diversified and aligned with their income objectives. That said, we will take a look at some of the best dividend Canadian stocks for income investors. Our Methodology: For this article, we scoured the list of S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes Canadian companies with at least five years of dividend growth track records. From that list, we selected stocks that are traded on American stock exchanges and sorted them by the number of hedge fund holders in our database that also had positions in those companies at the end of Q3 2024. This means that these Canadian companies are the most famous among hedge fund investors. The companies mentioned below also have strong dividend histories and healthy balance sheets, which make them reliable investment options for income investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them as of Q4. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) is a Canadian media company that provides news and information tools to professionals. The company is consistently investing in AI, with a focus on driving innovation across its portfolio and markets to serve its customers better. In 2024, its investment in AI has increased to over $200 million. The company continues to advance its "Build, Partner, Buy" strategy, launching several new AI product capabilities and enhancing CoCounsel, its professional-grade GenAI assistant. In addition, it has completed the strategic acquisitions of Safe Sign Technologies and Materia, which complement its product roadmap and accelerate the delivery of GenAI tools for professionals. In the third quarter of 2024, Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) reported revenue of $1.72 billion, which saw an 8% growth from the same period last year. Its operating profit for the quarter fell by 6% on a YoY basis to $415 million. The company's Legal Professionals segment remained the winner, generating $745 million in revenues, which grew by 8% from the same quarter in 2023. This growth was driven by a positive impact from acquisitions. In addition to strong performance in other areas, Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI) also reported a solid cash position. The company's operating cash flow came in at C$756 million, up 12% on a YoY basis. Its free cash for the quarter also grew to $591 million, from $529 million in the prior-year period. This strong cash position has enabled the company to grow its dividends for 31 years in a row, which places TRI on our list of the best dividend Canadian stocks. The stock's dividend yield on January 10 came in at 1.39%. According to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 25 hedge funds held investments in Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), up from 22 in the previous quarter. These stakes are worth $507.7 million in total. Overall TRI ranks 5th on our list of the best Canadian dividend stocks for income investors. While we acknowledge the potential for TRI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TRI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: DAVID BLACKMON: ESG Is Collapsing And Net Zero Is Going With It
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/01/11/opinion-esg-is-collapsing-and-net-zero-is-going-with-it-david-blackmon/

Just a few years ago, ESG was all the rage in the banking and investing community as globalist governments in the western world focused on a failing attempt to subsidize an energy transition into reality. The strategy was to try to strangle fossil fuel industries by denying them funding for major projects, with major ESG-focused institutional investors like BlackRock and State Street, and big banks like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs leveraging their control of trillions of dollars in capital to lead the cause. But a funny thing happened on the way to a green Nirvana: It turned out that the chosen rent-seeking industries — wind, solar and electric vehicles — are not the nifty plug-and-play solutions they had been cracked up to be. Even worse, the advancement of new technologies and increased mining of cryptocurrencies created enormous new demand for electricity, resulting in heavy new demand for finding new sources of fossil fuels to keep the grid running and people moving around in reliable cars. In other words, reality butted into the green narrative, collapsing the foundations of the ESG movement. The laws of physics, thermodynamics and unanticipated consequences remain laws, not mere suggestions. Making matters worse for the ESG giants, Texas and other states passed laws disallowing any of these firms who use ESG principles to discriminate against their important oil, gas and coal industries from investing in massive state-governed funds. BlackRock and others were hit with sanctions by Texas in 2023. More recently, Texas and 10 other states sued Blackrock and other big investment houses for allegedly violating anti-trust laws. As the foundations of the ESG movement collapse, so are some of the institutions that sprang up around it. The United Nations created one such institution, the “Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative,” whose participants maintain pledges to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and adhere to detailed plans to reach that goal. The problem with that is there is now a growing consensus that a) the forced march to a green energy transition isn’t working and worse, that it can’t work, and b) the chances of achieving the goal of net-zero by 2050 are basically net zero. There is also a rising consensus among energy companies of a pressing need to prioritize matters of energy security over nebulous emissions reduction goals that most often constitute poor deployments of capital. Even as the Biden administration has ramped up regulations and subsidies to try to force its transition, big players like ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, and Shell have all redirected larger percentages of their capital budgets away from investments in carbon reduction projects back into their core oil-and-gas businesses. The result of this confluence of factors and events has been a recent rush by big U.S. banks and investment houses away from this UN-run alliance. In just the last two weeks, the parade away from net zero was led by major banks like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and, most recently, JP Morgan. On Thursday, the New York Post reported that both BlackRock and State Street, a pair of investment firms who control trillions of investor dollars (BlackRock alone controls more than $10 trillion) are on the brink of joining the flood away from this increasingly toxic philosophy. In June, 2023, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made big news when told an audience at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Aspen, Colorado that he is “ashamed of being part of this [ESG] conversation.” He almost immediately backed away from that comment, restating his dedication to what he called “conscientious capitalism.” The takeaway for most observers was that Fink might stop using the term ESG in his internal and external communications but would keep right on engaging in his discriminatory practices while using a different narrative to talk about it. But this week’s news about BlackRock and the other big firms feels different. Much has taken place in the energy space over the last 18 months, none of it positive for the energy transition or the net-zero fantasy. Perhaps all these big banks and investment funds are awakening to the reality that it will take far more than devising a new way of talking about the same old nonsense concepts to repair the damage that has already been done to the world’s energy system.

Title: World of Warcraft’s 20th anniversary was a bittersweet trip through time

We shall never see its likes again. “Stand in the circles of death,” our raid leader said as our Blackrock Depths group came up on Lord Incendius, a giant fire (what else, with a name like that?) elemental. “That sounds safe,” someone responded. “Otherwise, he’ll kaboom the raid,” the raid leader finished. It was peak World of Warcraft raid chat. Reader, we stood in the circles of death, and the only person that got kaboomed was the fire lord. Our group finished him off, several “ty all” comments appeared in chat, including one from yours truly, and my Demon Hunter was back outside the Caverns of Time, ready to hit the next element of the MMORPG’s anniversary event. Blizzard went all out for World of Warcraft’s 20th birthday. The multi-month, in-game party was at a size and scale that we don’t typically see from events of its kind. Maybe Blizzard understood the gravity of the moment, the rarity of it, and figured, “Why the hell not?” How many games get to do something like this, really? Given the current state of online games still eyeing Warcraft‘s throne (and, honestly, the whole industry), the odds of another game doing something like this down the road seems … small. The king stays the king. World of Warcraft‘s anniversary has traditionally been a fun, albeit small, shindig. There are some quests to complete and special bonuses for things like experience and reputation gain, but for the most part, it’s a little celebration. This year? It felt like a party. There was a giant stage where everyone’s favorite Jim Cummings-voiced storytelling panda, Lorewalker Cho, told stories from Warcraft’s history, and you could cry and throw tomatoes. There was a fashion show where players could vote for the best outfits on display and a mount-matching competition. Leeroy Jenkins had a fried chicken stand. The vibe was immaculate. You could revisit old dungeons that had been revived for the event and fight World Bosses from past expansions that were all teleported to the same place. The original Alterac Valley came back. There were new armor sets to grab, old, previously unobtainable things came out of the vaults, and BRD went from being a dungeon to a reworked raid. There was a whole new questline focused on helping an overworked event coordinator solve problems featuring characters from across the MMO’s history that ended with everyone throwing the two of you a big party to say thank you. You could even ring the Scarab Gong (if you know, you know) and buy items that would give you reputation with factions that had been removed from the game — at last, my Zandalar Tribe reputation no longer sits there, unfinished, taunting me. I dumped tons of hours into the 20th Anniversary Celebration, admiring the obvious love and care for the history on display. World of Warcraft has changed a lot in those 20 years. I’ve been playing since near the beginning of the game’s life, and it still dumbfounds me. The class I main now, Demon Hunter, wasn’t even in the game at release. There were fewer character customization options and fewer races to play as. Stuff like Raid Finder and Dungeon Finder didn’t exist. You had to sit in Looking for Group and find other people who wanted to go to the same dungeon you did and then physically go there. Hunters used to have to carry ammo! Money was hard to earn! Mounts were luxuries! The level cap was 120 at one point! We’ve gone through, like, three different talent systems! I could spend 10,000 words covering how much WoW has changed in that time and I wouldn’t be able to do it justice. Blizzard’s 20th Anniversary Celebration wasn’t about making things the way they were but reminding us where we’d been along the way. It was like coming back to your parent’s house and seeing all your friends and finding treasure in the attic. And as I played it, something unpleasant — like tasting food you think might still be good, but as soon as it hits your tongu,e you know that bad boy has soured — wormed its way into my head: We’re probably never going to see something like this again. Okay, maybe Final Fantasy XIV gets there. Maybe Warframe. Maybe Fortnite, though Fortnite is less about itself and more about being Ready Player One. Maybe a few games make it. The good Lord willing and the creek don’t rise. But can you imagine a modern online-only game surviving long enough to get something like this? World of Warcraft is utterly unique; at one point, it had more active players than there are people who live in the state of Georgia. Imagine that. It got a South Park episode that was made partially in-game! And even that behemoth, a game so monumental, so important, that its release is literally a demarcation line for how the industry is and how games are made and released, almost didn’t survive the one-two “this game is kinda bad now” punch of Battle for Azeroth and Shadowlands that saw players leave en masse. If World of Warcraft can barely get here, what hope does anything else have? Forget the Concords and the Suicide Squads of the world; how many corpses of online-only games has the industry stepped over in the pursuit of the unattainable? How many more of those games are coming because every executive in every C-suite believes that, surely, this time will be different? In an age where servers are turned off if a game isn’t an immediate success, how could anything last 20 years, much less build a legacy? World of Warcraft was a unicorn; we shall never see something of its kind again. But it didn’t get to 12 million subscribers overnight. It was allowed to grow. Playing the 20th Anniversary Celebration was joyous, and I’m a little sad that it’s gone. The area around the Caverns of Time is once again just rock and sand. It was a triumphant celebration of a great game. But as I think of it now, all I see is what we’ve lost and what we’ll never see again. Before he worked on Warcraft Rumble, its associate game director, Adam Kugler, did not play many mobile games. Kugler was lead class designer on World of Warcraft, and at one point during Warcraft Rumble's development, he went to lunch with game director Tom Chilton to get some advice. While Kugler wanted to get guidance on where to take the MMO next, Chilton pitched working on Warcraft Rumble to Kugler and convinced him to check out some mobile games and get a better idea of the space. When he returned on Monday, Kugler had been won over by the idea of a Warcraft mobile game and jumped ship from World of Warcraft to work on a new title shortly after that. A Warcraft mobile MMO from Blizzard and NetEase is reportedly canceled after three years of development. This spinoff project, codenamed Neptune, was a mobile MMO World of Warcraft spin-off that took place during a different time period. Blizzard and NetEase scrapped it due to an unspecified financial disagreement This news comes by way of a Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the game's development. Bloomberg reached out to NetEase and Activision Blizzard for comment on the project's status, but neither company chose to comment on the matter. Activision Blizzard plans to release a new Call of Duty game and mobile Warcraft game in 2022, according to a February 2022 financial results report. As part of that report, the company went over what investors could expect from Activision, Blizzard, and King in 2022. Notably, a Warcraft game for mobile phones is officially teased for the first time: "Blizzard is planning substantial new content for the Warcraft franchise in 2022, including new experiences in World of Warcraft and Hearthstone, and getting all-new mobile Warcraft content into players’ hands for the first time." We've yet to learn the title of this game or see it in action. It'll be the first Warcraft game released since the disappointing Warcraft 3: Reforged in 2020, and the second to hit iOS and Android, following Hearthstone. In the same report, Activision discussed Call of Duty in great detail. While the teased Call of Duty game is still untitled, this financial results report and a tweet from Infinity Ward heavily suggest that it's Modern Warfare 2. "Development on this year’s premium and Warzone experiences is being led by Activision’s renowned Infinity Ward studio," the results state. "The team is working on the most ambitious plan in franchise history, with industry-leading innovation and a broadly appealing franchise setting." Shortly afterward, Infinity Ward tweeted, "A new generation of Call of Duty is coming soon. Stay frosty." https://twitter.com/InfinityWard/status/1489346822208249861 "Stay frosty" is an iconic line of John "Soap" MacTavish, a classic Modern Warfare character that was only teased in the 2019 reboot. Considering that 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is widely regarded as the series' best game in recent memory, it's not a surprise that the Modern Warfare 2 rumors are true. A report from Bloomberg claims that this game will still release on PlayStation consoles, which makes sense as the Microsoft acquisition isn't expected to be complete until June 30, 2022. Despite the acquisition being in progress, developers fighting to unionize, and the delay of Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV, this financial results report confirms that we can still expect new games from Activision Blizzard in 2022.

Title: Cracks In the Climate Change Narrative? Blackrock Quits Net Zero Asset Management Initiative

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/11/2025 4:45:05 AM PST by MtnClimber Blackrock has become the latest financial giant to take a step back from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) Initiative and its efforts to cut so-called greenhouse gas emissions to zero by the year 2050 or sooner. Blackrock, which manages $11.5 trillion in assets, joins a growing number of firms who are walking back their support for climate and Environmental, Social and Government (ESG) commitments. According to Reuters, NZAMI has garnered more than 325 signatories that manage more than $57.5 trillion in assets, all of whom have pledged to support the goal of net zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 through various environmental initiatives. According to Reuters, a number of major Wall Street lenders have left a similar climate organization for banks in the weeks ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House and Republicans taking control of Congress. Trump has been openly critical of ESG investing and has voiced skepticism of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and environmental rules that are blocking the creation of new energy and infrastructure projects. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, called the move by Blackrock “a huge win for freedom and American prosperity.” Bloomberg reports that a client letter obtained from Blackrock explains that its membership in the net-zero group, “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials.” Rep. Jordan heralded the firm’s departure from NZAMI and urged other U.S. financial institutions to, “follow suit and abandon the climate cartel and woke ESG policies.” (Excerpt) Read more at amgreatness.com ...

According to Reuters, NZAMI has garnered more than 325 signatories that manage more than $57.5 trillion in assets, all of whom have pledged to support the goal of net zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 through various environmental initiatives. According to Reuters, a number of major Wall Street lenders have left a similar climate organization for banks in the weeks ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House and Republicans taking control of Congress. Trump has been openly critical of ESG investing and has voiced skepticism of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and environmental rules that are blocking the creation of new energy and infrastructure projects. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, called the move by Blackrock “a huge win for freedom and American prosperity.” Bloomberg reports that a client letter obtained from Blackrock explains that its membership in the net-zero group, “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials.” Rep. Jordan heralded the firm’s departure from NZAMI and urged other U.S. financial institutions to, “follow suit and abandon the climate cartel and woke ESG policies.” (Excerpt) Read more at amgreatness.com ...

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/11/2025 4:19:52 AM PST by RoosterRedux LA is burning. And the derelict people responsible are worried that they are found out as charlatans and empty suits. The leftwing voters who enabled them are getting angry over the inferno that their chosen politicos green-lighted—as if they are shocked, shocked by the consequences of their voting. The dam buster Nero Newsom made his accustomed fiddling appearance and then split—when the media began pointing out that he prohibits new reservoirs, sends precious water out to sea, blows up dams, prevents precautionary gleaning of forests and chaparrals, and then usually blames “Climate change” or “Trump” when called to account. Poor Karen Bass was DEI-ing in Uganda after being previously warned that lack of rain, record winds, and kindling-like hillsides put her city in existential danger: Out of sight, out of mind. Or did she junket across the world to consult about fire prevention with Ghana’s new president? Was slashing nearly $18 million from the $50 billion city budget, after bragging about creating “451 new positions” in various woke/DEI fields, a way to prevent 25-square miles of Dresden-like desolation? The embattled Fire Chief Kristen Crowley for two years has bragged not of response time, not of preventive strategies to stop fires, not of slashed budgets and water shortages, but instead about her DEI credentials as the “first” (fill in the blanks) LGBTQ etc. woman, who has hired “70 percent” of her force as either nonwhite, or nonmale, or nonbinary, or non-old fashioned, tough-guy firefighters. The LA utility head? Usually AWOL. The permanent director of LA infrastructure is usually quickly fired or resigns for incompetence, bribery, or malfeasance. Joe Biden? He was there—but only to try to put thousands of acres of federal land off-limits to roadblock the evil incoming Trump administration. (Excerpt) Read more at x.com ...

Title: Meta and Amazon Axe Diversity Initiatives Ahead Of Trump’s White House Return

By Caroline Frost pmc-media-editor-2024 Meta is axing its diversity programs, adding their names to a growing list of firms across corporate America making similar moves in anticipation of Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The BBC reports that Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, sent a memo to staff about the decision, citing “a shifting legal and policy landscape.” Other companies to make similar recruitment decisions regarding diversity efforts since Trump won the US election in November include Walmart and McDonald. Related Stories News "Shameful": Joe Biden Slams Meta & Mark Zuckerberg For Dropping Fact Checking In What Could Be Outgoing POTUS' Last Press Conference News Supreme Court Justices Express Skepticism Of Overturning Law That Could Lead To TikTok Ban The BBC says the memo from Meta said that the term “DEI” (diversity, equity and inclusion) had become “charged.” It said that while it would continue to look for diverse staff, but finish seeking selection from a pool specifically of diverse candidates. Watch on Deadline Amazon previously sent a memo to staff in December, saying it was “winding down outdated programs and materials” related to representation and inclusion. Amazon confirmed to Deadline that Candi Castleberry, VP of Inclusive eXperiences and Technology, wrote to staff on December 16, saying: “We’re aiming to complete that by the end of 2024.” She added: “We believe this is important work, so we’ll keep investing in programs that help us reflect those audiences, help employees grow, thrive, and connect, and we remain dedicated to delivering inclusive experiences for customers, employees, and communities around the world.” The BBC reports that JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock this week pulled out of groups focused on risks from climate change. It follows Meta’s announcement four days ago that it was ending a fact-checking program previously criticised by Trump and Republicans. Deadline reported Tuesday that Zuckerberg had posted a video saying: “The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech. So we’re going back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies and restoring free expression on our platforms.” The changes are just the latest effort by Meta given that Trump and his allies have targeted the platform and Zuckerberg himself. Following Trump’s reelection, Zuckerberg met with the president-elect. Last week, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, Nick Clegg, announced his departure, to be replaced by Joel Kaplan, a Republican who has been sympathetic to claims that the platform has suppressed conservative voices.

Key takeaways The crypto market is going mainstream, and several leading institutions, including BlackRock and Standard Chartered, are expanding their base in the nascent industry. As these institutions take positions in larger cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether, retail investors can invest in newer projects with massive potential. One project that could record massive growth in 2025 is iDEGEN. The project merges the AI and memecoin ecosystems, ensuring investors take advantage of both. According to their whitepaper, iDEGEN is a meme project that leverages the benefits of AI in a bid to create the next billion-dollar memecoin. iDEGEN is a tool designed to learn, evolve, and adapt by leveraging community feeds on X. While iDEGEN is powered by AI, degens ultimately raise the tool. The team is launching the token as a memecoin thanks to the massive adoption of this narrative in recent years. In 2024, the memecoin space grew from a $20 billion market cap to $120 billion, representing a 500% growth within 12 months. It is the second-best performing narrative in the crypto space, only behind AI. Hence, iDEGEN combining AI and memecoin means it seeks to leverage the two fastest-growing narratives in the crypto space. As a memecoin, iDEGEN could be on track to outperform several other cryptocurrencies in the broader market. The team explained that the iDEGEN tool has a simple working mechanism. Users feed the tool their data through tweets, tags, and comments. It absorbs the post and adds it to its knowledge base; that’s how it learns. Furthermore, the tool posts on X every 60 minutes and can generate and post memes. Want to read more about iDEGEN? Click here. The iDEGEN pre-market auction continues to hit new milestones. According to the website, the pre-market auction has raised $16 million, selling over 1.3 billion $IDGN tokens. Furthermore, $iDGN has 18,375 holders, accumulating 65,176% in ROI since investing in this token. iDEGEN implemented a unique pre-market auction method that allows early investors to record excellent gains. Despite the broader crypto market’s underperformance, the iDEGEN token has increased 939% in the last seven days. With the pre-market auction method, the price adjusts every five minutes based on market activity. According to the team, if an investor purchases $IDGN tokens within five minutes, the price will remain steady for the next period. However, if purchases occur consecutively, the price will rise by 5%. Finally, if no one buys the tokens within five minutes, the price will drop by 5%. The iDEGEN pre-market auction has raised over $16 million to enable the team to build its products and services. With over 900% ROI for early investors in the last seven days, this token could outperform thousands of cryptocurrencies once it lists on exchanges. As an investor, one of the best times to buy a token is during its presale. With $IDGN still up for grabs, this could be an excellent investment in the medium to long term. $IDGN will list once the pre-market auction is over and could deliver excellent gains to early investors thanks to its AI and memecoin combination. Investors can easily track key information on the iDEGEN website, including the token’s pre-market listing price. This enables them to track the token’s progress accurately before its launch on trading platforms.

Title: Dundrum apartments decision a symptom of broken planning system
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2025/01/11/dundrum-apartments-decision-a-symptom-of-broken-planning-system/
Time Published: 2025-01-11T07:15:00Z
Full Content:
News that An Bord Pleanála had turned down a proposed development of 881 apartments on the site of the old Dundrum shopping centre follows an all-too-familiar pattern. A lengthy and complicated process has a project shot down due to objections and the decision of planners that rules had been contravened. Initial plans to redevelop this site go back as far as 2004, with the latest decision relating to an application process that started towards the end of 2021. I am not qualified to give an opinion on the reasons the scheme was turned down, which ranged from height to the nature and scale of the residential plans, to flood planning and transport concerns and a view that it did not fit within planning guidelines. Reading the decision gives an insight into the complexity of factors involved. But what is clear when we stand back is that this is another example of the planning and development system not acting in the wider national interest. There is, after all, a housing crisis. Here is a site that is ideally suited to development. It is in an urban area where, on the basis of all the national and local plans, development is desirable. National guidelines underline the vital goal of more “compact” living – developing sites near city and town centres and transport links, necessary to achieve climate goals. This site is 50m from a Luas stop, beside a host of bus services and near schools, shops and other services. The Strategic Housing Development scheme introduced in 2017, designed to speed things up by allowing developers to bypass local authorities (and under which the Dundrum application was made) has been a disaster Yet somehow the developers and planners cannot come up with a scheme to get it done. In a logical scenario, the two sides would sit down at the start – based on clear planning guidelines – drawn up after local consultation and offering appropriate rights to objection and agree what could happen. Once the developer stayed within the rules, it would happen. Instead, the Irish system looks back to front and upside down. Developers face delay and uncertainty. Planners are trying to guard against their decisions being legally overturned. The courts rule on narrow matters of law and this is not always in line with the wider interest. The odds are stacked against progress being made, particularly in the case of complex infill sites such as Dundrum. Reading Dundrum, it is clear that the local and national guidelines are not always completely aligned, or at least leave room for significant interpretation. There was a pre-planning meeting between the developers and the planners in late 2021 designed to scope things out. But, in the light of this, reading the planning judgment leaves you mystified about the gap between, on one side, a developer who felt their scheme was fully justified and, on the other, a planning authority who felt the exact opposite. Difficulties in developing urban sites are common, though reasons vary. Just down the road, the site of the old Central Mental Hospital has also been through the planning hoops, held up by an objection from another developer to a scheme approved by An Bord Pleanála. A joint venture between the local authority and the Land Development Agency may finally get the vital provision of more than 800 social and affordable houses started. But with years of delay. Two build-to-rent schemes in Blackrock and Dublin 18 proposed by Cairn Homes were turned down by An Bord Pleanála after lengthy consideration – one due to an “over-proliferation” of such schemes in the area. Cross the river to the north side of Dublin and you find the Supreme Court ruling against the planning approval for more than 1,500 apartments on the old Clonliffe College site, because enough consideration had not been given to potential damage to the adjoining lands and structures. Developments for renters, in other words, are not welcome. Local homeowners and businesses often have legitimate concerns, but the better-off use any legal tool to maintain the status quo And a scheme to redevelop an old pitch and putt course beside the Cadbury factory on the Malahide Road was turned down by An Bord Pleanála because it ruled that an assisted living element to the site did not go far enough to meet “mixed-use” guidelines (meaning that sites should comprise more than just housing), concerns about light in a minority of the apartments and a finding that the developers had failed to adequately consider the impact on Brent geese. A survey had shown no evidence that the geese – a regular feature of appeals in north Dublin – had used the site at all in recent years. This is not an argument to allow proper planning and vital environmental rules to be ignored. But if compact living is the goal of national policy, then Ireland needs to get a lot better at this. The Strategic Housing Development scheme introduced in 2017, designed to speed things up by allowing developers to bypass local authorities (and under which the Dundrum application was made) has been a disaster, spurring a host of legal challenges. At least its replacement seems better. Meanwhile, in some aspects – such as the designation of new urban development zones – the new planning act may help, though its implementation is going to take time and planning experts warn about the impact of some provisions. The Sinn Féin housing plan, meanwhile, had sensible suggestions about just how developers and local authorities could co-operate more effectively to get redevelopments on “brownfield” sites such as the one in Dundrum planned and delivered more effectively. And the Commission on Housing has a good analysis of the particular planning and financial challenges in redeveloping these sites and how to address them. At the moment nobody’s interests are served – except the lawyers and planning consultants, of course. Or maybe, quietly, it all suits some people quite well. A number of the objections to rental housing schemes refer pejoratively to the creation of a “transient” community or one that is not “stable”. Developments for renters, in other words, are not welcome. Local homeowners and businesses often have legitimate concerns, but the better-off use any legal tool to maintain the status quo. And local politicians quoted in the case of Dundrum, for example, were happy to support the idea of development, but also to repeat the objections of constituents to this scheme. A malign mind might argue that rather than this all being seen as a problem that goes to the heart of national spatial, social, economic and climate policy, a lot of people are happy enough with the way things are. And to see lack of supply keep the value of their house on the up. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Who is Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, the “Tsarina” who wants to enter OLT?
URL: https://en.protothema.gr/2025/01/11/who-is-margarita-louis-dreyfus-the-tsarina-who-wants-to-enter-olt/

Full Content:
Margarita Olegovna Louis-Dreyfus. This is the first name that stands out in the shareholder structure of the company Leonidsport, which submitted a public offer for 21% of the shares of the Thessaloniki Port Authority (OLT). She is the widow of Robert Louis-Dreyfus and head of the French giant Louis-Dreyfus, one of the most powerful conglomerates on the planet. “Tsarina,” is the nickname used for her by the French and American press due to her Russian origins, even though she does not come from a noble family or ultra-wealthy oligarchs from Russia, as one might imagine. The fourth wealthiest woman in Europe and one of the wealthiest in the world today, with a fortune exceeding 5 billion euros, the woman who controls global agricultural product trade and has powerful businesses in every sector of the economy one can think of, was once a poor orphan from the Soviet Union, educated thanks to the sacrifices of her grandfather. From Leningrad to the top of the world Her grandfather, Leonid Bogdanov, also raised her after her parents were killed in a train accident in 1969, when Margarita was just 7 years old. Bogdanov believed that the greatest wealth he could give Margarita was education and did everything he could to provide it. After graduating from school, she left Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and studied law at Moscow State University. Immediately after, she pursued a master’s degree at the Institute of Soviet Trade in Leningrad, where she obtained degrees in economics. After completing her studies, Margarita left the Soviet Union, where opportunities were limited. Armed with her high educational level, sharp mind, and impressive appearance, she secured a job as a salesperson at the German microchip and electronics company Laytron AG. Her grandfather, Leonid, whose name was given— as one can easily guess— to the company that is “entering” OLT, lived to see his beloved granddaughter “settled,” with a good job and prospects. Not family-wise, though, since in the mid-1980s Margarita married a Swiss student, with whom she divorced a year later. However, he did not live to see her become a powerful woman, as he passed away in 1985. In 1988, Margarita was on a flight from Zurich to London. Fate had her sitting next to Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the French businessman with an MBA from Harvard, who was constantly “in the air” because he managed the companies of the commercial giant founded by his great-grandfather in 1851. Margarita didn’t know this when she asked him what time it was. Nor did she know when they “clicked,” because, aside from telling her the time, he showed her a picture of his fluffy British shepherd dog (Bobtail) to attract the attention of the striking blonde sitting next to him. Something he succeeded at, as well as getting her phone number. A few days later, Robert called Margarita, asking her to translate a document into Russian. “You know, you could have asked me to go out to dinner without needing any translation,” she responded. “Alright,” he murmured, and their love story inevitably led to their marriage in 1992. After the marriage, Margarita acquired Swiss citizenship and became a full-time mother, caring for the three children she had with Robert: Eric and the twin boys, Kiril and Maurice. Meanwhile, Robert Louis-Dreyfus had created a new business empire without using a single cent from the conglomerate he was about to inherit—he was not involved in it anyway. He had made a fortune from poker (!) and was about to build an even greater fortune by rescuing failing businesses like the sports giant Adidas and the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi. Among the dozens of companies he managed in Europe, Australia, Asia, and the Americas, he became more and more involved in sports. In 1996, he made headlines by purchasing the historic French football club Marseille (Olympique de Marseille). His joy at becoming involved in European professional football would not last long. A year later, he was diagnosed with leukemia. The disease was very aggressive, and as his battle became more intense, he gradually entrusted Margarita with more and more responsibilities. In 2000, he returned to the family agricultural giant, the Louis-Dreyfus Group, which his great-grandfather had founded in 1851. In 2008, he founded Akira Holding to transfer 61% of Louis-Dreyfus, which he would gather, to her. Robert sensed that his end was near and anticipated what could happen to other giants: The board might “throw out” his wife to take control and transfer the company to another conglomerate. Thus, in 2008, he locked the shares for 99 years and appointed Margarita as the family trustee, ensuring that the aforementioned scenario could not happen. When he died in July 2009, at the age of 63, he left her in the strongest position on the three-member board, overseeing the largest share of the company, headquartered in Amsterdam, the third-largest agricultural products company in the world. But Margarita, after her husband’s death, did everything she could to fulfill his last wish, as he expressed it to her shortly before he passed away. “Do what I did. Maintain and grow the company to pass it on to our heirs,” their children. The new life It wasn’t an easy task. Yes, Robert had “locked” the shares so that no other shareholders or members could remove her from the board, but Margarita had to fight to earn respect, not just in the business world but even in the companies she controlled. “It’s a man’s world, and most of the time, men don’t take women seriously,” she said in an interview with Bloomberg, speaking about her business career. Margarita didn’t settle for the (more than comfortable) life of being the widow and heir of one of the wealthiest people in the world. She took action as president of Louis-Dreyfus companies and also Marseille, where she recently managed to fend off an aggressive takeover attempt by Saudi Prince Al-Waleed. And she made remarkable changes in the group. She sold the energy trading company and acquired more shares in Louis-Dreyfus, strengthening her position in it. At the same time, she was “building” the future for her three sons. She sent the twins to a school in Singapore “to expose them to new cultures and broaden their horizons,” as she said in an interview, while Eric studied in the USA and began his career as an intern at another commodity giant, Glencore, to gain the necessary experience. Margarita never stayed in the shadows. She earned the prestige and respect of the most powerful business circles on the planet and… inevitably began mingling with Europe’s elite. In the stands of the Stade Vélodrome (the home of Olympique Marseille), she was often photographed with French Presidents, such as Nicolas Sarkozy and the now-powerful head of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. From 2013 onward, in these photos, she would often appear with the former head of the Swiss National Bank and later vice-president of BlackRock, Philippe Hildebrandt. Their joint appearances would become the subject of discussion since, that year, Hildebrandt would divorce his wife, Kasia, after becoming involved in a trading scandal. This scandal also cost Hildebrandt his job, as Kasia is said to have made a significant profit with insider information about Switzerland’s monetary policy. Although there isn’t much information about Margarita Louis-Dreyfus’ personal life, in 2021, Louis Dreyfus Group confirmed journalistic reports that Margarita gave birth to twin girls, with the statement “the mother and babies are in excellent health,” without any mention of the father. How big is the Louis-Dreyfus Group? But how big and powerful can Louis Dreyfus be, for Margarita to be called “Tsarina”? If annual sales of 120 billion (net revenue of around 50-60 billion dollars yearly), operations in 100 countries, and 22,000 employees don’t say much to you, then perhaps the “ABCD” can. The four companies that dominate global agricultural product trade and primarily grains—Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus—are known as “ABCD.” These four companies were also involved in the 2011 scandal about grain price manipulation and tax evasion in Argentina. The French company represents about 10% of global agricultural trade flows, is the world’s largest cotton and rice trader, and the second-largest sugar trader. It is also the third-largest trader of copper, zinc, and lead concentrates globally, only behind Glencore and Trafigura. Louis Dreyfus is not just involved in agriculture and food processing. It also operates in international shipping with a fleet of oceangoing vessels, freight transportation, banking (owning the French bank Louis Dreyfus and shares in other banks), telecommunications infrastructure development, real estate management, and trades everything from minerals to Brazilian coffee, also owning several hedge funds. LD was founded in 1851 by Leopold Dreyfus, an 18-year-old Alsatian Jew, who became wealthy from his adolescence by buying and reselling grain from farmers to more distant regions. Leopold Dreyfus thus created one of Europe’s strongest dynasties. To this day, the company he founded is owned and managed by descendants of the same family. OLT and the Shareholders Margarita Louis-Dreyfus is now poised to take a leading role in Greek business life after submitting an optional public offer to acquire up to 2,116,800 shares of OLT, representing 21% of the company’s capital, through the company “Leonidsport B.V.” The company, which bears the name of Margarita’s grandfather, began the process yesterday, informing the Capital Markets Commission and OLT’s Board of Directors, submitting the information prospectus to them. The offered cash price for acquiring each share in the Public Offer is 27 euros. It should be noted that OLT’s stock closed at 22.88 euros yesterday, which is a premium of more than 17% compared to the price of the company’s shares. Explore related questions

Title: Curve Finance network activity doubles in 2024 – Will it fuel CRV value in 2025?

Is strong network growth enough for CRV to reverse its recent losses? Curve Finance’s user base more than doubled in 2024, reinforcing the nearly 500% gains logged by its native token, CRV, during its November pump. According to an exclusive 2024 report shared with AMBCrypto, the decentralized exchange (DEX) saw its unique users grow from 30k in 2023 to 60k in 2024 – A whopping 105% increase on a YoY (year-on-year) basis. The TVL also soared from $1.7B in early November to $2.4B in early January. This indicated improved trust and investor confidence in the DEX as more capital was locked in its smart contracts. Source: DeFiLlama The report cited new product features and institutional interest as key drivers of the user base. In fact, in late November, BlackRock chose Curve for liquidity and trading of its tokenized asset BUIDL. This indicated institutional interest in the DEX, which has also been evident on the price charts. Despite the weak market sentiment at press time, CRV still held about 280% of the gains logged during the November pump. The recent pullback eased at the demand zone of $0.6-$0.7 (cyan), and the price action chalked a triangle pattern. A bullish breakout from the pattern could make the $1.5 target feasible. However, a bearish breakout could erase more November gains and push the price to $0.26. Source: CRV/USDT, TradingView That being said, the weak sentiment and negative 30-day MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) suggested that CRV was relatively cheap at its press time price. The 30-day MVRV was down 10% while the 60-day MVRV was positive at 12%. This indicated that those who bought the coin in the past one and two months had, on average, an unrealized loss of 10% and a profit of 12%, respectively.

Why are folks in NC STILL living in tents with freezing weather happening? Just like Laihaina, BlackRock is there to buy it all up for pennies on the dollar. Almost like a plan.

The lost interest payments can be added to the principle of the loan. It would protect both the bank and the borrower. Also, they stopped maintaining the firebreaks and let them get full of flammable biomass. There are J6 political prisoners who have nowhere to go after Trump’s frees them in a few days. Lara Loomer apparently has an organization set up to help house them. They cancelled the insurance because California prevented them from raising their rates. They didn’t want to operate at a loss. Watch for questions about ‘lithium batteries’ when the investigations start. Where to go? If you are a die hard Fascist Demoncrat, and wish to stay in California, go squat on Newscum’s mansion. If you desire to leave the state, move to NY or other Red State so as not to incur culture shock. Not only did they cancel insurance coverage, in our case, they increased our rates from $100 a month to $600 a month with no explanation. We live in Northern California and are nowhere near a catastrophic fire zone. There are orchards and rice farms and other agricultural fields nearby but nothing like the canyons and mountains like they have in SoCal. “There really should be a law that mortgage payments are paused on a mortgage for 6 months after a total home loss in a federal or state disaster zone. ” Lenders will work with homeowners in this situation. Lotta lawyers are gonna get A LOT richer! Insanity. Sounds like you might be near the area where we had family, years ago. Lots of orchards and rice farms. Not when the value of the empty lot exceeds the value of the mortgage they won't. The lender will squeeze the destitute and homeless homeowner until they can foreclose on the property and make a windfall. It’s all part of the plan. The land was expensive and TPTB want it for cheap. Time to put the squeeze on the rightful owners to get them off. Deny them insurance, Deny them grace periods for mortgage pymts.

Title: Is Imperial Oil Limited (IMO) the Best Canadian Dividend Stock to Buy For Income Investors?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Canadian Dividend Stocks to Buy For Income Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) stands against the other Canadian dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are favored by investors not only in the US but also internationally. Canadian dividend companies, known for their robust cash flows, steady dividends, and solid balance sheets, have been particularly popular. However, these stocks lost some appeal in recent years as investors shifted their focus to other asset classes. According to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, there is now a renewed interest in Toronto's dividend-paying stocks, which had been overlooked for over two years. This resurgence is expected to grow as short-term interest rates in Canada continue to decline. An analyst at the bank, Ian de Verteuil, noted in a research report that the shift back to high-yielding equities, such as utilities, REITs, and communications, is just beginning. If interest rates continue to decline, the team anticipates that Canadian investors will redirect approximately $220 billion (US$161 billion) into dividend-paying stocks, moving away from fixed-income products. During periods of higher interest rates in Canada, dividend-paying equities were largely overlooked as investors sought better returns in term deposits, high-interest savings account ETFs, and technology stocks. As a result, the S&P/TSX Composite High Dividend Index has underperformed compared to the broader Canadian and US markets in both 2023 and the early part of 2024, in terms of both price appreciation and total returns. Also read: Early Retirement Portfolio: 10 Stocks to Live Off Dividends The recent underperformance of dividend stocks contrasts with their historical resilience. According to a report by Morningstar, following the 2008 financial crisis, investors gravitated toward income-focused strategies, valuing the perceived safety they offered. In 2008, funds in the Canadian Dividend and Income Equity category experienced a 24% loss, significantly less than the 33% drop in the Canadian benchmark index. Similarly, in 2011, when the TSX fell over 8%, the average fund in this category declined by only 0.8%. The report further mentioned that since 2008, dividend-focused funds have excelled at protecting investors' capital during market downturns, capturing just 65% of the downside. These funds have also performed well during market upswings, capturing 75% of the gains. From January 2008 to June 2015, this category outperformed the broader market, delivering an annualized return of 4.7% compared to 3.7% for the TSX. Concentrating on higher-yielding Canadian stocks would involve increasing exposure to sectors already heavily represented in the index, particularly financials. To achieve high yields, analysts recommend directing investments toward utilities, REITs, telecommunications, and financial sectors. Ian de Verteuil advised that Canadian investors should maintain this shift into these sectors in the future. However, he pointed out that securing high yields in Canada is challenging, as the high-yield bond market is quite restricted. Here are some other remarks from the analyst: “Canadian investors have always struggled to find yield. Unlike the US, there are very few options for ‘high’ nominal yield – there is no Canadian municipal bond market and the high-yield bond market north of the border is extremely narrow.” While Canadian dividend equities present an attractive option for investors, analysts consistently recommend diversifying across various regions to optimize returns. Due to the tendency of dividend investing to result in a heavier concentration of financial and energy stocks—common in the domestic market—income-focused investors should ensure their portfolios are well-diversified and aligned with their income objectives. That said, we will take a look at some of the best dividend Canadian stocks for income investors. Our Methodology: For this article, we scoured the list of S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes Canadian companies with at least five years of dividend growth track records. From that list, we selected stocks that are traded on American stock exchanges and sorted them by the number of hedge fund holders in our database that also had positions in those companies at the end of Q3 2024. This means that these Canadian companies are the most famous among hedge fund investors. The companies mentioned below also have strong dividend histories and healthy balance sheets, which make them reliable investment options for income investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them as of Q4. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here) A close-up of an oil rig in motion with the ocean shining in the background. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 22 Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO), a petroleum refining company based in Calgary, is primarily owned by ExxonMobil, which holds a 69.7% stake in the company. Over the past five years, the stock has significantly outperformed the TSX, soaring nearly 175% compared to the benchmark index's 44% return. This performance was fueled by the company's strong operational performance. In the most recent quarter, it reported the highest upstream production in over three decades and ongoing reductions in upstream unit cash costs. Additionally, the company achieved robust downstream utilization while successfully carrying out major planned turnaround activities at its Nanticoke and Strathcona refineries, all while maintaining safety standards. In the third quarter of 2024, Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) reported that Kearl achieved a production rate of 295,000 total gross oil-equivalent barrels per day, with the company's share amounting to 209,000 barrels, matching its highest-ever third-quarter output. Cold Lake's production reached 147,000 gross oil-equivalent barrels per day, driven by a strong initial ramp-up of the Grand Rapids project, showcasing impressive performance. Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) also remained resilient in terms of its cash position. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at approximately C$1.5 billion. It also returned C$322 million to shareholders through dividends. On November 1, 2024, Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) declared a quarterly dividend of C$0.60 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. Overall, the company has been rewarding shareholders with growing dividends for the past 30 consecutive years, which makes IMO one of the best dividend Canadian stocks. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.49%, as of January 10. The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Imperial Oil Limited (NYSE:IMO) grew to 22 in Q3 2024, from 18 in the previous quarter. These stakes are worth over $186.3 million in total. Among these hedge funds, First Eagle Investment Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall IMO ranks 9th on our list of the best Canadian dividend stocks for income investors. While we acknowledge the potential for IMO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IMO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Meta and Amazon axe diversity initiatives joining US corporate rollback

Meta and Amazon are axing their diversity programmes, joining firms across corporate America that are rolling back hiring and training initiatives criticised by conservatives, citing legal and political risks. The move comes just days after Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans. In a memo to staff about its decision, which affects, hiring, supplier and training efforts, Meta cited a "shifting legal and policy landscape". Walmart and McDonalds are among the other companies to have made similar decisions regarding diversity efforts since Trump won re-election. In its memo to staff, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by the BBC, Meta cited a Supreme Court ruling concerning race in college admissions, while also noting that the term "DEI" (diversity, equity and inclusion) had become "charged". The tech giant said it would continue to look for diverse staff, but end its current approach, which seeks to make selections from a pool of diverse candidates. In a December memo to employees, Amazon said it was "winding down outdated programs and materials" related to representation and inclusion, aiming to complete the process by the end of 2024. "Rather than have individual groups build programs, we are focusing on programs with proven outcomes — and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture," Candi Castleberry, Amazon's VP of inclusive experiences and technology, wrote in the note which was first reported by Bloomberg on Friday. Financial firms JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, also pulled out of groups focused on risks from climate change this week. The moves are a sign of the acceleration of a retreat that started two years ago, as Republicans ramped up attacks on firms such as BlackRock and Disney, accusing them of "woke" progressive activism and threatening political punishment. Big brands such as Bud Light and Target also faced backlash and boycotts related to their efforts to appeal to LGBTQ customers. Many of the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives were put in place after the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in 2020 following George Floyd's murder at the hands of police. Recent court decisions have bolstered critics of the programmes, who said that they were discriminatory. The Supreme Court in 2023 struck down the right for private universities to consider race in admissions decisions. Another court of appeals ruling invalidated a Nasdaq policy that would have required companies listed on that stock exchange to have at least one woman, racial minority or LGBTQ person on their board or explain why not. Meta said it was also ending its efforts to work with suppliers who are "diverse" but will instead focus on small and medium-sized companies. It also plans to stop offering "equity and inclusion" training and instead offer programmes that "mitigate bias for all, no matter your background". Meta declined to comment on the memo, news of which was immediately met with both criticism and celebration. "I'm sitting back and enjoying every second of this," said conservative activist Robby Starbuck, who has taken credit for successfully campaigning against the policies at companies such as Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson. LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign said workplace inclusion policies help to attract and retain top staff and had been "directly tied to long-term business growth". "Those who abandon these commitments are shirking their responsibility to their employees, consumers, and shareholders" RaShawn "Shawnie" Hawkins, the senior director of the HRC Foundation's Workplace Equality Program said. Meta's move comes just days after the tech giant said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by Trump and Republicans and elevated conservatives to key leadership positions. In a nearly three-hour interview with podcaster Joe Rogan Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said he had always been concerned about being the arbiter of "truth" and was "ill-prepared" when the issue first heated up after the 2016 election. He said the demands to take down information became unreasonable under the Biden administration. For example, he said the company faced pressure during the pandemic to remove content like statements about vaccine side effects. That helped to generate a wider political backlash, he said, including his own. "I feel like I have much greater command now of what I think the policies should be," he said, adding that he felt the US government "should be defending its companies ... not be the tip of the spear attacking". "When the US does that to its tech industry, it's basically just open season around the rest of the world," he added. His exit comes amid a dispute over his report into Donald Trump's handling of classified documents. In an exclusive interview, Ian Russell tells the BBC that he believes there is "no real movement" within government on online safety. The US companies join other major firms donating funds for the ceremony on 20 January. Donald Trump will still take office as the first US president with a felony conviction.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 S&P 500 Stocks on Jim Cramer's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stands against the other S&P 500 stocks. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently discussed the current state of the market and also discussed both the leading and lagging stocks within the S&P 500. He posed an intriguing question: What if Trump's tariffs are more negotiable than expected? Instead of a hard-line approach, Cramer suggested they could end up being more like a "steak knife" than a "meat axe," meaning less harmful to trade and international relations. READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently and 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar While a more reasonable tariff policy might not be ideal for global trade, it would be a positive development for stocks, particularly if it results in lower prices for American consumers or if multinational companies move their manufacturing to more favorable countries. Cramer emphasized that, for stockholders looking for growth, hopes should be placed on negotiable tariffs. “If you own stocks and you want them higher, you have to hope for negotiable tariffs that could cause countries to lower prices to us or make multinational companies move their manufacturing base here to a more friendly country.” Cramer also discussed the S&P 500's performance this year, noting that, while it is clear which stocks have thrived in the Nasdaq, the winners and losers in the broader S&P 500 have been more difficult to pinpoint. Additionally, Cramer mentioned that several of the stocks in his Charitable Trust, which are reliant on a rebound in China, are ones he’s not excited about at the moment, especially considering the disappointing Chinese economic data. He mentioned that his dismay for such stocks will only last until “they annualize the crummy Chinese numbers and then they'll probably bounce back.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 2. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A pharmacist discussing the health benefits of a prescription medication with a customer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33 Cramer started the list of S&P 500’s losers in 2024 with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) and said: “How about the S&P’s biggest losers? Wow, they are powerful, powerfully bad. Starting with Walgreens, down 64%. Here's a company that needs a buyer or buyers, maybe some for the front of the store, decimated by Amazon, some for the back, which could be used as a dispensary for all sorts of drugs. CEO Tim Wentworth, he's real good. Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), while a major player in the retail pharmacy industry, has faced considerable financial challenges in recent years, with its stock plummeting by over 80% in the past five years. This decline has largely been driven by heightened competition from tech-driven retailers like Walmart and Amazon. The company is undergoing a turnaround plan that includes considering asset sales, implementing cost-cutting measures, and closing 1,200 underperforming stores. CEO Tim Wentworth pointed out that despite these difficulties, around 6,000 of its 8,000 stores are still profitable. Additionally, in early 2024, the company made a significant move by cutting its dividend yield by 48%, with a focus on better capital allocation. After The Wall Street Journal reported in December that Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) is in discussions to be acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners, Morgan Stanley analyst Erin Wright stated that while the firm understands the context of a potential sale amid a challenging pharmacy environment, a buyout is difficult to envision due to Walgreens' significant debt and low cash flow, which complicates the value creation potential. Wright has assigned an Underweight rating to the stock. Overall WBA ranks 6th on our list of the S&P 500 stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of WBA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 29 Stocks Ahead Of Major AI Event. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) stands against other stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. In his appearance on Squawk on the Street the day CES took place in Las Vegas, Jim Cramer commented on the stock market division that persisted throughout 2024 and is present in 2025 as well. The division has seen technology stocks perform well, while other rate-sensitive sectors such as industrial and materials stocks have languished. Cramer commented on the reasons behind it: “I think that’s because people perceive that the rest of the market is hostage to rates. And that tech is not hostage to anything. So I’m aware of that and I’m just concerned that you have this speech tonight, nine-thirty Jensen Huang, everyone’s, we’re really kind of, whatever he says, is going to move things.” In fact, this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared that it commented about “private equity and private equity trying to get into the 401(k) business.” He added and mentioned, “Marc Rowan CEO of Apollo says, I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement [inaudible] to NVIDIA’s performance! So [inaudible] we’ve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand, there’s these stocks are, they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them!” However, even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates, they might falter in some circumstances. One of these can be bond yields, and if the thirty-year yield spikes to 5%, then Cramer believes “that will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time, there’s now reacceleration in tech spend.” The CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day. He stated “I think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases. This is tonight’s CES talk. It wouldn’t surprise me if we start hearing about robots. It wouldn’t surprise me if we didn’t hear a lot about Tesla. Tesla and self-driving cars. Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA!” Along with industrial and material stocks, another sector that’s caught Cramer’s attention is banks. Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that “one of the groups that I think we have to focus on, there’s a really interesting, uh, Barclays piece on the banks. Darkest before dawn. Raising the group for the first time since 2019, emphasis here on Citi.” Cramer also outlined that while technology valuations might appear to be overstretched, this isn’t the case with banks. He shared “This is a group that when you look at it, they’re selling at 11 times 2026 numbers. So the idea that you have this valuation problem in the market, well look at these stocks! There’s no valuation problem with materials. Or with banks.” He added “The valuation problem is with the stuff that keeps getting upgraded, which is enterprise software. So there’s a little duplicitous nature among the top people who work at these firms because they should be saying look, there are two markets. There’s the inexpensive market and we’re warming up to it, and the expensive market, and we don’t know what to do.” To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on Monday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 72 Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is a mega-American media company with a presence in the broadband, broadcasting, and production markets. Like its peers, the firm has struggled in an era where the Internet has allowed streaming companies like Netflix to prosper and steal customers from traditional media. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)’s shares are down 14% year-to-date amidst a flurry of news such as a potential spin-off of legacy television networks such as CNBC. Here’s what Cramer had to say about Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA): “Now, we have a deal with Starlink in the Italian government. Well, we have Starlink when it comes to WiFi, when do we have Starlink when it comes to cable and telco in this country? There was an article in Barron’s about the parent company that we work for Comcast. And they threw the book at it. The proverbial cyber book since there’s no phonebook anymore. But the one thing I would say is they didn’t talk about Starlink. And the existential crisis that’s coming given the fact that Starlink, at least in Italy, presents a rate card that’s so below the normal rate card that you just have no choice but to take it. And the payback is in three months. So we have to be recognizing that Musk, and I think the next thing you’re going to hear about, is Starlink versus ATT, Verizon, T-Mobile, which had two downgrades today, and the wireless companies. Overall, CMCSA ranks 10th on our list of stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of CMCSA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We recently published a list of 15 AI Stocks That Skyrocketed in Q4. In this article, we are going to take a look at where SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) stands against other stocks that skyrocketed in Q4. AI has been dominating the news, market, and basically almost everything we come across for the last two years, since the launch of ChatGPT. In 2024, AI made significant strides, especially in agentic systems and smaller, more efficient models. In addition to that, advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (a method that combines information retrieval with text generation) improved data accuracy and reduced AI errors, while smaller models became faster and more energy-efficient, making AI more accessible. However, the year also saw a rise in AI-driven cybercrime, with deepfakes used in scams and election interference. As these risks grew, governments and regulators began to implement measures to control AI’s development and use. However, opinions on the balance between innovation and safety remain divided. While AI continues to evolve and shows immense long-term potential, it still faces challenges such as data limitations, model reliability, and the need for revenue-generating applications. With the maturity of this technology, it will be crucial to address these obstacles in order to meet investor expectations and unlock its full potential in the coming years. Julie Biel, chief market strategist and portfolio manager at Kayne Anderson Rudnick, discussed the current state of AI investments in a CNBC interview and noted that while significant capital has been poured into developing the technology, much of it is still at the infrastructure stage. She pointed out that AI’s efficiency improvements are beneficial, but the lack of revenue-generating use cases is preventing broader enthusiasm. Biel also raised concerns about a potential AI bubble, as she mentioned issues such as hallucinations and data limitations that could become a hurdle in short-term progress. Despite the strong long-term outlook, she suggested that investors’ patience may wear thin if immediate returns do not materialize. In another CNBC interview, Anastasia Amoroso, iCapital chief investment officer, highlighted the continued growth of AI as a major theme in 2024, especially its expansion into AI software and power. She noted that while the last two years focused on semiconductors, this year should focus on AI software monetization and the energy demands of AI infrastructure, like data centers. Amoroso believes that AI will remain a key investment opportunity into 2025 and that the sector’s broadening scope, including AI software and its supporting power needs, presents solid prospects for growth. For this article, we listed 15 best-performing stocks from Insider Monkey’s database of AI stocks with at least over 100% share price returns in the fourth quarter of 2024. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their share price performance. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 database of 900 elite hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer focused on a computer screen, writing code to create a conversational assistant. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 11 Stock Price Performance in Q4 2024: ~326% SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) provides voice AI solutions that help businesses create conversational experiences. Its offerings include platforms for building voice assistants, tools for real-time data integration, and AI-powered customer service solutions. The company also provides technologies like speech recognition, natural language understanding, and text-to-speech to enhance functionality. The start of 2025 has not been so good for SoundHound (NASDAQ:SOUN) but it had quite the run in the fourth quarter of 2024. It achieved some notable milestones in the quarter including its Amelia conversational AI platform winning the XCelent Advanced Technology 2024 Award from Celent for its exceptional functionality and generative AI capabilities in retail banking. Moreover, the company’s AI was integrated into Lancia Ypsilon vehicles’ S.A.L.A. infotainment system, enhancing driver experience with conversational AI features across several European countries. In November, SoundHound’s (NASDAQ:SOUN) voice technology was integrated into Kia vehicles in India, offering Hindi language support and advanced conversational capabilities for a personalized in-car experience. The company also announced in the same month that its Amelia AI agents have helped Apivia Courtage handle over 100,000 customer calls, reducing direct inquiries by 20% and enhancing employee productivity. In December 2024, SoundHound AI launched its Smart Ordering system at all 130 Torchy’s Tacos locations, enabling customers to place accurate, natural voice orders. Additionally, SoundHound’s Dynamic Drive-Thru solution was deployed at Church’s Texas Chicken, enhancing order accuracy and reducing wait times through AI-powered, real-time feedback. Meanwhile, SoundHound’s Amelia Conversational AI Platform was recognized as a leader in Frost & Sullivan’s 2024 Radar for Enterprise Conversational AI in Healthcare, showing its innovative solutions that improve patient engagement and streamline healthcare operations. However, it is important to note that despite posting record third-quarter 2024 results, including an 89% revenue increase to $25.1 million, on November 12, the company stock dropped around 17% by the next day. Analysts had mixed views about the stock. For example, Wedbush remained positive on the stock, while Ladenburg Thalmann downgraded the stock to Neutral due to concerns about the Amelia AI acquisition’s impact on margins and higher expected losses. Overall, SOUN ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that skyrocketed in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of SOUN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SOUN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 29 Stocks Ahead Of Major AI Event. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. In his appearance on Squawk on the Street the day CES took place in Las Vegas, Jim Cramer commented on the stock market division that persisted throughout 2024 and is present in 2025 as well. The division has seen technology stocks perform well, while other rate-sensitive sectors such as industrial and materials stocks have languished. Cramer commented on the reasons behind it: “I think that’s because people perceive that the rest of the market is hostage to rates. And that tech is not hostage to anything. So I’m aware of that and I’m just concerned that you have this speech tonight, nine-thirty Jensen Huang, everyone’s, we’re really kind of, whatever he says, is going to move things.” In fact, this division is so prevalent that some of the biggest asset managers in the world have also been unable to remain immune to it. Mentioning a piece in the Financial Times, Cramer shared that it commented about “private equity and private equity trying to get into the 401(k) business.” He added and mentioned, “Marc Rowan CEO of Apollo says, I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement [inaudible] to NVIDIA’s performance! So [inaudible] we’ve got the NVIDIAs of the world which everybody likes and on the other hand, there’s these stocks are, they really are hostage to rates and no one wants them!” However, even though technology stocks have stood the test of high interest rates, they might falter in some circumstances. One of these can be bond yields, and if the thirty-year yield spikes to 5%, then Cramer believes “that will start interfering with this tech rally that seems to be motivated by a lot of analysts coming out and saying this is the time, there’s now reacceleration in tech spend.” The CNBC host also speculated on what Jensen Huang might end up talking about at CES later in the day. He stated “I think that one of the things that Jensen is going to talk about today are all the new use cases. This is tonight’s CES talk. It wouldn’t surprise me if we start hearing about robots. It wouldn’t surprise me if we didn’t hear a lot about Tesla. Tesla and self-driving cars. Tesla and the neural network that is based on NVIDIA!” Along with industrial and material stocks, another sector that’s caught Cramer’s attention is banks. Mentioning a recent investment bank note about the sector he believes that “one of the groups that I think we have to focus on, there’s a really interesting, uh, Barclays piece on the banks. Darkest before dawn. Raising the group for the first time since 2019, emphasis here on Citi.” Cramer also outlined that while technology valuations might appear to be overstretched, this isn’t the case with banks. He shared “This is a group that when you look at it, they’re selling at 11 times 2026 numbers. So the idea that you have this valuation problem in the market, well look at these stocks! There’s no valuation problem with materials. Or with banks.” He added “The valuation problem is with the stuff that keeps getting upgraded, which is enterprise software. So there’s a little duplicitous nature among the top people who work at these firms because they should be saying look, there are two markets. There’s the inexpensive market and we’re warming up to it, and the expensive market, and we don’t know what to do.” To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on Monday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 279 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest technology companies in the world. While it was one of the first firms to benefit from investors’ interest in AI stocks, the momentum has cooled off since July 2024. Investors are in a wait-and-watch mode for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s stock as they evaluate whether the billions of dollars it has spent on OpenAI will lead to profitability for its Azure Cloud computing division. Cramer’s comments for the firm surrounded a recent AI blog post by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s vice chair and president Brad Smith: “Brad Smith’s, his blog entry, it’s really much more than that. He’s talking about an AI manifesto. And the reason why I say it’s important is cause a lot of people say listen he’s talking about $80 billion in spend, so what. No he’s not. He’s talking about the new industrial revolution. Which is what you should be hearing tonight from Jensen. The new industrial revolution is such that you can’t afford to not spend. Not because you’re worried about what other people are doing, but because it’s so bountiful.” Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of stocks ahead of major AI event that Jim Cramer discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

In today’s AI-driven stock market, the firm’s shares initially struggled as investors fretted about AI’s ability to replace customer management teams and businesses through tools such as chatbots. However, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has recovered since then as its Agentforce product has elicited strong approval in the market. Cramer is also appreciative of Agentforce as he commented on a bearish Guggenheim note: “And interesting[ly], the Salesforce [bearish analyst note] you mentioned, is the, one of the few where there’s not to be acceleration.

Title: ‘A Huge Win’: Woke ‘Cartel’ Of Financial Giants Dealt Death Blow 11 Days Before Trump Takes Office
URL: https://dailycaller.com/2025/01/10/blackrock-exits-united-nations-backed-net-zero-coalition/
Time Published: 2025-01-10T21:58:03Z

Asset management behemoth BlackRock wrote a letter to institutional investors Thursday announcing its exit from an emissions-focused investor group, according to the Financial Times (FT). The firm, which manages over $10 trillion and has been a leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, has left the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) coalition — a United Nations–sponsored collection of financial services companies that have pledged to achieve net-zero portfolios by 2050 or sooner, the FT reported. The move comes less than two weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, who plans to embrace fossil fuels in his second term, takes office, and follows the exits of a slew of other corporations, including Goldman Sachs Group, Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (RELATED: UN Reportedly Moves To Unlock Tens Of Millions In Climate Funding For Country Run By Terrorists) In the letter to investors, vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand wrote that the asset manager’s membership in NZAM had “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” according to the FT. This is a huge win for consumers and a decent start for @BlackRock rolling back their destructive influence on our economy. However, they still need to undo a lot of horrible incentives they put in place for corporate executives via ESG. Not just NetZero targets, but demanding… https://t.co/aUlQ28OIcs — Will Hild (@WillHild) January 9, 2025 The firm began its ESG initiative in 2020, with CEO Larry Fink stating that “climate risk is investment risk” and that climate change would spark a “fundamental reallocation of capital.” However, the world’s largest asset manager exit has been backpedaling on its ESG efforts as of late, only supporting about 4% of the 493 environmental and social investment proposals shareholders put forward between the end of June 2023 and the end of June 2024, down from a rate of 47% in 2021. BlackRock has also walked back some of its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, editing their DEI language to be less racially oriented. Fellow investment firm Vanguard left NZAM in 2022, while financial services firm State Street remains in the environmental coalition. “The news of BlackRock’s departure from NZAM should be music to the ears of every American consumer,” Will Hild, executive director of conservative nonprofit Consumers’ Research, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “NZAM is an illegitimate cartel of asset managers pushing harmful and costly net zero policies across the entire economy. The activities of NZAM and its members raise prices on Americans everywhere from the gas pump to the grocery store.” When reached for comment, BlackRock referred the DCNF to a report confirming their departure from NZAM.

Title: Meta axes diversity programmes joining US corporate rollback
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmy7xpw3pyo
Time Published: 2025-01-10T21:32:57Z
Full Content:
Meta and Amazon are axing their diversity programmes, joining firms across corporate America that are rolling back hiring and training initiatives criticised by conservatives, citing legal and political risks. The move comes just days after Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans. In a memo to staff about its decision, which affects, hiring, supplier and training efforts, Meta cited a "shifting legal and policy landscape". Walmart and McDonalds are among the other companies to have made similar decisions regarding diversity efforts since Trump won re-election. In its memo to staff, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by the BBC, Meta cited a Supreme Court ruling concerning race in college admissions, while also noting that the term "DEI" (diversity, equity and inclusion) had become "charged". The tech giant said it would continue to look for diverse staff, but end its current approach, which seeks to make selections from a pool of diverse candidates. In a December memo to employees, Amazon said it was "winding down outdated programs and materials" related to representation and inclusion, aiming to complete the process by the end of 2024. "Rather than have individual groups build programs, we are focusing on programs with proven outcomes — and we also aim to foster a more truly inclusive culture," Candi Castleberry, Amazon's VP of inclusive experiences and technology, wrote in the note which was first reported by Bloomberg on Friday. Financial firms JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, also pulled out of groups focused on risks from climate change this week. The moves are a sign of the acceleration of a retreat that started two years ago, as Republicans ramped up attacks on firms such as BlackRock and Disney, accusing them of "woke" progressive activism and threatening political punishment. Big brands such as Bud Light and Target also faced backlash and boycotts related to their efforts to appeal to LGBTQ customers. Many of the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives were put in place after the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in 2020 following George Floyd's murder at the hands of police. Recent court decisions have bolstered critics of the programmes, who said that they were discriminatory. The Supreme Court in 2023 struck down the right for private universities to consider race in admissions decisions. Another court of appeals ruling invalidated a Nasdaq policy that would have required companies listed on that stock exchange to have at least one woman, racial minority or LGBTQ person on their board or explain why not. Meta said it was also ending its efforts to work with suppliers who are "diverse" but will instead focus on small and medium-sized companies. It also plans to stop offering "equity and inclusion" training and instead offer programmes that "mitigate bias for all, no matter your background". Meta declined to comment on the memo, news of which was immediately met with both criticism and celebration. "I'm sitting back and enjoying every second of this," said conservative activist Robby Starbuck, who has taken credit for successfully campaigning against the policies at companies such as Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson. LGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign said workplace inclusion policies help to attract and retain top staff and had been "directly tied to long-term business growth". "Those who abandon these commitments are shirking their responsibility to their employees, consumers, and shareholders" RaShawn "Shawnie" Hawkins, the senior director of the HRC Foundation's Workplace Equality Program said. Meta's move comes just days after the tech giant said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by Trump and Republicans and elevated conservatives to key leadership positions. In a nearly three-hour interview with podcaster Joe Rogan Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said he had always been concerned about being the arbiter of "truth" and was "ill-prepared" when the issue first heated up after the 2016 election. He said the demands to take down information became unreasonable under the Biden administration. For example, he said the company faced pressure during the pandemic to remove content like statements about vaccine side effects. That helped to generate a wider political backlash, he said, including his own. "I feel like I have much greater command now of what I think the policies should be," he said, adding that he felt the US government "should be defending its companies ... not be the tip of the spear attacking". "When the US does that to its tech industry, it's basically just open season around the rest of the world," he added. His exit comes amid a dispute over his report into Donald Trump's handling of classified documents. In an exclusive interview, Ian Russell tells the BBC that he believes there is "no real movement" within government on online safety. The US companies join other major firms donating funds for the ceremony on 20 January. Donald Trump will still take office as the first US president with a felony conviction.

Title: Jim Cramer on Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH): ‘I Think It’s Amazing That Enphase Was Only Down 48% For The Year’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 S&P 500 Stocks on Jim Cramer's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) stands against the other S&P 500 stocks. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently discussed the current state of the market and also discussed both the leading and lagging stocks within the S&P 500. He posed an intriguing question: What if Trump's tariffs are more negotiable than expected? Instead of a hard-line approach, Cramer suggested they could end up being more like a "steak knife" than a "meat axe," meaning less harmful to trade and international relations. READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently and 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar While a more reasonable tariff policy might not be ideal for global trade, it would be a positive development for stocks, particularly if it results in lower prices for American consumers or if multinational companies move their manufacturing to more favorable countries. Cramer emphasized that, for stockholders looking for growth, hopes should be placed on negotiable tariffs. “If you own stocks and you want them higher, you have to hope for negotiable tariffs that could cause countries to lower prices to us or make multinational companies move their manufacturing base here to a more friendly country.” Cramer also discussed the S&P 500's performance this year, noting that, while it is clear which stocks have thrived in the Nasdaq, the winners and losers in the broader S&P 500 have been more difficult to pinpoint. Additionally, Cramer mentioned that several of the stocks in his Charitable Trust, which are reliant on a rebound in China, are ones he’s not excited about at the moment, especially considering the disappointing Chinese economic data. He mentioned that his dismay for such stocks will only last until “they annualize the crummy Chinese numbers and then they'll probably bounce back.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 2. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A solar panel array stretched across a large open field, its glimmering panels reflecting the sun. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38 Dissecting Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), Cramer remarked: “Finally, there's Enphase, which is a solar equipment company that has the misfortune of making some of its equipment in China. Given that Trump won over solar advocate Vice President Harris, we can expect that much higher tariffs are looming on Chinese goods. I think it's amazing that Enphase was only down 48% for the year. But hey, there's always 2025.” Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) is a company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells energy solutions, particularly for the solar photovoltaic sector. It has been expanding its presence globally, particularly in Latin America. Recently, the company launched the IQ8P Microinverters in Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica, aimed at supporting high-powered solar modules for both residential and commercial applications. At the same time, Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH) is operating in an environment shaped by broader geopolitical events. According to The Washington Post, President Trump's economic advisers are working on a plan that would include universal tariffs of up to 20%, focusing on industries considered essential to national security, such as defense, energy, and critical medical supplies. This approach aims to prevent countries like China from circumventing tariffs by rerouting goods through third-party nations. However, Trump has denied this report. He continues to advocate for sweeping tariffs of 60% to 100% on imports from China and a 25% tariff on all products coming from Mexico and Canada. This stance has been a part of his campaign promises and remains a topic of discussion in his economic policies. Overall ENPH ranks 10th on our list of the S&P 500 stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of ENPH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ENPH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today’s briefing by Stéphane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General. **Climate Good afternoon, it is happy Friday indeed. Let me start off with climate. As you all know, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) today confirmed that the year that just passed -2024- was the warmest year on record, and that it is at about 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels. This is based on six various international datasets. It also said that the past 10 years, from 2015 to 2024, were the ten warmest years on record. The Secretary-General said that today’s assessment makes it clear that global heating is a cold, hard fact, adding that governments must deliver new national climate action plans this year to limit long-term global temperature rise to 1.5°C and support the most vulnerable, as well as deal with the devastating climate impacts. That statement was shared with you earlier today. **Deputy Secretary-General Our Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, is in Nigeria, in Abuja, in fact, the capital city of that country. She met today with the President of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as well as with the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development [Nentawe Goshwe Yilwatda]. They discussed Nigeria’s role in regional cooperation, peacebuilding and advancing inclusive development. She also met with Omar Touray, the President of the Commission of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to discuss recent developments, regional peace and security dynamics, as well as sustainable development in the Sahel. Yesterday, she also met with the UN country team and discussed how to strengthen the United Nations’ work in Nigeria for greater impact and delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Ms. Mohammed also had discussions with the Minister for Finance and Coordinating Minister of the Economy, [Wale Edun]. They discussed the country’s ongoing economic reforms. Leonardo Santos Simão, the Head of our Office for West Africa and the Sahel (UNOWAS), is also in Nigeria and accompanied Ms. Mohammed for parts of her programme. She will return to New York on Sunday. **Sudan Turning to a devastating humanitarian crisis that we are desperate to keep in the headlines, and that is Sudan. Today, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is sounding the alarm, saying that an estimated 3.2 million children under the age of five are projected to suffer from acute malnutrition this year. Of these children, over 700,000 will likely suffer from severe acute malnutrition. Sudan, as you know, has the world’s largest child displacement crisis, with 5 million children displaced because of the hostilities. Most of these children leave with their families with only the clothes on their bodies. Mothers often walk for days, sometimes up to 20 days, to reach a camp, looking for safety, looking for food and just looking for basic shelter. And as the conflict rages on, families and communities trapped in the middle of it and in hard-to-reach areas are continuing to bear the brunt of the violence and the suffering. The lack of access to sufficient food and basic services in these hard-to-reach areas inside Sudan is likely to swell and the risk of destitution and death increases. UNICEF, in collaboration with humanitarian partners, will continue to do its utmost to deliver safe and clean water and integrated health and nutrition services, including immunization, treatment of childhood illnesses, as well as do whatever they can management of acute malnutrition in children. And as you know, famine conditions are currently present in Zamzam, Al Salam, and Abu Shouk camps for internally displaced people, as well as the western Nuba Mountains of Sudan. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) committee has projected that famine could spread to five additional regions of Sudan, including El Fasher, by the middle of this year, with 17 other areas at risk unless urgent intervention is managed. Immediate and unimpeded humanitarian access is essential in order for us and our partners to deliver humanitarian assistance. And we continue to urge Governments to prioritise funding, ensure safe relief routes, and press all parties involved to just stop fighting. **Syria Moving to Syria: Our Special Envoy, Geir Pedersen, will travel to Riyadh in the Kingdom Saudi Arabia this weekend to engage with senior officials there. He continues to emphasize the importance of an inclusive, Syrian-led and Syrian-owned process, supported by the international community. Meanwhile, his Deputy, Najat Rochdi, remains in Damascus, where she is actively engaging with a broad range of interlocutors as part of our ongoing outreach efforts. On the humanitarian front, our humanitarian coordination colleagues tell us that a convoy of 23 trucks carrying about 200 metric tons of medical, health, hygiene and education supplies, provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, crossed from Türkiye through the Bab Al-Hawa crossing into Idlib. This is the first UN cross-border aid delivery of the year crossing from Türkiye. The supplies will support at least half a million human beings, enable 8,000 emergency surgical procedures, and provide enough medication to treat infections and support mental health for about 10,000 people for the next three months. We also continue to conduct regular cross-border missions from Türkiye to Syria, through other points, with 13 missions having taken place over the past five days, including roads and civilian infrastructure assessments. Our staff has also met with people to assess humanitarian efforts and needs in different locations in the country. We and our partners continue to support the response across the country as security and logistical conditions permit. However, the needs are massive and now, as the winter season is upon us, the humanitarian situation is even more dire especially for the millions of people who remain displaced in the country. More than 620,000 people were forced to flee their homes in November and December 2024, on top of the over 7 million people who had previously been displaced. We call on donors to support the humanitarian response, especially during this transition period. **Lebanon Turning to Lebanon, the Humanitarian and Resident Coordinator for Lebanon, Imran Riza, today announced a $30 million allocation from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund to support the response in the country. The funds will enable our partners, including local NGOs [non-governmental organizations] and community-based organizations, to deliver assistance in the areas of food security, shelter, nutrition, protection, healthcare, water and sanitation, as well as education. Mr. Riza said that the new allocation will provide a vital lifeline, enabling support to both those returning to damaged infrastructure and those who remain displaced. **Occupied Palestinian Territory Turning to the situation in Gaza, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) tells us that Israeli authorities continue to deny UN-led efforts to reach [North] Gaza governorate with vital aid. This includes our most recent attempt today. Across the Gaza Strip yesterday, only 10 out of the 21 UN planned humanitarian movements were facilitated by the Israeli authorities. Seven were denied outright, three were impeded, and one was cancelled due to security and logistical challenges. Meanwhile, OCHA is deeply concerned about the impact that dwindling fuel supplies are having on essential services in Gaza. Palestinian telecommunication providers are now warning that their services may start to shut down tomorrow due to fuel shortages, which they need to run the generators for their equipment. The World Health Organization said today that Al Awda Hospital — which is, as you know, the last partially functioning hospital in North Gaza Governorate — is critically low on fuel and essential medical supplies. WHO has been working to access Al Awda to resupply it and to assess the situation at Kamal Adwan Hospital, which is completely out of service. However, damaged roads — as well as insufficient facilitation of access by the Israeli authorities — has made it impossible to safely reach those facilities. Our WHO colleagues urgently call for immediate action to make roads passable and to facilitate access to Al Awda [Hospital] to keep it up and running. And turning to the West Bank, new reporting from OCHA indicates a pretty violent picture. In the first week of this year, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians, including a child, and injured 38 others across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Meanwhile, armed Palestinians shot and killed three Israeli settlers and injured eight others near Qalqiliya. OCHA also tells us that during the first week of the year, Israeli settlers injured 18 Palestinians across the West Bank, including nine in Silwad village in Ramallah Governorate. Meanwhile, more than 50 Palestinians in the West Bank were displaced by home demolitions, the majority in Silwan in East Jerusalem. We also have an update on the impact of the operation by Palestinian security forces in the Jenin refugee camp, where those forces have clashed with armed Palestinians for more than a month. OCHA says that since the operation began, access to the camp has been heavily restricted. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) estimates that some 3,400 people remain in the Jenin camp, in dire conditions — and more than 2,000 families have been forced to relocate to Jenin city. OCHA mobilized partners to respond to the needs of the affected families both inside and outside the camp. **Myanmar Turning to Myanmar, the Humanitarian Coordinator ad interim, Marcoluigi Corsi, said today that the humanitarian community is deeply alarmed by recent reports of civilian casualties in Rakhine State. On Wednesday, an aerial attack in Kyauk Nima village reportedly killed over 40 civilians, including children and women, and injured more than 20 people. Five hundred homes were allegedly destroyed. We reiterate our call on all parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians, including humanitarian workers, as well as hospitals, schools and humanitarian assets. We also stress the need to facilitate unimpeded humanitarian access to the most vulnerable people. **Venezuela An update for you on Venezuela. I can tell you that the Secretary-General continues to follow the situation in Venezuela with great concern. A peaceful way out of the political crisis requires full respect for human rights, including the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without any interference, and to peaceful assembly. The Secretary-General strongly condemns the detention of a large number of persons, including opposition figures, journalists and human rights defenders, since the 28 July presidential election. He urges the authorities to guarantee and respect their human rights and to release all the people who have been arbitrarily detained. **Honour Roll We have another welcome member of the Honour Roll. I just want to make sure you have been listening to the quiz last year. This European country is small in geographical size but, of course, big in every other way. It is one of only two double landlocked nations in the world. Yes. Liechtenstein. Very good, Amélie. We thank very much our friends in Vaduz for taking Liechtenstein to become the sixth Member State to pay its dues for 2025. There is still time for others to pay and to make it for the Honour Roll. **Questions and Answers Question: Yeah. About, Secretary-General's visit to DC, has the Secretary-General yesterday talked or met with the president-elect, [Donald J.] Trump? Spokesman: No. There was no opportunity to… Question: Even no small talk? Spokesman: Yeah, let me just finish my sentence. There was no opportunity to do it, given the geography of where everybody was sitting. He did shake hands and greet President [Joseph R.] Biden, who walked past where the foreign dignitaries were sitting. Question: On 30 November 2020, Secretary-General had a phone call with then President-elect Biden. Yesterday, you said that your team had actually contact with the president-elect’s team. Why this kind of phone call conversation did not happen yet? Spokesman: No doubt it will happen. As I said, we have been in contact with the incoming team. Question: Okay. Last Trump question. Does the Secretary-General have any opinion that the soon to be US president now is a convicted felon? Spokesman: We have no comment. Okay, señor. Question: Hi. Thank you, Steph, I have a follow-up on the situation in Venezuela, but this is not primarily on the humanitarian issues, but the political side of this situation. So, the SG on different occasions called for the Venezuelan people to commit to a political process that would lead to elections and to try to solve all of their issues through this kind of political process. They did. And then that takes us to the present, where there is a side that is sustaining power. There's another side that is being recognized by the international community as legitimately elected. So, I wonder if there is any message to the Venezuelan people on a day like today, especially when there's, like, a new government or a new face of government in the country, since there is such an erosion in the trust of the political process and what is the road ahead for them. Spokesman: No. I mean, I think, as I said, the Secretary-General is following the situation closely. I think he understands the frustration of a large part of the Venezuelan public. As he said, the way forward for a peaceful Venezuela requires full respect for human rights, for human dignity. And I think that's why he's so concerned about the arrests that we have seen since July, but also especially in the last few days. Question: Just an additional quick one. Has any of the sides reached out to the SG at any level? Have you received any letters? Spokesman: I'm not aware. I'll double check, but I'm not aware of any recent communication in the last few days. Okay. Sir? Question: Thank you, Stéphane. President-elect Donald Trump has stated that a meeting is being set up with the Russian [Federation] President, Vladimir Putin. So, is the UN aware of any details on this meeting? Spokesman: No. I mean, we've seen the press reports, both, I think, coming from the US and from the Russian [Federation] side. Obviously, once in office, any dialogue between the United States and Russia is to be welcomed. Question: Is the UN ready to be a part of the negotiation process? Spokesman: Well, I mean, negotiations on what? Correspondent: Yeah. Because, they are expected to have negotiations on Ukraine and, in the past UN was a part of that. Spokesman: I mean, on Ukraine, let's be clear. First of all, in terms of the UN's role, Secretary-General's good offices have been available since the beginning, should both parties, Ukraine and the Russian Federation, ask for it. Our view on the conflict in Ukraine remains the same — that we want to see an end to this conflict in line with General Assembly resolutions, international law, and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. I'm going to go online. Michelle? Question: Hey, Steph. Thank you. A couple of questions, if you don't mind. First of all, just a quick follow-up, when you were talking again about the contacts with the Trump transition team. What have they been in contact about or what have you been in contact with them about? Spokesman: I've not nothing else to share with you than what I've just said. Question: Okay. And then the US House of Representatives passed some legislation that is making its way through the US system on sanctioning the ICC [International Criminal Court]. If you got any response to that? Spokesman: Well, first of all, as you know, we don't like to comment on potential laws or on bills that are making their way through a legislative process. That being said, we do have a principled position on the International Criminal Court. And that is, while it is independent from the Secretariat, the Secretary-General has great respect for the Court and for the work of the International Criminal Court, which is in itself a very important pillar of international justice. Question: And would the UN expect the US to abide by the Headquarters Agreement, should any sanctions be…? Spokesman: You know, we expect every Member State to abide by treaties and agreements they have signed. Question: And then one last quick one. BlackRock left the… sorry. What's it called again? The Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative yesterday or announced that they're leaving it. Would the SG like to comment on that? Spokesman: Yeah, I mean, we've seen that. Obviously, the Net-Zero Alliance is an alliance, which means it is voluntary and companies are free to do and make the decisions they make. But, however, the decision taken by BlackRock to leave the alliance is disappointing, especially given the critical role that the private sector and especially asset managers have in combating climate change and mitigating the risks and the impact of climate change. You know, we encourage those companies that remain in the Net-Zero Alliance to continue with their work, or if they're in other groupings or just individually, using the assets that they manage, using their investments smartly in a way that helps with the transition, the energy transition, which helps to mitigate climate change, which helps to fight climate change. We encourage those companies to continue to do so. Climate change… we say climate change is an existential threat, and it's not just words. I mean, we're seeing the impact of it, and the devastation of it, around the world. Countries rich and poor are being impacted. No one is safe, and it is incumbent obviously on governments, as the Secretary-General said in his statements today, but also on the private sector and the money and the investments that they manage. Any other questions online? And then we'll go back to the room. Correspondent: Yes. I put my name. Spokesman: Okay. Go ahead, Abdelhamid. Question: Thank you. Yeah. There was a trilateral attack on Yemen by UK, US and Israel, and they destroyed lots of infrastructure. Now Hudaydah Port is not functioning. Ras Isa Port is not functioning. Civilian infrastructure has been attacked. Do you condemn that? And why the US and UK had to join that war? It's between Yemen and Israel. Why two countries had joined the war? Spokesman: Well, listen. You know, you have to ask those very countries. I can't speak for any country. I can barely speak for the UN. So, you'll have to ask those countries. There is in fact, as is clear for everyone to see, great tensions and violence between the exchange of fire, not so much between Yemen and Israel, but between Israel and the Houthis. And we're obviously very concerned by the renewed air strikes that we've seen in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen by those countries that you mentioned. And these air strikes were done, as we note, in response to the continued Houthi launching of indiscriminate missiles towards Israel and to attacks on the Red Sea and shipping on the Red Sea, which is critical to the global economy. We emphasize that international law, including international humanitarian law, as applicable, must be respected at all times. And we recall the Secretary-General, as he said many times, for the need to protect civilians and to protect civilian infrastructure. It is critically important for all to show utmost restraint and to cease all military activities. Further escalation could exacerbate regional tensions and pose great risk to the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen, which we often talk about. We're obviously very focused on the issue of Yemen. As you know, Mr. [Hans] Grundberg just left the country a few days ago. Your next question? Question: Two civilians in South Lebanon were killed this morning by an Israeli air raid. Are you aware of that, and what do you say to that? Spokesman: Yes. We have seen the reports of a fatal drone strike in southern Lebanon. We checked with our peacekeeping colleagues, who were not able to verify the report at this time. But obviously, we urge everyone to avoid any action that could undermine the cessation of hostilities which is in place and to use the mechanism that exists to address any concern that they have and to resolve any issues between the parties. And I think we've also seen there were statements made by Prime Minister [Najib] Mikati today about Lebanon's efforts to remove unauthorized weapons from Southern Lebanon, which is to be welcome, given that this is a centrepiece of Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). And we, of course, our peacekeeping colleagues are ready to work with the Lebanese Armed Forces, the Lebanese Security Forces to implement that resolution. Question: My last question, if you don't mind. Do you have any comment on the US Congress imposing sanctions on ICC? Spokesman: I just answered that question, by Michelle. She asked the same question about two seconds ago, and I answered it. Dezhi? Correspondent: Sorry. Just two regular question. First one… Spokesman: As opposed to? Question: As opposed to, like, I brought these up, like, from time to time. The first one is about the ceasefire deal in Gaza. Does the UN have any update on this? Spokesman: No. Nothing that you have not seen or read. Question: The second regular question would be the Yemen. I mean, the oil tanker, the plan of the oil tanker? Spokesman: Nothing new to report, but we'll see if there's anything else. Question: So it's still… It's still there. Spokesman: Yeah, I mean it’s still safe. Yeah. Okay. Thank you all. Have a wonderful weekend. If we speak, that is not a good sign. If we don't speak, it will be a good weekend.

Mobileye (MBLY), which is retreating 5% today, has tumbled 30% since its appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on Tuesday. Mobileye creates and markets advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and offerings related to autonomous driving. A fleet of autonomous vehicles driving down a sun-drenched highway. Disappointment With Mobileye's CES Appearance After Mobileye at last year's CES announced multiple design wins, the company failed to announce any new deals at this year's conference. The lack of such news appears to have sparked the large decline in MBLY stock this week. However, Mobileye this week did disclose progress in the area of innovations related to autonomous-driving technology. What's more, after attending the company's Capital Markets Day in December, RBC Capital was more bullish on the firm's ability to sell automakers its Level 2+ and Level 3 autonomous driving offerings. Moreover, the bank was upbeat about the company's demonstration of its products. However, RBC kept a Sector Perform rating on the shares, although it did raise its price target on the name to $14 from $11. The shares are currently trading around $16. In the third quarter, Mobileye's revenue fell 8% versus the same period a year earlier to $486 million. But that was 11% above Q2's top line. The Recent Price Action of MBLY Stock In the last month, MBLY stock has dropped 9%, but it is still up 31% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of MBLY, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MBLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: American Airlines' focus on ESG in 401(k) plan is illegal, US judge rules

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Daniel Wiessner (Reuters) -A federal judge in Texas on Friday said American Airlines violated federal law by basing investment decisions for its employee retirement plan on environmental, social and other non-financial factors. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor appeared to be the first of its kind amid growing backlash by conservatives to an uptick in socially-conscious investing. O'Connor said American had breached its legal duty to make investment decisions based solely on the financial interests of 401(k) plan beneficiaries by allowing BlackRock, its asset manager and a major shareholder, to focus on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors. "The evidence made clear that [American’s] incestuous relationship with BlackRock and its own corporate goals disloyally influenced administration of the Plan," wrote O'Connor, an appointee of Republican former President George W. Bush. A BlackRock spokesperson said: "We always act independently and with a singular focus on what is in the best financial interests of our clients. Our only agenda is maximizing returns for our clients, consistent with their choices." The judge ruled after holding a four-day non-jury trial in June, in a class action by American pilot Bryan Spence on behalf of more than 100,000 participants in the retirement plan. O'Connor said he would decide later on whether class members suffered financial harms and American must pay them damages. American said in a statement that it was reviewing the decision. Lawyers for Spence did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BlackRock, which on Thursday said it was leaving an environmentally focused investor group under pressure from Republican politicians, is not involved in the lawsuit. In November, BlackRock and two rival asset managers were sued by 11 Republican-led states who claim the firms violated federal antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and caused energy costs to increase. BlackRock called the claims baseless. Spence sued American in 2023, saying it had violated the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by failing to remain loyal to 401(k) plan participants and to prudently oversee their assets. O'Connor last February rejected American's claims that the lawsuit should be dismissed because Spence could not show that the 401(k) plan had underperformed, paving the way for a trial. On Friday, the judge said that American had breached its duty of loyalty to retirement plan participants. But the company's decisions did not violate its duty of prudence, O'Connor said, because it was acting according to prevailing industry standards. O'Connor is known for frequently ruling in favor of conservative litigants challenging laws and regulations governing guns, LGBTQ rights and healthcare. The Biden administration in 2023 adopted a rule allowing 401(k) and other plans to consider ESG factors as a "tiebreaker" between financially equal investment options. The rule replaced a regulation adopted during Republican President-elect Donald Trump's first administration barring the consideration of any non-financial factors, which could be resurrected after Trump takes office for the second time later this month. A Texas federal judge is currently considering a legal challenge to the Biden administration rule by 25 Republican-led states and oil drilling company Liberty Energy.

California-based property and casualty insurer Mercury General (MCY) is tumbling 20% today after the insurer warned that its losses from California's wildfires would "exceed its reinsurance retention level of $150 million." However, the company's reinsurer is obligated to pay for $1.29 billion of losses for each natural disaster "after covered catastrophe losses exceed the Company's retention of $150 million," Mercury explained. If Mercury's reinsurer pays out the entire $1.29 billion, Mercury would have a "total reinstatement premium" of $101 million. 15 Best States for Homeowners Insurance in the US Mercury's Financial Data Mercury's market capitalization is $2.66 billion. The company generated $4.63 billion of revenue last year, while its operating income came in at $123.6 million. On the balance sheet, it had total investments of $6 billion as of the end of the third quarter, along with long-term debt of $574 million. Its total liabilities came in at $6.3 billion. Additional Background Information The insurer noted that, with the wildfires continuing to burn, " it will be some time before (it) has an estimate of the total losses caused by this event." AccuWeather now anticipates that the total damage from the disaster will come in at $135 billion to $150 billion. Other property and casualty insurers are also dropping, with Progressive (PGR) giving back 1.5%, Allstate (ALL) retreating 7.5%, and Travelers (TRV) sinking 4.5%. While we acknowledge the potential of MCY, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: UK gilt selloff triggers pension cash calls in first big test since 2022 crisis

By Carolyn Cohn and Iain Withers LONDON (Reuters) - Some British pension funds are being told by asset managers to come up with more cash to support their hedging positions after a recent jump in borrowing costs, but pensions advisers told Reuters this week the market was behaving in an orderly way. XPS and Gallagher said some funds had been instructed to post more cash to maintain derivatives positions they hold through so-called Liability Driven Investment (LDI) strategies. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), a major LDI provider, said in a note to clients on Friday that although higher borrowing costs will have reduced pension schemes' collateral resilience, funds were better prepared than previously to withstand volatility. The market moves are the first big test of the pensions market since an industry overhaul of LDI usage to reduce risk and meet regulatory demands for more collateral and lower leverage. The derivatives will require more collateral against them to make up for the movement in price. LDI, which helps funds meet future payouts by hedging against moves in bond yields, was at the centre of a crisis in September 2022, when plans by the government of then-prime minister Liz Truss for unfunded tax cuts sent yields surging. Pension advisory firms XPS and Gallagher, along with six other industry players, said the market had responded to this week's sharp selloff in debt markets in an orderly manner. The Bank of England and The Pensions Regulator declined to comment on Friday. The yield on 30-year British government bonds, known as gilts, hit a fresh 26-year high on Friday as higher inflation expectations and worries about Donald Trump's imminent arrival in the White House prompted investors to sell. Ten-year gilt yields are up by 25 basis points, their biggest weekly jump in a year but far less than the nearly 70 bps weekly jump seen in 2022. BlackRock, a big player in LDI services alongside Legal & General (LON:LGEN) and Insight Investment, said in its note explaining the selloff that pension schemes were starting from a different place to previous years. It was nevertheless "vital" they continued monitoring their collateral, the firm added. The spikes in yields following the Truss government's "mini-Budget" in 2022 triggered collateral calls on funds' hedging positions, forcing operators to fire-sell assets to raise cash. "If yields did spike materially, then you could see things being stress-tested again. But we're certain the industry is in a much better place," said Carl Hitchman, chief investment officer at Gallagher Benefit Services UK. One client had received a cash call with a deadline of next week, but the fund had liquidity to meet this, he said. XPS said it has seen some capital calls, but CIO Simeon Willis said this was the market operating normally. The gradual rise in British borrowing costs this time had made it manageable, advisers said, with Insight Investment, Legal & General and Schroders (LON:SDR) all saying the LDI market was proving resilient and orderly. "Pension funds are well prepared and managing the volatility effectively," a spokesperson for BT pension fund manager Brightwell said.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Historic wildfires have destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in Los Angeles County. Many homes of the rich and famous in Pacific Palisades, Malibu, and Pasadena have been reduced to rubble and ash. Entire neighborhoods were completely destroyed, and the fires have been blamed for at least five deaths. The speed at which the fires spread caught firefighters and residents off guard. Fed by hurricane-strength Santa Ana winds, embers were flying through the air seemingly everywhere and with no let-up. Climate alarmists have pinned the blame on human-caused climate change, but that is not truth. On Episode #140 of The Climate Realism Show, The Heartland Institute’s H. Sterling Burnett, Anthony Watts, Linnea Lueken, and Jim Lakely welcome U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA) and CFACT’s Chris Martz to cover the LA fires and some of the “Crazy Climate News of the Week.” There’s been some fascinating news since our two-week hiatus, some of it good. Blackrock and JP Morgan are the latest financial giants to drop out of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, Michael Mann experienced his first-ever setback in his lawfare against climate realists, and Biden tries to tie Trump’s hands on drilling while also trying to ban some tankless water heaters on his way out of the White House. Join us LIVE at 1 p.m. ET so you can leave your questions and comments for the show in the chat. This show will be archived in WUWT Climate TV, a collection of over six hundred videos, featuring new interviews and analysis, and covering dozens of media sources discussing, debating and analyzing the latest in climate science, climate politics, and energy policy, including topics concerning temperature, sea level, polar bears, ocean acidification, extreme weather, censorship, wild fires, and more.

Climate may contribute by making the conditions suitable, ideal, perfect for the dreadful tragedy of the fires we see. However, attributing blame to the demon Carbon Dioxide, produced by us humans, is a dishonest distraction.

Title: JASON ISAAC: Wall Street Wants You To Believe It’s Backing Away From ESG. Reality Paints A Different Picture

Financial institutions across the world are engaging in the height of hypocrisy, publicly renouncing controversial groups while continuing to uphold its principles and objectives. BlackRock is the latest, and largest, to join a growing list of financial institutions like JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley that are withdrawing from the United Nations’ Net-Zero alliances. But while these institutions may appear to distance themselves from a controversial agenda, they remain steadfast in their commitment to the climate agenda — prioritizing political activism over fiduciary responsibility and economic growth. (RELATED: O.H. SKINNER: Will Joe Biden Slip Through One Last Dark Money Giveaway In His Closing Days?) A recent study shows coordinated efforts to defund politically disfavored industries, such as fossil fuels, may not only harm consumers, but also violate antitrust laws, according to the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Boyden Gray & Associates. Banks that publicly pledged to curtail funding for Arctic oil drilling or coal mining may have done so to pressure competitors to follow suit. Such actions, if left unchecked, could jeopardize the energy security of the United States while artificially inflating energy costs for businesses and families alike. The decision for BlackRock to leave the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI) and the banks to leave the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) might suggest these financial institutions are responding to growing scrutiny and political pressure over Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives. Legal challenges, such as the lawsuit filed by Texas and 10 other states against major asset managers, allege that ESG policies violate antitrust laws by colluding to constrain fossil fuel production and inflate energy prices. Public backlash against these policies has only intensified, particularly in regions where energy is becoming expensive and scarce. But actions speak louder than words — or, in this case, affiliations. Despite exiting the NZAMI and NZBA, these financial giants continue to pledge allegiance to net-zero goals, demanding divestment from essential energy sectors like coal and oil in an attempt to starve politically disfavored industries of capital. The result? Reduced energy security, higher costs for consumers, and a financial system that prioritizes activism over fiduciary duty and financial stability. Meanwhile, these policies give a competitive advantage to nations like China, which continues to expand coal production for cheap electricity and dominate critical mineral supply chains, further weakening the United States’ energy independence and global economic position. This contradiction exposes a deeper truth: the ESG movement is not about balance or responsibility. It is about control. By mandating adherence to subjective social and environmental metrics, ESG policies bypass the free market and erode the competitive principles that drive innovation and prosperity. The hypocrisy of these institutions is stark. On one hand, they tout their departure from these controversial UN alliances, likely hoping to avoid further legal and political backlash. On the other hand, they continue to uphold the same principles that have driven lawsuits and public criticism in the first place. This serves no one — not the ordinary Americans struggling to make ends meet, not the investors seeking strong returns, and certainly not the global economy, which depends on energy abundance and stability. If these institutions are serious about restoring trust and accountability, they must go beyond symbolic gestures. It is not enough to leave the NZAMI and NZBA while still practicing what they preach. Real change requires embracing policies that support energy innovation and accessibility for all. It means prioritizing economic growth and energy security over appeasing activist groups. Policymakers, too, have a role to play. They must hold financial institutions accountable — for the spirit of competition and fairness that underpins our markets. States like Texas have already taken meaningful steps to protect consumers’ rights, prohibiting taxpayer-funded contracts with companies that collude against the energy sector. Others should follow suit to ensure that banks and asset managers serve their customers, not narrow ideological agendas. The recent exodus from the UN’s Net-Zero alliances is not a victory; it is a half-measure. Until financial institutions fully abandon their net-zero commitments and embrace their responsibility to shareholders, clients and the broader economy, they remain complicit in an agenda that undermines energy security and economic freedom. Actions, not affiliations, define character. It is time for these money managers to prove they’re serious about serving the interests of the many — not the demands of the few alarmists — and abandon these radical political agendas.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘Maybe NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Actually Goes To A New All-time High’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 7 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the market’s movements this week, focusing on the economic data that’s shaping the outlook. He highlighted the upcoming nonfarm payroll report on Friday, noting its potential to sway market sentiment. Cramer pointed out that the market has been shaken by the persistently high 10-year treasury bond yields, which refuse to drop. “Friday’s employment numbers need to show lower wage growth and disappointing hiring. Now that could bring down the yield in the 10-year and therefore make people feel that the Fed will be back on schedule to start cutting the rates again. We gotta get them back into that groove, you know. On the other hand, if hiring and wages remain hot, well then anything good that happens next week could be repealed.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks The labor report is especially critical, according to Cramer, because despite the strength in sectors like autos, housing, and materials, the overall economy may still be running too hot for the Fed to slow it down as needed. He turned his attention to other economic indicators, such as the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which is offering strong signals of economic activity. Cramer mentioned a recent report, including Monday’s release of the PMI composite index, as an important barometer for the economy. This data, he explained, provides valuable insights into how the economy is performing across different sectors, with particular attention to manufacturing, which has shown particularly strong performance. In addition to these key reports, Cramer also mentioned the implications of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), specifically focusing on job openings. “I've been mulling over these job openings numbers and I keep thinking about how President-elect Trump might reverse the high levels of immigration we've seen under the Biden administration.” Cramer warned that mass deportations could create a labor shortage that would drive wages even higher, especially if the country cannot rely on enough workers to fill the gaps. In that case, Cramer mused, "robots may be our only hope," alluding to the role of automation in addressing potential labor shortages. “So here's the bottom line: It’s a light week, but still impactful, accept that people will be on edge ahead of Friday’s employment report. Still, I think you should do some buying if the market gets hammered. As we saw today, it’s not nearly as bad out there as so many think.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 3. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 During the episode, Cramer mentioned NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Jensen’s speech on Monday and said: “Tech was strong all day today, you know, it's the leader again in part thanks to the buzz around Nvidia, CEO Jensen Huang’s speech at CES on Monday night, Vegas. Right now, as I've stressed… I think we could be dazzled by the use cases for Nvidia's latest chips, especially the video component. Any company that buys the platform of GPUs and software can make a fortune from it. That's important because we keep hearing that Amazon wants to compete head-to-head with Nvidia. Something, by the way, I don't even believe. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a well-known name in the graphics, computing, and networking industries and its graphics processing units and the CUDA software platform have become crucial for AI infrastructure. At the CES 2025 event, the company revealed several new products. CEO Jensen Huang presented innovations targeting AI applications, including those designed to advance robot and vehicle training, along with new gaming chips and a debut desktop computer. One of the highlights of the event was the introduction of Cosmos foundation models, a new AI model. These models, which generate photo-realistic video, offer a more cost-effective method of training robots and self-driving vehicles compared to traditional data usage. Additionally, Huang unveiled the new RTX 50 series gaming chips, which incorporate NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell AI technology, a key driver behind the company's growth in data centers. Huang also provided a financial outlook for NVIDIA's automotive hardware and software division, forecasting revenue of $5 billion for fiscal 2026, up from an expected $4 billion in fiscal 2025. Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock, Ally, Microsoft, Washington Post and other US firms to lay off staff in 2025; check full list

Workforce reductions in the past two years have been a major concern across sectors, including tech, media, finance, manufacturing, and retail. However, according to a Business Insider report published on January 9, layoffs in major global firms, including Microsoft, BlackRock, and Ally, will continue in 2025. Among the multiple reasons the firms cite, they want to slim their staff as part of the cost-cutting measures against the backdrop of technological change, especially over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). A couple of days ago, the World Economic Forum released its 'Future of Jobs Report', in which it mentioned that as many as 41 per cent of companies want to reduce their workforce due to AI automation. The report added that 170 million new jobs would be created by 2030, and 92 million jobs would be displaced. Earlier, firms like Dropbox, Google, and IBM announced job cuts related to AI. BlackRock: According to Bloomberg, BlackRock told employees that it was planning to cut about 200 people from its 21,000-strong workforce. These reductions are more than offset by the addition of some 3,750 workers in 2024, and another 2,000 are expected to be added in 2025. The cuts would help realign the firm's resources with its strategy, Bloomberg quoted BlackRock's president, Rob Kapito, and its chief operating officer, Rob Goldstein, as saying. Bridgewater: On Monday, Bridgewater Associates cut 7 per cent of its staff, aiming to stay lean, reported Business Insider, quoting a source. With these layoffs, the world's largest hedge fund staff count comes to where it was in 2023. Earlier in 2019, The company's founder, Ray Dalio, said about 30 per cent of new employees were leaving the firm within 18 months. Washington Post: In an effort to cut costs, The Washington Post is eliminating less than 100 employees, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Stating that the changes wouldn't affect the newsroom, the spokesperson said, as quoted by Reuters, "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are." Microsoft: Taking a harder look at underperforming employees, Microsoft is planning job cuts. However, the firm declined to share details on the number of employees to be fired. "At Microsoft, we focus on high-performance talent," the BI quoted a spokesperson as saying. "We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action," the spokesperson noted. Ally: The digital financial services major Ally is laying off roughly 500 of its 11,000 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to BI. "As we continue to right-size our company, we made the difficult decision to selectively reduce our workforce in some areas while continuing to hire in our other areas of business," BI quoted the spokesperson as saying. The Ally made a similar level of cuts in October 2023, reported the Charlotte Observer. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Los Angeles Liz Wolfe | 1.10.2025 9:30 AM L.A. fires nowhere near contained: So far, at least 10 people have been killed by the wildfires in and around Los Angeles. More than 35,000 acres have been consumed, and more than 10,000 structures destroyed. Wind speeds had lessened last night, only to pick up again this morning, with gusts reaching 81 miles per hour in L.A.'s northern mountains. A new fire broke out last night, named the Kenneth fire, in the West Hills. The Palisades fire and Eaton fire are at 6 percent containment and 0 percent containment, respectively, both now ranking among the top five most destructive fires in California's history. ("Containment basically measures the fire's potential for growth, not how much of it has been extinguished," notes The New York Times.) The California National Guard has been called in by Gov. Gavin Newsom, and President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal government will cover the area's emergency response costs for the next six months. (There are only a few days left in Biden's term, so it remains to be seen whether President-elect Donald Trump will maintain this commitment.) The Pentagon has sent in Navy helicopters to help with the firefighting. You are reading Reason Roundup, our daily, morning newsletter. Want articles just like this in your inbox every morning?

Δ So far, at least one man has been arrested for trying to start fires in Woodland Hills, near Calabasas, riding around on a bike using a blowtorch trying to set Christmas trees and garbage cans on fire. He seemed like he was "on something," according to one resident who allegedly helped to detain the suspect. Los Angeles police have not confirmed that the Kenneth fire is attributable to arsonists, but the man has been taken into custody. ("If these fires are arson, how society handles this crime and punishment will have ramifications for decades to come," writes venture capitalist Katherine Boyle on X. "What's scary about 'new' forms of violence is that the societal narrative shapes whether they repeat or not. It's called a 'cycle of violence' for a reason; copycats valorize the original crime. Crimes come in waves and eras. School shootings are relatively new, whereas the age of the serial killer seems to have faded. We do not want an arson age.") Reports of widespread looting are also worrying residents; those whose homes survived fear that their possessions will be gone when they return. Los Angeles police have been making arrests, attempting to maintain a semblance of order amid a disaster situation. "Shame on those who are preying on our residents during this time of crisis," said L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger at a press conference yesterday. Curfews are being implemented in the areas most affected by the fires. The real red pill will come when people try to get permits to rebuild their homes and face multiyear waits. This might finally spell doom for the Coastal Commission, which should not even exist as an organization. https://t.co/LNIooLoTIX — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 10, 2025 Is BlackRock destroying America's housing markets? (No.) "Shadowy private equity giants are buying up the housing supply in communities across New York, leaving everyday homebuyers with fewer and fewer affordable options," said New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) yesterday as she introduced a new law aimed at making it harder for hedge funds to buy up single-family homes in the state. Hochul's proposing legislation doesn't ban the practice outright, but rather forces a 75-day waiting period before such firms could place bids on homes hitting the market. The reason why Hochul is tackling this? Well, because progressives (and other random commentators) frequently—and erroneously—like to claim that BlackRock has gobbled up so much American housing stock that normal people can no longer buy houses. Take even the Associated Press's write-up: "Private equity firms own more than 500,000 homes nationwide, according to the governor's news release, with some estimates expecting the firms to own up to 40% of the single-family rental market by 2030. There were more than 145 million housing units in the country in 2023, according to U.S. Census data." I'm sorry, what? How would you go from currently owning 0.3 percent to owning 40 percent over the course of five years? Are BlackRock and others planning to buy 57.5 million housing units? "Experts" might say that this is the plan, but that's because this area in particular is rife with people not knowing what they're talking about. Later, that same article claims that "non-individual investors" own a quarter of single-family homes, per 2021 data. But this includes landlords who have formed limited liability companies (LLCs), which is…a quite common practice. It's true that, in some places, whole neighborhoods are sometimes sold to investors, such as a 124-home subdivision in Conroe, Texas, for which "the winning $32 million bid came from an online property-investing platform, Fundrise LLC, which manages more than $1 billion on behalf of about 150,000 individuals," per The Wall Street Journal. ("We certainly wouldn't expect every single-family community we sell to sell at a 50% gross margin," said the builder's finance chief, Bill Wheat, after the sale.) Places hit harder by this phenomenon include not New York but rather Houston, Miami, Phoenix, and Las Vegas—places with a low-ish cost of living and a fair amount of starter home housing stock. In some cases, investors buying up housing stock and then renting these homes out could even be a good thing: If you are a young family who does not have enough saved up to buy a home in a starter-home subdivision, this allows you to rent. (Long-term, of course, buying a home is a major means by which people start building wealth, so there are trade-offs here.) Still, this isn't even a widespread practice in New York, so it's unclear why Hochul believes this warrants state intervention. See this for what it really is: An attempt by Hochul to look like she's addressing the issues contributing to housing affordability, when in reality she's doing nothing of the sort. Making it marginally harder for BlackRock to purchase homes is a silly, bad fix. Putting pressure on city governance to end rent control and rent stabilization, slashing regulations that make it hard to build new housing, and loosening or abolishing zoning and land use requirements would all have a greater effect.
