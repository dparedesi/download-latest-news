Title: Wes Edens is selling his sprawling $35M penthouse — located in a famed architect’s only NYC building
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/10/09/real-estate/wes-edens-is-selling-his-sprawling-35m-penthouse/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T18:02:11Z
Full Content:
Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wes Edens has found a buyer for his trophy Manhattan penthouse, which was last asking $35 million. The posh perch overlooks the High Line at the curvaceous 520 W. 28th St., the only residential building in New York designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid — the first female architect to win the Pritzker Prize. And it’s about as far from Edens’ upbringing on a rural ranch in Montana as one could reasonably imagine. If the deal closes near that price, it would be a win for Edens, a co-founder of Fortress Investment Group and founder of New Fortress Energy, a liquefied natural gas company. As the sale is in contract, there’s no word yet on how much he’s selling it for — and who the new owner is. Edens, who got his start at BlackRock and Lehman Brothers, is also co-owner of Aston Villa Football Club and owns the e-sports franchise FlyQuest. In addition, he founded Brightline, a high-speed passenger rail system connecting Miami to Orlando at 125 miles an hour. Brightline also plans to connect Southern California and Las Vegas at speeds of about 200 miles per hour. The deal was first reported in the weekly Olshan Luxury Market Report. Edens bought the penthouse for $20.2 million in 2020 — four years after it hit the market for $50 million, and renovated it in 2022, according to the listing — from Clayton Orrigo and Stephen Ferrara, of Compass, who declined to comment on the pending deal. The 6,618-square-foot aerie comes with five bedrooms and seven baths, and features its own internal three-story sculptural staircase and private elevator — along with 2,500 square feet of outdoor space. The home opens to a great room with 20-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling glass windows and views over the High Line. The room is further anchored by a large gas fireplace, custom lighting and a three-story chandelier. The main floor also comes with a chef’s kitchen, a media room, a library and a private balcony. Upstairs, a main bedroom suite comes with two walk-in closets, a spa-like bath, a sitting area and a private balcony. There are also an additional three bedrooms and a wet bar. Finally, a landscaped rooftop, “rebuilt from the studs” includes a sauna, a custom hot tub and cold plunge, a barbeque and an indoor wet bar. Amenities in the building — which was completed in 2017, a year after Hadid’s death of a heart attack at age 65 — include a 75-foot sky-lit pool, robotic parking and a private IMAX theater.

Title: Analysis:'Every electron counts': Why renewables stocks are back in play

Business MILAN :A return of fund inflows into renewable energy stocks is helping to breath new life into these companies' shares, powering their strongest quarterly rise since the sustainability boom early this decade. After two years of bearish sentiment and relentless redemptions that made the sector a short-sellers' hotspot, a fundamental shift in the U.S. power demand outlook and greater policy certainty are luring investors back. U.S. President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" and the subsequent move to direct the U.S. Treasury to restrict tax credit rules have hit the renewables industry. But money managers say the outcome was not as bad as many feared, and offers enough certainty for investors to engage and companies to resume projects. "Valuations were so disconnected from the fundamentals that even confirmation of negative news became a positive catalyst, said BlackRock portfolio manager Alastair Bishop. "It allowed investors to start focusing on the fundamentals." Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday. This service is not intended for persons residing in the E.U. By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading With the outlook improving, Bishop said outflows from BlackRock's active clean-energy strategies had slowed.Robeco portfolio manager Roman Boner said flows into the company's Smart Energy strategy had recently turned positive after sustained outflows. Lipper data shows alternative energy funds had their first net monthly inflow in June, after 25 straight months of outflows totalling around $24 billion. Investors pulled out money again in July before inflows returned in August and neared $800 million in September, the largest since April 2022. Quarterly data from Morningstar shows outflows from Clean Energy/Tech have shrunk to their lowest since the last recorded inflow in Q2 2023. These green shoots coincide with double-digit gains in clean energy indices, ETFs, and a surge in individual stocks across the sector — from producers to infrastructure plays. Bloom Energy is a prime example, teaming up with Oracle to deploy fuel cells at data centres. Its shares have rallied 300 per cent in four months to become the biggest weight in the iShares Clean Energy ETF, a jump some investors view as over-exuberant.The Federal Reserve's dovish tone has also helped. Capital-intensive renewable projects benefit from lower borrowing costs, though rates remain well above the ultra-low levels seen during ESG's heyday.PRIVATE EQUITY MOVES IN LOOKING FOR VALUEPrivate equity is also moving in, ignoring political noise to focus on long-term value. Global Infrastructure Partners is reportedly in talks to buy AES, potentially one of the largest deals involving a Wall Street power company. The MSCI Global Alternative Energy Index has halved since its January 2021 peak, but rose 17 per cent in the three months to September — its strongest quarter since end-2020 and more than double the broader market's gain.The rally, from a record-low base, has extended into October and is not purely U.S.-centricFirst Solar, a U.S. solar bellwether, climbed about 33 per cent over this period. Portuguese renewable energy company EDP Renovaveis rose 18 per cent.SHIFT IN MARKET FROM SUBSIDIES-DRIVEN TO DEMAND-LEDDriving the rally is rising electricity demand from Big Tech's rapid AI data centre build-outs, electrification of transport and industry, and the upgrading of grid infrastructure to handle new loads.U.S. power consumption, stagnant for over a decade, is forecast to grow sharply. With gas turbines in short supply and nuclear years away, solar-plus-storage is emerging as the only scalable short-term solution."Data centres need electricity in two to three years. People will just add as much renewables as they can. It's not only the cheapest source, but also the fastest to build," said Boner. These trends show renewable energy is morphing from a sector driven by policy and subsidies, to one shaped primarily by market forces, where strong demand requires all forms of energy."Every electron counts," Boner added.Cumulative new U.S. power generation demand is seen at 450 gigawatts by 2030, based on data presented by renewables developer NextEra. Of that, only 75 GW is projected from gas-fired plants, around 40 GW from deferred coal retirements, and limited nuclear contributions. Jonathan Waghorn, who manages both sustainable and fossil fuel funds at Guinness Asset Management, sees renewable earnings picking up, noting electricity demand forecasts have surged eightfold in just a few years."That's starting to get earnings momentum into the companies, especially those with AI, data centre, and grid-building exposure. The industry has just started to get going again, and the market is reacting."Waghorn's fund holds stocks involved in electrifying the energy mix like Eaton and Legrand. He also likes European names like cable maker Prysmian and grid services company Spie.Bishop expects earnings upgrades, typically supportive of price performance, and sees room for valuations to rise. At 14.6 times forward earnings, MSCI's Alternative Energy Index trades at a 40 per cent discount to world stocks, vs a 10-year average premium of 7.4 per cent, based on LSEG data, illustrating how the sector is currently valued well below the broader market despite historically commanding a premium. There are still risks - including higher-for-longer interest rates, policy reversals, and speculative retail excitement in unprofitable areas like new-generation nuclear - but some managers say unwinding bearish bets could help sustain the rally."There are still shorts to be squeezed out of the renewable space," said Luca Moro, CIO at SpesX, an energy transition fund.

More Info As we approach the end of the 2025 financial year, the U.S. stock market continues its defiant rally, shrugging off concerns about job losses, a partial government shutdown, and geopolitical instability. While the S&P 500 has surged with a roughly 14.2% year-to-date (YTD) gain, fueled largely by the relentless AI-driven investment boom—a phenomenon reshaping capital flows from semiconductors to energy infrastructure—the overall Energy sector is lagging badly. With a mere 4.5% YTD gain, it holds the third-lowest spot among major sectors, as oil and gas producers contend with softer commodity prices, the unwinding of OPEC+ cuts, rising costs, and elevated tariffs. Yet, beneath the surface of this underperforming sector, a significant transformation is taking hold.... A rebound in clean energy has seen the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) rise nearly 40 % this year, with demand tied to AI data centers and electrification is driving new investing patterns. Solar stocks are also benefiting, bolstered by policy support and tax incentives preserved (in part) under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). One recent Oilprice article warns that OBBBA “gutted key tax incentives for clean energy projects” and warns the bill’s impact on solar could worsen over time. The U.S. Senate’s July passage of OBBBA without last-minute excise taxes on solar that some lawmakers had proposed also helped stabilize investor sentiment in domestic solar and storage. The removal of those tariffs lent clearer direction to the U.S. clean energy supply chain and gave developers greater confidence in the viability of long-term projects. This shared agenda of capital rotating toward electrification, AI-driven power demand, and policy stability is creating room for a diverse set of energy names to outperform. These winners are not all pure-play renewables. They include integrated power operators, utilities reinventing themselves, and grid-tech enablers. Below are five off-the-radar energy stocks quietly outperforming their peers. Market Cap: $2.20B YTD Returns: 161.4% Israel-based smart energy SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) has been one of the best performers in the solar sector, alongside the broader Israeli stock market, with SEDG up in the triple digits thanks to the company’s improving business fundamentals. SolarEdge returned yet another healthy quarterly scorecard on Tuesday, with second quarter revenue of $289.4M (+9.0% Y/Y) beating the Wall Street consensus by $14.91 million, while non-GAAP EPS of -$0.81 beat by $0.03. According to SolarEdge CEO Yehoshua Nir, Trump’s OBBBA "validates our multiyear strategy of onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. by preserving the 45X advanced manufacturing credit for the next 7 years. We intend to manufacture in the U.S. and to ship U.S.-made SolarEdge products both domestically and across the globe for years to come." SolarEdge’s gross margins continued to improve, increasing 310 basis points sequentially to 11.1%. The company reported that the ongoing supply chain optimizations will cut gross margins by ~ 2%, down from a previous forecast of 4% to 6%. SolarEdge also issued upbeat guidance, with third quarter revenue in the range of $315 million to $355 million, representing 28.4% Y/Y growth at the midpoint while non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 15% -19%, including the 2% of new tariff impact. Market Cap: $165.0B YTD Returns: 83.7% GE Vernova (NYSE:GE) is one of the youngest energy companies, having been spun off by industrial giant General Electric (NYSE:GE) in 2024. GE Vernova is a global energy company that develops and provides products and services for generating, transmitting, and orchestrating electricity. With a market cap roughly half that of its parent company, GE Vernova is one of the largest renewable energy companies, with its GE Renewable Energy division offering a broad portfolio of wind, hydro, storage, and solar technologies. GEV shares have increased more than five-fold from their IPO price, thanks to rising global demand for the company’s services, strong backlog growth and multiple tailwinds from electrification and decarbonization. However, the wild runup has lately attracted some downgrades from Wall Street, with RBC Capital recently trimming GEV price target from $631, with the bank saying the company’s strong outlook is already reflected in the valuation. Market Cap: $113.8B YTD Returns: 60.1% Constellation Energy Corp. (NYSE:CEG) produces and sells energy, including electricity and natural gas, along with sustainable energy solutions to commercial, industrial, residential, and public sector customers. The company operates a diverse portfolio of generation assets, including nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric power, with a total capacity of approximately 31,676 megawatts. CEG shares have been on a tear after the company unveiled an agreement in June to sell more than 1,100 MW of nuclear power to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) from its Illinois nuclear plant for 20 years. According to The Wall Street Journal, the deal is the first deal of its kind for an operating nuclear plant in the United States, and closely mirrors a similar deal Constellation signed with Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) last year. The Microsoft deal is a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) that will see Constellation Energy restart its undamaged reactor in Three Mile Island, which was undergoing decommissioning. Neither deal will draw power from the main grid. However, Meta appears to have secured a better deal, with Citi’s Ryan Levine estimating that the 20-year PPA is priced in the $70-$95/MWh range, considerably cheaper than Jefferies' estimate of at least $110/MWh for Microsoft's PPA, because Meta’s deal “...does not offer a substantial premium for low-carbon nuclear power”. Levine has projected that ~70% of Constellation's existing nuclear plants could secure comparable datacenter deals at ~$80/MWh. Market Cap: $67.9B YTD Returns: 44.8% Irving, Texas-based Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is an integrated power generation company that generates and sells power to residential, commercial, and industrial customers across the United States. The company operates a diverse portfolio of power generation facilities, including natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage, and serves customers through retail brands like TXU Energy and Ambit Energy. VST shares have easily outpaced their energy brethren thanks to the company recording increased power demand from AI data centers and strong results from recent PJM capacity auctions, which are creating a favorable market environment for Vistra's generation and retail operations. Vistra’s diversified fleet, strategic positioning in the nuclear power sector through the Harbor Energy acquisition, and focus on long-term growth and customer-tailored solutions also contribute to investor confidence. Market Cap: $10.3B YTD Returns: 12.7% The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a Virginia-based power generation and utility company that operates in the United States and internationally. AES is actively transforming into a leader in renewable energy, focusing on solar, wind, and energy storage solutions to accelerate a greener energy future. AES shares have been rallying following a report by the Financial Times that BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners plans to acquire the utility company soon, in what would be one of the largest infrastructure takeovers on record. The deal would value AES at ~$38 billion, AES’ $29 billion in debt. Global Infrastructure Partners, which BlackRock acquired a year ago, has a history of utility mergers, including a $6.2 billion deal that took public utility company Allete private.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Rockets Past 800,000 BTC Milestone In Record-Breaking Run

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now holds a staggering 800,000 Bitcoin (BTC), according to Glassnode data, and has accumulated $98 billion in assets under management in less than two years since its debut in January 2024. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, now holds 802,200 BTC in its IBIT ETF, according to Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer. The fund had amassed 798,747 BTC as of Oct. 7, per BlackRock’s own iShares website. IBIT’s purchase of 3,510 BTC (worth $426.2 million) yesterday was enough to push its total holdings above the 800K milestone. The market-leading ETF now holds roughly 3.804% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. IBIT accounts for over 55% of the total BTC held in US spot Bitcoin ETFs, data from Bitbo shows. Additionally, the BlackRock ETF holds more than Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, which boasts a 640,031 BTC stockpile (valued at roughly $78 billion). The recent Bitcoin milestone comes amid reports that IBIT has become BlackRock’s most profitable ETF, surpassing the revenue of its flagship S&P 500 fund, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, which debuted in 2000. Meanwhile, IBIT has led the charge in weekly inflows among all U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, as pointed out by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. “IBIT is #1 in weekly flows among all ETFs with $3.5 billion, which is 10% of all net flows into ETFs,” Balchunas wrote in a Wednesday X post. “Also notable is the rest of the 11 OG spot BTC ETFs all took in cash in the past week, even GBTC, somehow; that’s how hungry the fish are. Two steps forward mode. Enjoy while it lasts.” On Monday, the dozen BTC ETFs pulled in their biggest daily inflow since crypto-friendly President Donald Trump secured the presidency against Kamala Harris as institutional appetite for crypto exposure continues to build. These funds have now posted cumulative net inflows of $63 billion since their launch, with IBIT taking in $65 billion, offset by net outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).

Title: Bitwise ‘Not Playing Around,’ Proposes Low Fee For Its Solana Staking ETF As Official Launch Nears

Crypto fund manager Bitwise designated a 0.20% fee for its Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund, which has a staking component, as asset managers inch closer to securing a green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for their crypto-based ETFs. In a Wednesday amendment to its registration statement, Bitwise formally renames its fund to the “Bitwise Solana Staking ETF,” while including language that enables it to “seek to provide exposure to the value of Solana held by the Trust.” By adding staking, the funds would earn small rewards from helping secure blockchains like Solana or Ethereum. Those rewards flow back into the ETF, providing investors with an opportunity to earn additional income from the same assets, rather than relying solely on price gains. The firm also stated that it would charge a 0.20% unitary management fee, a single charge that covers all fund operating costs, waived for the first three months on the first $1 billion in assets. According to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this incredibly low fee could be a sign of how competitive the investment vehicle could get among ETF issuers. “Bitwise not playing around, plans to charge just 0.20% for their spot Solana ETF,” Balchunas postulated. “Thought we’d see higher first, need war to get this low.” At that rate, the proposed fee undercuts most competing crypto ETFs, which often fall between 0.15% and 0.25%, and matches the lowest levels seen among greenlighted crypto products. “Low fees have near perfect record of attracting investors so good sign for inflow potential,” Balchunas explained. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK), the US’s first Solana staking ETF, ended its first day of trading with $12 million in inflows. The annual management fee for the SSK stands at 0.75%. According to Balchunas, Bitwise’s proposed offering is cheaper, has better tracking, and is 100% physically backed by Solana’s spot assets. “SSK is riddled with tracking issues like a futures ETF. It trails spot Solana by 12% — although it got better in the past month,” he opined. Despite leading the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has yet to submit paperwork with the SEC for an SOL ETF. In August, Bloomberg’s ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested that it would be “messed up” if BlackRock were to file a last-minute application to debut its own SOL product simultaneously with other bidders, after those firms had already spent so much time working with the U.S. regulator to get the paperwork right. Nonetheless, analysts have predicted that several applications for Solana ETFs with staking could win the SEC’s regulatory blessing in the course of this month.

Title: ‘Blown Away’—Bitcoin Braced For A $100 Billion BlackRock Earthquake As Wild Price Swings Rock Crypto

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 10/10 update below. This post was originally published on October 09 Bitcoin has surged into October, with traders strapping in for a market “frenzy” in coming months. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has hit a fresh all-time high over $126,000 per bitcoin, giving it a market capitalization of around $2.5 trillion amid fears of a Federal Reserve-fueled U.S. dollar crisis. Now, as U.S. president Donald Trump floats the idea of a $2,000 Covid stimulus check-style tariff dividend, BlackRock’s market-leading spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is on the verge of crossing $100 billion in assets under management—on track to hit the milestone far faster than any other ETF in history. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock’s IBIT, which launched in January 2024 to huge fanfare, has surged thanks to massive inflows over the last few months and the increase in the value of the bitcoin price itself. The fund now has assets of $98.6 billion and could cross the psychological line in a matter of days. 10/10 update: The bitcoin price has dipped as the crypto market rally comes off the boil, even as the Federal Reserve looks all but certain to cut interest rates again later this month. “Bitcoin volatility is poised for a breakout. Implied volatilities across 14, 30, and 90-day expiries have surged to their highest levels in the past 30 days, pointing to increased anticipation of big moves ahead," Sean Dawson, head of research at leading onchain options platform Derive.xyz, said in emailed comments. “This spike comes as markets price in a near-certain 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month, with Polymarket odds currently sitting at 90%. Following a 3% dip from $123,000 to $120,000, bitcoin has recovered to $121,600. According to Coinglass data, a dense band of short positions is at risk of liquidation just above this level. A modest push upward could trigger a cascade of liquidations and propel BTC back toward $125,000 and beyond." Bitcoin and crypto traders remain bullish despite the latest bitcoin pull back, with analysts pointing to a mismatch between current price action and the underlying market. “Bitcoin is up 7% in October, perfectly matching its seasonal pattern — but this time, the rally feels different,” 10x Research analysts led by chief executive Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note. “Despite trading near all-time highs, momentum is fading, and what once looked like a clean breakout now sits in no-man’s-land. Beneath the surface, the story unfolds differently: institutional whales are buying aggressively, while early adopters quietly sell into strength.” Bitcoin ETFs could add another $20 billion worth of inflows before the end of the year, according to some market watchers, with the lion's share of that likely to go to BlackRock's bitcoin fund. “Following the recent rally over the first weekend of ‘Uptober’, which saw bitcoin’s price surge to a new all-time high above $125,000, record-level ETF inflows totalled above $3 billion across the first week of the month,” Dom Harz, cofounder of bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) platform BOB, said in emailed comments. BlackRock’s IBIT is on track to hit the $100 billion milestone about five times faster than any other ETF in history, according to a report from Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, with it also “by far the youngest” of the 20 largest ETFs. BlackRock's flagship S&P 500 ETF took 25 years to reach its current revenue levels, while IBIT has achieved higher profitability in less than two years. The fund, charging a 0.25% fee, is thought to bring in annual revenue of $240 million for BlackRock, becoming the most profitable BlackRock ETF when it surpassed BlackRock’s IWF and EFA funds in July. “The fact that IBIT is now BlackRock’s most profitable product is extremely impressive," Seyffart, who added that BlackRock’s bitcoin fund—and rival crypto-tied ETFs—faced a lot of criticism ahead of their launches last year, told Bloomberg. “We were very bullish on the amount of demand and flows that we thought would come into the bitcoin ETFs, but even these numbers have blown away our most bullish expectations.” The BlackRock bitcoin fund has become the de facto route for traditional finance to gain bitcoin exposure, with the surging popularity of the "debasement trade" this year catapulting bitcoin higher along with gold. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market “While it’s very possible that gold will continue to outperform other assets for the foreseeable future, it has certainly become a crowded trade,” Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. "That means there is more risk involved in initiating exposure at this point. After more than a 50% rally in the gold price year-to-date, attention may now turn to other alternatives that express a similar view. These include other metals and commodities, tokenized real assets, and bitcoin, which remain undervalued against gold. These alternative assets can all play a similar role in portfolios—a hedge against future inflation and political intervention, and an alternative to the U.S. dollar and other debasing currencies.” Crypto ETFs more widely drew record inflows of almost $6 billion globally last week, according to data from CoinShares. "This level of investment highlights the growing recognition of digital assets as an alternative in times of uncertainty," James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, wrote in the weekly report. US stock futures are showing tentative gains as investors continue to weigh up the implications of a government shutdown that enters its tenth day. According to the Kalshi prediction market, the current forecast signals a possible 24-day shutdown this time around. The standoff in Washington remains unresolved, though some lawmakers have signalled a willingness to compromise on healthcare subsidies to end the impasse. Crucially, there have been some claims that next week’s CPI inflation reading will still be released by the BLS irrespective of whether an agreement is reached in time. Looking ahead, attention will turn to the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, expected to dip to 54.1 from 55.1. With a degree of hesitancy being shown in US futures, there is likely to be some caution as we weigh up the potential implications of the third quarter earnings season. Kicking off with the likes of JPMorgan and Citigroup next week, markets are likely to take on a wait-and-see approach as elevated valuations mean that weak corporate data would likely hurt market sentiment more than positive numbers benefit it.

Title: How Asset Managers Can Eliminate Child And Forced Labor From Their Portfolios

ByBhakti Mirchandani, Contributor. Child labor is a large and growing problem in the United States. With child labor violations in the US up 79% year-over-year following an 140% increase over the past decade, detecting and mitigating child labor violations is material for all investors. This is the second article in a series on child and forced labor due diligence and monitoring. The series draws from guides for asset owners and asset managers that Kathy Hahn and Juho Rana Kim from Casey Family Programs, Jerome McCluskey of Latham & Watkins, and I co-authored following consultations with and/or contributions from over 100 experts, ranging from Save the Children to Neuberger Berman and from UNICEF USA and its Impact Fund for Children to BlackRock. This one-page child and forced labor due diligence guide for asset managers consists of six due diligence questions for asset managers to use when underwriting portfolio companies. If the answers to all of the questions immediately below are no, the process is complete. If the answer to any of the questions below is yes, asset managers would proceed with the longer questionnaire that follows further below. Alternatively, questions may be adapted and put to management or the compliance team of a target on a legal due diligence call. This guide is designed to be intuitive enough for any team member to use and brief enough for investment team members to hang in their cubicles as a reference to use while underwriting and monitoring portfolio companies. The following tables present a four-page child and forced labor due diligence questionnaire for asset managers to use with higher risk portfolio companies. If answers to any of the questions in the Standard Questionnaire immediately below are unclear or suggest a higher level of risk, parts or all of the Detailed Questionnaire should be applied based on the responses to the Standard Questions. As Human Rights Watch Senior Researcher Jim Wormington notes, optimal use of the Detailed Questionnaire would require in-house sector expertise, external partners, or both, and asset managers should consider resource requirements. Asset managers would naturally vary the number of questions from the Detailed Questionnaire that they ask based on position size, whether the position is a controlling interest, potential risks involved, and what change they are trying to drive in their portfolio and/or across the industry. Where the answer to any of the above questions is unclear or suggests a higher level of risk, please use parts or all of the below Detailed Questionnaire based on the responses to the Standard Questionnaire. The next article and final in this series presents a longer list of due diligence questions for asset owners to use if answers to any of the three Heightened Risk Scenario questions from the first article in this series is unclear or suggests a higher level of risk. Note: Special thanks to the organizations with team members who generously took the time to contribute to this work, listed here. The views of this series of articles should not be construed as reflecting the views of these organizations.

Title: Battle over Elon Musk’s trillionaire pay package builds as pension funds face off against Tesla
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/09/tesla-pay-elon-musk-trillion-fight/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T09:56:00Z

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. Tesla is weeks away from a monumental shareholder vote on CEO Elon Musk’s potential $1 trillion pay package at its annual investor meeting, and the EV maker is pulling out all the stops to push the measure through. Last year, Tesla rallied thousands of mom-and-pop retail investors to vote their shares of stock in favor of Musk’s billions in pay. Now, Tesla is teeing up retail holders for another vote on Nov. 6 that would set Musk on the path to becoming the world’s first trillionaire by granting him up to 12% of Tesla’s outstanding shares divided into 12 tranches through a restricted stock grant. The first tranche starts at $2 trillion, and the final tranche is $8.5 trillion. If he hits all the goals in the plan, he’ll have brought Tesla to a market cap of $8.5 trillion, and his stake would be worth more than $1 trillion. Much of the playbook for 2025 is similar to 2024: a slick investor website, a bevy of posts, and engagement on X about how investors can vote shares on specific brokerage platforms, and even a special video with Optimus humanoid robots explaining voting in between taking a sauna and overseeing platters of bagels and cream cheese. Tesla’s Annual Meeting is coming up on November 6 & we need your vote!Voting is quick and easy – you can vote online, by mail, by QR code or by phone@Tesla_Optimus can show you how pic.twitter.com/OM5UwtkJWx— Tesla (@Tesla) October 6, 2025 Tesla is clearly dedicating resources to communicating with its individual retail investors and informing them about how to vote, independent activist investor Michael Levin told Fortune, a feat that is difficult to accomplish in the U.S. Given how Tesla pulled it off last year, this year’s vote to approve Musk’s new award isn’t nearly as in doubt as it was in 2024, he said. Plus, Tesla has the same playbook to work from this year. “The result of 2024 gives a very strong clue about how 2025 will work out—and that passed with 72% of voters supporting it, and that’s pretty comfortable,” Levin said. “This year, it’s sort of a version of the same thing: A comp plan going forward with these insane, ambitious goals, and people are fine with that and don’t mind him being a trillionaire.” Thousands of retail investors and Tesla loyalists have pledged their support in favor of Tesla and Musk’s stratospheric new pay plan, but a growing coalition of pension funds and Democratic state fiduciaries are speaking out about what they see as red flags: a comp package that is too large, a lack of independence on the board, and the potential for other founders and controlling CEOs to follow in Musk’s footsteps. The latter would be disastrous for an economy that is already tilted too favorably in the direction of billionaires like Musk while employees writ large are battling inflation and lackluster pay raises, sources said. “It’s not only the magnitude, it’s the way in which the pay package is sort of a ransom aimed at shareholders,” New York City Comptroller Brad Lander told Fortune. “It’s a megalomaniacal trip of bizarre proportions that is all about Elon’s ego and not about the financial health of the company or its stakeholders and shareholders.” Lander, who signed a letter with other investors urging shareholders to vote against Musk’s pay plan and to oppose the reelection of three Tesla board members, oversees more than $1 billion invested in Tesla on behalf of New York City’s pension funds. Similarly, New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, who oversees about $1.4 billion invested in Tesla on behalf of the state’s pension funds, called Musk’s pay “excessive,” and said it “waters down the holdings of other shareholders, and gives a captive board unwarranted discretion.” DiNapoli said he plans in coming weeks to lobby other investors to vote against the plan and all directors with reelection bids on the board. The vote will be a pivotal moment—not just for Tesla, but for all those who oversee invested assets on behalf of shareholders and retirees, New Mexico State Treasurer Laura Montoya told Fortune. “If we don’t hold them accountable you’re going to have so many others who are going to try and follow suit,” Montoya said. “This is a precedent that could be damaging to our economy, not just today and tomorrow but in our children’s future.” The Tesla meeting agenda includes investor votes on 14 proposals, but the two that are keenly relevant to Musk’s compensation include a proposal to approve his 2025 CEO performance award, and a second proposal that would include the creation of a special reserve of 208 million equity shares for Musk. The vote authorizing more shares will also replenish the equity pool of 60 million shares available for employees and directors that companies typically use to compensate executives. “All the action is in those two proposals,” said Levin, who holds a small investment in Tesla and plans to oppose the pay proposals. The pay plan up for a vote this year comes after a Delaware judge rescinded Musk’s previous moonshot award in January 2024, a decision that prompted Tesla to hold an investor vote to ratify his pay package a second time in 2024 and to authorize a move from being incorporated in the state of Delaware to Texas. The 2024 ratification vote and the move to Texas were enormous victories for the EV maker, even though the same Delaware judge rescinded Musk’s pay package a second time following the vote. Since then, the Tesla board has given Musk an interim award of 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at about $24 billion. Musk’s proposed 2025 award involves the CEO hitting both market capitalization and operational goals that could potentially see Tesla reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion if Musk successfully unlocks all 12 tranches. He’ll have to stick around at Tesla for a minimum of 7.5 years and up to 10 years for his shares to vest. The board claimed during negotiations that Musk “raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests” if he does not get paid for his past work at Tesla and receive at least a 25% voting interest in the company. The new award requires him to “participate in the board’s development of a framework for long-term CEO succession,” one of the provisions states. All told, Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire, and he would hold 28.8% of Tesla if he hits all the goals in the moonshot plan. He would also become the first and only CEO to hit a moonshot hat trick—three back-to-back pay packages. The Tesla board told investors the pay package is key to keeping Musk focused on Tesla and motivated to grow the company. “In light of the AI talent wars, Tesla’s internal efforts to develop and expand its product offerings within the AI industry, the absence of a comprehensive plan to address the compensation that remains outstanding for Musk’s past performance, and the lack of any go-forward incentive to motivate Musk to keep his focus aimed at Tesla long enough to achieve meaningful results that will transform Tesla over the long term, we believe there is a pressing need to retain and incentivize Musk immediately,” the board told investors last month. In their criticisms, pension funds and Democratic state fiduciaries are taking aim not only at the size of Musk’s potential pay package but the Tesla board, chaired by Robyn Denholm. Pension leaders have said Denholm and the board are letting investors down by failing to properly oversee and challenge Musk when needed and ensure that he stays focused on Tesla. “In our view, the board’s failure to limit Mr. Musk’s outside endeavors while rewarding him with unprecedented pay packages for only a part-time commitment strongly indicates a lack of true independence by management and jeopardizes long-term shareholder value,” states a letter from SOC Investment Group, signed by a dozen fiduciaries and investors. “The board has permitted Mr. Musk to be overcommitted for years, allowing him to continue as CEO while taking time-consuming leadership roles at his other companies, xAI/X, SpaceX, Neuralink, and Boring Company.” The letter noted that the level of compensation paid to the Tesla board members could also compromise the board’s impartiality. Average comp paid to S&P 500 board members in 2024 was $327,096, the letter states. Denholm’s average compensation per year has been $62 million. Denholm has repeatedly denied that her objectivity has been clouded by the wealth she’s made selling Tesla stock over the years. Still, some investors are planning to send a message to the board by voting against the three directors up for reelection this year: Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman told Fortune her concerns about Tesla as a fiduciary were based on the board’s governing track record and the lack of accountability by directors overseeing Musk in his role as CEO. “This is one of those circumstances where somebody has to say, ‘Enough is enough,’” said Lierman. Despite the organizing by pension funds, the battle to sway the vote is an uphill climb, although that is no reason not to speak out, noted Lierman. Tesla appears positioned to win approval of Musk’s new moonshot pay plan based on Musk’s ownership, the voting history of large institutional investors, and the company’s track record with individual holders. According to the proxy statement, owned by Musk—and his brother and board colleague Kimbal Musk—can be voted for the two key comp proposals. Meaning there is no majority-of-minority requirement, a corporate governance mechanism where a transaction or proposal has to be approved by a majority of shareholders who are not involved in the transaction. Currently, Musk holds about 20% of the company, and Kimbal Musk holds about 1.5 million shares, less than 1% of Tesla’s outstanding stock. In addition, large institutional investors BlackRock and Vanguard hold close to 13% of Tesla between them, and both voted in favor of Musk’s pay ratification in 2024. According to FactSet, retail shareholders equate to approximately 34% of outstanding shares. Last year’s ratification vote saw 72% of all votes cast in approval of his pay, which excluded shares connected to Musk and his brother. Given the level of insider control plus Tesla’s command over its retail base, proxy advisory firms like ISS and Glass Lewis aren’t going to be a determinant even if they recommend investors oppose the pay proposals, said Levin. Similarly, BlackRock and Vanguard don’t disclose their votes in advance, but they may not be much of an issue even if they suddenly reverse course on Musk’s pay this year versus last year. Still, Musk is unlikely to leave anything to chance, said Levin, given his ownership stake in Tesla. And if Musk left Tesla it would be terrible for investors; the stock would likely immediately plummet. “Maybe it’s a risk this board doesn’t want to take,” said Levin. “But I think the cost of avoiding that risk is way too high—it’s a trillion dollars of equity.” Tesla’s shareholder meeting is slated to take place on Nov. 6 at its headquarters in Austin. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Crypto-Focused AMINA Bank of Switzerland Offers Regulated Staking of Polygon Token

Swiss-regulated crypto bank AMINA has become the first bank worldwide to offer institutional clients regulated staking access to POL, the native token that powers the Polygon blockchain. The launch allows qualified participants, including asset managers and corporate treasuries, to earn staking rewards while supporting network security in compliance with financial regulations. As part of this collaboration, AMINA clients can receive up to 15% in staking rewards. This rate combines AMINA’s base yield with an additional incentive from the foundation. The move expands the bank’s existing POL custody and trading services, giving institutions a compliant path to participate in blockchain infrastructure relied on by firms like BlackRock, JPMorgan and Franklin Templeton for their tokenization efforts. Myles Harrison, AMINA’s chief product officer, said the service bridges traditional finance with “the networks that matter.” AMINA Bank (previously known as SEBA Bank) holds a license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”), and also has nods to offer crypto services from regulators in Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong. Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron called the development a sign that institutions “aren’t just buying tokens anymore — they want to participate.” Polygon, an Ethereum overlay blockchain which processes transactions for less than a cent and settles them in under five seconds, has become one of the main networks for on-chain finance. It now hosts over $1 billion in tokenized real-world assets and nearly $3 billion in stablecoin value. The POL token had a market cap of $2.5 billion at press time.

Title: Finn McRedmond: Forget VAT. Delivery apps are killing our restaurants
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2025/10/09/finn-mcredmond-the-more-takeaways-we-order-the-more-miserable-we-become/

Call the social scientists. I propose a new method for tracking the social health of society and it’s called The Takeaway Index. It suggests that the moral status of the nation is tightly correlated with the amount of time we spend ordering food via apps on our smartphones. I think it stands up against accepted scientific methods. This is, conveniently, rather good news for me. I have ordered just one takeaway in 2025. It was Monday, June 30th. I had returned from Glastonbury after a seven-hour trip home, husk-like, to an empty fridge. I scrolled through Uber Eats and ordered chicken, broccoli and some pickled cabbage, in repentance for the hedonism of recent days. I felt immediate guilt, not because it was going to be disgusting, but because I know delivery apps are wreaking havoc on the restaurant industry. Forgive the moralising (it’s just dinner), but your beloved local trattoria’s life depends on it. In the first quarter of 2025, 150 restaurants in Ireland closed. Six-hundred restaurants, cafes and hospitality businesses closed in the 12 months from September, 2023. This is a crisis and if the impersonal data doesn’t do it for you, then look to your main street. Near to where I grew up, Gareth Smith’s restaurant, Big Mike’s (in Blackrock, Co Dublin), has been forced to shutter. The economics of the industry are “insurmountable”, he explained. Allow me to acknowledge the cost-of-living crisis and all the hardship it places on the consumer. Regular dinner out is an extravagance beyond many. A fish pie for €20 is not trivial pocket change. With that out of the way, now turn your eyes to this staggering figure reported by RTÉ this summer: we spend €2.2 billion a year on takeaways. Restaurants are caught in a nasty doom loop. They were once reliant on the likes of Uber Eats or Deliveroo to survive, but those are now among the factors making brick-and-mortar restaurants less viable. There are other things at play of course, but this part of the story is too often overlooked. During the pandemic, restaurants relied on these delivery apps to reach their customers. It was a vicious cycle; customers became too used to takeaways and restaurants grew too reliant on takeaway apps. Now, in 2025, not enough people are eating out. Or, as UCC professor Ronan Carbery puts it in a piece for RTÉ, “delivery platforms transformed from pandemic lifelines into structural threats”. The Government is listening. Tuesday’s budget announced VAT on “food businesses” will reduce from 13.5 per cent to 9 per cent from next summer. This might dig hospitality out of the grave, but only if those in search of dinner are willing to give up their Uber Eats account too. “It’s actually much more complicated than that.” These are the words I hear from the more annoying among you. Isn’t single-cause history out of fashion? All well and good, but this is not about the multifaceted source of hospitality’s malaise. Rising wages, cost of produce, hostile rental markets – these are all problems too. But what we are witnessing beyond the economic analysis is a much more troubling directional trend. And we have always been able to learn a lot about the world by looking at how it decides to eat. Last I heard, society is more atomised than ever – polarised, miserable, with nasty populists in the wings and surrounded by a truculent electorate. The isolating power of the smartphone turns out to be even greater than we ever imagined – as young people in particular while away their hours, and thus their lives, scrolling through endless amounts of slop. This radicalises some and makes loners out of others. Meanwhile, everyone wants to sit inside and order a pizza to their front door from an app. Breaking bread might be the most ancient practice, slowly being lost to the lure of the smartphone. Ordering food off an app is a symptom of this bigger sickness. Just like the decline in shared community activities like sports teams and bridge clubs, the retreat inside to eat dinner on the sofa is part of this social atomisation. But it is a cause of the isolating spiral too. As fewer people want to be – or can afford to be – in shared places like restaurants, is it any wonder that everyone has forgotten what is nice about it in the first place? This is a self-sustaining crash-out. I’ve glanced into the future and it is a grim place where the dimly-lit wine bar serving pan-European small plates is closed. Also closed are the robust kitchens serving trad-hibernian fare, the seafood bars on Dublin’s south coast and West Cork’s shores. We have ceded our appetites to middlemen at Silicon Valley mega-corps. We demand lunch in a box handed to us by a low-wage gig-economy worker. All the while the local restaurant was just around the corner, begging for your custom. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Elm Park offices present opportunity for offices and healthcare investors
URL: https://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/elm-park-offices-present-opportunity-for-offices-and-healthcare-investors/a1420248835.html

Block A at Elm Park With office deals increasing in both the lettings and sales markets, the launch of Block A at Elm Park, Dublin 4, along with the adjoining annex, presents an interesting opportunity for investors and owner occupiers. It also reflects how keen pricing has become for Dublin offices. Agent TWM is guiding in the region of €18.5m for the entire block which is equivalent to €1,744 per square metre – whereas to develop the same block at current prices could cost more than double that, at €4,198 per square metre. Block A is a modern seven-storey office building extending to about 72,000sqft with an adjoining smaller building known as the annex, extending to about 10,000sqft. The sale includes 76 secure basement car spaces. Currently the lot generates annual rent of €1.32m and there is potential to increase that by letting out two vacant floors extending to 29,000sqft which can be accessed via individual entrances. Strategic risk management firms Willis Towers Watson has a lease on four floors accounting for 60pc of the building and they are paying about €1.2m in rent. Recent figures for the Dublin office market saw increased activity when 822,000sqft of office space was leased across 61 deals during the three months to the end of September. That was the highest number of transactions in a quarter since the third quarter of 2018. Recovery in office demand was also reflected in the investment market, where offices accounted for 35pc of deal volume, across 12 deals. Michele Jackson of TWM also says Elm Park could also appeal to purchasers and occupiers in the healthcare sector, partly because its basement is built to double height level, which is designed to accommodate ambulances. “The 2024 strategic acquisition by the HSE of its Elm Park Green portfolio for approximately €50m is understood to have triggered a broader interest in this location from investors seeking a value add/alternative use play as well as from the immediate healthcare sector.” The HSE acquisition comprised 275,000sqft of accommodation across two buildings which included the vacant Seamark building, extending to approximately 180,000sqft. The acquisition will support cost-effective and expedient delivery of healthcare accommodation in line with the most recent Programme for Government. Elm Park is a prime Dublin 4 location adjacent to St Vincent’s public and private hospitals and 2kms from Blackrock Health. The development has generous secure basement parking and easy access to bus and Dart public transport. Ms Jackson says that “The location is likely to appeal to both investors and owner occupiers looking to buy into sectors poised for growth.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Commentary: Is Hong Kong’s comeback for the world or for China?

Commentary As China prepares for a key meeting to discuss its next five-year plan, repositioning Hong Kong must take focus, says former SCMP editor-in-chief Wang Xiangwei. File photo of people crossing a street during busy evening traffic in Central Hong Kong. (Photo: AFP/Mladen Antonov) This audio is generated by an AI tool. HONG KONG: Just a few years ago, many outsiders had written Hong Kong off. The violent protests of 2019, followed by the imposition of a national security law in 2020 and strict COVID-19 restrictions, triggered a mass exodus of local and foreign talent and capital. Professionals and firms fled to safer havens like Singapore, while others sought refuge in New York and London, leaving the city economically battered and demographically hollowed out. Yet, in a striking turnaround, Hong Kong is staging a robust comeback - albeit one fraught with inconsistencies. The city's stock markets have surged back to prominence, fuelled by Beijing's economic stimulus measures unveiled in September 2024. In the first half of 2025 alone, the city raised HK$107.1 billion (US$13.7 billion) through initial public offerings (IPOs) - seven times the amount from the same period in 2024. PwC forecasts that 2025 will mark Hong Kong's most active IPO market in four years, with fundraising expected to claim the global number one spot. Much of this momentum is being driven by mainland Chinese firms, which account for around 60 per cent of the over 2,600 companies listed in Hong Kong, as well as more than 80 per cent of total market capitalisation. Government incentives have also drawn hundreds of thousands of Chinese talents from the mainland and overseas. The latest vindication came last month when Hong Kong supplanted Singapore as Asia's premier destination for attracting talent and rocketed to fourth place worldwide in the IMD World Talent Ranking - its highest-ever position. This resurgence, however, feels lopsided on the ground. The streets are bustling, and the vibrancy is unmistakable. Tourism footfall is up, especially from mainland China, which accounted for nearly 80 per cent of Hong Kong’s visitor arrivals between January and August. But boarded-up storefronts tell another story. High rents and competition from cheaper cross-border alternatives have hit parts of the retail and restaurant segments hard, even as other sectors, for example jewellery and watches typically favoured by tourists - thrive. Beneath this uneven recovery looms a larger, strategic question: Is Hong Kong rebounding to reclaim its cherished mantle as Asia's World City - a cosmopolitan powerhouse akin to New York or London - or is it morphing into China's World City, a specialised outpost serving the mainland's ambitions? The answer will dictate everything from investment flows and urban planning to cultural identity and global relevance. Since 2001, Hong Kong has leaned heavily into its "Asia's World City" branding, spotlighting its prowess in financial services, trade, tourism, transport and communications. This narrative positioned the city as a vibrant, rule-of-law bastion bridging East and West. But the past five years have upended that vision, amid escalating US-China tensions. Perceptions have shifted dramatically; serious doubts now swirl about whether Hong Kong is devolving into "just another Chinese city". This unease stems partly from the territory's political elite, who have increasingly embraced mainland-style rhetoric and governance practices. Over the last two years, Beijing has exhorted the city to prioritise economic growth, leveraging its unique perch as a capitalist enclave under the "one country, two systems" framework. Yet Hong Kong grapples with striking a delicate equilibrium between security and development, and between deeper integration into the mainland economy and its role as a regional hub for international business. Recent flashpoints underscore the tension. In March 2025, state-backed media unleashed blistering criticism against tycoon Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings for its plan to sell strategic Panama Canal ports to a consortium led by US financial behemoth BlackRock, branding the move a "betrayal" and "spineless capitulation". Similarly, early this month, Beijing's top diplomat in Hong Kong warned the newly arrived US Consul General Julie Eadeh against "colluding with anti-China forces", after she met with local civil society figures. Contrary to fears that Hong Kong would be collateral damage in the US-China showdown, its liminal "in-between" status is proving a surprising asset. The mainland stimulus not only juiced stocks but also amplified Hong Kong's appeal as a conduit for global capital into China. Looking ahead, the city stands to gain from cross-border talent flows. In the US, President Donald Trump's aggressive crackdown on elite universities like Harvard and restrictions on foreign scholars have unnerved Chinese students and scientists, many of whom view Hong Kong as a lifeline. Its capitalist ethos, English common law, and open access to Western platforms like Google and Facebook, which are banned on the mainland, make it an alluring alternative. Beijing's blessings have supercharged this trend. Hong Kong's talent admission schemes, offering low taxes and top-tier international schools, have magnetised mainland professionals eager for global exposure while securing better futures for their children. Since 2022, these programmes have fielded nearly 500,000 applications, approving over 330,000 and welcoming more than 230,000 arrivals. The government's back-patting as an "international talent hub" rings somewhat hollow though, as the vast majority hail from the mainland, raising eyebrows about diversity and true global pull. These newcomers will undoubtedly invigorate the economy, restoring the frenetic energy of old. But they also fuel anxieties over whether Hong Kong can preserve its status as an international business nexus amid ballooning geopolitical friction. Officials have pivoted toward forging economic ties with Middle Eastern powerhouses and Belt and Road Initiative partners, with Dubai and Qatar emerging as favoured haunts. This shift isn't whimsical: US sanctions on senior figures, including Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, have hamstrung outreach to traditional business partners like the US, UK, and Europe, forcing a reorientation. The result? Apprehensions that Hong Kong is settling for a diminished role - a regional player on par with Dubai - rather than reclaiming its perch as a global financial titan rivalling New York and London. As China's leaders convene imminently to chart the 2026-2030 Five-Year Plan against a backdrop of roiling geopolitics, repositioning Hong Kong must rise to the fore. It needs to make the city indispensable to China’s modernisation and equally indispensable to global capital seeking exposure to China and Asia. To deliver that dual indispensability, Hong Kong must navigate these currents with nuance - honouring Beijing's directives while safeguarding the openness that once defined it as Asia's unrivalled world city.

Title: Think tank founder faces scrutiny over China corporate ties despite decoupling advocacy

Republican strategist Katie Zacharia joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss President Donald Trump's negotiations with China on trade, tariffs and the framework for a TikTok sale. Oren Cass, founder of the Washington-based think tank American Compass, has built a reputation as one of the right’s most outspoken advocates for economic nationalism and "strategic decoupling" from Beijing. Yet recent details about the group’s corporate partnerships and staff affiliations raise questions about consistency between its rhetoric and its operations. In essays and media appearances, Cass has argued that the United States must take a tougher stance toward China and prioritize domestic manufacturing and independence from Chinese supply chains. In a 2023 Foreign Affairs essay, Cass and a colleague warned that the U.S. "must break from China or else become irrevocably corrupted by it," arguing that economic interdependence had already "weakened America’s industrial base and constrained its political will." MAJOR COLLEGES FACE HEAT OVER CHINESE SCHOLARSHIP TIES AS ESPIONAGE CONCERNS MOUNT Oren Cass has become (Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP/Getty Images) In the same essay, Cass and his co-author argued that China’s influence extended deep into U.S. research and policy institutions. "China has long targeted U.S. universities, think tanks and research institutes to extract economic gain and advance its own ideological agenda," they wrote, adding that such organizations "must accept processes and controls designed to ensure the integrity and security of their work." They went further, calling for legal restrictions. "U.S. law should be changed to prohibit these institutions from entering into any partnerships with China-based and affiliated entities. Any funding flowing from one nation's institutions to the other's must be stopped." Lawmakers from both parties have long raised concerns that the Chinese government exploits educational exchanges, research partnerships and business investments in the U.S. as cover for espionage activities. These warnings have intensified in recent years amid growing scrutiny of Beijing’s influence operations on U.S. soil. The national flags of the United States and China flutter at the Fairmont Peace Hotel on April 25, 2024 in Shanghai, China. (Photo by Wang Gang/VCG via Getty Images) On July 28, 2025, Cass joined a group of policymakers and national security experts in a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressing "deep concern" over the decision to resume exports of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China. The group warned that the Trump administration’s move "represents a strategic misstep that endangers the United States’ economic and military edge in artificial intelligence." He reiterated his stance during a conversation on Steve Bannon’s "War Room" podcast where he argued against lifting export restrictions on advanced computer chips bound for China. CHINA'S MALIGN INFLUENCE TOUCHES EVERY ASPECT OF US LIFE. WE ALL NEED TO HELP STOP THEM And yet, Cass’s uncompromising rhetoric on China appears at odds with the realities of operating a Washington think tank in a globalized economy. In June 2025, American Compass hosted a lavish fifth-anniversary gala at Washington’s National Building Museum, an event underwritten in part by Qualcomm, BlackRock, and Google — companies whose global operations remain deeply intertwined with China’s economy. U.S. Vice President JD Vance arrives to speak during the American Compass Fifth Anniversary Gala alongside American Compass founder and Chief Economist Oren Cass (L) at the National Building Museum in Washington, DC, on June 3, 2025. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) China is the world’s second-largest economy and a key trading partner for U.S. companies, making such financial entanglements common across Washington’s policy landscape. Fox News Digital reached out to Qualcomm, BlackRock and Google for comment; none responded before publication. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP What's more, American Compass’s staffing and advisory relationships have also prompted questions. The organization’s director of events and operations previously worked for Alibaba Group, one of China’s largest tech companies. Additionally, an economist on the group’s advisory board is also a professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management, a leading business institution with close ties to China's Communist Party. Cass and American Compass did not return multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital. While none of these associations are illegal or unusual in Washington, they complicate Cass’ image as a champion of economic separation from China and highlight the difficulty of pursuing that ideal while relying on corporate sponsors.

Title: Spiritans to sell Tipperary farm to fund compensation for abuse survivors
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2025/10/09/spiritans-regret-delay-in-redress-for-school-abuse-survivors-and-ask-for-more-time/

The Spiritan order is to sell one of the biggest farms in Co Tipperary as part of its pledge to compensate victims of abuse. The 765-acre Rockwell Farm will be sold on the open market and is likely to fetch at least €20 million, according to industry sources. The land was used for an agricultural college until the 1980s and is now a dairy farm with up to 650 cows. By November of last year, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published in September 2024. The schools involved were Blackrock College, its feeder junior school Willow Park, Rockwell College, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College. In a statement, Spiritans provincial Fr Brendan Carr said the order had been upfront about not having the cash to compensate victims and would instead need to sell assets. He said the order had been “fully transparent about their financial position” from the beginning. “Progress is being made and Rockwell Farm will be the first of these properties to be sold, but this involves multiple legal, valuation and regulatory steps that simply take time to complete.” He added that as a registered charitable organisation, the Spiritans are subject to the oversight of the Charities Regulator and subject to audit. The order also felt a need “to respond clearly to the suggestion that the Spiritans are deliberately delaying or obstructing progress”. Last Friday, the order was accused of adding to the suffering of the survivors by missing the deadline given last June in announcing a redress scheme. The Spiritans had not provided any such update at the end of summer, the Restore Together group said, and had been seeking a meeting with the order ever since. Responding on Wednesday, Fr Carr said “a commitment was made” but “progress has not been as fast as anyone would wish”. [ Spiritans commit to redress scheme for school abuse survivors in attempt to ‘offer atonement’Opens in new window ] Fr Carr acknowledged “the immense urgency that victims and survivors feel. We feel it too.” He added: “We continue to meet regularly with survivors and to provide ongoing counselling and restorative meetings facilitated by the independent restorative justice team. These encounters are deeply important to us and they continue to shape how we respond and plan.” He appealed “for understanding as we continue to navigate these complex financial and legal steps”. Fr Carr said: “We will provide a further public update as soon as key transactions are concluded and timelines can be confirmed with confidence.” The value of Co Tipperary land was brought into focus during a recent legal action involving billionaire businessman John Magnier. Mr Magnier lost a case at the Commercial Court claiming a verbal agreement to buy the 751-acre Barne Estate amounted to a sale. He agreed a price of €15 million with the owner Richard Thomson-Moore in August 2023, but eventually lost out to New York-based businessman Maurice Regan who agreed to buy the estate for €22.5 million.

Title: How Has The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Fared Compared To Its Older Funds?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-fared/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T19:00:41Z

Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas has highlighted how the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has performed in comparison to the world’s largest asset manager’s older funds. This comes as the fund approaches the $100 billion milestone, which will make it the fastest to reach this milestone. In an X post, Balchunas revealed that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which is approaching $100 billion, is now the most profitable fund for the asset manager by a “good amount.” The Bloomberg analyst also highlighted that this is a massive feat for the Bitcoin fund, considering its age in comparison to the other funds. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which was launched last year, is currently generating an annual revenue of $244.5 million for the world’s largest asset manager. This is well ahead of BlackRock’s Russell 1000 Growth ETF, which is 25 years old and generates an annual revenue of $219.3 million, placing it in second place. Notably, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is the only fund on the list that has a single-digit age. The other of BlackRock’s funds are 12 years and above. Eric Balchunas also noted that IBIT was approaching $100 billion in assets under management (AuM), which could make it the fastest to reach this milestone. The Bloomberg analyst revealed that the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF currently holds this record, although it achieved this feat in 2,011 days. Meanwhile, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which is just 437 days old, currently has $99.44 billion in assets under management, putting it on track to surpass this record by a considerable margin. This comes as the BlackRock BTC ETF continues to lead the pack, with massive daily net inflows. On October 6, these Bitcoin funds saw $1.19 billion in daily net inflows, with IBIT accounting $970 million of these flows. Meanwhile, they recorded a daily net inflow of $875.6 million yesterday, with IBIT accounting for $899.4 million of these flows. Eric Balchunas also revealed that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is now in the top 20 in ETF assets following the rapid increase in its AuM. Based on its current AuM, IBIT is 19th on the list of largest ETFs, just ahead of Vanguard’s VIG and the “legendary” Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund. The Bloomberg analyst remarked that if the last 12 months are repeated, it may not take too long for the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF to break into the top 10. He noted that the fund took in $40 billion over the last 12 months and saw an 85% increase. He added that he will put the timeline at December 2026 if he has to give one. At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at around $121,500, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Jury told Quilligan subjected to a violent assault
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/courts/2025/1008/1537523-kieran-quilligan-case/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T16:30:14Z
Full Content:
Jennie O\u0027Sullivan The jury in the trial of two men accused of the murder of Kieran Quilligan has been told that the 47-year-old had been subjected to a violent assault with a hammer-like weapon. Mr Quilligan's skeletal remains were found in a one-tonne gravel bag on scrub land near Rostellan in east Cork on 29 January last year, five months after he was first reported missing. Niall Long, 33, formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon and 27-year-old Luke Taylor, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock in Cork city have both pleaded not guilty at the Central Criminal Court to murdering Mr Quilligan on dates unknown between 1 September 2023 and 29 January 2024, at an unknown location within the State in the district court of Cork city, contary to Common Law. On the opening day of the trial before Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford at the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork, Prosecution Counsel Donal O'Sullivan SC told the jury of two women and ten men in his opening address that while the prosecution is not in a position to say who landed the blows, the allegation is that this was a joint enterprise where two people embarked on an enterprise to commit a murder. He said the jury would see alot of CCTV footage of both of the accused and alot of the evidence is circumstantial as there were no eye witnesses. He told jurors that Mr Quilligan was a user of the Simon Community and lived in an apartment provided by them. "He was someone who took drugs and was dealing drugs at the time. Niall Long (one of the co-accused) is someone who was a drug user and may have been dealing drugs as well," Mr O'Sullivan said. Mr O'Sullivan said on the morning of 1 September, Mr Quilligan and another man John Paul Thornton (known as 'Bubbles') robbed and assaulted Mr Long on York Hill. "It appears this is the instigating factor of what occured later that evening," Mr O'Sullivan said. It will be the State's case that at around 8pm that evening, the co-accused Luke Taylor was seen with Kieran Quilligan on CCTV leaving his apartment on Anderson's Quay and heading up along the quays towards St Finbarr's Cathedral. Two people in a house on St Finbarr's Place later reported hearing a violent altercation at around 9pm. Prosecution Counsel Donal O'Sullivan said CCTV will allegedly show a white Toyota RAV4 car registered to Niall Long's mother driving along Dean Street at the top of St Finbarr's Place. It will be claimed that the CCTV footage will show it reversing so that the boot of the car is facing down the lane at 9.05pm. Gardaí conducted a trawl of CCTV footage across Cork city and county and the same car was tracked going to a location in Little Island and afterwards dropping Mr Taylor off at an address at Jacob's Island. Mr O'Sullivan says Mr Quilligan was never seen alive again. He was reported missing on 4 September and a garda investigtion began. He said the jury would also see CCTV footage taken on 4 September which shows Mr Taylor being picked up from the Rochestown Park Hotel at 10.15pm by a white Toyota RAV4, which travelled to a number of locations in east Cork. On 29 January, a cadaver dog on scrubland at Whitewell, Rostellan, "reacts to an area below the road, wet and damp, not the sort of place anyone would be walking", Mr O'Sullivan said. There gardaí found a one-tonne gravel bag. Underneath it was a second bag inside which were skeletal human remains later identified as Kieran Quilligan's. Prosecution Counsel Donal O'Sullivan said post-mortem examination results revealed that while most of the soft tissue was gone, there was a large number of skeletal injuries. "This man was badly beaten. A weapon appears to have been used in the nature of a hammer," he said. "He met his death in a violent manner". Before his remains were found, a search was carried out on 15 September 2023 of Mr Long's home, and a car, as well as a bucket with cleaning products were seized. Blood was found, which matched to Kieran Quilligan. Concluding his opening address to the jury, Mr O'Sullivan said that "I don't have direct evidence, an eye witness saying I saw Niall Long or Luke Taylor beat him to death. I don't have that. "The case is for the most part circumstantial - a man goes missing on 1 September, found on 29 January, most likely he died on 1 September." The trial continues before Ms Justice Lankford, who indicated on Monday that it could last until the end of the month. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: BlackRock and Brevan Howard tokenized funds launch on Sei: check SEI price outlook
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-and-brevan-howard-tokenized-funds-launch-on-sei-check-sei-price-outlook/
Time Published: 2025-10-08T16:14:55Z
Full Content:
Global investment giants BlackRock and Brevan Howard have announced the launch of their tokenized funds on the Sei network, leveraging Kaios’s advanced infrastructure. Announced on October 8, 2025, the move highlights an accelerating institutional adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. The debut introduces BlackRock’s BUIDL and Brevan Howard’s BH Digital Liquidity Fund to the Sei ecosystem, facilitated by Kaios’s institutional-grade platform. Conventional funds under this initiative are transformed into on-chain digital assets, enabling 24/7 compliance with DeFi protocols. BlackRock. Brevan Howard. Live on Sei. The most powerful names in global finance are coming to Sei via @KAIO_xyz — beginning with BlackRock's ICS US Dollar Liquidity Fund and Brevan Howard's Master Fund, now live. RWAs Move Faster on Sei. ($/acc) pic.twitter.com/fXaTgQvx1c — Sei (@SeiNetwork) October 8, 2025 Sei’s architecture ensures robust handling of high-volume transactions while maintaining enterprise-level security. Mr. Olivier Dang, COO of KAIO, commenting on the announcement “This launch marks another major milestone in institutional blockchain adoption. By using the Sei Network, we’re bringing composable access to leading fund strategies entirely onchain. It’s the foundation for real-time, programmable, financial infrastructure built for the next era of capital markets.” Justin Barlow, Executive Director at the Sei Development Foundation, in his statement, also stated, “The integration of KAIO’s onchain infrastructure with the Sei Network is another important step toward the goal for Sei to become the institutional settlement layer for all digital assets. Sei’s high-performance rails enable a seamless experience for trading money market funds onchain–one that is superior to the experience of trading those funds in the real world.” This collaboration addresses longstanding pain points in asset management, such as settlement delays and high costs. By embedding KYC/AML protocols and secure custody solutions, Kaios ensures regulatory alignment, paving the way for broader institutional inflows into tokenized RWAs. The debut of these high-profile funds is poised to catalyze demand for the SEI token. As institutional activity surges, network usage is expected to rise, enhancing SEI’s deflationary mechanics and staking yields. SEI is trading at near $0.28, with a 4% weekly loss amid broader crypto market profit taking. Short-term forecasts anticipate modest recovery, targeting $0.40-$0.50, bolstered by Sei’s growing network, partnerships. Medium-term outlooks predict SEI reaching $1, with the all-time high of $1.14 allowing for further upside. The price trajectory hinges on sustained partnerships and regulatory tailwinds like potential SEC approvals for staking yields. An $18 million token unlock is a challenge that could introduce supply pressure. Sei’s staking ratio and recent 50% weekly surges suggest resilience. This launch cements Sei’s role in institutional blockchain innovation, with SEI’s price outlook tilting positive amid heightened utility and capital inflows.

Title: The Protocol: 77% of Bitcoin Holders Have Never Used BTCFi, Survey Reveals

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: BITCOIN HOLDERS HESITANT TO EXPLORE BTC DEFI : Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi), also known as BTCFi, has been touted as the next wave of innovation for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. However, research suggests bitcoin holders themselves are barely engaging. Some 77% of bitcoin holders have never tried a BTCFi platform, according to a survey of more than 700 respondents across North America and Europe by BTC mining ecosystem GoMining. Just over 10% reported having experimented once or twice, while only 8% said they actively use BTCFi services for yield or lending. The survey highlights a stark disconnect between the sector’s promise and its actual reach. “There’s an enormous appetite for these opportunities, but the industry has built products for crypto natives, not for everyday bitcoin holders,” said GoMining CEO Mark Zalan in a statement. That appetite shows up in the data: 73% of respondents expressed interest in earning yield on their BTC through lending or staking, while 42% want access to liquidity without selling. Yet hesitation dominates. More than 40% said they would allocate less than 20% of their holdings to BTCFi products, underscoring the sector’s trust and complexity problem. — Jamie Crawley Read more. ETHEREUM FUSAKA UPGRADE ON HOLESKY TESTNET GOES LIVE: Ethereum’s next upgrade, Fusaka, just moved closer to going live on the main blockchain after a successful test run on the Holesky test network last week. The Fusaka hard fork comes only a few months after Ethereum’s major Pectra upgrade and is designed to make things cheaper for institutions using Ethereum. One of the changes it introduces is PeerDAS, a feature that lets validators check only part of the data needed instead of full chunks (“blobs”), which helps cut costs for both layer-2 networks and validators. Test networks like Holesky act as practice grounds where developers can safely test new code before it reaches the real chain. Holesky, launched in 2023, was particularly important because its validator setup closely mirrors Ethereum’s mainnet. But over the past few months, Holesky has started showing signs of age and reliability issues. Fusaka is the last upgrade the network will see before it shuts down — two weeks after Fusaka goes live on mainnet. The next two testnet runs are scheduled for October 14 and 28. After those are complete, Ethereum developers will lock in a date for Fusaka’s full mainnet launch. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. DOUBLEZERO MAINNET GOES LIVE: A new project wants to give blockchains their own “fast lane” on the internet. The DoubleZero Foundation announced that its highly anticipated mainnet-beta is live. DoubleZero is a network built to speed up how blockchain validators talk to each other. Instead of relying on the public internet, which can sometimes be slow and unpredictable, Solana validators can now connect through DoubleZero’s fiber routes, which let users transact faster. In simple terms, DoubleZero is like a private highway system for blockchains. While normal internet routes are designed to be cheap and broad, they aren’t built for the split-second coordination thousands of blockchain nodes need. DoubleZero says its network reduces lag and makes it easier for validators to process transactions and stay in sync, which could improve both performance and reliability for end users. The project has already seen early adoption. When it went live, 22% of staked SOL is plugged into the DoubleZero network (as of publication is at 25%.) Big industry names like Jump Crypto, Galaxy, RockawayX, and Jito are contributing fiber links and engineering resources, betting that faster internet infrastructure will pay off as blockchain applications scale. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. BEE MAPS RAISES $32M IN FUNDING ROUND: Bee Maps, the decentralized mapping project powered by Hivemapper, has raised $32 million in fresh funding to expand its global contributor network and scale its infrastructure, it announced this week. The round was led by Pantera Capital, LDA Capital, Borderless Capital and Ajna Capital, marking one of the largest financings in the decentralized physical infrastructure (DePin) sector this year. Bee Maps is an application on the Hivemapper network, which is one of the largest decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) focused on mapping data on Solana. Hivemapper enables drivers to contribute data through AI-enabled dash cams, which detect real-time changes on roads (like new signs on the roads, detours, or construction zones), ensuring digital maps can update quickly to stay accurate. Bee Maps leverages this infrastructure by rewarding contributors with its native token, $HONEY, for collecting street-level imagery. The raise highlights strong investor appetite for Bee Maps’ vision of real-time, AI-powered maps. In recent months, Bee Maps has teamed up with major players including Lyft and Volkswagen’s robotaxi program to bring its mapping-data to their platforms. The fresh capital will be used to distribute more devices, enhance AI models that process and update map features and boost contributor incentives tied to $HONEY. – Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

Title: BlackRock dominates all ETFs with $3.5bn haul: ‘that’s how hungry the fish are’

Time Published: 2025-10-08T15:54:20Z

About us Copy link BlackRock investors are relentless. Larry Fink’s firm led exchange-traded fund flows across every sector last week, topping the list with $3.5 billion in flows into its Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. That’s 10% of all net inflows into ETFs. In second and third place came Vanguard and State Street. Their flagship S&P 500 trackers, SPLG and VOO, hauled in $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. What’s impressive, however, is that both are getting lapped by a two-year-old. BlackRock’s IBIT has been around since January 2024, while Vanguard’s SPLG is 20 years old, and State Street’s VOO has been around for 15 years. Still, BlackRock wasn’t alone in its feeding frenzy. Every single Bitcoin ETF took in cash last week, with a total of 43,100 Bitcoin worth about $4.8 billion, according to Coinglass. “That’s how hungry the fish are,” said Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst. “Two steps forward mode. Enjoy while it lasts.” Moreover, flows into Bitcoin ETFs are nearly on par with 2024, with just under three months still to go. Year-to-date, inflows are now at $48.3 billion versus last year’s $48.5 billion, according to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares. Since its inception, BlackRock Bitcoin investors have been insatiable. The fund is now nearing $100 billion in assets under management, making it the most profitable of all BlackRock ETFs. Loads of that capital comes from investors who had to wait a decade before the SEC greenlit a Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product. Now that it’s here, almost two years in, investors can’t get enough of it. And lately, conditions have been favouring even more exposure to crypto’s top asset. The “sustained high appetite” is driven by several factors, Butterfill told DL News. For one, the Fed is starting to cut interest rates — which tends to favour risky assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum — while the US government shutdown is forcing investors to find protection. “The ongoing U.S. government shutdown impasse shows no clear path to resolution,” said Butterfill. “This increasingly projects an image of ineffectiveness and raises questions about US creditworthiness.” Off the back of BlackRock’s voracious appetite and the confluence of macro factors came a new all-time high for Bitcoin. The crypto topped $126,000 on Monday for the first time. BlackRock’s $3.5 billion intake is nothing short of impressive. Notably, that figure represents more capital than the entire crypto venture capital funding for the first quarter of 2024 by a wide margin. Back then, VCs ploughed just over $2.2 billion into crypto startups, according to DefiLlama. With some of the recent developments in corporate Bitcoin adoption, there are plenty more bullish signs flashing. Take crypto treasuries. They’re the firms that buy and hold tokens to bolster their balance sheets, hoping to ride the coattails of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s historic price appreciation. Currently, the top 100 Bitcoin treasuries hold approximately 1 million Bitcoin, valued at around $127 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net. And that’s just Bitcoin. Ethereum treasuries have been even more aggressive than their Bitcoin counterparts, accumulating more than $25 billion in barely six months.

October 08, 2025 11:35 ET | Source: Primior Holdings Primior Holdings Irvine, California, Oct. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC:GRLT), a Southern California–based real estate development and investment firm, today announced progress on its tokenization strategy led by its flagship platform, Gaia, and confirmed that Gaia is set to begin beta testing on November 1, 2025. Interested participants can join the waitlist now for early access and to be the first notified at primior.com/gaia. Tokenization—the representation of real-world assets on a digital ledger—is emerging as one of the most transformative trends in global finance. While institutions such as BlackRock are advancing tokenization of public assets like stocks and bonds, Gaia is positioning itself to lead in tokenizing private markets—including private equity, private credit, and real estate. By lowering barriers to entry and enabling more flexible investment structures, Gaia is designed to change how capital is raised across private markets. Mission-Aligned GrowthGaia’s mission is democratizing real estate investing for all. With global real estate estimated to exceed $600 trillion, even a 1% market share represents a $6 trillion opportunity. Gaia aims to lead the tokenization of real estate by improving access, liquidity, and efficiency for investors and sponsors alike. Development Platform: GP-Led Execution Backed by USP & Institutions Alongside Gaia’s progress, Primior’s development platform continues to advance substantial projects where Primior acts as the General Partner (GP) and is fully responsible for end-to-end execution—from site acquisition and entitlements through design, capital stack structuring, construction, lease-up, and asset management. The company is currently developing more than $100M in projects, which are capitalized by USP and other institutional investors. USP (United States Property) is Primior Group’s flagship tokenized real estate fund. USP is a security token representing ownership in the fund; holding USP provides exposure to a diversified portfolio of U.S. real estate. The development pipeline managed by Primior as GP supplies high-quality opportunities that can be aggregated and managed within tokenized structures like USP, aligning tangible assets with modern digital ownership rails. (No offer of securities is being made by this release; see “No Offer or Solicitation” below.) Primior Holdings Inc. is part of the broader Primior Group, which includes private affiliates in asset management, property management, and investment banking. These divisions provide depth and expertise across real estate, fund management, and financial advisory, further strengthening the credibility and execution capacity behind Primior Holdings’ public-market initiatives. “Our strategy with Gaia is clear,” said Johnney Zhang, Chairman and CEO of Primior Holdings. “We believe tokenization will fundamentally change how private equity and real estate are financed. Gaia is built to lead that change, creating investment opportunities that are more inclusive, transparent, and scalable than traditional models.” Corporate Update: Reverse Split & Capital Structure After careful consideration and in response to shareholder feedback, Primior Holdings will cancel the previously announced reverse split. In addition, the company plans to retire the outstanding note and convert it into preferred equity rather than common equity. Primior will provide a further update once additional information is available. About Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC:GRLT) Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC:GRLT) is a real estate development and investment firm headquartered in Irvine, California. The company is advancing next-generation financial solutions through Gaia, its proprietary tokenization platform for private equity and real estate.

Title: Top Altcoins to Watch as XRP Liquidations Shake the Market

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A sudden 4,455% spike in $XRP’s hourly liquidation imbalance just wiped out $8.14M in bullish bets, and the market’s feeling it Coming right after $XRP briefly surpassed BlackRock in market cap, the drop shows just how fragile sentiment remains in Uptober’s volatile environment run. As risk-off sentiment spreads, some traders are already seeking the next breakout opportunities in top altcoins to buy, such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), Maxi Doge ($MAXI), and Aster ($ASTER). $XRP’s recent move was a complete wipeout. According to Coinglass data, long positions fueled the liquidation imbalance, with bulls losing nearly $25M in 24 hours, including a single hour that wiped out $8.14M. The price drop knocked $XRP out of the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap, with $BNB reclaiming the spot after its own surge to new all-time highs. Investors who once bet on $XRP’s momentum toward its ATH of $3.66 are now watching confidence fade fast. This sudden correction highlights how quickly leverage can backfire on traders in a thin market. While $XRP bulls recover from losses, rotation is already underway. The focus is shifting toward trending cryptocurrencies showing real momentum and early upside potential. As $BTC stays strong above $122K, traders are shifting into ecosystems that expand Bitcoin’s utility, and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is at the forefront. Bitcoin Hyper is a complete Layer 2 scaling solution powered by Solana’s Virtual Machine (SVM). In simple terms, it provides Bitcoin with what it’s always lacked – speed and low fees. That results in instant $BTC payments, DeFi applications, and even meme coins, all secured by Bitcoin’s main layer. Discover how to buy Bitcoin Hyper in our guide. Here’s how it works: you bridge your $BTC in, the system verifies it on-chain, then mints the same amount on Bitcoin Hyper’s network. Transactions run sub-second and near-zero cost before settling back to Bitcoin via zero-knowledge proofs. In a week where $XRP’s ‘utility’ narrative took a beating, $HYPER shows what real scalability looks like. Grab $HYPER before the next presale price jump. When blue-chip coins wobble, the best meme coins usually get their second wind, and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is ready to flex. The ultra-ripped cousin of Dogecoin, Maxi Doge channels the degen bull run mindset with muscle, memes, and market discipline. $MAXI celebrates pure grind culture by never skipping leg day or a 1000x play. The branding is absurd, but it resonates strongly with traders who prioritize conviction and community over charts. With Dogecoin ($DOGE) up 136% in the past year, meme season’s clearly not over. Future tie-ins with leverage and trading platforms hint at deeper utility ahead, giving $MAXI more potential than most meme coins at launch. As traders de-risk from volatile majors like $XRP, meme-driven liquidity is already shifting toward community-first plays. Maxi Doge isn’t just a meme; it’s a lifestyle token designed for traders who thrive in a fast-paced environment. Join the $MAXI movement and embrace the grind – the charts don’t lift themselves. Following the chaos of $XRP’s liquidation, traders are rethinking where they park their leverage, and many are pivoting to on-chain solutions. Aster ($ASTER) is emerging as that safe haven: a next-gen decentralized exchange offering MEV-free perpetuals and spot trading across Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, and Arbitrum. Aster also allows users to post yield-bearing assets, such as $asBNB or $USDF, as collateral, thereby boosting capital efficiency for professional traders. The numbers speak for themselves – a $3.47B market cap, $1.49B 24-hour volume, and a 43% volume-to-market capitalization ratio, signaling extremely high attention. Aster’s roadmap also hints at cross-market integration, connecting crypto and traditional assets through stock perpetuals and hidden orders. This hybrid approach will position $ASTER as a full trading stack built for speed, privacy, and institutional-grade liquidity. Built on Aster Chain and backed by YZi Labs, the DEX delivers transparent governance – exactly what shaken traders are craving post-$XRP crash. Unlike $XRP’s centralized token dynamics, Aster thrives on openness, efficiency, and community-driven design. Buy $ASTER on Binance today. This article does not constitute financial advice.

According to reports, Russian police have seized around 2,700 crypto mining equipment from a site in St. Petersburg after a months-long probe into unusually low meter readings. The haul included banks of machines, fans and other cooling gear, and the authorities say they also took away two transformers. Investigators say the operation started after energy inspectors noticed inconsistencies between recorded meter figures and actual power use. The site had been connected to the grid since March 2018. It ran, according to officials, until August 2025. Police say three unnamed St. Petersburg residents had originally signed a contract to connect a commercial property to the grid more than seven years ago. Officers released video of the raid on a ministry Telegram channel. The footage shows police forcing open locked containers and pushing a man to the floor as they searched the premises. In one container, rows of active machines could be seen, with fans running and cooling systems in place. Other rooms held hundreds more rigs. Based on reports from the Interior Ministry, investigators believe the suspects used technical knowledge of the power grid to alter meter readings so the utility would show much lower consumption than was actually used. The suspects behind the illegal crypto mining rig operation were placed in custody and charged with causing “property damage by deception or abuse of trust,” prosecutors said. The ministry has not released an estimate of how much electricity was taken or the financial value of the theft. Officials also did not say which digital coins were being mined at the site. Police added they are still looking for possible accomplices linked to the operation. This seizure follows similar discoveries across Russia and territories under Moscow’s control. In mid-September, authorities uncovered an illegal cluster in what Moscow calls the Donetsk People’s Republic where operators had connected 25 rigs directly to the grid, bypassing meters. Officials reported damage estimated at 14 million rubles ($170,633) for that network. In other areas, hidden setups have appeared underground or inside trucks and vans. Regions mentioned by officials include Dagestan, parts of the North Caucasus and Southern Siberia — places where cheap or poorly monitored power has sometimes attracted clandestine miners.

The murder of a man whose body was found months after he went missing had its origins in an assault and robbery he and another person committed, a jury has heard. Donal O’Sullivan SC, prosecuting, told jurors they will hear evidence how Mr Quilligan and another man had assaulted and robbed Niall Long off York Street in Cork city on September 1st, 2023. “This apparently was the instigating factor to what happened later,” Mr O’Sullivan told the Central Criminal Court sitting in Cork. Mr Long (33), of St Michael’s Close, Mahon, Cork, and Luke Taylor (27), formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, deny the murder of Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1st, 2023, and January 29th last year. Mr O’Sullivan said the jury would hear Mr Quilligan (47) was a drug user and dealer and that Mr Long was a drug user and may also have been dealing drugs. After being assaulted on September 1st, Mr Long could be seen on CCTV around Cork city, while Mr Taylor could be seen on CCTV with Mr Quilligan some time before 9pm leaving Mr Quilligan’s flat in the Simon Community complex on Anderson’s Quay. Mr O’Sullivan said Mr Quilligan and Mr Taylor went up St Finbarr’s Place lane. Two people in a nearby house heard a “violent altercation” and called the guards, he said. He said a white Toyota Rav registered to Mr Long’s mother was reversed into the top of St Finbarr’s Place with the boot facing the lane. Neither Mr Quilligan nor Mr Taylor were seen on CCTV at the top of the lane before the car left the area. “Kieran Quilligan is never seen alive again,” Mr O’Sullivan said, saying gardaí tracked the vehicle to a farm at Little Island and then back to the city, where Mr Taylor is dropped off. Mr O’Sullivan said gardaí later became concerned about an area at Whitewell, Rostellan. With a cadaver dog, gardaí searched the area on January 29th last year and found skeletal remains in a gravel bag. Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margot Bolster established Mr Quilligan suffered bone injuries, but she could not determine a cause of death. Mr O’Sullivan said: “The man was beaten badly. A weapon in the nature of a hammer was used. He met in his end in a violent manner after a lot of bony injuries.” He told the jury of 10 men and two women how gardaí had months earlier searched Mr Long’s home and a vehicle and they had discovered a bucket with cleaning products found to contain blood matching Mr Quilligan’s. “I don’t have direct evidence. I don’t have witnesses saying, ‘I saw Luke Taylor and Niall Long beat him to death’. I don’t have that. The case is for the most part circumstantial: a man goes missing on September 1st, found on January 29th. Most likely he died on September 1st,” he said. The trial continues.

Title: Russell 2000 May Be the Hidden Compass for Ethereum’s Next Big Move | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee because markets are moving in strange harmony again. From small-cap stocks to Ethereum (ETH), patterns once thought unrelated are beginning to sync. While some call it a coincidence, others see a deeper signal about where risk capital is heading next as rate cuts loom. A striking correlation is emerging between the Russell 2000 and Ethereum, two very different risk assets that now appear to be moving in lockstep. Analysts at Milk Road highlighted the relationship, noting that both are hypersensitive to interest rate cuts and liquidity cycles. With markets pricing in four consecutive rate cuts through year-end, Milk Road says, “expect both of them to move up in tandem.” “This correlation is almost spooky. The Russell 2000 (small-cap equities) and ETH are basically moving in sync. Both are highly sensitive to interest rates. With 4+ consecutive cuts on the horizon… Expect both of them to move up in tandem,” they wrote. The pattern has been building since April, when the Russell 2000, an index tracking US small-cap stocks, began outperforming the broader market. It has gained over 42% since bottoming on April 7, outpacing the S&P 500’s 36% rise. The surge has coincided with renewed speculation, reported in a recent US Crypto News publication, that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting rates following its 25bps move on September 17. Traders assign over a 94.6% probability to another cut by late October. The parallel with Ethereum makes sense to macro traders as both assets thrive in risk-on environments fueled by cheaper capital. On the one hand, small-cap companies benefit directly from lower borrowing costs. On the other hand, Ethereum tends to attract liquidity inflows as investors rotate into growth and innovation-oriented risk assets during easing cycles. The Russell 2000’s tech sector hitting an all-time high is a milestone that some analysts like see as an early proxy for crypto market momentum. “Russell 2000 vs ETH Price. This is a fascinating combination of TradFi and crypto. Just as ETH acts as an index for Altcoins (smaller cryptocurrencies), the Russell 2000 represents small-cap stocks in traditional markets. It’s a correlation most traders overlook, yet it can reveal valuable insights about market risk cycles and investor appetite,” wrote analyst Joao Wedson, CEO and founder of Alphractal. However, not everyone is convinced that the small-cap rally or Ethereum’s correlation signals sustainable growth. Investor Oguz argues that small caps are dying, pointing to a decades-long trend of mega-cap dominance in digital and mobile-driven economies. “The internet and mobile have created winner-takes-all markets…Companies like Meta and Spotify become so large and profitable that they can leapfrog competitors across industries. This trend won’t reverse anytime soon. Long mega-caps,” he said. That view frames the concern that if the small-cap rally proves temporary, Ethereum could face similar cyclical headwinds as a proxy for decentralized innovation. Both ecosystems rely on broad-based risk appetite, not concentrated capital flows into giants like Apple or BlackRock. Still, near-term momentum remains undeniable. The Russell 2000’s five biggest holdings, including IonQ, Bloom Energy, and Kratos Defense, have rallied an average of 90% since August, despite many lacking consistent profitability. This surge, fueled by rate expectations and risk tolerance, mirrors Ethereum’s rally patterns during liquidity expansions. Perhaps the key distinction lies in structural utility. Unlike small caps, Ethereum is growing into a settlement layer for decentralized finance, tokenized assets, and smart contracts. This positions it for longer-term relevance even as small-cap equities fluctuate. Whether this correlation holds or diverges, both markets point to a restored risk appetite, with liquidity steering the narrative.

Title: Body of Kieran Quilligan found on Cork scrubland had injuries from hammer-like weapon, murder trial hears

Kieran Quilligan THE badly skeletonised body of a man was discovered in scrubland by Gardaí using a cadaver dog almost five months after he vanished with indications he had been subjected to a violent assault with a hammer-like weapon. Two men have denied the murder of Kieran Quilligan (47) whose skeletal remains were discovered in a one-tonne gravel bag in scrubland just off the Midleton-Rostellan road in east Cork in January 2024. Niall Long (33) and Luke Taylor (27) appeared before the Central Criminal Court, sitting in Cork, charged with the murder of Mr Quilligan. Both are charged with the murder of Mr Quilligan on a date unknown between September 1, 2023 and January 29, 2024 contrary to Common Law at an unknown location within the State. The two men entered not guilty pleas when arraigned before Ms Justice Siobhan Lankford and a jury of 10 men and two women. Long is formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon, Cork Taylor is of no fixed abode and previously of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork. Ms Justice Lankford was told by Donal O'Sullivan SC, for the State, that the case is expected to last between three and four weeks. In opening the case, Mr O'Sullivan said the jury would effectively be dealing with two trials as the State will argue the two defendants were involved in a joint enterprise or common design. Mr O'Sullivan outlined the prosecution case but stressed that what he was saying was not evidence but merely what the State would argue. He said Mr Quilligan was a drug user and had availed of the services of Cork Simon. In September 2023, he was living in an apartment near Cork Simon Shelter with his partner. Mr O'Sullivan said the prosecution will argue that on the morning of September 1 2023, Mr Quilligan and another man, John Paul 'Bubbles' Thornton, went to a lane off York Street in Cork city centre. "They had an incident with Niall Long on the side street...they robbed him and assaulted him." Mr Quilligan then returned to his apartment. Mr O'Sullivan said that Mr Long was caught on CCTV security cameras moving around Cork city centre, going close to where Mr Quilligan lived. "It appears this is the instigation...for what occurs later." Mr O'Sullivan said that Mr Quilligan was later in company at his flat with Luke Taylor who was known to both the deceased and the other defendant. Both Mr Quilligan and Mr Taylor left the flat after 8pm and walked across Cork city centre to Proby's Quay near St Fin Barre's Cathedral. The movements of both are caught on CCTV security cameras. Both men walked off Proby's Quay and up a side street called St Finbarr's Place. However, CCTV footage never shows Mr Quilligan leaving the laneway. Mr O'Sullivan said cameras captured the movements of a white Toyota Rav4 car - which belonged to Mr Long's mother - driving from Mahon towards St Finbarr's Place. "The car reverses into the lane so the boot stays down the lane," Mr O'Sullivan added. "Two people living in a house hear a violent altercation and call the Gardaí. "After that, Kieran Quilligan is never seen alive again." Mr Quilligan was reported missing on September 4 by his partner and, after initially treating the matter as a missing person case, Gardaí became very concerned for Mr Quilligan's welfare. Gardaí conducted a trawl of CCTV security camera footage across Cork city and county. The white Toyota Rav4 is tracked driving to east Cork and then back to Cork city where Luke Taylor is dropped off at Jacob's Island near Mahon. Mr O'Sullivan said Gardaí ordered a search of an area off the roadway between Midleton and Rostellan on January 29 2024. Gardaí were assisted with their search by the deployment of a cadaver dog from Northern Ireland. The dog showed significant interest in an area well off the roadway by scrubland. Gardaí located a one-tonne gravel bag. Underneath it was a second bag which was found to contain skeletonised human remains. Both gravel bags appeared to have been taken from a local farmyard. "It was later identified Kieran Quilligan," he said. The remains were virtually skeletonised with little soft tissue remaining. No precise cause of death could be established after a post mortem by Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margaret Bolster at Cork University Hospital (CUH). However, Mr O'Sullivan said that Dr Bolster noted multiple injuries to Mr Quilligan's bones. "The man was badly beaten. A weapon appears to have been used in the nature of a hammer. "He met his death in a violent manner." Mr O'Sullivan said a search was ordered of Mr Long's home. In the course of that search, Garda seized a car as well as a bucket with cleaning products. "Blood was found. It was matched to Kieran Quilligan." Mr O'Sullivan said the prosecution case does not involve any direct evidence of what happened to Mr Quilligan but will revolve around circumstantial evidence. The trial will feature up to 126 witnesses and will also involve a substantial amount of CCTV security camera footage. Mr Long is represented by Ray Boland SC while Mr Taylor is represented by Brendan Grehan SC. The trial continues. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

KAIO, the tokenization firm backed by Brevan Howard and Nomura Bank's crypto-focused Laser Digital, is bringing its tokenized funds to the Sei network (SEI) as real-world asset demand is expanding. The firm, formerly known as Libre Capital, has issued over $200 million in assets, including token versions of feeder funds of Brevan Howard, Hamilton Lane, Laser Digital and a BlackRock funds, with plans to expand access to additional strategies. The tokens, available to institutional and accredited investors, allow for onchain subscription, redemption and reporting. The Sei Network, built for high-speed financial transactions, provides the underlying rails for execution. KAIO's expansion follows ARK-backed tokenization firm Securitize introducing the $112 million Apollo Diversified Credit Fund, a tokenized feeder fund of Apollo's private credit vehicle, to Sei. The announcement highlights a growing trend in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), where traditional investments like bonds, credit and funds are represented as digital tokens. The process promises faster settlements, around-the-clock trading and potential to integrate with smart contracts and plug into decentralized finance (DeFi). Industry estimates project the total addressable market for tokenized RWAs in the trillions of dollars. With KAIO's integration with Sei, starting with tokens representing shares in the BlackRock ICS US Dollar Liquidity Fund and Brevan Howard Master Fund, will let investors use tokens within DeFi applications as collateral, liquidity reserves or yield-bearing assets, offering more flexibility in how institutional capital moves onchain. Justin Barlow, executive director of the Sei Development Foundation, framed Kaio's expansion as a key milestone for Sei toward its ambition to "become the institutional settlement layer for all digital assets." "By using the Sei Network, we’re bringing composable access to leading fund strategies entirely onchain," Olivier Dang, COO of KAIO, said in a statement. "It’s the foundation for real-time, programmable, financial infrastructure built for the next era of capital markets."

Title: Crypto ETFs seen to double by year-end as Bitcoin heads for $148,500

About us Copy link Crypto is heading into 2026 with a perfect mix of regulatory green lights, supportive monetary policies, and surging institutional demand. That’s according to a new CF Benchmarks report seen by DL News, which predicts that Bitcoin will jump 20% to $148,500 by year-end. It also forecasts that exchange-traded funds will double in number to 80, and stablecoins are on track to reach $500 billion in circulation. The report says digital assets are moving into a “maturity phase” where price discovery comes from strategic allocation decisions and not speculation or hype like in previous years. The prediction comes as the overall market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies hovers around $4.3 trillion, according to CoinGecko. Meanwhile, the circulating value of stablecoins has smashed $300 billion, DefiLlama data shows. Several factors have contributed to the surge. Chief among them? Macroeconomic uncertainties over global trade caused by US President Donald Trump’s policies, his questioning of the Federal Reserve’s independence, fiscal policies, and the government shutdown. These factors have amounted to what analysts refer to as “the debasement trade,” which has seen investors scramble to hoover up safe haven assets like gold and Bitcoin. Trump has also fuelled the rally by backing blockchain-based businesses. Since his second term began, he has backed several pro-industry policies, signed a stablecoin bill into law, and appointed crypto supporters to key positions in government. CF Benchmarks, which is owned by crypto exchange Kraken and powers indexes used by major ETF issuers including BlackRock and Fidelity, is not alone in its bullishness. Laurent Benayoun, CEO of crypto market making firm Acheron Trading, told DL News that “ETFs net inflows exert institutional buying pressure, and associated direct positive price action, on their underlying spot assets.” “Continued support from the US administration and interest rate cuts will lead to further adoption and growth,” Benayoun said. After years of uncertainty, the US policy landscape has flipped. The Genius Act, signed in July, established a federal framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, sparking $30 billion in inflows and sending total stablecoin assets toward $350 billion by year-end. CF Benchmarks expects that figure to reach $500 billion in 2026, as Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal integrate regulated stablecoins into global payment networks. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs continue to attract capital. The CME derivatives exchange is also adding new Solana and XRP futures options, expanding institutional exposure to emerging tokens. The report likens this regulatory moment to the “Swensen era” of ETFs in the 2000s, when new listing rules triggered an exponential rise in adoption. The Fed’s first rate cuts in nine months, combined with signals of further easing into 2026, create a supportive backdrop for risk assets. CF Benchmarks expects two additional cuts this year, bringing policy rates near 3.25%. Despite lingering inflation risks, the firm argues that Bitcoin remains at the lower bound of its fair-value range, currently between $85,000 and $212,000, offering a tactical entry point for investors positioning for debasement hedges. The report also points to tokenised equities and real-world assets as the next frontier. With over $40 billion in tokenised assets already issued, CF Benchmarks expects that figure to double in 12 months, with Solana-based xStocks leading early adoption. “Digital assets are no longer a side bet,” the report said.

Title: 10% of Ethereum now locked in ETFs and treasuries – does ETH supply squeeze follow?

Institutional Ethereum appetite remains strong amid volatility, with ETFs managing over $30 billion worth of the digital asset. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Institutional demand for Ethereum has climbed to new highs during this market cycle. According to Strategic ETH Reserve data, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) now control more than 12.5 million ETH, or roughly 10% of the token’s circulating supply. This marks a dramatic expansion from April, when these institutions collectively held about 4 million ETH, representing less than 3% of the total supply. The rise reflects how institutional capital has increasingly turned to Ethereum exposure through regulated ETFs and on-chain treasury allocation amid the growth of the network fundamentals in tokenized assets and stablecoins. According to Token Terminal data, decentralized applications on Ethereum are hosting more than $365 billion in user assets, while the network’s native token trades at a 1.45x multiple of its ecosystem TVL. Data from Strategic ETH Reserve shows that spot Ethereum ETFs currently hold 6.92 million ETH, valued at about $30.76 billion based on an ETH price of $4,448 at press time. The assets are distributed across nine products from eight issuers. BlackRock leads by a wide margin, managing over 4 million ETH worth $17.6 billion, more than half of all ETF-held Ethereum. Grayscale follows with approximately 1.8 million ETH split between its ETHE and ETH trusts. Fidelity ranks third with around 778,200 ETH, while Bitwise holds roughly 151,600 ETH. Other issuers, including VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Invesco Galaxy, and 21Shares, each hold under 100,000 ETH. The strong accumulation trend aligns with surging investor interest in regulated Ethereum exposure. According to SosoValue data, cumulative net inflows into Ethereum ETFs have surpassed $15 billion since launch, signaling that institutional appetite remains robust despite market volatility. Meanwhile, Ethereum-focused Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) collectively hold 5.66 million ETH, equivalent to 4.68% of the circulating supply and valued at $25.19 billion. This figure highlights Ethereum’s growing prominence as a corporate treasury asset, second only to Bitcoin in institutional accumulation. July and August marked the peak of these treasury expansion moves, as several firms joined the acquisition wave. Although momentum has since cooled, leading holders continue to expand their stakes. BitMine Immersion Tech tops the list with 2.83 million ETH, worth about $12.59 billion, representing 2.34% of the digital asset supply. The firm aims to eventually control 5% of total ETH, which it views as strategic preparation for broader network adoption. However, the ETH treasury play has drawn criticism from industry experts who argue that South Korean retail money is now propping up some of these companies. Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow claimed that these retail traders have about $6 billion in chasing the next “Strategy play.” Nonetheless, asset management firm VanEck has argued that the strong wave of institutional adoption shows that ETH is a stronger contender to Bitcoin in the race for dominance as a store of value.
