Title: Tennessee Attorney General settles ESG dispute with BlackRock

By Niket Nishant and Ross Kerber (Reuters) -Asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) agreed to new disclosure requirements about its use of sustainable-investment factors as part of a legal settlement with Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, his office said on Friday. The resolution is the latest step by New York-based BlackRock and by other firms to move away from environmental, social or governance measures. An anti-ESG backlash has gathered force among Skrmetti and other Republican politicians including incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Skrmetti sued BlackRock late in 2023, alleging it did not adequately disclose its use of ESG factors and that it overstated their financial benefits. Although BlackRock did not admit to wrongdoing or pay fines as part of the deal, Skrmetti told Reuters in an interview that the agreement was significant as a mark of the times. "BlackRock was at the heart of this, the biggest asset manager in the world, and their willingness to undertake this settlement speaks to the end of the ESG moment," he said. The company's steps like quitting an investor climate group on Jan. 9 "certainly helped solidify" the agreement, he said. BlackRock, with some $11.6 trillion under management, said it was pleased to resolve the dispute with Tennessee. "BlackRock has consistently acted in the best interests of our clients, and we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that fact through even greater transparency about our practices," the company said in a statement sent by a representative. Among other things, BlackRock agreed to disclosure requirements such as giving quarterly, not annual, details about votes it cast, and to provide a rationale when its non-ESG funds cast proxy votes against management recommendations on environmental or social matters. BlackRock already provides many such details on its website. Skrmetti said the formalization of the disclosures creates a "comprehensive compliance regime" and that the lack of financial penalties helped speed the deal. ESG investing enjoyed a run as a hot area of finance but investors pulled back in recent years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine surged energy prices and hurt the relative performance of technology-heavy ESG funds that often avoid fossil fuel stocks. Meanwhile Republicans, often from energy-producing states, have increased pressure on BlackRock and rivals like Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) over the issue. Fink said in 2023 that he had stopped using the term ESG as it had become too politicized.

Title: Vanguard fined more than $100 million by SEC over violations involving target date retirement funds

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Asset management giant Vanguard has been fined more than $100 million to settle charges related to disclosures around target date investment funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday. The alleged violations stem from a 2020 change where Vanguard lowered the minimum investment requirement for its institutional target date funds. The SEC order found that the change spurred redemptions as Vanguard customers moved from other target date funds into the institutional versions, creating taxable distributions for some of the remaining shareholders. The SEC said Vanguard failed to properly disclose the potential impact of the investment threshold changes on distributions. “The order finds that, as a result, retail investors of the Investor TRFs who did not switch and continued to hold their fund shares in taxable accounts faced historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments,” the SEC said in a press release. The fine of $106.41 million will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Vanguard agreed to the fine without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. Vanguard is one of the world’s largest asset managers, reporting more than $10 trillion of global assets as of last November. The firm was founded by Jack Bogle in the 1970s and has a reputation as a low-cost, investor friendly firm. “Vanguard is committed to supporting the more than 50 million everyday investors and retirement savers who entrust us with their savings. We’re pleased to have reached this settlement and look forward to continuing to serve our investors with world-class investment options,” Vanguard said in a statement. Target date funds are a popular retirement vehicle designed to slowly shift from a growth-oriented portfolio to a conservative portfolio as the listed year approaches. Typically, this is done by replacing riskier stocks with higher exposure to income-generating bonds as the retirement date nears. The fine highlights how investors can see large tax bills even when they themselves do not make any asset sales during a calendar year. When Vanguard dropped the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds to $5 million from $100 million in December 2020, it spurred retirement plan investors to cash out of the investor share class of these funds and swap into the institutional version, according to the SEC. Vanguard then had to sell the underlying assets in the investor share class of the funds to meet the redemptions from departing investors, the SEC found. As a result, shareholders who stayed in the investor share class were subject to a large capital gains distribution — and a tax liability if they held the fund in a taxable brokerage account, according to the order. Normally, target date funds remain in tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts — which would avoid a tax hit from a large capital gains distribution. The SEC’s order said Vanguard’s investor-series target funds saw $130 billion in redemptions from December 2020 to October 2021, up from $41 billion in the same period a year prior. Vanguard later merged the two series of funds together, which the SEC order said the company refrained from doing originally in part to preserve fee revenue. The fine announced Friday is in addition to the $40 million Vanguard had agreed to pay to investors as part of a class action suit. The timing of the target date fund changes is similar to another recent Vanguard legal run-in. In 2023, Vanguard was fined $800,000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority related to problems with account statements for money market funds in 2019 and 2020. The alleged violations took place under former CEO Tim Buckley. The current CEO, Salim Ramji, joined Vanguard from BlackRock in 2024. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: T Stamp Inc. (IDAI): AI Identity Verification Under $2 Billion Market Cap

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap. In this article, we are going to take a look at where T Stamp Inc. (NASDAQ:IDAI) stands against other AI companies under $2 billion market cap. It’s clear that AI holds immense promise but it comes with significant risks. Some of the concerns that the market has include overreliance on a few key players, shifts in demand toward smaller competitors, and the broader impact of AI-driven market trends on earnings and valuations. While AI offers opportunities, managing risks such as customer concentration, economic headwinds, and market volatility will be crucial for its sustainable growth and integration. On CNBC ‘Fast Money,’ a discussion between traders highlighted concerns about elevated expectations for AI, especially in the chip market, with NVDA as a prime example. Past patterns in the semiconductor giant’s stock suggest potential declines, with customer concentration being a significant risk. Some believe demand for high-end chips could shift to smaller semiconductor companies. They also discussed that broader market performance might improve as other sectors gain traction, especially during earnings season, which is expected to influence investor sentiment more than AI and GLP-1 trends. They mentioned that the key risks for earnings include the strong U.S. dollar, rising rates, and policy uncertainties, which may impact large-cap companies. While recent PPI data offered some relief, the bond market remains firm, with 10-year yields approaching 5%. Expectations for CPI and PCE figures are mixed, with potential reacceleration seen as a headwind for markets in a higher rate environment. Earnings and economic data were considered critical factors to watch by the traders. For this article, we scoured our database as well as several ETFs and media reports to find all possible AI stocks under $2 billion. We then listed the stocks in ascending order of their market cap. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:IDAI) specializes in identity authentication solutions for government, enterprise, and peer-to-peer markets globally. The company uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, biometrics, cryptography, and data mining to detect and prevent identity fraud, safeguard sensitive data, and improve digital service accessibility. Its technology combines Irreversibly Transformed Identity Token and various biometric or identifying data sources. On January 6, T Stamp (NASDAQ:IDAI) announced a strategic partnership with Qenta Inc. As part of the agreement, Qenta is spinning off its Goldstar KYC technology into a new subsidiary, QID Technologies LLC, with Trust Stamp holding a 10% stake in the new entity. Trust Stamp has also granted QID a non-exclusive license for its AI-powered identity technologies in exchange for a $1 million license fee, payable in three installments over Q1 2025. Additionally, QID will contract with Trust Stamp for business and product development services related to identity and privacy solutions, with monthly service fees starting January 1, 2025, capped at $3.6 million annually. As a 10% shareholder in QID, Trust Stamp expects to receive a net cash inflow of $3.3 million from the projected $3.6 million in billed revenue. Overall, IDAI ranks 58th on our list of AI companies under $2 billion market cap. While we acknowledge the potential of IDAI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Spread the infestation! Ethereal Oracle Dev Comment: Ethereal Oracle has been one of the strongest and most ubiquitous cards in the meta since the launch of The Great Dark Beyond. In hindsight, this is a card we probably should have addressed in the last balance patch. Unfortunately, the timing of that patch wasn't ideal because we try to avoid high-impact changes heading into an extended winter break where we wouldn't be able to react to unforeseen problems that might arise. Instead, we're adding the change into this major patch because we're already expecting a meta shakeup with the mini-set, and we have our usual built-in balance window a few weeks from now for any necessary follow-up adjustments. Disenchantable versions of Ethereal Oracle will be eligible for full dust refunds for two weeks after this change goes live with Patch 31.4. Choose your faction and fight for glory! From January 21 - February 11 , pick one of three Event Tracks to complete for 13 packs (5 Perils in Paradise packs and 8 The Great Dark Beyond packs) and a faction-specific Hero Skin. Which campaign will you join? Event Hero skins not earned through the event will be available in the in-game Shop after the event ends. When Patch 31.4 launches, all current Arena runs will end and a new Arena season will begin. The Arena pool will be adjusted so that the following sets make up the card pool this season: Additionally, a new Arena-only card will be added to the card pool to help you probe the depths of the meta: Loaner decks for new and returning players* are getting updated with the launch of Patch 31.4.

Returning players can claim these returning decks each time they are eligible. New players are eligible for their free deck after completing the tutorial and Apprentice Track. On February 4 , the Wonders XL format will end and the Wonderful Un'Goro format will begin. Wonderful Un'Goro is back to a 30-card format using the Wonders format, but with Journey to Un'Goro added. The following sets will make up the format: The Wonderful Un'Goro format will end with the February season and then Twist will be on hiatus. We will have more information about future Twist seasons in a future update. WTB an update for BG's instead of this BS we currently have. Honestly, might as well throw Wayward Probe into the main game too because why not. have they showed the Grunty card yet Believe it’s tomorrow at 9am EST I love how Twist is seemingly being shelved just as quickly as it was introduced. "Here's a repeat season followed by another hiatus. We'll update you all later." Just admit you killed Duels for no reason and your replacement failed because of no actual effort. The season with the prebuilt decks for Legendaries was so fun but we haven't seen anything like it since. But hey, at least we have 1 game board a year now and 2 ultra premium Ragnaros skins. Yeah I think with their current staffing level, it’s taking all of Hearthstones workforce to keep standard/battlegrounds/arena running. solo adventures, twist, duels, mercenaries, and game boards are all getting shelved. There are a lot of new skins and pack bundles in the shops, which is likely because blizzard is forcing the team to focus on content that instantly generates money. I don’t blame the devs, because they’re underpaid engineers who also play the game and try their best, but I hope the upper echelons of blizzard make sure to prioritize gameplay a bit more often I feel that there was a bunch of better changes you could do to Ethereal Oracle rather than increasing the Cost. Because the design philosophy of most nerf feels to be "Maybe they would play it less" instead of "Let's make the card more balanced" You want to play your cards, every Priest plays Creation Protocol because why wouldn't you, but the card is perfectly fair. I don't really know in what deck the card was problematic cause I don't play standard. But recently I only saw it on Meteor Shaman, and if that deck was the problem you could say "Draw 2 spells that started in your deck" or remove the Spell Damage, or even give it Spell Damage -1 , Why not after 10 years I think we are ready for a change like that, but only increasing the Mana is like meh. The decks when the card was fundamental are going to still being playing the card and the decks when the card wasn't that relevant are going to cut it off. The decks when the card was fundamental are going to still being playing the card and the decks when the card wasn't that relevant are going to cut it off. But... that was exactly the problem with the card - it was too efficient, so a lot of decks used it. You didn't even have to plan to use the spell damage. The goal is to make it a bigger investment so that decks that don't need it stop using it by default - expanding deck diversity in the meta, so the decks that want Ethereal Oracle look more different from every other deck. Fundamentally, I just read this statement and hear you saying "I think the nerf will work". I mean, the card is nerfed, that's not debatable. What I mean with that statement is that you are hurting more the decks where that card was just fine, than the decks when the card was problematic. And is a clear case when the just pay for the sinners. For example (this was reverted but works for the point) At some point Saronite Chain Gang was nerfed to "Summon another Saronite Chain Gang" because back on the day the interaction that it had with Shudderwock was problematic. But that actually damaged all the other decks when you wanted to use Saronite Chain Gang as a handbuff card. So instead of make an smart change that fix the issue without removing the utility that it had for other decks. As simple as said "Battlecry: Summon another Saronite Chain Gang with stats equal to this minion's", they just removed that. So yeah, it fixed the Shudderwock problem, but all the other decks that cared for the card for a different reason also lost a card unjustifiably. So yeah, the card is going to see less play, but is going to see less play in the decks where it was less problematic At 4-Mana, if I don't care about the Spell Damage that much, I might just play Carry-On Grub which has better stats and an effect that you can play on curve without worry about anything, and without needing external cards to trigger it. A shame that they are not adding Wayward Probe to constructed too, since this is the last time any Starship support will ever be printed. A card like that would have been a fun addition to the Starship mechanic and what I would have expected to see in a miniset. I would probably bought a Overmind mythic skin. Damn shame it's Kerrigan. "Awaken my child and embrace the glory that is your birthright. Know that I am the Overmind the eternal will of the Swarm and that you have been created to serve me." Expected some more changes after such a long time lol And 1 aena-specific card? Weird Usually when you have such a meta warping card nerfed the meta changes quite a bit. This card will slow down a lot of the decks that use it. Cards that seem very strong now may not be in a week, plus with a mini set coming out they’ll probably have a bigger one in a few weeks and rotation is soon so they’ll likely buff a few cards before they rotate.

Mason Hawkins is a prominent figure in the world of value investing, best known as the founder and chairman of Southeastern Asset Management, an investment firm established in 1975. The firm began with a modest pool of assets but grew to manage approximately $20 billion within a few years. With decades of experience and a reputation for disciplined investment strategies, Hawkins has earned widespread respect among investors and financial professionals for his long-term approach to wealth creation. His firm specializes in managing concentrated portfolios based on in-depth research, fundamental analysis, and a value-oriented philosophy. Hawkins believes that patience and a contrarian mindset are critical to success, often holding onto investments for years to allow their true value to emerge.

This disciplined approach has helped Southeastern Asset Management weather multiple market cycles, including challenging periods like the dot-com bubble and the 2008 financial crisis.

Title: Legend Biotech Corporation (LEGN): The Biotech Stock with Biggest Upside Potential

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Biotech Stocks with the Biggest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN) stands against other biotech stocks with the biggest upside potential. While 2024 was a “challenging” year for biotech stocks, JPMorgan is of the view that some names in the industry may be poised for considerable upside in the coming months. On November 28, Johan Hueffer, senior partner and principal of investments at Novo Holdings, appeared on CNBC to discuss his macro perspective on investments in life sciences. He said that biotechs faced difficulty raising capital in the last couple of years. However, that trend has started to improve in the last quarter or two. Still, there have been impacts on companies that particularly service the pharmaceutical industry, such as contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), and companies that provide tools for research and development. Similar trends have been observed for companies that manufacture tools for production in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. While these sectors have had ups and downs in the past two years, the trends are starting to normalize now. Hueffer was of the view that the industry is now showing considerable opportunity. Similarly, Goldman Sachs shed light on biotech as an often overlooked sector in the investing space. In a note to clients, John Flood, Goldman’s Head of Americas Equities Sales Trading, said that biotech stocks posed an under-the-radar opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the Fed’s recent rate cuts. Changes in interest rates uniquely affect biotech stocks as they are sensitive to them and often rely on projected future profits. These stocks are also heavily impacted by the cost of capital. Although there is little to no current profitability, these stocks have significant upside potential and pose an “option-like structure” if clinical trials succeed. This makes them especially responsive to changes and movements in interest rates. Since September, the Fed cut a full point off the funds rate. According to CNBC, the current market pricing is showing just one or two more moves lower in 2025. On January 8, CNBC reported that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members voted to reduce the central bank’s benchmark borrowing rate to the 4.25%-4.5% target range. However, they also slashed their outlook for expected rate cuts for 2025, bringing it down to two from four and assuming quarter-point increments. These changes are expected to affect biotech stocks. Flood’s note also highlighted that the biotech industry has recently shown improved fundamentals, attributed to a more favorable regulatory environment and positive clinical outcomes. Despite these tailwinds, Goldman’s data reflects that biotechnology remains under-owned by hedge funds. The sector ranked in the 13th percentile in hedge fund long/short positioning over the past year. Furthermore, it ranked in the 4th percentile over the past five years. We used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of 40 biotech stocks. We then selected the top 12 stocks with the highest analyst upside potential as of January 15, 2025. We have also included the market capitalization of the stocks as of the same date. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds, as of fiscal Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small cap and large cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laboratory with workers in masks and lab coats focused on analyzing cell therapies. Analyst Upside: 161.86% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31 Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN) is a clinical-stage company that develops, discovers, manufactures, and commercializes novel therapies for oncology and other indications. It develops advanced cell therapies across an elaborate range of technology platforms. The company operates in the US, China, and other geographical segments. It experienced solid sales growth for CARVYKTI® in fiscal Q3 2024. CARVYKTI treats multiple myeloma and is the first and only cell therapy that is clinically shown to significantly increase the overall survival in multiple myeloma patients. The company also increased its commercial capacity for the drug, delivering it to patients across the globe. It accounted for net trade sales of around $286 million in fiscal Q3 2024, reflecting operational growth of 87.6% year-over-year and 53.2% quarter-over-quarter. Due to the drug’s transformational nature, Legend Biotech Corp. (NASDAQ:LEGN) recently initiated commercial production at its facility in Belgium to fulfill the demand for CARVYKTI worldwide. It plans to expand its capacity further while simultaneously advancing its R&D programs as part of its long-term strategy to be a leader in cell therapy innovation. TimesSquare Capital U.S. Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: “We began buying shares in Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN), a biotechnology developer of cell therapies to treat blood cancers such as multiple myeloma and leukemia. The European Union approved the use of Legend’s Carvykti treatment of multiple myeloma and later the FDA followed suit. Some investors may have been concerned about possible delays as Legend ramps up production, and its price declined. Though with a long-standing agreement with Johnson & Johnson and a new partnership with Novartis, we see a long runway of growth ahead, so we initiated a position.” Overall, LEGN ranks 2nd on our list of the 12 biotech stocks with the biggest upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of biotech stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/17/2025 7:50:29 AM PST by karpov As the smoke clears from devastating Los Angeles wildfires, efforts to clean up the affected areas are being complicated by burnt-out electric and hybrid vehicles and home-battery storage systems. Lithium batteries from Tesla Inc., along with those from other carmakers, have added to the mix of toxic materials requiring specialized removal in the wake of the fires, delaying the fire victims’ return to their properties. “A lot of the cars in the evacuation area were lithium batteries,” said Jacqui Irwin, a state assembly member representing the Pacific Palisades, one of the neighborhoods hardest hit by the fires. “We’ve heard from firefighters that those lithium batteries burned fires near homes — like those with power walls — for much longer.” The L.A. wildfires, which began Jan. 7, have taken at least 27 lives and destroyed thousands of homes. While the dry, dangerous winds are forecast to end — a lack of rain and another possible round of winds next week has kept officials concerned that the danger is not over. Estimates for insurance losses from the fires have rapidly jumped to as high as $40 billion and BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink has warned it could take a decade to rebuild the city. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has already allocated $100 million to the cleanup effort. There were over 431,000 Teslas in operation in the Los Angeles area as of October 2024, according to data from S&P Global Mobility. Based on new registrations, their market share locally was three times that of the rest of the nation. The Tesla Model Y was the biggest-selling vehicle in the state through September, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.

Yes and no. The special blankets don't put the fire out, just cover the EV's while they keep burning. It's to prevent other things around the EV from catching fire.

Yes and no. The special blankets don't put the fire out, just cover the EV's while they keep burning. It's to prevent other things around the EV from catching fire. But if everything around the EV is already burning, there's no value added from the special EV fire blankets. 16 posted on 01/17/2025 8:08:34 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Title: Supreme Court Upholds TikTok Ban, App May Shut Down Jan. 19 in the U.S.

Trump says he needs 'time to review the situation' before deciding on next steps By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor TikTok could fade to black in the U.S. in a matter of days after the Supreme Court rejected its appeal to halt a law that will ban the popular video app as of Jan. 19 unless Chinese parent ByteDance sells its stake. “There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,” the Supreme Court wrote in its unanimous opinion in the case issued Friday morning. “But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.” Related Stories VIP+ 2025 Vision: A Special Report on Hollywood in the Attention Economy The court said that “we conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate petitioners’ First Amendment rights.” The Supreme Court affirmed the Dec. 6 judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which found that the national security risks presented by TikTok’s Chinese ownership justified the divest-or-ban law. Popular on Variety In response to the ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew thanked President-elect Donald Trump “for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship.” ByteDance has not publicly indicated any willingness to sell its TikTok stake. TikTok has told employees that they will still have jobs regardless of the Supreme Court ruling. In the event of an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling, TikTok has been planning to shut down the app in the U.S. on Sunday, Jan. 19. At that point, TikTok users will see a pop-up message linking to a site with information about the ban. TikTokers also will have the option to download their personal data. There still could be wiggle room for TikTok to avoid an immediate shutdown. The Biden administration is leaving the question of what to do about TikTok to Trump, set to be sworn into office Jan. 20. Trump, in a post Friday on Truth Social, wrote: “The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!” Trump is trying to position himself to be seen as TikTok’s savior: He is considering issuing an executive order to suspend enforcement of the law for 60-90 days while he tries to hammer out a resolution to keep TikTok available, as first reported by the Washington Post — although it’s questionable whether Trump has the legal authority to pause the divest-or-ban law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Trump may also instruct the government to not enforce the ban. But given that the law imposes fines of $5,000 per user on companies that distribute or host the TikTok app, tech companies like Apple, Google and Oracle (which has an agreement to host TikTok user data in the U.S.) may be reluctant to flout the ban. On Friday, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that he spoke with Chinese president Xi Jinping and “discussed balancing Trade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects. President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!” Meanwhile, Trump has invited TikTok’s Chew to attend the incoming president’s Jan. 20 inauguration in Washington, D.C., and to “sit in a position of honor on the dais,” per the New York Times. The shutdown of the TikTok app in the United States would be a boon to rival platforms including Meta’s Instagram, Google’s YouTube and Snapchat. Amid the looming threat of the TikTok ban, Chinese-owned social app Xiaohongshu (aka Red Note) has soared in popularity this past week. In May 2024, TikTok and ByteDance sued the U.S. government over the divest-or-ban law, arguing the legislation violates the First Amendment rights of its U.S. users. In addition, two groups of TikTok users and creators filed petitions for review in the D. C. Circuit, challenging the constitutionality of the law. But the Supreme Court sided with the law’s backers, who have claimed TikTok represents a national security threat because Beijing-based ByteDance is subject to oversight by the Chinese Communist Party. ByteDance and TikTok have claimed the Chinese government has never requested access to TikTok user data — and that they would not turn it over if that were the case. The Supreme Court noted in its opinion that, according to the U.S. government, ByteDance “has previously declined to agree to stop collecting U.S. user data or sending that data to China to train the algorithm.” In addition, “The Government has further noted the difficulties associated with monitoring data sharing between ByteDance Ltd. and TikTok Inc. … Under these circumstances, we find the Government’s data collection justification sufficient to sustain the challenged provisions.” “Data collection and analysis is a common practice in this digital age,” the Supreme Court said in its opinion. “But TikTok’s scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the Government’s national security concerns.” American lawmakers who backed the legislation have claimed it is not technically a ban because it offers ByteDance a choice: to divest TikTok’s U.S. business or to have the app shut down. TikTok and ByteDance, in their lawsuit, argued that “in reality, there is no choice,” saying the forced divestiture required by the law in order for TikTok to be allowed to continue operating in the country “is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.” Chinese officials reportedly have been exploring the potential for ByteDance to sell its stake to tech mogul Elon Musk. A TikTok spokesperson called that “pure fiction.” ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group. Last year, the TikTok divest-or-ban legislation passed Congress with bipartisan support. It was signed into law by President Biden in April 2024. U.S. lawmakers have voiced concern about TikTok’s Chinese ownership, suggesting the Chinese communist regime could use the app to spy on Americans or use it to spread pro-China propaganda — despite providing no public evidence that the Chinese government has demand TikTok turn over user data or promote specific content. The law doesn’t mandate the shutdown of TikTok per se. Rather, it prohibits Apple and Google’s app stores and web hosting services from distributing TikTok in the U.S. (under penalty of monetary fines) unless ByteDance sells its ownership stake in the app to an entity based in a country that is not designated a “foreign adversary” of the United States.

Title: Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV): A Bear Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bearish thesis on Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV) on wallstreetbets Subreddit Page by SunderRei. In this article, we will summarize the bears’ thesis on SERV. Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV)'s share was trading at $18.88 as of Jan 16th. Logistics robots filling packages in a warehouse, preparing for delivery. Serve Robotics (SERV) has captured significant attention with its autonomous delivery robots, yet the company’s financials raise major red flags. Despite a market valuation exceeding $1 billion, SERV's history of unprofitability, negative gross margins, and high operational costs suggests an unsustainable business model. Each robot currently costs more to produce and operate than the revenue it generates, undermining the company's long-term viability. Alarmingly, SERV plans to mass-produce 2,000 third-generation robots in 2025, a 20-fold increase from its existing fleet of 100. With production costs per robot exceeding $32,000, this initiative will exert enormous financial pressure on a company already struggling to demonstrate profitability. The revenue potential per robot is concerningly low. Based on SEC filings, second-generation robots generate an average of $7,612 annually in delivery revenue, which pales in comparison to their production cost of $63,654. Even with the reduced production costs of third-generation robots and projected improvements in efficiency, it would still take six years for a robot to recoup its manufacturing cost—well beyond the likely operational lifespan. Operational expenses, including remote control staffing (required 20% of the time) and maintenance, further erode profitability, with annual costs per robot conservatively estimated at over $18,000. Advertisement revenue, a secondary income stream, offers limited relief. Even with an optimistic projection of $800 per robot per month, total revenues remain insufficient to offset the heavy expenses. SERV’s reliance on NVIDIA as a strategic investor has driven speculative interest, particularly following NVIDIA’s $12 million investment and 10% ownership stake. However, NVIDIA’s involvement appears more focused on showcasing its AI hardware capabilities than on SERV’s financial success. NVIDIA’s endorsement has inflated SERV’s valuation, which skyrocketed 2,000% in mid-2024, but it fails to address the fundamental flaws in SERV’s business model. Looking ahead, SERV's planned expansion is likely to exacerbate financial losses, with ballooning costs far outpacing revenues. Recent insider sales totaling $3 million further signal declining confidence among management. While SERV remains a speculative play for optimists betting on autonomous delivery technology, its current valuation is disconnected from its financial reality. For investors, SERV presents an overvalued stock with significant downside risk, making it a compelling short opportunity as its financial struggles become increasingly apparent in future reports. Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 5 hedge fund portfolios held SERV at the end of the third quarter which was 3 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of SERV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SERV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 'Drill, Baby, Drill,' Yet Time To 'Chill, Baby, Chill' on Lower Prices
URL: https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2025/01/17/with_drill_baby_drill_you_may_need_to_chill_baby_chill_on_lower_prices_1085017.html

The energy policy of the incoming Trump administration seems as concise as it is clear: Slash domestic energy costs under the mantra, popularized in 2008 by GOP vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, of “Drill, baby, drill!” While a RealClearInvestigations canvass of energy experts suggests many of them foresee long-term benefits in that approach, it’s less clear to them that consumers will see immediate change. In other words, Trump may not deliver in 2025 on his campaign pledge to “cut energy prices in half within 12 months.” On the other hand, given expected huge increases in energy demand, a more aggressive approach to exploiting domestic resources should help keep prices steady and buttress affordability in the long run. “‘Drill, baby, drill’ is a soundbite, really, that stands for increasing domestic energy production from reliable sources, meaning located in the United States and not subject to geopolitical shocks and other disruptions,” said H. Sterling Burnett, director of climate and environmental policy at the Heartland Institute, a free market think tank long supportive of the oil and gas industries. One thing everyone agrees on is that the Trump administration is likely to continue the whipsaw of 21st-century energy policies of the United States. From Bush to Obama to Trump to Biden, and now back to Trump, the U.S. has zigzagged between the conviction that global warming threatens the planet, requiring a wrenching and expensive shift from fossil fuels, and the belief that society is better off when energy is abundant and affordable. Despite his campaign warnings of insufficient energy supplies, Trump will take office with high domestic oil and gas production. Since the new year, the price of oil has hovered around $75 a barrel, roughly equivalent to what it was a year ago and down from the more than $130 a barrel price it hit at the midpoint of President Biden’s term. It’s true that Biden’s policies limited energy exploration on federal lands and banned some liquid national gas exports, but American energy companies have refined their techniques, allowing them to tap more from existing sources. Consequently, the Trump administration will be trying to goose production at a time when environmentalists insist it is unnecessary, and with inflation still percolating it may be difficult to deliver lower prices in the near term. Trump conceded last month that “it’s hard to bring things down once they’re up, you know, it’s very hard,” but added: “I think that they will. I think that energy is going to bring them down.” “I will declare a national emergency to allow us to dramatically increase energy production, generation and supply,” Trump stated on the campaign trail. “Starting on Day 1, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refiners, new power plants, new reactors, and we will slash the red tape.” All of that is doable, experts said, but energy markets are nothing if not unpredictable. Even as the U.S. enjoys a relatively ample supply of energy, new warnings have emerged about the ravenous energy demands of artificial intelligence and data centers that are at the forefront of technological innovation. Moves that put the U.S. on more solid production footing are expected to benefit consumers by stabilizing prices while also leaving the nation more secure in its energy future, according to supporters of Trump’s outlook. “There are levers he can pull that will remove the disincentives to drill,” said Mark Mills, executive director of the National Center on Energy Analytics (NCEA). “At current prices it might not be that attractive to drill, and of course Trump wants to bring down prices so there’s a natural tension between those objectives.” Still, optimism is high among energy mavens sympathetic to Trump’s approach. As analyst Alex Epstein told commentator Jordan Peterson in a conversation made public Tuesday, “I’ve been at this 17 years now, and it’s definitely at a peak in terms of enthusiasm and opportunity in this sphere.” Biden’s departure will leave an energy sphere shifted toward renewables by design rather than free market forces. While Trump’s victory last November would seem to indicate a majority of Americans agree with his design, the Biden administration is going down swinging on its position that global warming is an existential threat, and ramping up efforts to limit oil and gas production in the U.S. Through an executive order on Jan. 6, the administration banned exploration in 625 million acres of saltwater, covering the east and west coasts, much of the Gulf of Mexico, and some stretches on the Alaskan coast. Left-wing environmental groups that cheered the sweeping move insist Trump will be unable to reverse it. Such parting shots are of a piece with Biden’s entire term, which began with a raft of executive orders designed to shut down oil and gas projects under Trump, and consistent maneuvers to limit lease sales and permits, starve the fossil-fuel industry financially, and pump hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into various green energy schemes. Biden’s anti-oil-and-gas strategy, coupled with his gigantic spending initiatives, triggered the worst U.S. inflation in decades. Biden also deep-sixed the previously approved Keystone XL pipeline to pump oil from Canada’s tar sands to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast; offshore exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) has stagnated, and new liquid natural gas projects were paused. In 2024, the government held no offshore lease sales for the first time in 42 years, and in their final weeks Biden’s team offered the legal minimum of Alaskan sites for auction. “The Biden administration was at war with our industry,” said Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil & Gas Association. “Industries with expensive long-term projects like offshore exploration and LNG [Liquified Natural Gas] are looking for certainty in the marketplace.” Environmentalists made much of what they called tepid interest in the recent Alaska lease auctions. But industry executives said the low interest was more attributable to the limited nature of the auctions and the fact Biden officials chose the least attractive sites from a geological perspective. In addition, while it is true domestic production is at a record high, the total is only a fraction greater than it was in 2019 before the COVID lockdowns. Just as Biden canceled or paused oil and gas initiatives when he took office, Trump can restart them on Jan. 20 in keeping with the nation’s 21st-century energy policy zigzag. In addition, Trump is expected to again withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, and the U.S. is unlikely to remain an eager participant in the various conferences the global warming alarmists hold in farflung cities. While climate change activists have raised alarms about such moves, supporters of more gas and oil exploration note that over the past 15 years, no country has reduced its carbon dioxide emissions more than the U.S., in large part because of the transition to natural gas from coal. “The Trump administration should easily be able to just start approving LNG permits again,” said Thomas Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research. “The greens will likely sue based on the bogus study the Department of Energy released, but it won’t hold up to scrutiny.” In addition to disengaging from United Nations-led climate agreements, Trump could take three other moves that would indicate Washington will end its hostile stance toward fossil fuels, Burnett told RCI. Two of those would involve holding regular lease sales as required by law, and laying down specific timeframes for the conclusion of the permitting process. Third, and most significant, would be rescinding of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Obama-era “endangerment finding,” regarding greenhouse gases, according to Burnett and others. Should the EPA drop that measure, which put a heavy thumb on the scale in favor of renewable energy by labeling CO2 harmful, the oil and gas industry would prosper. There is other low-hanging fruit likely to be plucked via a “drill, baby, drill” mindset, which experts said would help signal the U.S. is committed to abundant energy now and in the future. The office of “climate czar” which was created by Biden and which has adamantly refused to break down how it spends its money could be shuttered, along with the “environmental justice” offices Biden implanted in various government agencies. While some projects like the Keystone XL pipeline appear to be dead, holding more lease sales, ungumming the permit process, and removing regulatory obstacles would all send clear signals the U.S. would be open for business for oil and gas production. In addition, federal lawyers could end litigation or decline to defend against lawsuits that might be filed against regulations pushed through during Biden’s term, according to energy experts. Trump could also replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve drawn down by Biden since 2022. Chris Wright, the executive Trump has nominated as energy secretary, is a former oil executive who participated in the fracking boom, but he has long championed policies that would increase all forms of energy, including renewables and nuclear. Similarly, his interior secretary nominee, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, is expected to slash regulations and open up more opportunities for exploration and mining on federal lands. What the Trump administration does do with energy will not be confined to oil. This month Trump announced a $20 billion foreign investment in building data centers here in the U.S., a part of the technology explosion linked to artificial intelligence and a development that will require enormous amounts of energy. The juice for such projects comes from natural gas, not oil, and green lights on LNG pipelines and facilities from the Trump administration would facilitate them. A recent report by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization that seeks to “reduce energy waste and combat climate change,” predicts that new data centers, manufacturing facilities, and electric vehicles will require a vast expansion of the electric grid during the next decade. “A data center can be built in 12-18 months and it needs power 24/7 so windmills aren’t going to do it,” Mills said. Yet another component of “drill, baby, drill” would be geared toward ensuring futures markets and U.S. independence, according to Mills and others. After curbing domestic oil and gas, Biden was put in the uncomfortable position of rattling the U.S. energy cup before Saudi Arabia, a regime he had been sharply critical of, and nations generally hostile to the U.S. such as Venezuela. Such foreign policy contortions would be avoided by ramping up domestic production, and it might also insulate the U.S. from “black swan” events that can send shockwaves through global energy markets. It’s unclear, for example, what will happen with supplies from Iran if Trump, as expected, ratchets up sanctions on the Tehran theocracy that Biden relaxed, or if Israel were to extend its bombing campaign against Iran and target the mullahs’ export facilities. The situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia present another factor. Of the four major pipelines Russia used to supply Europe with most of its energy, only one, that running farthest south that comes up through Bulgaria and Romania, is still active. Thus, increased domestic production and supply would cushion the U.S. from possible adverse impacts on global markets and also provide more profit and jobs via exports. “Policies of restriction are bad for consumers and our national security,” Pyle said. “The street is fickle, they saw money in ‘green’ but they’ll go wherever the money is.” Trump’s pro-industry outlook is also aligned with recent market tradewinds, which have shifted away from the “environmental, social and governance” investing that leftist groups and Wall Street firms like BlackRock had pushed. Since the end of 2023, some $14 trillion was withdrawn from such funds, and in the new year many big banks and investment companies, such as JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America have announced their departure from the “ESG” fold. Republican governors like Florida’s Ron DeSantis have also fought against left-wing investing by pulling huge state pension funds from managers that embrace those trends. “People are obviously concerned about the price at the pump and the cost of electricity, but it’s important that the government gives the industry a clear signal that the policy environment will be reframed to ultimately benefit American consumers,” said Dustin Meyer, a senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute. “I think there’s a lot more interest in energy exploration than there was four years ago. The new administration should mark a return to the long-established, bipartisan consensus that energy production is good for the U.S.” We're proud to make our journalism accessible to everyone, but producing high-quality investigative pieces still comes at a cost.

Posted on 01/17/2025 3:49:27 AM PST by AbolishCSEU Governor Kathy Hochul announced that construction is underway at Town and Country Apartments, a 256-unit affordable housing complex in Binghamton. The $94 million rehabilitation project will modernize the 22-building garden-style development, fully electrify its infrastructure, and improve energy efficiency by 20%. The project is part of Hochul’s five-year, $25 billion Housing Plan, which aims to create or preserve 100,000 affordable homes across New York State, including 10,000 with support services for vulnerable populations. The initiative complements efforts by New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR), which has financed over 1,260 affordable housing units in Broome County in the past five years. The apartments, reserved for households earning 60% or less of the area median income, will receive upgrades such as new flooring, windows, appliances, and electrical fixtures. Exterior renovations include roof replacements, concrete and asphalt repairs, updated landscaping, and environmental remediation. All units will be equipped with ENERGY STAR® appliances to promote sustainability. “This $94 million investment is preserving an important part of the Binghamton community while ensuring 256 households have an affordable, safe, and sustainable place to call home for years to come,” said HCR Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas. The development’s funding includes $70.9 million from HCR’s Multifamily Preservation Program and $16 million from the State Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. Additional support includes a $3.2 million subsidy loan from HCR’s Clean Energy Initiative and $3 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding from the city of Binghamton.

Title: Citadel Securities seeks to establish brokerage in China
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/citadel-securities-seeks-to-establish-brokerage-in-china-93CH-3818583

Investing.com -- Citadel Securities, led by CEO Peng Zhao, has submitted an application to the China Securities Regulatory Commission to establish a brokerage in mainland China. The move comes as many Wall Street firms find it challenging to navigate the country's markets. The application was received by the regulator on Friday, as per the information on the regulator's website. Citadel Securities' decision to establish its own operation in China follows its unsuccessful attempt to acquire Credit Suisse's onshore business last year. In its efforts to navigate the complex regulatory environment in China, Citadel Securities had hired Tony Tang, the former China head of BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., in September 2023. The US-based firm's move is somewhat unusual as many foreign financial institutions have been scaling back their operations in China. Despite this trend, Citadel Securities has been actively participating in China's A-share market from Hong Kong, where it trades cash equities, futures, options, and exchange-traded funds. The company maintains an office in Shanghai with a small team that supports its offshore China business. The new application signals an ambition to expand its presence within the mainland China market. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Citadel is trying to build its own operation in China after failing to buy Credit Suisse’s onshore business last year. It hired Tony Tang, BlackRock Inc.’s former China head, in September 2023 to navigate the increasingly complex regulatory landscape. The Miami-based firm, led by Chief Executive Officer Peng Zhao, is going against the grain as most foreign financial institutions have scaled back in China. Building a business from scratch in China typically takes longer than an acquisition, and gaining a license approval can take more than a year. The next step is for the CSRC to accept Citadel’s application before the regulator can review it. Citadel has been participating in China’s so-called A-share market from Hong Kong, where it trades cash equities, futures, options and exchange-traded funds.

Title: Zuckerberg, other moguls say they're backing off ESG and DEI but are they for real?

'Hannity' panelists Riley Gaines, Joe Concha and Leo Terrell give their take on DEI and the Trump transition team. Over the past 18 months, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) agenda has suffered setbacks in corporate DEI programs, declining investment dollars, and the collapse of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance. In just the last month, major banks withdrew from net-zero alliances and Meta dismantled many of its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs. ESG seems to be coming unglued. But don’t be fooled. A closer look at what the banks have said reveals that they are still full of unrepentant ESG financiers. Many of the touted changes are superficial or cosmetic rather than indicative of an underlying philosophical shift. Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives have been the subject of heated opinions of praise and rebuke. (Adobe Stock) Dozens of Fortune 500 companies (including McDonald's and Walmart) representing trillions of dollars of market cap and millions of employees rolled back or nixed their DEI programs in 2024. ESG-labeled investment funds hemorrhaged cash over the past two years. And the incoming administration has promised to jettison DEI in federal agencies. DEI IS LIKE A WOKE IED FOR THE LEFT’S WAR AGAINST OUR MILITARY. WE MUST DEFUSE IT The Net-Zero Insurance Alliance has fallen apart with the mass exodus of insurance companies over the past year and a half when many state attorneys general expressed concern that participating in such an alliance might violate anti-trust and anti-collusion laws. U.S. states have withdrawn billions of dollars from Blackrock due to concerns about ESG. These changes are welcome corrections to the flawed and deeply ideological goals of ESG advocates. The latest dominos to fall are large American financial institutions. Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, and JP Morgan have all withdrawn from the global Net-Zero Banking Alliance. Even Blackrock, once a vocal advocate of ESG, withdrew from Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. Though this may appear to be of a piece with other rollbacks of ESG, cynicism is warranted. If you look at the press releases from these large financial institutions, you’ll find that they are unrepentant and still intend to pursue net zero goals. For example, Goldman stated: "Our priorities remain to help our clients achieve their sustainability goals and to measure and report on our progress." Citigroup was even more blunt: "we remain committed to reaching net zero." I WAS FORCED TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST MY SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HALT COMPELLED SPEECH, RACIST DEI Blackrock has been the most explicitly unrepentant. "[O]ur memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion… and subjected us to legal inquiries… [But this] does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios." Translation: "We just want to distance ourselves from problematic PR, but we are not changing a single thing about how we do business." The moves by these large banks seem to imitate Blackrock CEO Larry Fink’s strategy of not using the term "ESG" because it was a political hot potato, but remaining committed to "sustainability." Blackrock remains heavily invested in green infrastructure and renewable energy projects. That’s fine if their clients explicitly ask for such investments. But as American Airlines learned last week, pension fund managers have a fiduciary obligation to pursue the best financial returns for their clients and they can be held liable for using the funds they manage for other ends. NEARLY HALF OF ALL US COLLEGE STUDENTS REJECT MANDATORY DEI COURSES ON CAMPUS: STUDY While superficial progress has been made with U.S. financial institutions withdrawing from destructive global net-zero alliances, they appear insincere when it comes to truly changing their ways. This should not be surprising given that bank personnel have not changed much. Nor do we see evidence of a change of heart when it comes to ESG. Instead, they seem concerned about public pressure and criticism from the incoming federal administration and from state government officials. Withdrawing from these alliances also gives them a freer hand to signal net zero intentions without having to deliver on them by a fixed date. But if ESG policy was distracting and destructive before, it is still so now. Ideological ESG priorities detract from companies’ ability to function well and benefit their contractual stakeholders. Companies have a hard enough time being profitable without pursuing various social justice priorities. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Banks would do better to clarify their commitment to maximizing shareholder value and doing business with everyone. Pursuing long-term profit successfully benefits shareholders, workers, suppliers and customers. Most corporations, especially the unrepentant financiers, need to clean house in their human resources departments to focus on value creation rather than racial identity politics or costly virtue-signaling on environmental and social issues. And as the American Airlines case shows, companies that fail to do so may very well be violating their fiduciary duty to clients and to shareholders.

Title: US President-Elect Donald Trump Said to Plan Elevation of Cryptocurrency as a National Priority

Photo Credit: Unsplash/ Ewan Kennedy The US government currently holds nearly $20 billion worth of Bitcoin, President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority and giving industry insiders a voice within his administration, according to people familiar with the plans. The order is expected to name crypto as a national imperative or priority — strategic wording intended to guide government agencies to work with the industry, according to people familiar with the matter. It is also slated to create a crypto advisory council to advocate for the industry's policy priorities, said the people who requested anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public. Trump has enjoyed strong support from the crypto industry, which has a powerful presence in Washington, backed by well-funded political action committees. A slew of companies, including Coinbase and Ripple, have donated to Trump's inaugural committee in recent months. On Friday, days before the inauguration, the industry is hosting an “Inaugural Crypto Ball” in support of Trump. The executive order would mark a sea change for crypto, which has been a target for investigations during President Joe Biden's administration following a spate of high-profile fraud cases, including the bankruptcy of the FTX exchange. Federal agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission filed more than 100 enforcement actions against the sector in recent years, and banking regulators made it difficult for crypto companies to work with financial institutions. Still under discussion for inclusion in the executive order is a directive for all government agencies to review policies about digital assets and possibly pause any litigation involving crypto, the people said. Stopping legal actions that have targeted a range of companies from Binance Holdings Ltd., the world's biggest crypto exchange, to startup Ripple Labs Inc. is a top priority for the industry. Also under consideration is the creation of a national Bitcoin stockpile, which would encompass the government's existing holdings of the world's biggest cryptocurrency, the people said. The US government currently holds nearly $20 billion worth of Bitcoin, confiscated as part of various investigations, according to analytics company Arkham. Bitcoin has rallied almost 50%, to above $100,000, since the November election in part on hopes that such a stockpile would be created. The token more than doubled in price in 2024. The people cautioned that the executive order, which could come as soon as Monday, is not final and could change before it is made public. A representative for Trump did not immediately respond to a request to comment. Trump has vowed to issue a bevy of executive orders across a range of disparate industries and issues within his first few days back in office. “What I think Donald Trump is going to do is signal that the United States is back and we are ready to lead in this industry,” said Kara Calvert, vice president for US policy at Coinbase Global Inc., the country's biggest cryptocurrency exchange. “What it's signaling to other countries is be careful, or you won't keep up.” Despite regulatory setbacks under Biden, crypto in the US expanded, with major financial companies including the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock Inc., launching spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds last year. BNY has been working to expand its crypto custody effort, and Cantor Fitzgerald announced plans to launch a Bitcoin financing business. Trump embraced the crypto industry during the presidential campaign last year. In July, he headlined a Bitcoin conference, where he promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Trump-branded collections of nonfungible tokens have been coming out for several years, and last year he and his sons announced a crypto effort called World Liberty Financial, which is supposed to let people earn and borrow crypto, but has yet to provide those services. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

By Tom Wilson (Reuters) - Advocates and holders of crypto will soon influence U.S. policy on the emerging technology after a slew of nominations and advisory appointments by President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. The crypto industry has spent years fighting lawsuits and enforcement actions by the U.S. government. It hopes the incoming Trump administration will mark a shift in policy. Political appointees will be vetted for potential conflicts. Some have committed to selling their interests. The industry is hosting a sold-out black tie ball in Washington on Friday, with tickets ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. David Sacks, Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, is scheduled to attend. Below are some facts on the crypto positions of key members of the incoming administration and Trump's inner circle. SCOTT BESSENT A billionaire hedge fund manager, Trump's pick to be Treasury Secretary has spoken favorably about crypto. "Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay," he told Fox News in July. "I think everything is on the table with bitcoin." According to a financial disclosure filed last month, Bessent holds shares in a BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) bitcoin exchange-traded fund worth between $250,001 and $500,000. Bessent will divest his interests in the fund and other investments within 90 days of his confirmation, he wrote last week to the U.S. Treasury. Bessent did not respond to a request for comment. HOWARD LUTNICK Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce is a vocal supporter of bitcoin. Lutnick is CEO of New York brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which earns fees to manage billions of dollars' worth of U.S. Treasuries for Tether, the company that issues the eponymous stablecoin. "Do I own bitcoin? Of course I do," Lutnick said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. "Does Cantor Fitzgerald own bitcoin? A shedload of bitcoin." Lutnick did not respond to a request for comment. ELON MUSK The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief and world's richest man, chosen by Trump to oversee a government cost-cutting effort, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has long championed crypto including bitcoin and dogecoin. His public comments and actions of his companies have in recent years influenced the price of bitcoin and dogecoin, a smaller token conceived as a joke during an earlier crypto bubble. The acronym for Musk's cost-cutting agency, DOGE, is a nod to dogecoin, which is now the world's seventh-biggest crypto token based on its circulation of $4.5 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko. In 2021 Tesla bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, becoming one of the biggest companies to own crypto before selling most of its holdings. It held unspecified digital assets totaling $184 million in September 2024, a company financial report showed. Musk did not respond to a request for comment sent via Tesla on what crypto assets he may hold. VIVEK RAMASWAMY Set to work with Musk at DOGE, the former presidential candidate and entrepreneur is the founder of Strive Asset Management. Strive, which said in September it managed over $1 billion in assets, last month filed to launch an exchange-traded fund that invests in corporate bonds for bitcoin investments. The company's wealth management arm, launched in November, seeks to integrate bitcoin into Americans' investment portfolios, Ramaswamy said in a press release. In June 2023, Ramaswamy held $100,001 to $250,000 of bitcoin and $15,001 to $50,000 worth of the smaller token ether, according to a financial disclosure. He did not respond to a request for comment. DAVID SACKS A former PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) executive, Sacks was appointed White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar in December, tasked with developing a U.S. legal framework long sought by the crypto industry. Sacks is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures. The firm has invested in crypto firms including BitGo and Bitwise, its website shows. Sacks did not respond to requests for comment. STEVE WITKOFF Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate tycoon and donor to the incoming president, founded crypto venture World Liberty Financial in November. World Liberty, which sells a proprietary token, lists on its website Trump as among those entitled to a large share of any of the company's revenues. Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment. ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP JR., BARRON TRUMP Eric Trump told Reuters last year he was very involved in World Liberty, which he, his elder brother Don Jr. - seen as the most influential family member in the presidential transition - and younger half-brother Barron helped to form. Eric told a bitcoin conference in December the technology was a "financial revolution," and that his father would make the United States the crypto capital of the world. JD (NASDAQ:JD) VANCE U.S. Vice President-elect Vance held between $250,001 and $500,000 in bitcoin in August 2024, according to a financial disclosure. The venture capital firm co-founded by Vance, Narya, has made investments in Strive, Ramaswamy's asset management company, and video platform Rumble, its website shows. In November, Rumble said it would allocate its excess cash reserves to bitcoin. The company also received last year a $775 million investment from stablecoin firm Tether. Asked for comment on the crypto stances of Vance and Trump's sons, Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said - without providing evidence - that bureaucrats in Washington had sought to stifle innovation with more regulation and higher taxes. "President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto and other emerging technologies," he said in a statement to Reuters. PAUL ATKINS Atkins, a lawyer and former top SEC official, is Trump's choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and has advocated for deregulation. He is expected to take a softer approach to crypto than current Chair Gary Gensler. Atkins is chief executive of Patomak Global Partners (NYSE:GLP), a consultancy. Patomak advises "cutting-edge crypto-native companies" and traditional financial firms on how to "leverage digital assets for growth," its website says. Atkins did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: Bitcoin State Of Mind: Texas Aims To Pioneer Strategic Reserve

With President Donald Trump’s inauguration just a few days away, Bitcoin and blockchain supporters are bracing for crypto-friendly policies. Leading the charge is Texas, with Senator Charles Schwertner announcing a bill to launch its first state-level Bitcoin reserve. In a Twitter/X post, Senator Schwertner announced the filing of SB 778, making Texas the first state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. According to the Texan legislator, creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve will position the state as a blockchain leader, drive economic growth, and secure everyone’s economic freedom. Texas is the 10th largest economy globally and has over $194 billion in general revenue that will fund the state’s operations from 2026 to 2027. In addition to its huge budget, the state has a growing Bitcoin and blockchain economy. It’s also home to several crypto mines, including the one in the city of Rockdale, which is acknowledged as the biggest Bitcoin mining operation in North America. It’s time for Texas to lead the way in establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. That’s why I filed SB 778, which, if passed and signed into law, would make Texas the first state in the nation to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This would position our state at the… pic.twitter.com/dRdCt86Otr — Charles Schwertner (@DrSchwertner) January 15, 2025 According to Schwertner, it’s about time that Texas led the way in approving and launching a crypto reserve. In addition to the proposal to start a reserve fund, SB 778 also outlines a recommendation to set up the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Advisory Committee. This committee shall include the House chairs for Appropriations and Finance, a comptroller, a member of the Senate and the House, among others. Although the general aim of establishing the state’s crypto reserve is to leverage the blockchain and use it as a hedge against inflation, SB 778 also outlines its specific purposes. According to Section 403.703, the state aims to hold BTC as a financial asset. The document also specifies that persons, including Texans, can donate Bitcoin to advance shared ownership and a sense of community. The document also highlights specific transactions that will not be allowed. For example, Section 403.705 indicates that the comptroller cannot approve transactions to buy BTC to be held in other countries. Although some questions and risks are associated with creating a reserve, many states are pushing forward. Aside from Texas, Oklahoma has shared its plans to hold the premiere digital currency as part of its currency reserves. Representative Cody Maynard filed HB 1203, the Strategic Reserve Act, which aims to allocate a portion of the state’s pension funds to buy these digital assets. Pennsylvania lawmakers also submitted their plans to invest in Bitcoin. The state’s policymakers suggest that the state’s Treasury allocate up to 10% of the funds to buy crypto. Representative Mike Cabell says the state can follow the lead of private financial firms like Fidelity and BlackRock.

Title: Layoffs: Asset manager Schroders to cut 3% tech workforce, aims to revive growth

Layoffs: The United Kingdom's biggest asset manager Schroders Plc plans to layoff as much as 3 per cent of its workforce, or 200 jobs, as new Chief Executive Officer Richard Oldfield looks to revive growth, according to a Bloomberg report on January 17 citing sources. The source added that the layoffs would mostly be in technology and is one of the major changes being implemented by new CEO Oldfield, who took over from former and long-time chief Peter Harrison in November 2024, as per the report. “Our priority is to reposition the business at pace, as we transition to growth,” a spokesperson for the London-based firm said in a statement, Bloomberg added. As of June 30, the nearly 220-year-old Schroders managed around £774 billion ($947 billion) of assets. The job cuts will help it “improve delivery and ensure we are well-placed to meet our 2025 objectives, which are centered on reinforcing our active investment proposition,” the spokesperson added. Schroders' share price has sunk by around 50 per cent since its 2021 peak as it faced criticism for relatively high cost base and slower organic growth. The talk points also came amid wider woes facing traditional active fund managers as investors flock to lower-cost passive funds, the report noted. Other firms in the industry have trimmed their workforces in recent months, including Wellington Management and Manulife Financial Corp. Earlier this month, BlackRock Inc. told employees it’s cutting about 1 per cent of its over 21,000 employees. This means around 200 jobs are on the chopping block. “The cuts are part of BlackRock’s efforts to realign its resources with the firm’s strategy… As part of these firmwide efforts, we will be making changes today that will see approximately 1 per cent of our colleagues leave the firm… This is never easy,” BlackRock President Rob Kapito and COO Rob Goldstein told staff in a memo on January 8.

Today’s KevinMD article is “Leveraging Your Medical Career for Long-Term Wealth Building.” Amir, welcome to the show. Amir Baluch: Hey, thanks for having me on. So I’ll start by briefly sharing my story and journey. Kevin Pho: Go right ahead. Amir Baluch: Well, it was kind of not the smoothest journey to get to where I am. So right now, I’m a semi-retired anesthesiologist and mainly focus on wealth strategies and alternative investments. But unlike most people listening to the show, I actually did not get into medical school the first time I applied. That was kind of painful. And so I decided to put my life savings in my first business, electronic payments. After about a year, that didn’t work either. So then I’m like, OK, what am I going to do? I guess I’ll move back in with my parents in Midland, Texas. My dad was an internal medicine doctor, so I figure, hey, they’ve got a spare bedroom for me. But two months later, he declared bankruptcy—clinic wasn’t doing well, some failed investments—and we actually ended up moving to a one-bedroom apartment, the whole family, and kind of started from scratch. So I was just sitting there thinking to myself: How do I prevent this, or where is the lack of financial education? I definitely didn’t get it in college or in high school. So, you know, I started learning a lot just from books and audio books as well. There weren’t really that many masterminds or anything like that. So Rich Dad Poor Dad was a book that was pretty popular around that time, like a quarter of a century ago, actually. And eventually I figured out that most people make their first million in real estate. So I started getting into real estate at the age of 21 while I reapplied. Eventually, I did get into medical school, thankfully, on the second attempt, but I kept going with those alternative investments in real estate. And eventually, when I was 25, I got into my first multifamily deal as an LP with a private REIT. In 2008, when I was a resident in Miami doing anesthesia, we did a short sale flip in Dallas. I eventually moved to Dallas in 2010–2011. I got my securities license because I love to learn. I joined a boutique investment bank. It had a broker-dealer arm and also a mergers and acquisitions arm. So I learned from them for about half a decade before I went off on my own to create Baluch Capital and help educate other physicians, so they wouldn’t end up like my family did, you know, 25 years ago, and also present some opportunities for growth and passive income. Kevin Pho: All right. So you’re an anesthesiologist, and of course, you have your focus on wealth building as well. What’s your life like between those two careers? Amir Baluch: Well, a few years ago, I went down to about doing 8 days a month of anesthesia. I took a year off to kind of formalize our company, make my brother systematize on the real estate development side, and brought in some underwriters from BlackRock, JP Morgan. Then I went back into anesthesia about 4 to 5 days a month. So, you know, every other Friday and maybe every other Tuesday, I’ll be in the OR, just picking up shifts or, you know, helping out friends if they’re on vacation—I’ll cover them. That way, I still have one foot in the game and get some free food every now and then, and don’t let my Figs scrubs go to waste that I spent so much money on, right? But most days, I’m waking up at 4 a.m. and I’m online with my team. We’re doing Zoom calls, we’re preparing for the day, and usually by 9 a.m. I’ve pretty much got a whole day’s worth of work done. The rest is pretty much the bonus round. We just work a lot on acquisition of real estate development, so we’re constantly working with underwriters and brokers and wholesalers. On the private equity side, we’re constantly in meetings with companies that we’ve already invested in. And a lot of times, I’m a strategic partner with them. So we’ve got to sit in on these quarterly meetings and help, you know, either if they need to pivot or need to scale up or wherever they are in their process. Then we also do acquisitions, buying out e-commerce stores and creating fixed income products for passive cash flow for people. So all that structuring, organization, and team building is usually the space that I live in. Kevin Pho: All right. So let’s talk about your KevinMD article, “Leveraging Your Medical Career for Long-Term Wealth Building.” Tell us what this article is about for those who didn’t get a chance to read it. Amir Baluch: Well, you know, physicians are in such a unique space because they study for about 12 years, and they go into debt, which is kind of a disadvantage, but then they cash flow pretty significantly, and they usually have pretty good credit. So they have the cash flow, but they don’t have the time. So now, how can you use this to your own benefit? Well, you know what, whenever we become doctors, we kind of have a systematic approach for diagnosis and treatment, right? But a lot of times, we don’t apply that to investing. People kind of just shoot from the hip, but I think if doctors started applying that to their investments, they could actually diversify and create a systematic plan. “Hey, let me have a certain amount of private equity, a certain amount of private credit, a certain amount in real estate, a certain amount in the public stock markets,” and build a portfolio just as if they were trying to build a medical plan with somebody with multiple comorbidities. “Hey, we’ve got to treat your diabetes; we’ve got to treat your blood pressure; use this; use this.” You bring in specialists when you need them, right? You consult with other people when you get stuck. You don’t try to make a diagnosis or decide what the plan is on your own. So I think a lot of that mindset is actually embedded in the back of a doctor’s head, but sometimes they don’t use it because they’re so pressured with time, which is really their greatest asset. That’s the one that they really have to protect. So what I feel that a lot of physicians should do is, you know, if they have the strong cash flow and they can live a little bit below their means and start generating passive income, if you start focusing more on assets that create passive income instead of just focusing on net worth, you could buy your time back. For example, we’ve helped a lot of doctors just take one day off a week. Let’s say you can just take a Wednesday off, or maybe two afternoons—maybe Tuesday, Thursday afternoon. You can just work on your practice or work on something outside of medicine, like if you are going to go into real estate or you have another type of side hustle, just to kind of clear your mind. But it does help to get that extra maybe 5,000 to 10,000 dollars a month first, so you can back off a little bit and get a big perspective on what’s going on. Don’t miss out on the big picture, because when you’re working as a doctor—I don’t know how it was for you—but you’re just like, man, it’s work, work, work. It seems to never end. So I think that’s a good strategy that doctors can use to get their time back, which will help them make better investment decisions, maybe help grow their practice if they’re private practice. If you’re W-2, that’s a little bit different, but they could start building a second stream of revenue and kind of have some more control in life and also diversify from some of the pitfalls of medicine, which a lot of people don’t like to talk about, like decreasing reimbursement rates and a lot more corporate control and feeling the squeeze from these mergers. Kevin Pho: So you talk about alternative sources of income, passive sources of income. Normally, that tells me that this is real estate-based—that’s part of your background as well. So let’s say we’re a physician, or a physician is listening to you here, interested in hearing more. Tell us how they can get started. What are some examples of some of these passive income streams that you’re talking about? Amir Baluch: Well, I think that an easy one to get into is anything involving real estate, just because we’re a little bit more familiar with it. So I tried to get in with just doing a single-family rental. It’s kind of easy to get your mind wrapped around it, and it’s a business, but it’s very simple. The cash flow comes in from rent; your expenses are mainly the mortgage and maybe a little bit of upkeep. And that’s a pretty small business model but very easy to understand. And for a physician, it comes with a little bit of cash flow and some decent tax benefits. So you’re working on both offense and defense there. That’s a good place to go. The next probably would be private equity, which just means private business. So there’s public equity, like public stocks, and there’s private. It just happens that private equity has made more money than public equity every year for the last 35 years. So at some point, somebody should have some exposure to it. And physicians can team up and buy into these businesses. Even some mom-and-pop businesses, you could buy at maybe three to four times the net income of a business, which means your return is, you know, the inverse of that, which is 25 percent cash-on-cash return from day one. So imagine if you could buy into something that’s maybe medically related—maybe it’s an existing medical spa, which, you know, is a little bit medical, but maybe you might not have aesthetics involved in it. Or maybe it’s a joint venture with a pharmacy or something like that, that’s a little bit medically related but not what you’re trained to do. There’s actually good cash flow from there. And then, as they get older, it’s usually better. You know, then you’re trying to just protect what nest egg you’ve created, and you’re just looking for even more cash flow to bring your time back, and maybe something less risky. So usually private credit offers that, where it’s fixed debt against lending on a hard asset like real estate. Also, there are things like municipal bonds and corporate bonds. There are some public stocks that put off dividends, but it’s not that great. And then also just traditional fixed income products as well that you could get from either a financial advisor or even online. You could find those things where you could be a debt partner into a different type of entity. Kevin Pho: Now let’s talk about the first thing you mentioned—single-family homes. How does one get started in that? You say that it’s a simple business, but let’s say a physician, like you said, is at a time deficit, may not know a lot about real estate. How does one learn enough to have the confidence to purchase a single-family home for passive income purposes? Amir Baluch: Well, there are a couple of ways. One, if somebody wanted to partner on the money side and the lending side and have somebody else kind of manage it from a distance, you could do that. And usually there are realtors out there that specialize in it. So how I got started—I got my real estate license in 2011. I don’t think anybody needs to do that. But even then, I worked with another realtor that specialized in single-family rentals. And so you can find these people online, and there are also these real estate meetups that you’re going to find in almost any city. So networking with people that are in that space is probably the first place to go. And whenever you find somebody there, as soon as you are collaborating with them, they’re going to open up their Rolodex. They’ve got people that lend on it, they’ve got people that find the properties, they’ve got people that manage the properties, because eventually you need some type of a team. If you’re wondering who those team players are, probably the best book you could get—now, I’ve actually just bought and given away copies of this; I wish it was my book—but it’s called The Millionaire Real Estate Investor by Gary Keller. It’s like a blue and white book on Amazon, probably 10 bucks or something like that. But they show you step by step on what team members you need to make this pretty smooth. And so, you know, once you start putting your team together and pull the trigger on your first one, and you get through a year or two of that first one, you kind of know, hey, what to look for, how to hire a proper property manager. And, you know, you rarely get any phone calls. So I think that’s the first thing to do: put together your team of a realtor that knows what they’re doing, get your lender—then the lender might have some contacts for you to help get you some deals too—and then a property manager. Kevin Pho: Now, contrast that option with, say, real estate syndications, because I hear a lot of physicians who may not want to make that effort in constructing their own team and directly purchasing a property, then go into real estate syndications. So contrast those two options. Amir Baluch: That’s a good topic. So the most important thing that a lot of people don’t talk about—the most important difference—is the valuation method. Most businesses, including a multifamily syndication or any commercial real estate syndication, the whole enterprise is valued at a certain multiple of the net income. Now, in commercial real estate, though, it just happens that instead of using a multiple of the net income or the multiple of EBITDA, you basically get the inverse of that, which is cap rate. And so cap rate is your, you know, if you bought a property all cash, what is your cash-on-cash return for a year? It’s usually like 4, 5, 6 percent, something like that. So that’s how those things are valued. So if you don’t increase the net income, if you don’t increase the rents, the value of that property is not going to go up. And you get a little bit of cash flow, but that value is really not going up that much. And sometimes it can go down, even if you increase rents, which is what’s happened in the last couple of years in multifamily. Now, if you contrast that with single-family, why does the value of the house go up? Well, it’s actually not the value, but the price of the house goes up because the value of the dollar goes down, and houses are always a good hedge against inflation. So houses will adjust for inflation, and the valuation is based off comps. So if your neighbor next door sold for a million bucks, and you’re right next to them, and you have about the same square footage, you’re probably going to sell for a million bucks. And it happens that, you know, all the components to make a house—wood, steel, labor, wages—that all goes up. So, you know, the replacement cost goes up, which makes these houses more valuable over time as well. So the valuation method is a little bit different, and you have to just go in there knowing what the plan is. So on a single-family, if you just buy and hold, and the cash flow is more than your monthly payment to the bank, you’re pretty much going to be OK no matter what, as long as you don’t get huge expenses coming in or too much vacancy. In commercial real estate, the difference is you’re going to be a lot more passive, so you can sit back and not do much work, but you’ve got to be careful about the valuations going in. You need to know a little bit more about how they’re going to increase those rents. In any commercial thing, it’s all about increasing the rents and decreasing expenses. You kind of have to have a better grasp of that and not just blindly invest in that, because if it’s not managed correctly, the overall property can go down in value—or maybe just not go up in value as much—compared to a single-family rental, which is pretty much always going to go up in value because it’s just hedging against inflation, sometimes a little bit better or oftentimes, in my opinion, better than commercial real estate. Kevin Pho: Now let’s talk about the second option you mentioned, which is private equity. How do physicians dip their toes into that potential option? Amir Baluch: So this is a little bit trickier. You know, sometimes they’ve done it and didn’t even know that they’re in it. For example, a lot of my surgery buddies are partners in a surgery center—that’s technically private equity. Or maybe if somebody opened up or partnered on a coffee shop down the street or anything that’s a private business, they might be in it but not thinking that it’s private equity, but it is, just on a very small scale. A lot of times when people think private equity, they think of businesses that are, you know, 10 million, 50 million, maybe even a few billion dollars. That one, at least for me, is just a lot of networking. Luckily, because of my securities license, I was networked with a bunch of broker-dealers, and we just get deals all the time. Most of these things involve issuing securities in the private market. And so through them, I’ve gotten a lot of deal flow in at least life sciences and biotech. But if somebody wants to get into private equity, you really have to go out there and basically take action and look for it. So you could go find some business brokers. For example, let’s say I really wanted to get into a pharmacy, because as an anesthesiologist, I just liked the pharmacology, right? And maybe I just wanted a pharmacy. You could find business brokers that are selling it and get on those email lists and say, “Hey, I’m looking for this. I can get an SBA loan for about a million, so I have this much down payment. If you find somebody that’s willing to owner-finance, I could do that.” And you actually go out there and have to hunt. It’s way easier to do public equity, right? You just push a button online and buy stocks. But the downside of that is those are very efficient markets, and in an efficient market, it’s hard to get good risk-adjusted returns. In the private market, there’s a lot more inefficiencies. You have to deal with brokers, and the deals take a long time to close. It’s not like if somebody puts a Twitter post online that the valuation changes in milliseconds or anything like that. So it’s a little bit more work but a lot more stable. Over time, the data has shown it’s more profitable and higher risk-adjusted returns. Kevin Pho: Now, is there a certain type of physician personality trait who would be more amenable to these alternative investments versus just sticking with low-cost index funds? Because from what I’m hearing, not all physicians may be cut out for these alternative investments that you’re talking about. Amir Baluch: Right. I think, you know, at the end of the day, you can make it through either path. I’d say if you are going to do a set-it-and-forget-it with index funds, you’re going to have to save a lot more and have a longer timeline. Right now, I mean, these people—nobody has a crystal ball—but JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are predicting that the next 10 years, the S&P and indices should be averaging around 3 percent, 2 to 3 percent a year returns after adjusting for inflation because of the bull run we’ve had and P/E ratios, you know, two standard deviations above where they usually are, and things like that. So if you just have a longer timeline, you could set it and forget it if you don’t want to spend the time to learn about alternatives or if you don’t have the network to find some mentors that could help guide you. Now, if somebody has more time on hand and wants to diversify—which I think diversification is really key because you can never put all your eggs in one basket, right? So if somebody wants to diversify, it is a little bit more active. Even if you end up being a limited partner in some type of alternative syndication, there’s still some active role in there. You need to do some minimal due diligence. And if anybody has questions about that, they could email me on an asset class. I’ll at least show, you know, 20 or 30 things you should look at in every asset class before you pull the trigger. But you do have to take a little bit more active role or maybe put together a small investment group where everybody is putting in their two cents and dividing up the work and pooling their money together to invest as a group. That’s another way to do it if people are constrained for time. But for sure, people that have more time, which in my experience has been anesthesiologists and emergency doctors—it’s more like shift-work-oriented—or even hospitalists that are one week on, one week off, are now really getting into alternatives and having the time to do the due diligence on these deals and increase their deal flow. Because it just depends on your time, the time involvement you want to take, and your timeline. If you can look further out and save more money, you could go with the indices route—just a little bit more risk. Kevin Pho: We’re talking to Amir Baluch. He’s an anesthesiologist. Today’s KevinMD article is “Leveraging Your Medical Career for Long-Term Wealth Building.” Amir, let’s end with some take-home messages that you want to leave with the KevinMD audience. Amir Baluch: You know, in anything you want to accomplish in life, if you work hard enough and you’re around the right people, you’re going to get it. So if being financially savvy or getting enough passive income so you can maybe just take one or two days off—not really retire early, because I think if you like your job, you should keep doing it—but, you know, you want to just find some mentors out there, read as much as you can, and hang around people who have been there, done that, that pretty much already are where you want to be. And if anybody wants any other resources, we’ll have a link for anybody watching where they can get a free copy of my book, Prosperity Prescription. It has a little bit of a blueprint on how to get that started. Or if somebody wants to book a quick 10-minute call with me—just like a clarity call, I call it—where in 10 minutes, we kind of find out what the next step would be for them. Those two options will be available somewhere on a link, either on my website or somewhere after this podcast. Kevin Pho: Amir, thank you so much for sharing your perspective and insight.

Samara Cohen, the firm's ETF and index instruments chief investment officer, thinks cryptocurrency deregulation will "absolutely" propel bitcoin to another historic year. "There will be progress made on… FIT21 ["Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.] There will be progress made on stable coins. There will be progress made just on definitions in taxonomy," she told CNBC's "ETF Edge" this week. Cohen is behind the firm's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) – which is up 114% since its January 2024 debut and up almost 8% year to date. It comes as bitcoin briefly traded above $100,000 this week. Despite the strong performance, she suggests cryptocurrency investors need an iron stomach. "Bitcoin is a risky asset. So, 15% in the context of Bitcoin is not an enormous move. Investors should expect volatility," said Cohen. "But in the long term, the price of bitcoin is really going to be determined by the level and pace of adoption." On Monday, BlackRock announced the official launch of its iShares Bitcoin ETF on CBOE Canada. And, it's not the only firm making an early year push deeper into cryptocurrency. Calamos Investments plans to launch its Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF next Wednesday – two days after Trump's inauguration. According to the press release, it's the "world's first 100% downside protected bitcoin ETF." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Research released by New York Digital Investment Group shows that in Q4 2024, Bitcoin broke away from major assets following the election of Donald Trump in November—but it could still move back in line with them. Bitcoin has often moved in line with U.S. equities—particularly tech stocks—as it is considered by many to be a “risk-on” asset. It has also typically done well in a low-interest rate environment. Bitcoin ETFs registered $16.5B of net inflows, but the lion’s share of flows is going to BlackRock and Fidelity while some ETFs registered outflows during the quarter. pic.twitter.com/Z1Kz1Z7GkW — NYDIG (@NYDIG) January 13, 2025 “With Bitcoin increasingly owned by traditional market investors, it’s natural to expect correlations to change,” the NYDIG report read, referring to the new Bitcoin ETFs trading on stock exchanges. “Still, the promise of a non-sovereign issued store of value is an appealing investment in the current geopolitical climate, one that should not be driven by the same macroeconomic levers of say the U.S. stock market,” it added. Bitcoin surged to new highs after President-elect Trump’s November 5 victory. The incoming leader campaigned on a promise to slash regulation and help the digital asset industry, and NYDIG credits Trump's win as the "main driver" for Bitcoin's surge. By December 17, the biggest digital coin had hit a new all-time of $108,135, CoinGecko data shows. It has since retreated and is now trading for $99,600. Earlier this week, it briefly dipped below the $90,000 mark before a resurgence back above $100,000. NYDIG added in its research that Bitcoin outperformed all asset classes by a wide margin in 2024, rising by more than 47% in the final quarter, and by nearly 120% from January to the end of the year. The biggest cryptocurrency has in the past moved both with the stock market and gold. Is it slowly becoming an asset class of its own?

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, an LA Native, Weighs In on Wildfire’s Impact on Insurance

The ongoing Los Angeles wildfires have destroyed or damaged some 12,000 structures, incinerated entire neighborhoods and wiped out businesses and landmarks alike. The extensive damage, which took place in less than ten days, could take up to ten years to repair, according to Larry Fink, CEO and chairman of BlackRock (BLK), which manages enormous assets for insurance companies affected by the natural disaster.

During the company’s third-quarter earnings call yesterday, Fink pointed to insurance as “one of the primary areas of growth for us.” The sheer amount of damage wrought by the Los Angeles fires will make homeowners insurance an increasingly pertinent topic in the U.S. going forward, Fink said. The devastating event is also a personal one for the BlackRock executive, who is a Los Angeles native. Hiking the Santa Monica Mountains, where one of the ongoing wildfires broke out, was “one of my pleasures of growing up, looking for snakes and reptiles as a kid, walking through the chaparral,” he said, recalling living in Los Angeles during the great Bel Air Fire of 1961. “We’ve always had fires in Los Angeles, but we’ve never seen destruction like this.” The ongoing wildfires have killed at least 25 people and brought unprecedented economic damage. Losses for the insurance industry could climb as high as $40 billion, according to analysts from Keefe Bruyette & Woods, while Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have estimated $30 billion in costs to insurers. These numbers surpass the $12.5 million in losses from California’s 2018 Camp Fire—the largest insured wildfire loss to date. The sheer amount of destroyed homes—many of which were in well-to-do neighborhoods like the Pacific Palisades or Altadena, which Zillow estimates have average home values of $3.5 million and $1.2 million respectively—will shine a spotlight on the role of homeowners insurance across America, according to Fink. In recent years and months, numerous insurance companies have withdrawn coverage from wildfire-prone areas in California. Los Angeles County, for example, has reportedly seen 531,000 homeowner policies canceled between 2020 and 2022. The pullback has forced many California residents to turn to the California FAIR plan, the state’s last-resort insurance program. The FAIR plan’s total exposure as of September was $448 billion—a 61 percent increase year-over-year and a 123 percent jump compared to 2020. Besides potentially spurring a redefinition of event risk throughout the U.S., the aftermath of the Los Angeles fires means homeowners insurance will become a key topic for governments going forward, Fink told CNBC. “This is going to be one of the bigger issues that we’re going to have to be tackling over the next four years.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Litecoin ETF Could Attract Up to $580M of Inflows If Adoption Mirrors That of Bitcoin ETFs
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/01/16/litecoin-etf-could-attract-up-to-usd580m-of-inflows-if-adoption-mirrors-that-of-bitcoin-etfs
Time Published: 2025-01-16T21:33:47Z
Full Content:
While a litecoin (LTC) exchange-traded fund is still only theoretical, investor demand for the product could soar as high as $580 million if Wall Street adopts it at the same rate it did LTC’s better-known cousin bitcoin. That calculation is based on the roughly 6% of bitcoin’s total supply now locked up in a variety of ETFs. Similar performance by a LTC product would yield more than $500 million of inflows for the token, which has a similar Proof of Work consensus mechanism to that of BTC. These possibilities came into focus Thursday as market participants began sizing up the likelihood that LTC might become the third crypto asset to get its own ETF in the U.S., after BTC and ETH. Canary Capital, a new digital asset-focused investment firm founded by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg, is best positioned to issue such a product. It got the ball rolling on a litecoin ETF in October. On Thursday, Nasdaq stock exchange filed a 19b-4 document with the Securities and Exchange Commission, officially putting the regulator on the clock to make a decision. Bloomberg’s Balchunas expects LTC to garner SEC approval given industry chatter he said he’s been hearing. Litecoin’s similar tech specs to bitcoin may also prove a factor, assuming their reliance on proof of work consensus mechanism spell better likelihood of being considered a commodity. The question is whether there is enough investor demand to make a litecoin fund a success or not. “Even if demand is comparatively low, it could still see some demand,” said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Just because the success won’t be as crazy as the bitcoin or even the ethereum ETFs doesn’t mean that it can’t be successful. The market and investors will make that determination.” The bitcoin ETFs set unprecedented records in their first year of trading, with the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Fund (IBIT) becoming the most successful launch in the history of U.S. ETF launches. “The key question here remains the uncertainty of investor demand for additional products and whether new crypto ETP launches will matter,” JPM analyst Kenneth B. Worthington wrote in a note on Monday. Worthington believes that tokens beyond Bitcoin, Ethereum or Solana oftentimes lack depth as they “may capture incremental attention for a limited time.” About 6% of bitcoin total market capitalization, which stands at a whopping $1.97 trillion, is locked up in the ETFs, according to a report by JPMorgan earlier this week. In comparison, the ethereum (ETH) ETFs comprise about 3% of ether’s $401 billion market cap. He used this so-called “adoption rate” to determine how much inflows the proposed XRP (XRP) and Solana (SOL) ETFs could attract which Worthington concluded could add up to a combined AUM of up to $14 billion. When applying this calculation to Litecoin, which stands at a $9.6 billion market cap, Canary Capital’s fund could attract anywhere between $290 to $580 million in the first year of trading, depending on how well investors will adopt the fund. While $290 million seems disappointing compared to the $108 billion that the spot bitcoin ETFs have gathered or the $12 billion that the ether ETFs currently hold, it is a larger amount than most ETFs in the U.S. handle. According to Seyffart, only about 1,330 out of roughly 4,000 ETFs in the U.S. have an AUM greater than $300 million.

Title: GFL Environmental’s (GFL) $6 Billion Stake Sale – Here’s Why Jim Cramer Thinks It’s a Smart Move

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Watching These 8 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GFL Environmental (NYSE:GFL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer is watching. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently highlighted a surge in merger activity, pointing out that we’ve seen a significant uptick in deals over the past few days. He explained that this wave of mergers and acquisitions aligns with what he’s been predicting, a shift in M&A activity due to the change in administration. Cramer noted that under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department’s antitrust division have been very strict on mergers, often taking an aggressive stance against any form of corporate consolidation. According to Cramer, companies had grown increasingly reluctant to pursue mergers under Biden’s regulatory approach, as they faced the uncertainty of lengthy court battles with little assurance of success. “And that’s why when Trump won in November, it became very obvious that we were looking at a deluge of M&A deals and these companies couldn’t even bring themselves to wait for inauguration day.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 12 Stocks in Focus This Week and 7 Consumer Goods and Retail Stocks on Jim Cramer’s Radar “Alright, so what do we make of this wave of deals? First, I gotta say, it’s just nice to see some mergers again and while this deluge was widely anticipated because of the change in administrations, it’s still good to see some confirmation.” Cramer said it made him more confident in predicting that M&A deals will continue to increase, which is one reason why he recently added Goldman Sachs stock to his Charitable Trust portfolio as it has a major M&A advisory business that had been relatively dormant under the previous administration. He urged investors to consider buying the stock, noting that it’s an excellent opportunity. More generally, Cramer expressed satisfaction in seeing so many companies once again pursuing mergers that make sense for their businesses. When examining the deals announced in early January, Cramer pointed out that while some of these deals might have faced challenges under Biden’s administration, most appear justifiable. “So the bottom line: Gotta tell you, I’m just glad we’re back to a place where reasonable arguments like this will be considered fairly by the antitrust regulators rather than the situation we had under Biden where every takeover is considered anti-competitive until proven otherwise. For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 8. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An excavator at a landfill site operating amidst a pile of solid waste. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32 Cramer mentioned GFL Environmental Inc.’s (NYSE:GFL) sale of its majority stake in its Environmental Services business. “Yesterday, a waste management company called GFL Environmental announced that it’s selling the majority of its environmental services business to a pair of private equity firms for over $6 billion… Looking at the transactions we’ve seen just this week, while some of them likely would’ve been challenged by Biden’s ideologically driven regulators, most of them seem pretty justifiable. All of them make great business sense.” GFL Environmental (NYSE:GFL) provides non-hazardous solid waste management and environmental services in Canada and the United States, including collection, transportation, recycling, disposal, liquid waste management, and soil remediation. Recently, it announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Environmental Services business for an enterprise value of $8.0 billion. As part of the deal, the company will retain a $1.7 billion equity interest in the business and expects to receive approximately $6.2 billion in cash proceeds after accounting for the retained equity and taxes. As per Reuters, the transaction follows months of pressure from activist group ADW Capital Management, which had urged GFL to divest its environmental solutions business and focus solely on waste management. The company plans to use up to $3.75 billion of the net proceeds from the deal to reduce debt, with up to $2.25 billion allocated for share repurchases. Following the debt repayment, it expects its net leverage to stand at 3.0x. CEO Patrick Dovigi stated that the transaction will significantly strengthen the company’s balance sheet, moving it closer to achieving an investment-grade credit rating. Additionally, GFL Environmental (NYSE:GFL) has the option to repurchase the Environmental Services business within five years of the deal’s expected close in the first quarter of 2025, which will also lead to a reduction in its cash interest expenses by approximately C$200 million. Overall, GFL ranks 6th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer is watching. While we acknowledge the potential of GFL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GFL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Trump will keep TikTok from ‘going dark’, adviser says

TikTok is planning to shut its app in the US on Sunday when a ban kicks in. United States President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security adviser has said the new administration will keep TikTok alive in the US if there is a viable deal. “We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,” US Representative Mike Waltz told Fox News on Thursday. He noted that the law gives authority for a 90-day extension for the app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to complete a divestiture. This is the case, said Waltz, “as long as a viable deal is on the table. Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going.” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor on Thursday that TikTok, which is owned by China’s ByteDance, should be given more time to find a buyer. “It’s clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans,” Schumer said, adding that Senate Democrats tried to pass a bill to extend the deadline to come up with a solution. “I will work with the Trump administration and with both parties to keep TikTok alive while protecting our national security.” TikTok is used by more than 170 million Americans monthly. The New York Times reported on Thursday that Trump is considering an executive order that would seek to allow TikTok to continue operating despite a pending legal ban until new owners are found. It was not immediately clear if Trump has the authority to do so given the legal divestiture requirements imposed by Congress. A group of US lawmakers is also pushing for a 270-day extension as well, warning that a ban could hurt Americans who make a living from using TikTok. TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Trump transition, Karoline Leavitt, said, “President Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to save TikTok, and there’s no better dealmaker than Donald Trump.” Reuters has previously reported that TikTok plans to shut US operations of its social media app on Sunday, when a federal ban is set to take effect, barring a last-minute reprieve, according to people familiar with the matter. A White House official told Reuters on Wednesday that outgoing President Joe Biden has no plans to intervene to block a ban in his final days in office if the US Supreme Court fails to act. The official added that Biden is legally unable to intervene absent a credible plan from ByteDance to divest TikTok. The law signed in April mandates a ban on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores if ByteDance fails to divest the site. Users who have downloaded TikTok would theoretically still be able to use the app, but the law also bars US companies from providing services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of it once any ban begins. The president can issue a one-time, 90-day delay to the ban if he certifies to Congress that there has been evidence of significant progress and there are binding legal agreements in place to allow a complete divestiture in three months. Separately, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the US presidential inauguration on January 20 and sit among high-profile guests invited by Trump, a source told Reuters. Representative Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, criticised the decision to invite Chew on social media platform X. “Trump talks a big game on China & wanted to ban TikTok—just like many Republicans voted to do,” Pallone said. “But now he’s inviting TikTok’s CEO to sit beside him at his inauguration even though TikTok is linked to the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] & is a threat to our national security. What message does this send?” The US Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday, overturn the law, or pause the law to give the court more time to make a decision. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 percent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 percent each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the US. Follow Al Jazeera English:

More Info Italy’s biggest bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, has made history by becoming the first Italian financial institution to buy 11 bitcoins for a "test" purchase worth $1 million. Initially a widespread rumor, Bloomberg has confirmed that Italy’s largest banking giant has indeed dipped its toes in Bitcoin. According to an internal memo, the financial institution completed its first proprietary Bitcoin trade, investing the funds into the world’s largest digital currency. “It’s very small amounts, considering we have 100 billion euros in our securities portfolio,” Intesa CEO Carlo Messina told reporters on the sidelines of an event in Milan on Tuesday. “It’s an experiment, a test.” Intesa set up a proprietary trading desk for digital assets in 2023 and started handling spot trades with cryptos last year. The news first surfaced when the bank’s employees leaked an internal email on the image-sharing platform 4Chan. Following the leak, Niccolo Bardoscia, Intesa Sanpaolo’s head of digital assets trading and investment, officially confirmed the acquisition in an email to the media, revealing that the bank now holds 11 BTC. While Bardoscia confirmed the purchase, the executive did not reveal exactly why the bank had acquired BTC. Therefore, it is still unclear if the purchase was to diversify Intesa Sanpaolo’s investment portfolio or if it was a pilot to offer crypto services, according to CryptoRank. The acquisition is not the bank’s first foray into blockchain. In July last year, Intesa Sanpaolo pioneered a $25.7 million digital bond issuance on the Polygon network in collaboration with state-owned bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA. In addition, Intesa Sanpaolo broadened its crypto desk to allow spot trading. Before then, it only offered clients crypto options, futures, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Intesa Sanpaolo’s purchase came as Europe eased regulations. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory guideline came into full effect in December, a milestone that’s expected to pave the way for more digital-asset adoption among financial companies. While Intesa is currently only prop trading — buying and selling using its own balance sheet rather than on behalf of clients — the crypto desk’s activities fit with the bank’s broader blockchain projects, and it may be a stepping stone for eventually trading digital assets for institutional customers. “We won’t become a Bitcoin provider but we need to know how to do so if our bigger clients ask us to,” Messina told reporters on Tuesday. Intesa carried out the Bitcoin purchase through Boerse Stuttgart Digital’s institutional trading platform, a spokesperson from the German exchange group said in a statement. After rallying in the wake of Donald Trump’s US election win in early November, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have had a shaky start to the year, hurt by concerns that persistent inflation will curtail the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy easing. Bitcoin briefly slid below $90,000 on Monday — a drop of almost 5% from the start of 2025 — before a rebound that left it slightly up for January. The largest cryptocurrency soared to a record high of $108,316 last month. This BTC acquisition signals a shift in sentiment within Italy. As the country’s largest bank leads the way, other financial institutions may follow suit, potentially accelerating adoption. The move stands out in Italy, where the central bank governor, Fabio Panetta, has consistently cautioned against digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, describing them as “unsecured.” That said, the bank has a long way to go to catch up with its US peers: BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has amassed $51 billion in assets in the spot Bitcoin ETF it launched a year ago, and is pushing to have its money-market digital coin more widely used as collateral for crypto derivatives trades. JPMorgan is preparing to offer instant settlement for foreign-exchange conversions between the dollar and the euro through its blockchain platform. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s value continues to surge, with optimism growing about easing regulatory hurdles under incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. Some analysts expect it to more than double in value by the end of this year.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. The NASDAQ, heavily comprised of technology stocks, has been on a consistent upward trajectory for some years. In 2023, it experienced remarkable growth, marking its best performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. In 2024, the index continued to surpass market expectations with a 28.64% gain. This impressive performance is largely driven by the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has significantly boosted major tech stocks and the broader market throughout 2023 and into this year. Analysts suggest that the NASDAQ could be the index of the future, as its companies have shown a strong ability to adapt to evolving market trends. NASDAQ’s consistent outperformance can be observed over several years. According to a report by Invesco, since January 1, 2008, the Nasdaq-100 Index has delivered a cumulative total return of 750%, significantly outpacing the broader market’s 315% return. This success is largely attributed to the innovation driven by tech companies, which continues to attract investors. For instance, the technology sector in the broader market has achieved an annualized total return of 20.65% over the past decade, compared to 12.80% for the market. This leadership is understandable given the rapid adoption of technology in recent years. The Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) noted that the Nasdaq-100 has approximately 55% exposure to the tech sector, in contrast to about 32% for the broader market. READ ALSO: 12 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield and Warren Buffett’s 10 Cheap Stock Picks Tech companies are not only driving innovation but are also swiftly adjusting their dividend strategies. In 2024, many prominent tech firms began issuing dividends, significantly boosting the overall dividend pool. Although dividends are traditionally linked with value stocks rather than the high-growth companies fueling the AI surge, analysts suggest this shift broadens the appeal of these stocks to new investor groups while putting surplus cash to use. Typically, growth-focused companies prioritize reinvestment over returning earnings to shareholders. However, experts like Ted Mortonson from Baird argue that these dividend payments won’t undermine the companies’ future dominance. Here are some other comments from the analyst: “I don’t view it as a problem. I view it as they’ve won. They’ve won the technology side. They’ve won on the business-model side, and they’re going to win on the Gen AI cycle.” Overall dividends are becoming increasingly popular among investors, with many US companies either raising or maintaining their payouts. Howard Silverblatt, a Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, suggested that with an anticipated reduction in interest rates by the FOMC in 2025, coupled with record earnings forecasted for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the entire year of 2025, companies might allocate more funds towards substantial dividend hikes in the upcoming year. He further mentioned that February, traditionally the peak month for dividend increases, is expected to see even more significant growth as some firms may look to compensate for previous conservative strategies. In 2024, the large-cap companies in the broader market outperformed many others, achieving record levels in earnings, sales, and dividends. For 2025, a projected 8% rise in dividend payments is expected, up from a 6.4% increase in 2024. For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders. From that list, we picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment toward them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician in a clean room assembling a semiconductor chip using a microscope. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a global leader in semiconductor equipment manufacturing, supplying critical tools for creating advanced chips used in AI, data centers, automotive technology, and other sectors. The global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market is projected to more than double by 2032, with Applied Materials likely to be a major beneficiary of this growth. Beyond just selling its equipment, the company has seen a significant boost in revenue from its equipment servicing segment. As manufacturing equipment becomes more complex and specialized, the demand for expert maintenance continues to rise, contributing to this fast-growing part of the business. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 16%. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) reported revenue of $7.05 billion, which showed a 5% growth from the same period last year. The company’s net income for the quarter came in at $1.73 billion. Its diverse range of products and services strategically positions the company to support its customers in advancing AI and energy-efficient computing. As these critical areas of semiconductor innovation gain prominence, the industry’s progress increasingly relies on materials engineering, a field where Applied Materials holds a leading position. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) also showed a strong cash position in FY24. The company reported an operating cash flow of $8.68 billion during the year. Its free cash flow amounted to $7.5 billion. Moreover, the company returned approximately $5.01 billion to shareholders, including $1.19 billion in dividends. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for seven consecutive years. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.89%, as of January 15. Vltava Fund highlighted Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its recently published Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “In the quarter just ended, we added to the portfolio two new companies from the technology sector: Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research. Both are in the same industry as is another of our investments that we have held for some time, KLA Corporation. This industry is termed semiconductor devices and materials. One chapter in Hidden Investment Treasures is devoted to investing in technology companies and, among other things, the controversy over what really constitutes a technology company. As investors, we try to view technology companies not according to the industry into which they are formally classified but by whether the technologies and technological processes used in the production of their products and services are an essential element in value creation or if they are a source of long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Among the companies that are formally categorized as technology-based and fall into either the Information Technology or the Communications Services sector, we find some that can be said to be just that but also others for which this classification is at least debatable. Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it. In the cases of Applied Materials and Lam Research, there can be no doubt that these are technology companies not only as a formality but also in fact. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 74 funds held stakes in Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), compared with 77 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4.6 billion. Overall, AMAT ranks 6th on our list of best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for AMAT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How Hola Prime Is Changing The Future Of Prop Trading

Time Published: 2025-01-16T17:39:08Z

For decades, proprietary trading firms have been cloaked in opacity, leaving traders in the dark about critical processes like pricing, risk management, and payouts. Hola Prime is challenging the status quo. With users across 175+ countries and a suite of innovative features, the firm is redefining the future of prop trading by prioritizing transparency and creating an ecosystem tailored to the needs of modern traders. In prop trading, traders can showcase their skills without risking their own capital. They begin by participating in a firm’s challenge, trading in a demo environment to meet profit targets while staying within risk limits. Once they succeed, traders gain access to a “Funded Account,” where they trade with the firm’s capital and share the profits. Traders just pay a small fee, while the prop firm provides the platform. The firm’s business model revolves around identifying disciplined traders and mirroring their trades. By scaling up the trade volume, the firm can double the potential profit, benefiting both the trader and the firm. Hola Prime is transforming the prop trading industry by creating a transparent and trader-focused ecosystem that sets new benchmarks in the prop trading industry. Leading Hola Prime is Mr. Somesh Kapuria, the firm’s Managing Director and CEO, whose extensive experience in Forex and securities spans decades. A former senior executive at Citibank, New York, and Blackrock, Mr. Kapuria consistently drove revenue growth and spearheaded innovations widely adopted by Wall Street asset managers. “When we launched Hola Prime, it wasn’t about starting just another prop trading firm,” Mr. Kapuria shares. “It was about giving traders a fair shot, free from hidden costs and confusing practices. We’re not just fixing problems; we’re reshaping the future of trading. When traders win fairly, we win too.” Prop trading is not a regulated industry, as of today. But Hola Prime has taken a proactive approach by establishing a dedicated Risk and Compliance Department. This is unheard of in the industry. The purpose of this Department is to ensure that the internal policies at Hola Prime are as robust as they can be, and are always complied with. This Department ensures that there are Daily Accounts Reconciliations, payouts are always accurate and available for processing, and there are always additional funds available for cushion. It also ensures strong KYC and AML implementation, seamless Order flow management into live markets, along with effective management of the firm's market risk, at all times. This approach helps in building a sustainable business with a solid foundation, and builds deep trust with the customers. Prop trading has historically faced criticism for its lack of clarity, especially in pricing and execution. Traders often question whether they’re being treated fairly, but finding answers has been difficult. This absence of transparency erodes trust and causes trust deficit. Recognizing this gap, Hola Prime stepped up with an innovative solution - the Price Transparency Report. By providing traders with tick-by-tick data compared against market benchmarks, Hola Prime empowers them to verify the integrity of pricing and execution. “We are proud to be the first and the only prop firm to publish a Price Transparency Report,” says Mr. Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Risk and Compliance at Hola Prime. “This report is just as crucial for us as it is for our traders, as it guarantees that our liquidity providers offer prices that are in line with the market, fostering accountability at every level,” he adds. “We share this report with all active traders, and we’re proud to report a 99.63% match rate between our data and leading market benchmarks,” Mr. Ashutosh continued. “With over 10 million price ticks analyzed every month, we ensure that our pricing accuracy and transparency remains unmatched in the industry.” Unlike many competitors, Hola Prime was designed by traders who have experienced the pain points of traditional prop trading firsthand. This insider perspective has enabled the firm to create solutions that directly address these challenges - from delayed payouts to insufficient risk management tools. Mr. Somesh Kapuria, Managing Director and CEO, Hola Prime “Our mission is simple - to eliminate uncertainty for traders and empower them to focus on strategy and execution,” says Mr Somesh Kapuria. “Every feature we’ve developed is rooted in feedback from our global trading community” he adds. Payout delays have long been a sore spot for prop traders. Hola Prime tackles this head-on with its industry-leading 1-hour payout system, with over 99% success rate. For traders, this means no more waiting days to access their hard-earned profits. “We follow a 10-point payout system and complete our calculations at the end of each day to ensure payouts are ready promptly,” says Ms. Sumedha, CFO at Hola Prime. “Our average payout time is just 45 minutes. Our partnerships with PSPs, including Paypal, Rise and some crypto PSPs, are integral. These PSPs offer fast and reliable transfers, enabling quick multi-currency and multi-network payments for traders who prefer crypto withdrawals" she adds. Furthermore, Ms Sumedha reveals, “Hola Prime has launched Hola Prime Visa Cards, now available as a standard payout withdrawal method for all traders. The cards provide effortless access to earnings, allowing traders to make online purchases, shop in-store, and withdraw cash from ATMs. This innovative payout method is designed to provide a smooth and hassle-free experience for all Hola Prime traders.” Hola Prime is committed to providing traders with the tools they need to succeed in a competitive market. The firm offers funding options of up to $300K, with the potential to scale accounts to $4 million, ensuring traders have access to the capital they need to execute their strategies effectively. The firm emphasizes a lot on education and continuous improvement. Through extensive training resources and expert guidance, Hola Prime equips traders with the knowledge and skills to refine their strategies and make informed decisions. Hola Prime’s innovative features extend beyond technology. The firm has introduced a 95% reward structure and a 200% fee reimbursement policy, designed to reduce financial risks and foster a supportive trading environment. “Our focus is on creating a safer and more reliable trading environment,” says Mr. Kapuria. “By integrating advanced risk management measures and leveraging technology, we aim to support traders in their journey of growth and success.” The prop trading industry has long operated in a cloud of ambiguity, leaving many traders uncertain about fairness and reliability. Hola Prime is addressing these challenges head-on, redefining the industry with its emphasis on transparency, efficiency, and trader empowerment. With a clear and equitable framework, Hola Prime offers traders access to industry-leading platforms, innovative tools, and unparalleled support systems, in addition to 24/7 Live Human Customer Support. By prioritizing fairness and innovation, the firm is setting many new standards for prop trading — that benefit traders and the industry as a whole. Hola Prime’s transformative approach to prop trading is paving the way for a more transparent and equitable future. By combining cutting-edge technology, proactive risk management, and a commitment to trader success, the firm is empowering traders to thrive in an ever-evolving market.

By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -TikTok's fortunes took a positive turn on Thursday as a growing number of U.S. officials said its Chinese owner should have more time to sell the app and stop it from being banned ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House. Trump's incoming national security adviser said the new Republican administration will keep the social media app used by 170 million Americans alive in the U.S. if there is a viable deal and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer urged President Joe Biden to extend by 90 days a deadline to shut it down on Sunday. A law passed in April mandates TikTok's owner, ByteDance, divest TikTok's U.S. assets by Sunday to a non-Chinese buyer, or be banned on national security concerns. "We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark," U.S. Representative Mike Waltz told Fox News, pointing to a provision in the law allowing for a 90-day extension if there is "significant progress" toward a divestiture. "Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going," said Waltz, who was picked by Trump to be his national security adviser. A White House official said on Thursday the Biden administration does not plan to enforce the ban on Sunday leaving it up to the Trump administration, though it is not clear if the app will remain online absent a formal extension. "Given the timing of when it goes into effect over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement," the official said. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday absent a divestiture, overturn the law or pause it to give the justices more time to make a decision. The court said it may issue rulings on Friday, but as is customary, did not state which case or cases would be decided. Trump once supported a ban on the app but changed his stance last year. His shift came amid growing signs of support for his presidential campaign among tech executives and overtures from Republican donor Jeff Yass, who owns a big share of ByteDance. In a sign of warming ties between Trump and TikTok, the video app's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, will attend the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 and be seated on the dais among other high-profile invitees, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. BIPARTISAN SHIFT "It's clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans,” Schumer said on the Senate floor, adding that Democrats tried to pass a bill extending the deadline to find a solution to 270 days. "I will work with the Trump administration and with both parties to keep TikTok alive while protecting our national security," he added. The comments by Schumer, who was a strong supporter of the law to force a sale, are a sign of the growing concern among prominent Democrats about the potential impact and political fallout of shutting down TikTok. The New York Times (NYSE:NYT) reported Trump is considering an executive order that would seek to allow TikTok to continue operating despite a pending legal ban until new owners are found. It was not immediately clear if Trump has the authority to do so given the legal divestiture requirements imposed by Congress. TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Trump transition, Karoline Leavitt, said, "President Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to save TikTok, and there's no better deal maker than Donald Trump." 'TALKS A BIG GAME' Still, several Republicans and Democrats remain concerned about Chinese ownership of the app, worried the Chinese government could use it as a tool to collect data on U.S. citizens and to spread propaganda to the public. "Trump talks a big game on China & wanted to ban TikTok - just like many Republicans voted to do," Representative Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, wrote on the social media platform X. "But now he's inviting TikTok's CEO to sit beside him at his inauguration even though TikTok is linked to the CCP & is a threat to our national security. What message does this send?" The prospect of a TikTok ban has already triggered some users to seek alternatives, with Chinese social media app RedNote gaining nearly 3 million U.S. users in one day earlier this week, according to analytics firm Similarweb (NYSE:SMWB). Reuters reported that TikTok plans to shut U.S. operations of its social media app on Sunday barring a last-minute reprieve, according to people familiar with the matter. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States.
