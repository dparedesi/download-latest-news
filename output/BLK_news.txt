Title: 'No excuse' as to why Spiritan redress scheme not started

Ailbhe Conneely Social Affairs & Religion Correspondent The Spiritan Order has been accused of further traumatising victims and survivors of child sex abuse, by failing to implement the Independent Restorative Justice Framework it announced three years ago. The advocacy group Restore Together which represents many of victims/survivors of Dublin's Blackrock College and Willow Park School, Rockwell College, St Mary's College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College, has pointed to a lack of urgency by the order in completing the programme. The Spiritan Restorative Justice Framework has six elements including an apology, therapy, testimony (truth telling), redress, memorialisation and restorative justice. Just half of those have been activated in full according to Restore Together. The redress scheme and the truth searching process - to help the Spiritans and Irish society learn from the abuse scandal - has yet to be agreed and started. The last element (physical and other forms of memorialisation at Spiritan schools), will not be implemented until the other elements are activated and progressed. The restorative framework, which is independently managed, has the potential to be a ground-breaking development in Irish social justice if fully implemented, according to the group. It has described it as "progressively designed" to address the traumas of abuse in a holistic, collaborative and non-adversarial manner, to help people to heal and get justice, and to rebalance the power between victim and perpetrator. In a statement it said there was "no excuse" for not having all six elements implemented by now. Spokesperson Philip Freddis said the group "can't get a meeting" to discuss the status of the redress scheme and the other elements of the framework. He pointed out that those suffering are mainly in their 60s or older, "so we are deep into overtime". In June, the order said it realised that time was of the essence for those awaiting an announcement of a redress scheme. It acknowledged that the pace of putting the necessary framework for "overhauling and restructuring the assets of the Province" had been slow. It expressed hope that "a more detailed update of progress" would be issued by the end of the summer. Mr Freddis said the full Restorative Justice Framework "must be delivered in a timely way" or its benefit would be "diluted or even lost" if people had to wait and fight for every element of it. "Why after all these years, is there a lack of urgency and why must we be made to appeal, plead, fight and ultimately wait for justice like this? "We can only conclude that there is a lack of understanding, empathy and prioritisation by the Spiritans for their victims/survivors," he said.

Blackrock College in Dublin. Photo: Brian Lawless/PA Victims and survivors of child sex abuse at Spiritan schools are suffering “further trauma” due to ongoing delays in the delivery of a redress scheme, an advocacy group has said. The Spiritan schools involved are Blackrock College and Willow Park School, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College, all in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. The advocacy group Restore Together has said there is a “lack of urgency” in the setting up of an agreed redress scheme. Restore Together spokesperson Philip Feddis said the group was told in June that it would have an update by the end of the summer, but has not been able to hold a meeting to discuss the status of the redress scheme or other elements of a restorative framework. "We were told in June that we would have an update by the end of the summer, but currently we cannot even get a meeting to discuss the status of the Redress Scheme and the other elements of the Restorative Justice Framework that was announced no less than three years ago,” he said. "It is not acceptable to victims/survivors because justice delayed is justice denied. Blackrock College in Dublin. Photo: Brian Lawless/PA Today's News in 90 Seconds - October 3rd “It is over four years since we first engaged with the Spiritans on this scandal. The people suffering are mainly in their 60s or older, so we are deep into overtime. "The full Restorative Justice Framework must be delivered in a timely way or its benefit will be diluted or even lost if people are made to wait and fight for every element of it.” A restorative framework was first announced by the Spiritans in 2022, and according to Restore Together would be a “groundbreaking development in Irish social justice” if fully implemented. "Restore Together say there is no excuse for not having all six elements of the programme implemented by now considering it is decades after children were abused, over four years since Restore Together first met the Spiritans and three years since the Restorative Justice Framework itself was announced,” the group said in a statement. It said the delivery of a redress scheme, instead of individuals having to go to court, is a “particularly important element” of the promised programme, and just three of the six elements of the programme have been implemented. These elements include apology, therapy and counselling, and restorative justice services. Along with the redress scheme, Restore Together said a truth searching and gathering process is yet to be agreed, which would help the Spiritans and Irish society “learn from the abuse scandal”. The last element, physical and other forms of memorialisation at Spiritan schools, will not be implemented until the other five elements have been progressed. “There is no argument about the need to address the wrongs that continue to harm us or how it should be done,” Mr Feddis said. “So why, after all these years, is there a lack of urgency and why must we be made to appeal, plead, fight and ultimately wait for justice like this? We can only conclude that there is a lack of understanding, empathy and prioritisation by the Spiritans for their victims/survivors.” The Spiritans have been contacted for comment.

Title: Hyperliquid Still Best-Positioned Perp DEX Despite Aster’s Surge, DeFi Analyst Says
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/03/hyperliquid-still-best-positioned-perp-dex-despite-aster-s-surge-defi-analyst-says
Time Published: 2025-10-03T04:20:33Z
Full Content:
A new thesis from DeFi analyst Patrick Scott argues that despite losing market share to rivals, Hyperliquid remains the most investable decentralized exchange for perpetual futures. Perpetual futures — or perps — are crypto derivatives that allow traders to speculate on prices without an expiry date. The decentralized platforms that host them, known as perp DEXes, have surged in popularity as traders move activity away from centralized exchanges (CEXes) such as Binance. Scott noted that perp DEXes have expanded from less than 2% of CEX perpetual trading volume in 2022 to more than 20% last month. Hyperliquid, which issues the HYPE token, has been a key driver of that growth. Still, recent shifts have raised questions. Hyperliquid’s share of perp DEX volume fell from 45% to just 8% in recent weeks, while Binance-affiliated rival Aster ballooned to more than $270 billion in weekly trades. Other upstarts such as Lighter and edgeX also posted triple-digit percentage gains in activity. Scott argued that Hyperliquid’s fundamentals set it apart. The exchange continues to generate strong revenue, trading at what he described as a reasonable multiple compared to peers, with user stickiness reflected in open interest. “Unlike volume and revenue, which measure activity, open interest measures liquidity. It’s much stickier,” he wrote, noting Hyperliquid still commands about 62% of the perp DEX open interest market. Beyond trading, Scott highlighted expansion plans including the HyperEVM network, already hosting over 100 protocols and $2 billion in total value locked and USDH, a stablecoin backed by reserves held with BlackRock and Superstate. Another initiative, HIP-3, would allow builders to launch new perps markets by staking large amounts of HYPE, creating what Scott described as a “supply sink” for the token. Scott cautioned that his thesis would be invalidated if Hyperliquid’s open interest or revenue dropped materially, or if USDH failed to gain liquidity over the next year. But for now, he maintains Hyperliquid is better positioned than competitors running heavy incentive programs.

Title: Saudi considers removing foreign investor restrictions on stocks
URL: https://www.semafor.com/article/10/03/2025/saudi-considers-removing-foreign-investor-restrictions-on-stocks
Time Published: 2025-10-03T02:37:04Z
Full Content:
Saudi Arabia is preparing to lift restrictions on foreign investors buying local stocks, in the latest step by regulators to boost trading on the Tadawul exchange. The Capital Market Authority (CMA) launched a 30-day consultation on rules that, if approved, would scrap the so-called Qualified Foreign Investor (QFI) program, which forces international investors to meet certain criteria before they can trade. The proposal would also eliminate a swap program used by foreigners to access the market indirectly. The CMA said the move was part of a âgradual approach to opening the marketâ designed to attract âgreater flows of foreign capital.â It hinted that further measures would follow to increase international participation. In this article: Following on from moves announced last week, removing the QFI program signals that Saudi Arabia is getting serious about taking steps to attract foreign cash, even if the latest announcement sparked some confusion. The QFI program was introduced a decade ago as the kingdomâs first step to open its exchange to global money, initially requiring participants to have at least $5 billion of assets under management. At the time, regulators worried about an influx of âhot moneyâ entering and exiting quickly. No longer. Criteria have been eased several times since then as the kingdom increasingly sees the need to court foreign capital. Saudi Arabia has a big pipeline of companies planning to list on the stock market, many with government ownership. To digest all this new supply of shares the market will need to attract as many investors as possible. That should also help boost liquidity. Low volumes of trading has been a common bugbear for foreign investors looking at investing in Tadawul. There are now around 4,500 registered QFIs on the Saudi exchange, including some of the worldâs biggest fund managers: including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and JPMorgan Asset Management. Once the latest amendments to the rules are finalized anyone around the world will be able to quickly start investing in the Saudi market. Some investors were confused that the draft rules published Wednesday evening still contained references to a foreign ownership cap that was set to be amended. Dumping the QFI regime is the start. Next would be changes to foreign ownership limits, which are currently capped at 49%, two people familiar with the plans said. The CMA is reportedly working on a proposal to adjust that cap, though currently foreigners hold only about 11% of the market and no single stock is anywhere near the limit. Market reaction to the QFI consultation was muted, in contrast to the buying spree triggered by potential lifting of foreign ownership limits. But that was probably overdone. Saudi companies will still need to demonstrate strong earnings growth amid a public sector showing signs of slower spending if they are to truly attract more foreign capital.

Title: Meta Superintelligence Labs executives are pushing staff to ditch slow internal systems for faster engineering tools

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Meta's Superintelligence Labs is trying to speed up AI development by steering its teams toward new tools that allow developers to build and test products more quickly, according to internal memos obtained by Business Insider. The shift highlights the stakes of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's massive bet on AI. Over the past year, Meta has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into luring top researchers with nine-figure pay packages and reorganized its AI work under the new Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Now, its new leaders are revamping the internal engineering tools that those teams use — a shift that underscores the urgency with which Meta is moving as it races to catch up with rivals like OpenAI and Google. Internal documents show that MSL's Product and Applied Research (PAR) group, led by former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, is pushing staff away from Meta's slower, home-grown infrastructure toward mainstream developer platforms like Vercel. One memo from late September notes that Meta's existing systems, designed for billions of users and giant engineering teams, take "too long" to deploy changes and are "not conducive to vibe coding," making it harder for small, fast-moving AI teams to experiment. The practice of vibe coding, or having AI tools write code, is becoming more widespread among engineers in the tech industry. Meanwhile, Meta is also building an internal alternative called "Nest" that will integrate more easily with Meta's data for quick experimentation. Another internal post shows that Meta has paired Vercel with GitHub, a widely used code-hosting and collaboration platform owned by Microsoft, to give its PAR teams a faster way to work. Friedman and Alexandr Wang, Meta's new chief AI officer, are investors in Vercel. Vercel has become one of the biggest names in the market for building web and AI apps. In September, it raised $300 million at a $9.3 billion valuation from backers including Accel, Singapore's GIC, BlackRock, Khosla Ventures, and General Catalyst. The company's customers include giants like Netflix, Adobe, and Stripe. The memos offer a rare glimpse into how Meta is trying to accelerate its AI ambitions by relying on outside development and engineering tools, and sidestepping the limitations of its own systems that were built for a different era. Meta declined to comment. Vercel and GitHub did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. In one of the memos sent in late September, Aparna Ramani, head of infrastructure for MSL, told staff that the company's internal systems, which were built to support billions of users and massive teams of developers, don't work well for the small, fast-moving engineering teams inside PAR. "Deploying changes takes too long (hours vs. minutes), and the overall tech stack is not conducive to vibe coding," Ramani wrote. In other words, engineering tasks that would be quick and easy to deploy elsewhere often require more manual work at Meta, slowing teams down. Ramani's memo outlines a plan with two approaches to quickly build app prototypes and reduce deployment times from 99 minutes to two minutes or less. The first approach uses Vercel, which, Ramani wrote, is "widely used and can unblock MSL immediately." She wrote that Vercel is willing to work with Meta to mitigate some data and hosting restrictions. Ramani also wrote that Meta already has one tool running on Vercel, with multiple other projects in development. The second approach is to build an internal platform called "Nest" for hosting apps built with TypeScript — a popular Microsoft-created programming language widely used across the industry — on Meta's systems. Ramani wrote that a working prototype was expected within two weeks of the memo. Nest will eventually become the "de facto" option, and keeping Vercel available provides "an escape valve where there are capability gaps," the memo said. A second internal memo, published on September 17, shows how Meta used Vercel with GitHub to provide its PAR teams with a faster way to build and prototype apps. Meta is already running 10 projects on Vercel and GitHub, which could now be updated "in minutes," the post said. Meta has often turned to outside technology when its own tools fall short. Earlier this year, Business Insider reported that Meta rolled out an internal coding assistant called Devmate that uses AI models from rivals, including Anthropic's Claude, after employees said Meta's own Llama AI model struggled with complex tasks. Meta has also recently launched a feature called Vibes, which uses Midjourney, an external AI image generator, rather than its own image-generation technology. Friedman is an advisor to Midjourney.

Nick Lichtenberg is business editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Ford CEO Jim Farley gathered a host of experts this week to discuss what he calls “the essential economy,” the blue-collar backbone that he sees mired in crisis. AT&T CEO John Stankey and FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam talked about how AI is impacting manufacturing and how they’re hustling to stay ahead of the curve; Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a sober warning about how China could “dominate” if we’re not careful with our auto industry; and even JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon appeared via video to urge America not to become a “nation of compliance and box-checking.” But during the keynote discussion with Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and Mike Rowe of the Mike Rowe Works Foundation, Farley revealed how his own family is being impacted. “My son worked as a mechanic this summer,” Farley said while moderating. Then, Farley added, his son said something that stunned both of his parents: “Dad, I really like this work. I don’t know why I need to go to college.” Farley said he and his wife looked at each other and wondered, “Should we be debating this?” It’s something that’s happening in a lot of American households, he noted. “It should be a debate.” Rowe, a longtime vocational advocate, seized on data showing that while two skilled tradespeople enter the workforce, five retire each year. The imbalance, he explained, is “the math that’s catching up to us” as the baby boomer generation ages and birth rates fall. Rowe cited data from his own life. His own degree cost $12,200 in 1984, he said, whereas today it would cost something like $97,000. “Nothing in the history of Western civilization has gotten more expensive, more quickly,” Rowe said. “Not energy, not food, not real estate, not even health care, [nothing has been inflated more] than the cost of a four-year degree.” The Associated Press reported that, yes, many colleges were charging roughly $95,000 per year as of April 2024, but the financial aid system lowers that in practice. Still, it’s by and large true that inflation for college tuition, health care, and housing costs has far outpaced that for, say, televisions, toys, and software, showing Rowe is making a solid point. With costs this high, the value proposition of college is under serious scrutiny. Fortune has reported on several Gen Z entrepreneurs who dove straight into the trades instead of going to college. One, at 23, was already his own boss and making more than $100,000 per year, and the other, 19, was working his way up to it. Both of them had side hustles as social-media influencers, adding another revenue stream. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Arizona, said she often gives options to students that are different from a traditional four-year degree. “Our youth want to know why. Why do I need to go to college? Why do I want to get in debt? Why do I want to do these things?” She said that “because I told you so” doesn’t cut it anymore. Labor Secretary Chavez-DeRemer echoed this sentiment, saying government, educators, and industry must partner to make the skilled trades attractive to young Americans. “For far too long, we haven’t brought the right people to the table,” she said, emphasizing the need for collaboration so that “businesses are heard, and the American workforce is valued.” Chavez-DeRemer argued that if the average American wants to have a good-paying job and a mortgage, they should strongly consider the trades. She questioned: “Do you know that most of our 35- and 40-year-olds are not going to be able to buy a home anywhere near the future?” This is the time in people’s lives when they’re trying to grow their families, and the current U.S. economy does not set them up to do that, she said. She noted that trade school graduates often emerge earning more than $100,000 per year. The average tradesman will come out making about $11,000 more than a college graduate will, she said. The essential obstacle, said Rowe, is not just economics but stigma. “Stigmas and stereotypes and myths and misperceptions have conspired to keep a whole generation of kids from giving trades an honest look,” he said. Until the culture changes and people recognize the dignity and opportunity of these jobs, attempts to fill workforce gaps will be “quixotic or Sisyphean.” Asked about the fear AI and robotics might replace human workers, both panelists were optimistic. Chavez-DeRemer compared the transition to prior industrial and tech revolutions, stating: “We adapt. We are an adaptable people.” She emphasized AI should be seen as a tool that empowers, not replaces, the essential workforce. “Businesses are retraining their employees,” she said. “The R&D is showing us that [they’re] going to create new types of jobs.” Rowe added, “AI is coming for the coders, not yet for the welders,” reflecting the resiliency and growing demand in the trades. He argued every “frontline” vocation, from welding to pipe-fitting, is now seeing a boom, and AI won’t touch that. Rowe also cited remarks covered by Fortune from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang about the need for blue-collar workers to power the data-center infrastructure underlying the AI boom. He also mentioned BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s comments that his $12 trillion–plus portfolio was dependent on having enough electricians, a sector short of hundreds of thousands of workers. “The biggest CEOs in our country [are ringing] the metaphorical alarm bell,” Rowe said, calling it a “macro problem” the essential economy can solve. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: IBIT Surpasses Deribit to Become Largest Bitcoin Options Platform
URL: https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-options-etf-ibit-deribit-38-billion/
Time Published: 2025-10-02T21:15:36Z
Full Content:
Written & Edited byLandon Manning BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is currently the largest venue for BTC options trading, reaching a whopping $38 billion in open interest. The product surpassed Deribit, a derivatives exchange owned by Coinbase, to achieve this goal. This record could serve as a bullish data point for crypto ETFs, as IBIT was better-equipped to deal with setbacks last month. Still, in the long run, a TradFi takeover could cut into crypto margins. With Bitcoin options traders preparing for Uptober, it’s important to remember just how huge this market really is. Four months ago, Coinbase agreed to a $2.9 billion deal to purchase Deribit, the popular derivatives exchange, and the firm’s stock rose 37% during the negotiations. Last month, Coinbase completed this deal to make bold expansions in the Bitcoin and crypto options markets. However, the BTC ETFs are apparently even more popular than this platform, with BlackRock’s IBIT reaching a mesmerizing $38 billion in open interest: $IBIT has surpassed Coinbase's Derbit platform as the largest venue for bitcoin options with $38b in open interest. I told y'all ETFs are no joke.. Fat crypto margins in trouble. Nice find by @sidharth_shukla pic.twitter.com/LUcnpW5g4I Experts already called IBIT the “greatest launch in ETF history,” but this really puts the asset’s prominence in perspective. Even while Bitcoin ETFs saw institutional outflows and deflated gains in September, this single product has still come to dominate the options market. To be fair, the graph clearly shows that Deribit’s open interest fell sharply in the last few days, which is an important component of this crossover. A record-breaking $21 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options expired last week, creating a huge stress-test for derivatives exchanges. Still, this evidently wasn’t a comparable problem for ETFs. This data point is a handy piece of evidence supporting ETFs’ growing stature. Both IBIT and Deribit faced important setbacks last month, but the ETF has apparently weathered them more effectively. Considering that a flood of altcoin ETFs may hit the markets after the US government shutdown ends, this could be very useful information. Regardless of which venue is more successful, this high open interest for Bitcoin options trading is a bullish signal. While BTC’s price continues to rise, the markets show a diversified appetite. Still, there might be some potential downsides to this approach. As TradFi institutions like BlackRock become the preferred vehicles for Bitcoin options trading, it may become harder to achieve the same rapid price gains that crypto is famous for.

Δ “Tokenization is like a freight train. It can’t be stopped, and eventually it’s going to eat the entire financial system,” Vlad Tenev told a panel at a cryptocurrency conference in Singapore on Wednesday (Oct. 1). “I think most major markets will have some framework in the next five years,” said Tenev, whose comments were reported by CNBC. The CEO added that reaching 100% could take more than a decade. As that report notes, a tokenized asset is a digital representation of a real-world asset, such as stocks, bonds or commodities, that can be recorded and traded on a blockchain. Robinhood in June began offering more than 200 tokenized U.S. stocks to customers in the European Union, bringing the company’s stock to what was then a record high. “I think it will become the default way to get exposure to U.S. stocks outside the U.S.,” Tenev said, adding that he expects the practice to expand after there is more clarity around licensing and regulations throughout the world.

Beyond Robinhood’s launch of tokenized stocks, the CNBC report points out that there have been other indications of tokenization’s growing popularity, with financial sector titans Morgan Stanley and BlackRock expressing interest. “I actually think cryptocurrency and traditional finance have been living in two separate worlds for a while, but they’re going to fully merge,” Tenev said at the event. Tenev is not alone in forecasting the transformative effect of tokenization. As covered here last month, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has said tokenized money and assets could reshape monetary policy and payments. “A BIS study said a tokenized, unified ledger run by public authorities could replicate stablecoin benefits without private-coin risks,” PYMNTS wrote. “The BIS and Federal Reserve Bank of New York also co-authored experimental work showing how smart contracts might automate liquidity operations and policy transmission.” The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, has emphasized the need for interoperable standards on settlement finality, identity and dispute resolution to make sure tokenization scales responsibly. “Together, these projects underscore how public authorities aim to integrate tokenization into regulated infrastructures while private firms race ahead with commercial deployments,” that report concluded.

Title: Humphreys campaign trail: ‘Wee selfies’, spirit of Big Tom and Fianna Fáil voters

In Blackrock, Co Louth - reigning tidiest small town in Ireland, they’ll have you know - an older man snaps an errant piece of litter with his picker and shoves it into a bag. He glances down the frightfully clean path as the mobile melee that is a presidential campaign rolls into the seaside village The branded Heather Humphreys cars, bright yellow campaign jackets, the colourfully dressed candidate herself, and the not insignificant cohort of media orbiting her has roused the little village from its mid-morning slumber. A woman driving down the main street shrugs gamely at the camera crews and journalists, who stop traffic as they trail across the road after the candidate. Humphreys strides into The Village Garden cafe, a pretty coffee shop on Blackrock’s main thoroughfare, and brings the whole media kit and kaboodle with her. Spoonfuls of overnight oats and coffee cups hang in the air as the stunned patrons watch the national media overwhelm what had been, until moments ago, a peaceful coffee shop. In their surprised glee to meet her, husband and wife John and Catherine Pepper, natives of Blackrock, wrangle Humphreys for a chat. After a quick search in the depths of a handbag, a bit of paper is produced, and John insists that Humphreys sits down and signs a message to each of their children: Seán and Meábh who live locally, and Sienna who is out in Dubai. “And do one more,” he tells her, for a grandchild not yet born. “I wanted them to be the first in Blackrock and Dubai to have the president’s autograph,” John explains. Humphreys helped John, who is visually impaired, into the seat beside her along with his white cane. “It would be a terror if I collapsed beside the president,” he told her. [ On the canvass with Jim Gavin in Roscommon and Catherine Connolly in BallyfermotOpens in new window ] John, who is a lifelong Fianna Fáil supporter, assured Humphreys: “If I still had my faculties, I’d be out campaigning for you.” He explains to The Irish Times that he had canvassed for “Albert and for Charlie,” but would break the habit of a lifetime and vote for Humphreys instead of for Fianna Fáil. “And if I had my sight, I’d be campaigning for her. That’s what she means to me,” John said. Out on the prom, another Soldier of Destiny was pledging his support for Humphreys. Declan Breathnach, the former Fianna Fáil TD for Louth, has known Humphreys for years through local and national politics. They even danced together back in the day, though Breathnach says Humphreys had “two left feet”. But why would a former Fianna Fáil politician not support Jim Gavin? “I don’t know Jim Gavin, I suppose. And when you know somebody and know them on a very personal basis, I think it’s incumbent on you to say what you feel.” On Fianna Fáil’s presidential campaign in general, Breathnach says “there was a lot of dithering [that] went on within the organisation, and I’m sure that Billy Kelleher saw that as well”. Fine Gael couldn’t have crafted a canvass that suited Humphreys more. The visit to Blackrock revolved around the diligent Tidy Towns committee and, of course, the local credit union. Tidy Towns in Blackrock seems to be something akin to a local sport, or maybe a religion. [ Heather Humphreys denies Simon Harris pressured her to drop disability reformsOpens in new window ] The committee effusively thanked Humphreys for pushing for the competition to continue during Covid-19 when she was the minister responsible for community development. Blackrock manages a “voluntary” ban on election posters, which every candidate has known better than to breach. Mary Murtagh of Louth Tidy Towns together thanked Humphreys for her compliance. “It’s the cable ties,” Mary says, visibly wincing at the thought of them. Humphreys recalls how her grandmother would bring her to Blackrock on her holidays. “And we had the tea in a flask, and we had the sandwiches on the beach, weather permitting!” Someone produces a sprig of literal heather for her. “I’ve me bit of heather,” Humphreys says, as she fusses to pin it to her lapel, “heather for the Heather!” People are leaning out of passing car windows to pledge first preferences. There are “wee selfies,” everyone is citing whatever Monaghan relation they can think of (“your mother must have been good stock so!”) and the spirit of the late county and western star Big Tom is invoked more than once. “I knew him well,” Humphreys told a voter emolliently, “he was a gentle man, and a gentle giant”. As is compulsory any time Humphreys visits a town, she also goes into the local Connect Credit Union to approvingly survey it and its comparatively low rate of written-off loans. “Must be very decent people in Blackrock,” Humphreys, who used to work as a credit union manager, says. In nearby Ardee, Humphreys graciously makes impressed noises when shown around the town’s run-down, cobweb strewn castle; which the local community has been loyally trying to restore for over a decade. “It will be lovely when it’s finished,” Humphreys says, generously. She also calls into a Men’s Shed in Slane, where she tried her hand at working a circular saw. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Premium ETF Heads To Nasdaq In SEC Filing

Time Published: 2025-10-02T13:30:04Z
Full Content:
Nasdaq has filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to list the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, a product designed to generate income by selling options on bitcoin-linked holdings. The proposal was submitted on September 30, 2025, and the SEC has opened a comment period as part of its review. According to the Nasdaq filing, the Trust will hold primarily bitcoin, shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), cash, and the premiums earned from written options on IBIT or on indices that track spot bitcoin ETPs. The product is described as an actively-managed exchange-traded product that the sponsor intends to be treated as a publicly-traded partnership for US federal tax purposes. The filing also sets a minimum of 80,000 Shares required to be outstanding at commencement, and lists trading hours from 4:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. BlackRock’s move follows a wider push by asset managers to offer income-style crypto products. Reports have disclosed that the new ETF would collect premiums by writing covered calls, a strategy meant to produce regular distributions for investors who want yield rather than pure price exposure. Analysts quoted in market coverage say the approach limits upside in strong rallies but can smooth returns when bitcoin moves sideways or down. Covered calls are straightforward in concept but not without risk. The Trust would hold IBIT and bitcoin while selling call options against those holdings to collect premiums. If the calls are exercised early, the filing says IBIT shares may be delivered out to the options clearer; certain OTC options would be cash-settled. That mix of physical holdings and options income is intended to create a yield-focused product that behaves differently from a spot ETF. Market watchers note this is not BlackRock’s first bitcoin product. Based on reports, IBIT has already become a major vehicle for US investors since its launch, reaching large asset levels quickly and helping to normalize bitcoin exposure inside regulated funds. That track record likely makes it easier for BlackRock to pitch a second, income-focused offering to both retail and institutional audiences. The next steps are procedural but important. The SEC’s notice solicits public comments and will consider whether the proposed listing satisfies Nasdaq’s Rule 5711(d) and investor-protection standards. If the SEC requires changes — for example on disclosure around OTC options or daily NAV dissemination — Nasdaq and BlackRock would have to respond before trading can begin.

Title: Robinhood CEO: Here’s when the tokenisation ‘freight train’ will shake up the $115tn stock market

About us Copy link Bringing stocks, bonds, and just about every other financial asset onchain is inevitable. At least according to Robinhood CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev. “Tokenisation is like a freight train,” Tenev told a captive audience at this year’s Token2049 crypto confab in Singapore. “It’s going to eat the entire financial system.” During a fireside panel in the Marina Bay Sands convention centre, the 38-year-old entrepreneur unpacked how the $127 billion stock trading app is positioning itself to tap the burgeoning tokenisation niche. In June, Tenev announced the launch of over 200 tokenised stocks on Arbitrum, a Ethereum layer 2 network, for its users in Europe. The launch also included tokenised equity in private companies, such as Tesla and OpenAI. But when will tokenised stocks become available in the US and then globally? “Most major markets will have some framework in the next five years,” Tenev said. “I think a hundred per cent? That might take a decade or more.” For years, turning traditional financial assets into cryptocurrencies has been pitched as a key upgrade to financial markets. The technology ostensibly eliminates intermediaries and streamlines back offices required for trading equities and other assets. Despite these perceived advantages, it has yet to take hold in a meaningful way. The entire tokenisation market is worth $32 billion, according to rwa.xyz. Meanwhile, the global public stock market is valued at more than $115 trillion as of 2023, according to the World Economic Forum. Still, companies — on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley — are working to close that gap. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Apollo, and other stalwart asset managers are actively tapping blockchain technologies to tokenise various fund products. Elsewhere, crypto firms, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, and Kraken are moving to offer tokenised stock trading, too. The enthusiasm comes amid key market structure legislation winding its way through the halls of the US Congress. Draft bills outline which financial agency will regulate newer asset classes, such as tokenised stocks and cryptocurrencies alike. The House Clarity Act passed in July, while the Senate version is still being debated. Ultimately, lawmakers will merge the two versions before executing a vote as early as the end of the year. Thanks to the European Union’s comprehensive crypto rulebook, known as Markets in Crypto-Assets, the continent has a slight lead in terms of crypto adoption — for now. “Unfortunately, but realistically, the US will probably be somewhat behind,” Tenev said. “The US will probably be the last economy to fully tokenise. But it’s inevitable. “ Liam Kelly is DL News Berlin-based DeFi Correspondent. Got a tip? Email at liam@dlnews.com.

More Info BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners is negotiating the acquisition of power utility AES in a deal that could be worth $38 billion. That would make the tie-up one of the largest in history involving a public power utility in the United States, per Reuters. Media reports on the news cited sources in the know that remained unnamed and that said the deal included AES’s substantial debt load, at $29 billion, per the Financial Times. Its market capitalization, on the other hand, was valued at $9.4 billion at the time the first reports about the talks surfaced. Later, Reuters said AES’s market cap has risen to $10.94 billion, giving the potential deal a total value of over $40 billion. The reports suggest that BlackRock’s approach is related to the strong growth in electricity demand coming from the booming IT sector thanks to artificial intelligence development and the rush to build data centers to handle AI. AES gas spent a substantial sum of money over the past few years on building low-carbon generation infrastructure, namely wind and solar installations, to supply Big Tech majors concerned about their green energy credentials. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that AES had become the subject of takeover interest from large investment firms and was studying a sale. At the time, the enterprise value of the company was calculated at some $40 billion. It has electricity supply deals with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, among others. As of July, however, the company’s stock was down 38%. As of this week, the stock is down by close to 23% over the past 12 months, but it rebounded on the news that Global Infrastructure Partners was in advanced talks for the acquisition of the company. GIP itself became part of BlacRock last year, for a price of $12.5 billion. The company currently manages some $200 billion worth of assets worldwide.

Can XRP’s recovery extend itself as RLUSD eyes $800 million? He will remain with the team in an advisory role to have more time with his family. XRP’s price slipped after the update, but it rallied soon after. Ripple Labs is set for a key leadership reshuffle by the end of the year as current CTO David Schwartz will step away from his role. However, he will join the Ripple Board of Directors. In a statement, Schwartz said he will continue to work on side projects and novel applications for the XRP Ledger. “The last few months I’ve been tinkering on the side – spinning up my own XRPL node and publishing its output data, researching other use cases for XRP (besides what Ripple is focused on), and more.” He has been with Ripple for over 13 years and is part of the founding team of the XRP Ledger. Surprisingly, Schwartz contributed to Bitcoin’s early days and was even mistaken for being Satoshi Nakamoto last year. For his part, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed his illustrious impact on the XRP community as “legend.” Source: X In another development, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, expanded by nearly $50 million after last week’s BlackRock and VanEck partnership. It has also expanded to African markets via stablecoin payment providers in the region. Overall, RLUSD’s market cap is close to hitting $800 million – Underscoring strong growth for a stablecoin that debuted last December. Meanwhile, XRP closed Tuesday’s trading session in the red, with a 1.2% price dip after Schwartz’s update. However, it soon shrugged off the loss and rallied by about 4% on Wednesday. This, after Bitcoin’s [BTC] spike on the back of the U.S government’s shutdown. Source: XRP/USDT, TradingView In fact, the altcoin has consolidated for three months on the charts. And, it could front a bullish breakout or capitulate over the next few days. Market bulls might be ready for another run too.

Title: This Working Life: ‘Patrick Kavanagh was spellbinding. He was radical. I had to get involved’

Art Agnew is a volunteer at the Patrick Kavanagh Centre and former principal of St Louis in Carrickmacross Art Agnew My father and mother were our teachers at our school in Co Louth. And my grandfather and grandmother were teachers before them. I was born in 1943 and had three older sisters and three younger sisters. I was reasonably quick at school, though my sisters were all very quick. Three sisters joined the St Louis order in Carrickmacross, one left and became a teacher. My eldest sister was a nurse. My next three sisters became teachers and my younger sister was a social worker. I was a bit young at 17 when I started my teacher training in St Pat’s in Drumcondra. I went back teaching at home in Kilcurry and in 1962 returned to Dublin and started in the Christian Brothers in Crumlin. At night we did a BA in UCD as mature students. I studied English, philosophy and economics. I loved these subjects – but my love of Kavanagh did not come from them. The thing is Kavanagh was always about. He had grown up six miles away in Inniskeen. My grandaunt Brigit had taught him. She was the Miss Moore in his semi-autobiography The Green Fool. I was teaching in Crumlin for four years. I enjoyed it – though it was challenging teaching 40 boys in one class. They ranged in ability from the very bright to those who needed help. My mother told me that if I had the opportunity to go to my Aunty Gaye in Terenure for my dinner. I used to get an hour-and-a-half lunch with the Christian Brothers and it was not too hard to get there from Crumlin. We did not finish school until 4pm then. We used to get buns on a Friday, but back then not every child was well fed, it is good they have free school meals now. I knew I was not going to spend my life teaching in Dublin. I saw a position advertised in St Louis in Carrickmacross. My sister, mother and godmother had been at school there. I got the job and I stayed until I retired in 2005. I was principal for the last seven years. I was part of the community from which the children came. Occasionally I could be dealing with pastoral care, dealing with parents – and by the time I became principal, I was familiar with many kinds of problems. The vast majority of parents were supportive, the children generally had good parents. It was very important to know the parents when the idea of special needs came in. In the past, parents were a wee bit reticent about speaking up for their kids. I remember one child who came into the office this day around 2000, with tears in her eyes. But those tears were tears of joy. “I am dyslexic,” she told me, “I knew I was not thick.” I enjoyed my work – but I won’t say I enjoyed every single day as Helen, my late wife, will confirm. I would come home and I would be exhausted. I’d sit in the armchair and not get out of it until bedtime. At those times you would have hoped you could solve a problem but you could not. The things you need are energy and patience. And a comradeship with the teaching staff, and to give people space. We had a tea-break at 10.50 – and as principal you learn not to arrive into the staff room on time. You’d give people six or seven minutes before you land in to get a cup of tea, so they could suppress their annoyances with the system. We had a strong public speaking and debating tradition in the school. We took part in debating competitions in Dublin run by university students and we got to several finals. There was one time in the Eighties when we were playing the Donegal team in basketball and we had to cross the Border. Things were a bit grim at the time. Anyway, we were stopped and were waiting for clearance. There was a female soldier and she called out that she wanted our bus searched. Who came on the bus but two young soldiers. So our head girl jokes: “You can search me.” The soldiers went scarlet, with all the girls beaming at them – and they left. We went on and we won that game. Our next game was in Cork, and then we won the All-Ireland. Helen stayed at home with our four children. With my father and mother both teaching, I thought my mother had to work too hard when I was growing up. So we survived on one salary. We did ok. I taught two of our daughters Neasa and Rosita, and they didn’t mind. Rosita was the first student in Ireland to get eight A1s in her Leaving – though she’ll kill me for bringing that up. I retired in 2005 and that meant we had time to go travelling. We went to America, twice, and all over the EU. Helen died two years ago, there is much grieving – and you have to go along with it, you have to put up with it. You have to get on with things – and having four children and 10 grandchildren is a great diversion for me. I have many photographs of Helen around the house and I include her in all my conversations. We met in the Pavilion Ballroom in Blackrock, near Dundalk, on an August Bank Holiday. It turned out she grew up five miles away from me – and at the time she lived 200 yards away from my bedsit in Dublin, and so that was that. Apart from my interest in soccer, I had a grá for poetry. I had been to a lecture Patrick Kavanagh gave in Earlsfort Terrace. He was spellbinding. He was radical. I felt it was important to get involved. In 1967, the year he died, I was teaching and doing the degree at night – but two years before that, we had called into O’Dwyers pub one night. He was there with John Jordan, James Liddy, Macdara Woods and I heard him say “the top of Parnassus is flat”. Much later I was out in Greece with Helen – and it was indeed flat. I did not go talking to him that night. He was in own company. I went to his wake on Haddington Road, but I was teaching and could not go to his funeral. I got involved with the Patrick Kavanagh Centre because my grandaunt taught him and because my mother was in the training college with his sister Celia. My sister Una has written extensively on Kavanagh. In 1998 she wrote The Mystical Imagination of Patrick Kavanagh. I’ve been active since 1980 in organising Kavanagh’s yearly weekend in late September to mark his birthday. We used to hold it in November, but the weather in Carrickmacross and Inniskeen was too poor. We held it last Sunday and there were around 70 at the graveside. People came from all over Ireland. We had a poetry workshop, the Patrick Kavanagh award and a book launch, and a panel discussion on the inevitability of art. Then after that we had a film screening of Three Irish Writers – about Kavanagh, Brendan Behan and Myles na gCopaleen. In a way it was awful to watch, they all died young enough. After that we went out to the Brew House for a story telling session and a nice beer. The Kavanagh Centre opened in 1994 in what would have been St Mary’s Church, and the cemetery is where Kavanagh’s remains rest. Monaghan County Council invested nearly €1m in refurbishing the centre – and it’s world class. The annual poetry competition has been going since the Patrick Kavanagh Society was set up in 1971. The lady who won this year was Róisín Leggett Bohan from Cork. She was good. Her poetry is like Emily Dickinson with a nip to it. When I retired, I became kitman for the under 18’s Irish soccer international team. I was in 12 European countries and Turkey. I did that until 2009. I’ve been involved with Carrick Rovers since 1968, I am on the committee and would watch the matches and that. Jack Charlton and Brian Kerr brought their Irish squads to Carrickmacross and they trained on our grounds, and Ronnie Moran also brought the Liverpool squad. I have to get out of the bed before 9am. I make porridge the night before with raisins. I add honey and a banana. I walk to the shop for the paper. I’ll have tea and toast at 11. I would go walking most days. It would depend if I had anything to do. I might call out to the Kavanagh Centre if it is busy. We have schools coming all the time when Kavanagh is on the Leaving. I used to love doing the tours, but retired from tour guiding last year. I’m also chair of the Inniskeen Development Group, though again I’m planning on retiring next month. I can get around no problem at 82. There are a few who are not as fortunate and they need visiting. You know you have to do it and you do it – and you enjoy it. I’m not spouting any wings. My mother was a great believer in putting people at ease by talking away with them. And I think I have a doctorate in trivia. When I got the teaching job in Carrickmacross, in the late Sixties, towns were encouraging people to come and live there. There were 45 serviced sites, so we applied for a bungalow and got it. And I am still there today. I can cook. I’ve always cooked. I make my lunch at home. I generally go to the butcher on a Saturday. In the winter I buy half a pound of stewing meat, a sideline chop and a pork chop and lamb liver to keep me going until Thursday, then in the fish shop I buy hake, smoked cod and mackerel to take me to Friday. Generally speaking I would go to McNallys on a Friday night and meet friends. A year and a half ago we started a ciorcal comhrá – and Irish conversation group – on Wednesday evenings in the library. There are usually between 10 to 12 of us. Tomorrow I’m getting the bus to Dublin to go to a past-pupils reunion of those boys who left in 1973. They invited me. They started in 1968 and so did I. I was happy to be invited. Many have been so supportive since Helen died. I would read a good deal at night. At the moment it’s a book on the Roman empire and Frank McNally’s Not Making Hay. He is a good armchair writer, I’m full of chuckles. I would say Spraying the Potatoes is my favourite Kavanagh poem. There is a lyrical earthiness about it. I am often asked about line: “The axle-roll of a rut-locked cart/Broke the burnt stick of noon in two.” It was never fully explained by him – but I think it was just the hint of going home for the dinner.

Wall Street indexes closed higher Wednesday, primarily boosted by the healthcare sector following Pfizer's drug price agreement with President Trump. Investors largely overlooked weaker private payrolls data and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, demonstrating historical market resilience.

Title: Bitcoin Surges Past $116K Despite U.S. Government Shutdown: Is $120K Next?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-surges-past-116k-despite-u-s-government-shutdown-is-120k-next/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin blasted through $116,000 with a 3% daily gain even as the U.S. government officially entered shutdown, its first since 2018. The political stalemate over health-care funding has 750,000 federal workers on furlough and could cost about $400 million per day, yet risk assets shook off early nerves. Crypto’s total market cap rose 3% to $4.09T, with Bitcoin leading and dominance climbing from 57% to 59%, a structure analysts say tends to produce more durable rallies than altcoin-led surges. Gold’s sprint to fresh records near $3,875–$3,895/oz underlined the flight-to-safety backdrop, but BTC’s two-day rebound from $112,000 suggests buyers are treating macro uncertainty as a dip-buying opportunity. Fueling the rally, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted $3.53 billion in net inflows in September, topped by $429.9 million on Sept. 30 (BlackRock, Ark, Fidelity leading). On-chain and derivatives data indicate healthy conditions as leverage resets after the decline, funding levels normalize, and open interest remains steady, allowing BTC to resume its upward trend. Technical analysts point to a multi-week bull flag with the price now pushing against the upper boundary, mirroring patterns seen before previous impulsive moves. Seasonality also favors the market, with “Uptober” traditionally showing strong performance after a positive September close. Telegram’s Pavel Durov even revived long-term optimism, reaffirming a $1 million BTC target driven by fixed supply versus money printing, sentiment often seen during mid-cycle expansions. In the near term, Bitcoin resistance is around $117,500. A clear reclaim and daily close above this level could pave the way toward $119,300–$120,300, with a psychological target near $ 120,000. Order-book heatmaps indicate significant short liquidity between $118,000 and $119,000 (about $7 billion), which could trigger a squeeze if this level is broken. On the downside, bulls aim to defend the $114,800–$115,200 zone first, then the $112,000 pivot identified before the bounce; below that, there’s a larger liquidity pocket at $107,000–$108,000 (roughly $8 billion in long liquidations). Analysts MN van de Poppe, Ted Pillows, and Daan Crypto Trades all agree on the same strategy: hold $112,000, break above $117,500, and then let momentum push toward new highs into Q4.

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics Wall Street’s main stock indexes have closed higher, with the biggest boost from the healthcare sector as investors looked past weaker-than-expected private payrolls data and uncertainty around the first day of the US Federal Government shutdown. With the Labor Department’s September jobs report expected to be postponed if the government has not reopened by Friday, investors were on Wednesday paying close attention to the ADP National Employment Report. ADP showed a decline in private payrolls of 32,000 and a downwardly revised 3,000 decline in August. These numbers were weaker than economist forecasts for growth of 50,000 in September and the prior report of a 54,000 advance in August. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters.

Elsewhere in economic data, the Institute for Supply Management showed US manufacturing edged towards recovery in September. After opening lower, all three main US indexes advanced. Among the S&P 500’s 11 major industry sectors, the biggest gainer was S&P 500 healthcare, boosted by pharmaceutical companies. The healthcare rally started in earnest on Tuesday after Pfizer and US President Donald Trump said they had cut a deal. The drug maker agreed to lower prescription drug prices in the Medicaid program - compared to its charges in other developed countries - in exchange for tariff relief. Trump said he expected more drug companies to follow suit. “Yesterday was the catalyst for healthcare,” said Lara Castleton, US head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors, adding that the sector was probably ripe for a rally after underperforming the rest of the market so far this year. “People have not necessarily been avoiding it, but they have not been as heavily allocated into healthcare as they have been in technology and all the AI hype,” she said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.21 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 46,441.10, the S&P 500 gained 22.74 points, or 0.34 per cent, to 6,711.20 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 95.15 points, or 0.42 per cent, to 22,755.16. The S&P 500 tech sector provided the second biggest boost for the benchmark index, with Micron rallying 8.9 per cent and the broader Philadelphia chip index adding two per cent. The sector with the biggest percentage decline during the session was materials, which ended the day down more than one per cent. The healthcare sector’s biggest gainers were Biogen, up 10.9 per cent and Thermo Fisher, up 9.4 per cent. Ms Castleton noted that equity investors appeared to be shrugging off uncertainties around the shutdown. Markets have historically been resilient during government closures. The S&P 500 rose during each of the last six shutdowns, according to a note from Deutsche Bank. During the last government closure between the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, indexes were able to advance. In individual stocks, a 16.8 per cent rally in shares of AES made it the biggest gainer in the benchmark index and a strong boost for the S&P 500 utilities sector. This was after the Financial Times reported that BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners was nearing a $US38 billion ($57b) deal to acquire the utility group. While the materials sector was broadly weaker, Lithium Americas Corp US shares rallied 23.3 per cent and rival Albemarle closed up 4.2 per cent. The US Department of Energy has taken a five per cent stake in Lithium Americas and a separate five per cent stake in the company’s joint venture with General Motors. Corteva said it would separate its seed and pesticide businesses into separate publicly traded companies, sending its shares down nine per cent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.92-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 580 new highs and 99 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 2,707 stocks rose and 2,003 fell as advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.35-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 111 new highs and 68 new lows. Volume wise, on US exchanges 19.79 billion shares changed hands compared with the 20-day moving average of 18.62 billion.

Reports of a potential acquisition helped shares of a utility company power higher, while an agricultural sciences firm faced pressure after it announced a plan to separate into two independent entities. Major U.S. equities indexes recovered from early losses to end higher on the first trading day after a federal government shutdown took effect. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Dow eked out a 0.1% gain to finish at all-time highs. The Nasdaq climbed 0.4% to finish just short of its closing record. Find the full market summary from Investopedia here. Shares of renewable energy provider AES (AES) surged nearly 17%, gaining the most of any S&P 500 stock. The push higher followed reports that Global Infrastructure Partners, owned by asset management giant BlackRock (BLK), is in talks to buy AES. The deal could be worth around $38 billion, which would make it one of the largest infrastructure takeovers ever. Pharmaceutical stocks and others in the healthcare sector extended their gains Wednesday, a day after Pfizer (PFE) became the first major drugmaker to comply with a push from the White House cut medication prices in the U.S. to the lower levels seen in other countries. According to media reports, other major pharma companies could follow Pfizer's lead and seek pricing deals with the Trump administration. Shares of Biogen (BIIB), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), Eli Lilly (LLY), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) all ranked among the benchmark index's top performers Wednesday. Shares of memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner Micron Technology (MU) advanced close to 9%, along with hard drive makers Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC). The moves extended recent gains on anticipation they could benefit from growing demand for data storage to support AI. Corteva (CTVA) shares tumbled 9.1%, logging the S&P 500's weakest performance Wednesday, after the agricultural sciences firm announced a plan to split its crop protection and its seed businesses into two independent companies. The company expects the transaction to be complete by the second half of 2026. Shares of tech-focused research firm Gartner (IT) fell 4.5%. Although the U.S. federal government accounts for less than 5% of Gartner's revenue, the government shutdown weighed on sentiment across the advisory industry. Gartner stock has also faced pressure stemming from concerns about how AI could disrupt the research business. Interpublic Group (IPG) stock lost 5% on Wednesday, reversing gains posted in the prior session after German biotech giant Bayer (BAYRY) named IPG as the exclusive creative and media partner for its consumer health business. IPG and fellow marketing firm Omnicom (OMC) announced that the regulatory approval process for their intended merger remains in progress and that they expect the deal to close by year-end. Omnicom shares also slipped 5%.

Title: Versant Lease at Former NY Times Building Occupies 164K SF

Time Published: 2025-10-01T18:29:24Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Versant, Comcast’s corporate cable channel spinoff, signed a lease over the summer for a temporary home across 164,545 square feet at the former New York Times building at 229 West 43rd Street, according to Savills’ third-quarter Manhattan office leasing report. The move, which occurred in August, marked a major milestone for MSNBC, which moved out of its headquarters and studios at NBC’s iconic 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Adweek cited a memo to the company’s staff from Jeff Mayzurk, Versant’s president of operations and technology, saying that the new location, known internally at Versant as “summer camp,” was chosen “due to its studio and production space and its central location.” Despite this, Versant considers the move temporary, and is reportedly still searching for a permanent location. The length of the lease and the asking rent were unclear, as was the reason the new location will only be temporary. When the Martha Graham Dance Company moved to neighboring 1501 Broadway in May of this year, Crain’s New York Business reported that asking rents in that building started at $58 per square foot. It is unclear who the brokers were for the Versant lease, although JLL is the building’s leasing team, according to the building’s website. The owner of the building’s office portion is Columbia Property Trust. The building’s first four floors and two below-grade ones are retail-oriented and separately owned, having been purchased in August 2025 by Forum at Times Square for just $28 million, according to Crain’s New York Business. Ironically, an adviser on that deal, Jay Miller of BayBridge Real Estate Capital, told Crain’s at the time that the location’s appeal was enhanced by the possibility of a proposed casino right across the street. Those hopes were dashed two weeks ago, as CO previously reported. The building – which occupies 682,843 square feet, according to Property Shark – served as the home of The New York Times from 1913 to 2007. It received a landmark designation in 2001, and underwent an extensive renovation around 2011. CO reported in 2022 that BuzzFeed, seeking to cut its office footprint, relocated to 107,000 square feet in the building that it planned to share with its new parent company, Complex Networks. Both companies have since relocated again, with Buzzfeed shrinking its footprint further to 42,210 square feet at 50 West 23rd Street. Columbia Property Trust, Versant Media and JLL did not immediately respond to requests for information. Larry Getlen can be reached at lgetlen@commercialobserver.com.

AES (AES) shares jumped nearly 17% Wednesday following a report the renewable energy provider is in talks to be acquired by BlackRock’s (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). The Financial Times said the purchase could be worth $38 billion, which would make it one of the largest infrastructure takeovers ever, and could be announced within days. The report noted that AES is strapped with $29 billion in debt, which would be part of the deal, and that while talks are in the advanced stage, the two sides may not come to a final agreement. AES, which has been exploring a sale among other options, also counts several big tech giants among its clients, with deals to power artificial intelligence data centers for Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT). The deal would underscore how some renewable energy providers have seen growing interest in recent months as investors bet on demand for power to support AI and cryptocurrency mining. A spokesperson for AES told Investopedia that per company policy, it does not respond to rumors in the marketplace. GIP did not respond to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication. BlackRock acquired GIP last year for $3 billion in cash and 12 million BlackRock shares, for a total of about $12.5 billion. Before that closed last October, GIP struck a $6.2 billion partnership deal to take Minnesota-based energy company Allete private. With Wednesday's gains, shares of AES have added roughly a fifth of their value this year. BlackRock shares lost 2% Wednesday, but have climbed over 11% in 2025 so far.

Title: BlackRock Expands 50 Hudson Yards HQ by Another 194K SF

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy BlackRock has expanded its New York City headquarters to more than 1.2 million square feet. The asset management company has subleased an additional 193,573 square feet at Related Companies’ 50 Hudson Yards, according to a third-quarter office report from Savills. The sublandlord was Meta, which announced it was looking to cut about 250,000 square feet from its 1.2 million-square-foot office footprint at the Hudson Yards tower in December 2022. The expansion comes after BlackRock added more than 50,000 square feet to its headquarters at 50 Hudson Yards in July 2024, which brought its total footprint at the property to roughly 1.05 million square feet, as Commercial Observer previously reported. Now, following the latest expansion, BlackRock will boast roughly 1.24 million square feet of office space across more than 15 floors at the 77-story tower. The terms of the deal were unclear, but when 50 Hudson Yards opened in 2022, asking rents ranged between $175 and $240 per square foot. During the second quarter of this year, office rents in Hudson Yards averaged $153.52 per square foot, according to a report from Avison Young. JLL‘s Peter Riguardi, Matthew Astrachan, Joseph Messina and Hannah Bernstein brokered the deal. BlackRock declined to comment, while spokespeople for Related and JLL — which has represented BlackRock in past deals — did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BlackRock signed its original lease at 50 Hudson Yards in 2016 for 20 years, with an initial commitment to occupy 850,000 square feet at the property, as CO previously reported. The asset management company has now far exceeded that commitment, joining the ranks of several high-profile tenants at the 2.9 million-square-foot office building. Those tenants include Meta, which leases space across 19 floors of the tower, and Truist Financial, which signed a deal for 100,000 square feet at the property in September 2022.

If you're new here, please click here to get my FREE 57-page investment banking recruiting guide - plus, get weekly updates so that you can break into investment banking. Thanks for visiting! If you’ve searched online for asset management interview questions, you’ve probably walked away disappointed. Yes, there are bits and pieces of information, but most “lists” are quite generic and gloss over detailed questions. Asset management interviews are like the “Generalist Olympics” because you need to know about a huge range of topics: The standard fit/behavioral questions, the firm’s investment strategies, economics and trade policy, valuation, equities and fixed income, general market knowledge, portfolio management, and more. The good news is that you don’t necessarily need to know a lot about each topic. The bad news is that it’s challenging to prepare because there’s no centralized place to learn about everything, and it’s much harder to “memorize” answers: One quick note before we begin: “Asset management” in this context refers to front-office work at firms such as Fidelity, Wellington, T. Rowe Price, and PIMCO. This means that you’ll analyze companies and entire sectors and construct portfolios for clients. “Asset management” does NOT mean wealth management, hedge funds, asset/liability management, or the commercial real estate kind of asset management (i.e., managing existing properties that your firm has acquired). Your clients could be either institutions or very-high-net-worth (VHNW) / ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) individuals. But they should not be retail investors with small amounts to invest because that’s more like wealth management. Asset management firms want candidates with great academic qualifications (university name, GPA, etc.), solid internship experience in related fields (equity research, hedge funds, etc.), and the ability to work in a team and generate new investment ideas while managing risk. But there are very few entry-level openings each year (perhaps in the low hundreds or less), and the process is unstructured. You’ll go through the usual HireVue and phone/video interviews and then complete in-person final rounds, but there’s less of a strict timeline than in fields like investment banking. This means you need to prepare far in advance, as you won’t know the exact timing of each step in the process. The following topics are most important in AM interviews: Q: Tell me about yourself / walk me through your resume. A: See our guide and examples for the “Walk me through your resume” question and the article on how to walk through your resume in buy-side interviews. To give this more of an AM spin, talk about classes, student clubs, internships that are related to the markets and investing, and how working at this firm will let you focus on a certain strategy, sector, or geography you like. Focusing on team activities also helps. Q: Why asset management? A: You’ve always liked getting a big-picture view of the market and constructing entire portfolios based on individual companies and asset classes. You also like explaining your findings and rationale and understanding clients’ concerns, so AM is perfect since it combines client work and investment analysis. Avoid day trading references; focus on using classes, books, student clubs/activities, and relevant internships to explain your interest. Q: Why our firm/group? A: As always, you need to research the group beforehand, find a few “fact sheets” about their offerings, and link these into your answer (examples for T. Rowe Price): “I’m interested in your Dividend Growth Fund because it’s the perfect mix of ‘value’ and ‘growth’ investing. I focused on value in my previous hedge fund internships, but it doesn’t perform well in all market environments; this strategy is more robust and lets us shift the portfolio in changing markets and apply traditional value screens to high-growth companies.” Q: What are your strengths and weaknesses? A: There’s a full guide to this one. For strengths, you can cite points such as technical/analytical skills, communication ability, teamwork, and the ability to make quick decisions in response to market events. For weaknesses, you can discuss points like hesitating to give harsh feedback to teammates, sometimes not pushing back on inappropriate requests, or presenting too many options to clients. These questions test whether you can do the job: Q: How would you determine the optimal asset allocation for a client? A: You’d start by asking questions about their profile first: What their existing portfolio looks like, how much they have to invest, their liquidity requirements, their risk tolerance, any investment restrictions, and how much they need to live on (individuals) or fund their required obligations (e.g., pensions). Once you have gathered this information, you would start with the key constraints and then construct a portfolio to “bridge the gap” between what they currently have and what they should ideally have. For example, if a pension fund needs to make $50 million per year in employee benefit payments, you’d recommend a mix of bonds and dividend-paying stocks that would yield annual payments comfortably above that amount. After that, you would then assess the fund’s tolerated drawdowns and allocate more to bonds or stocks depending on whether it should accept more or less risk. Alternative assets, such as real estate and private equity/hedge funds, might also be allowed, but it depends on the client type. Q: Suppose that you are building a portfolio with allocations to many different asset classes. How would it be different if you were working at a pension fund vs. a university endowment? A: Both are subject to specific liquidity requirements and may have restrictions on their allowed strategies, securities, etc. The key difference is that endowments often plan longer-term and have a higher risk tolerance because they don’t need to make specific annual payments to retired employees; they simply need to grow their university’s assets over many decades. So, you might lean toward a more traditional stock/bond mix for a pension fund, but would be more likely to consider alternatives (real estate, PE/HF investments, etc.) for an endowment, along with a higher allocation to riskier assets. Q: A client’s portfolio just fell by 20% in the most recent quarter, and he is very upset with your firm. What would you do to calm him down? A: First, you’d listen to his concerns and spend time asking follow-up questions about his feelings, what he expected vs. what happened, and how this affects his real life. Then, you’d try to reframe the losses in a way that speaks to their concerns and mindset. This varies by client type and outlook, but a few examples include: Q: What is your investment philosophy, and how does it match ours? A: This one varies by candidate and fund, but here’s an example answer: “I understand that your fund focuses on ‘value with a macro overlay,’ so you invest in ~80% value stocks and then use other securities, such as precious metals ETFs, to hedge macro risk. I focused on value investing in emerging markets in my last role, which is quite similar because macro factors make an outsized impact there. Issues like a country’s borrowings in local currency vs. USD, its current account surplus/deficit, and commodity prices make a huge impact because many EM companies – even ‘value’ ones – are tied to exports and commodity prices. So, with every single investment recommendation I made, I always had to think about how to hedge the macro risk via derivatives and other investments.” Q: How do you manage risk in your portfolios? A: Entire books have been written about this topic, but one simple approach is to outline the key risk categories, such as currencies, interest rates, market, liquidity, and credit, and assign a “rating” for each one to each holding in your portfolio. You could then take a weighted average of these, see what the totals look like in each category, and rebalance accordingly. For example, maybe one client portfolio is overly exposed to interest-rate risk because of its allocation to long-term government bonds, but could afford to take more market risk; you might reallocate from bonds to stocks to get a more appropriate allocation. These questions are closer to the ones in investment banking interviews. But the interviewers will not go into nearly as much depth since accounting and valuation are just two of many possible topics: Q: Explain how the 3 financial statements link together. A: This is a classic question that is answered in the IB interview question article in Category #4. In short, the Net Income at the bottom of the Income Statement acts as the first line of the Cash Flow Statement. Adjust this for non-cash income and expenses, reflect the Change in Working Capital, and then record cash inflows and outflows from investing and financing activities. Cash at the bottom of the CFS equals the Beginning Cash in the period plus all these changes (Cash Flow from Operations, Investing, and Financing), and this becomes the ending Cash number on the Balance Sheet. Link the non-cash adjustments to their corresponding BS line items, make Net Income flow into Equity, and link the CFI and CFF line items to their corresponding Balance Sheet lines. Q: Walk me through how to move from EBITDA to FCF and explain how FCF is used in valuations. A: We have a whole tutorial on EBITDA to FCF, so see that for the details. In short, FCF = EBITDA – Net Interest Expense – Taxes +/- Other Non-Cash Adjustments +/- Change in Working Capital – CapEx. The tricky part is that this specific “type” of FCF is rarely used in valuations because it’s more of a credit or financial statement analysis metric. You tend to use Unlevered Free Cash Flow in a DCF because it ignores capital structure; UFCF excludes the Net Interest Expense and bases the Taxes on EBIT rather than Pre-Tax Income. Q: Explain the relationship between valuation multiples and a DCF model, and when you might rely more on one or the other. A: Unsurprisingly, we have another tutorial on valuation multiples. Essentially, they’re a “condensed” form of the DCF that expresses similar information (cash flow, future growth rates, and risk) but in a single number rather than an entire analysis. Common examples are Enterprise Value / Revenue, Enterprise Value / EBITDA, and P / E or Equity Value / Net Income. Valuation multiples are normally supporting tools in a full company analysis; they are shorter and easier than detailed projections, but also less meaningful. However, if a DCF is not feasible because the company is too speculative, does not yet generate revenue, or has other major issues, you might rely more on multiples. Q: Explain the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and how it affects valuations. A: See our tutorial on the WACC formula. This CAPM model says that a company’s Equity, Debt, and Preferred Stock have “expected” or “required” rates of return, and you can estimate the overall Discount Rate by taking a weighted average of these rates. You then use this Discount Rate in a DCF model to value the company based on its future cash flows. When the required rate of return is higher, the company’s implied value is lower (and vice versa). Q: Why does a DCF for individual companies matter if your job is to construct portfolios of 50 – 100 assets for clients? A: Single-company DCFs matter less in this context, but they can still be helpful for “sanity checking” the valuations in different sectors. For example, if Big Tech is overvalued, DCF models for all companies in the sector will probably point to similar results. So, you can often run quick analyses that give you a rough idea of valuation levels based on representative companies in the sector. And yes, you could use simple EBITDA or P / E multiples as well, but the DCF often gives you a more accurate reading (if executed correctly). In nearly all AM interviews, the interviewer will ask you about metrics such as the S&P 500 closing price and the 10-year government bond yield to assess how closely you follow the markets. However, they will also expect you to have a view on where the markets are headed. To stay up to date, it helps to read the weekly “Market Commentary” updates from various banks and AM firms: BlackRock | T. Rowe Price | Barclays | JPM | Citi Q: What’s the S&P 500 at? What about the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the prices of oil and gold? A: You can view all of these on the homepage of the WSJ each day, even without a subscription. If you’re in Europe or Asia, substitute in the major indices in your market, such as the FTSE 100 or the Nikkei and Shanghai Composite. Q: Where are the equity markets headed? Why? A: There is no “best” or universal answer for this one, and also no way to judge whether your answer is correct. But “better” answers tend to have more data supporting them, while “worse” answers are based on vibes rather than numbers: “I expect the overall U.S. market, represented by the S&P 500, to remain stagnant over the next year (vs. a ~14% YTD increase) because the companies with the largest weightings in it are valued very richly, and once some of the AI hype moderates, their share prices may not perform as well. It’s already at a 24x forward P/E vs. 25- and 10-year averages of 20x. Political instability, such as the government shutdown, and the inability to rein in the deficit will also weigh down stock prices. International markets, which are up roughly ~25% YTD based on VTIAX, should continue to outperform over the next year, perhaps in the 10 – 20% range, due to the falling USD and much lower P/E multiples in the ~15x range. Several non-U.S. developed markets have also hinted at fiscal stimulus, which could boost asset prices as well.” Q: Which sectors will benefit the most and be hurt the most by rising inflation? A: The most vulnerable sectors are ones with low margins that cannot easily pass on price increases to their customers – something like low-cost retailers might count (yes, they can increase prices, but their customers are very price-sensitive). Anything that is more defensive, viewed as a “necessity,” or has prices that are locked to inflation in some way, will tend to do better. Examples might include certain healthcare or utilities companies or consumer staples. In this category, bond questions are much more likely than currency and commodity questions: Q: Explain the yield to maturity (YTM) and duration of a bond and how you use them in portfolio management. A: The Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the annualized return an investor will receive if they buy a bond at its current market price and hold it until maturity, assuming the company makes all the required payments, and the investor reinvests the interest payments at the same rate as the overall return. Duration is the first derivative of the bond’s price with respect to the YTM, so it tells you how sensitive a bond’s price is to changes in interest rates or “prevailing yields on similar bonds.” Portfolio managers use the YTM to measure their potential annualized returns and duration to manage interest-rate risk; they want the weighted-average duration of their entire bond portfolio to be in a certain range so that they’re not caught flat-footed if interest rates suddenly change. Q: Is a U.S. Treasury truly “risk-free?” If not, what are the risks, and how could you hedge against them? A: No. It’s free of default risk, but it still has interest-rate, currency, and inflation risk. For example, if overall interest rates increase, pushing up the yields on similar UST, the market value of any UST you own will decrease, and you will lose money if you sell them before maturity. If you convert from another currency into USD to buy these bonds, the FX rate could change and reduce the amount you earn back upon sale or maturity. And inflation risk means that if inflation runs above the YTM of the bond, you could also lose money in real terms, even if you receive all the interest payments and earn back the nominal amount you invested. Q: Recently, the Fed cut interest rates, but rates on 30-year mortgages increased. How is that possible? Shouldn’t they always follow the benchmark rate? A: The Fed only controls short-term interest rates – but mortgages are typically priced based on longer-term benchmarks, such as 10-year Treasuries. Even if short-term interest rates fall, long-term bond yields could rise if the market prices in higher political, economic, or inflation risk, which is likely what happened here. Also, mortgages have prepayment and credit default risk, so one of these may have increased despite the rate cut. Q: Compare and contrast gold and silver as assets. A: Both gold and silver are precious metals often used in the “defensive” part of portfolios. They both act as inflation hedges and provide downside protection in market crashes, making them particularly useful when interest rates are currently low but inflation expectations are rising. However, silver tends to be more volatile than gold and fluctuates more in different economics cycles, as it also has significant industrial uses, such as in EVs and smartphones. Most investors aim to maintain a specific gold/silver ratio over time. Q: Consider the USD/EUR exchange rate. Suppose that the ECB cuts interest rates at a faster rate than the Fed, the major EU member states report falling trade surpluses with the U.S., and European GDP growth comes in below expectations. Despite all this, the EUR *rises* against the USD. Why? A: Dozens of factors influence FX rates, but a currency tends to strengthen when yields on government bonds priced in that currency increase, when the country runs a trade surplus, and when economic growth exceeds expectations. So, in this scenario, we would expect the EUR to fall against the USD since it’s the opposite in each case. The answer probably lies in other factors not mentioned here: For example, maybe on-again-off-again/confusing tariffs or geopolitical uncertainty has reduced confidence in the USD, and investors have flocked to the EUR as a safe(r) haven. Many of these questions do not have “answers” – they’re designed to spur a discussion between you and the interviewer. You could say almost anything if you back it up with solid reasoning, so the goal is to assess how deep you can go based on your knowledge. Q: How will tariffs impact the global economy? A: We published a whole article about this one back in April, so you can start there. In short, tariffs are an additional corporate tax on foreign-sourced parts, supplies, and raw materials, so they tend to be inflationary if companies pass them on 1:1 to customers (which may or may not happen – it depends on their margins and competition). Theoretically, tariffs are supposed to encourage more domestic production, but the real-life results have been mixed. So, the best answer is that tariffs are “case by case,” and they’ll boost some sectors (e.g., domestic auto companies) while hurting others (luxury retailers, spirits companies, etc.). They turn the economy into more of a “government picks the winners and losers” game. Q: How will AI and automation affect the economy? A: AI and automation tools tend to reduce labor costs, but they increase demand for the required inputs, such as electricity and rare-earth/other metals. So, like tariffs, this one is case-by-case based on the labor costs in each industry, how much AI will shift those costs, and whether the industry is a “supplier” or “consumer.” For example, mining companies could benefit greatly because AI demand could boost prices for metals like aluminum, silicon, and copper (all used in chips), as it takes a long time for production to catch up. Many “white-collar” industries, such as law firms, Big 4 accounting firms, and banks, will likely see falling labor costs as teams can do more with less (so, they may be able to maintain or expand their margins even as they grow). On the other hand, sectors like nursing facilities may not be affected much because nurses are very difficult to “replace” or even “augment” with current AI tools. Q: The demographics in most developed countries are awful, as no one is having kids anymore. How will this affect GDP growth and asset prices? A: Falling populations due to low birth rates negatively impact GDP growth because it’s much harder to grow an economy when the population is falling (of course, improved automation could change this). Also, social welfare systems such as Social Security and Medicare in the U.S. become increasingly difficult to maintain since the burden falls disproportionately on younger workers. Higher taxes to fund these systems, plus benefit cuts to keep them solvent, both translate into reduced consumer spending, which puts more downward pressure on GDP. That said, asset prices will not necessarily fall because they depend on the money supply and fiscal and monetary factors as well. So, if the government runs huge deficits and prints money to fund these social welfare systems and prop up consumer spending, asset prices could keep inflating, even if the overall economy is poor. We’ve covered stock pitches extensively, including some of the differences in long-only roles. The short version is that you should prepare at least one “Long” pitch by following the guide, but it doesn’t have to be for a specific stock. If you’re interviewing for a role that’s more “big picture,” you could also pitch an ETF focused on a specific industry, geography, or company type. Rather than doing exhaustive research and creating a detailed model, focus on quick pitches that you can explain in 30 – 60 seconds. There’s a good “investor presentation” example for Tema Global Royalties ETF here. You could use this to extract and mention these points in your pitch: Finally, case studies outside of stock pitches are not that likely unless you complete a U.K.-style assessment center. If you do, expect some type of group exercise that involves portfolio construction or selecting Fund A vs. Fund B for your portfolio. This article turned out to be far longer than I expected because the breadth of topics in these interviews is so wide. Unfortunately, I don’t think there is a quick/straightforward preparation plan. You must read a lot about the economy, markets, trade, and geopolitics, and there is no real shortcut to understanding everything. If I had to suggest a specific plan, I’d recommend spending one day on each “preparable topic” above (fit/behavioral questions, portfolio/client management, accounting/valuation, equities, FICC, and your stock pitch). You should be able to do a decent job reviewing each one and outlining answers to common questions in this time frame. Don’t spend more than a day coming up with your stock pitch; maybe even limit it to a few hours to prevent an overly complex pitch. With everything in the other categories (“General Market Knowledge” and “Economics, Trade, and Geopolitics”), the only answer is to continuously read sources like the WSJ and FT. It may be boring, but winning the “Generalist Olympics” of asset management interviews is sort of like winning the real Olympics: A ton of repetition over long periods and more than a little luck.

What would you do to calm him down? A true asset management aficionado would say the benchmark went down by 40% and we performed top quartile amongst peers with lower volatility. I thought about adding something like that that, but 40% seemed extreme, even for a pessimist like me. Also, even though it’s true that AM returns are benchmarked against indices, I’m not sure an upset client really wants to hear that (I realize some articles and advice may suggest this).

Title: World of Warcraft: Midnight deep dive reveals a continent-hopping questline as part of its main campaign, a cosy 'Arcantina' hub, and the release date of player housing's early access

At home in time for the holidays. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. World of Warcraft: Midnight just received a massive deep dive on its official channels. It's mostly an assemblage of information already out there, such as the new Demon Hunter Spec, the game's new zones, the transmog updates, and the upcoming Prey feature—which as a difficulty sicko with precious few mates that have raid-accessible schedules? I'm very excited about. One of the more interesting tidbits lies in its Campaign. While Midnight's first zone will be the Eversong Woods, Blizzard's shaking things up with the way the rest of the expansion's story will play out. Once you've tied things up near Silvermoon, you'll have your choice of Harandar, Zul'Aman, or—get this—a romp throughout older zones. Arator’s Journey will see you following Arator on his journey (no shockers there), visiting locations like Hope's Chapel, the Scarlet Monastery, and culminating at Blackrock Mountain. When you've completed both zone stories and this questline, you'll be funnelled to the Voidstorm to throw down with Xal'atath's forces directly. The rest of the deep dive's info has mostly been released by Blizzard on official channels before, but there are two notable exceptions. The first of which is the Arcantina, a cross-faction social hub that aims to be a place where players can chill out—and also pick up quests from seasonal NPCs. The second is that Player Housing, the long-awaited feature that Blizzard seems to basically be nailing thus far, will officially be releasing in early access on December 2—though you'll have to pre-purchase Midnight first. We also got to find out a little more about how players will be getting decor. The answer being, "through basically everything". Crafting, achievements, vendors, events, you name it. What's more, anything that's accolade-related—such as beating a raid—will be applied retroactively to your player's account. All in all, Midnight's shaping up to be real compelling. Transmog updates, base UI improvements, opt-in difficult world content where a bad guy can ambush you at any time, and the most important endgame of all: Making a cute little house to put all your trash in. Based on what I've seen of other games, WoW's housing features are going to be a phenomenal boon to the 20-year old MMO's community.

Title: The Future of Financial Settlement Isn't Faster, It's Fundamentally Different

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. The financial industry loves to talk about speed. Real-time payments. Instant settlement. Same-day ACH. But making a horse-drawn carriage go faster doesn't turn it into a car. The problem with traditional financial settlement is that it was built for a world that no longer exists. Traditional financial infrastructure is a patchwork of batch processing systems, correspondent banking relationships and siloed databases that were state-of-the-art when telex machines roamed the earth. Even today's "real-time" payment rails are largely smoke and mirrors. They’re just faster messages layered on top of the same 1970’s architecture. They still require reconciliation, suffer from counterparty risk and depend on business hours in specific time zones. This is a design problem. Consider what actually happens when a fintech promises "instant" international transfers. Behind the scenes, they're pre-funding accounts, managing float across multiple jurisdictions and hoping their reconciliation catches any discrepancies before month-end. The customer sees speed, but the company shoulders massive operational complexity and working capital requirements. Settlement friction negatively impacts every business that moves money. An e-commerce platform waiting T+2 for card settlements ties up working capital that could fund inventory. A logistics company managing international suppliers juggles dozens of banking relationships just to pay invoices. Even sophisticated enterprises with treasury management systems spend millions annually on the plumbing that moves value between entities. This isn't sustainable in a world where digital commerce happens 24/7, supply chains span continents and customers expect Amazon-like efficiency from every interaction. Why do we have same-day delivery on a weekend for packages but not financial transfers? Public blockchain infrastructure offers something that is worlds apart from traditional financial infrastructure: a shared, programmable settlement layer that operates continuously, transparently and without intermediaries. Value can move incredibly fast through a global economy built on blockchain rails. When BlackRock tokenized its BUIDL money market fund, it showed a recognition that 24/7 trading, near-instant settlement and programmable compliance create genuine operational advantages. When companies issue tokenized shares, they create a more efficient, transparent and accessible capital market infrastructure. These new financial primitives create entirely new markets. Let’s be clear that it’s not just financial services that are being revamped through better payment rails. The real unlock provided by smart contracts is that they can automate complex multi-party workflows that today require armies of back-office staff. A manufacturer can pay suppliers automatically when IoT sensors confirm delivery and quality checks. Real estate transactions can settle atomically, with payment, title transfer and regulatory filings happening simultaneously. Insurance claims can trigger instant payouts when parametric conditions are met. The point, again, is that blockchain doesn't just digitize traditional finance or provide increased speed. Different rails mean entirely new business models are possible. Every major bank is already tokenizing assets on Ethereum. Circle moves billions in USDC daily. PayPal's stablecoin runs on public blockchains. Why are any enterprises still debating whether this is "real?" They're missing the plot. While traditional companies optimize their SWIFT messages and patch their core banking systems, an entire parallel financial system has emerged. The gig economy worker in Manila doesn't know or care that her USDC payment bypassed the correspondent banking network; she cares about whether the money arrived instantly, so that she can use it immediately to pay rent, buy groceries or send some home to her family, all without fees eating away at her paycheck. The thing about infrastructure revolutions is that they don't announce themselves. In five years, "we still use ACH" will be the new "we still host our own servers in-house." It’s technically possible, unnecessarily expensive, and a clear signal you've fallen behind. The payment rails upgrade has happened. It just hasn't been evenly distributed yet.
