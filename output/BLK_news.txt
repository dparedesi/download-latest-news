Title: Trump Mulls Replacing Jerome Powell As Fed Chair As Shortlist Narrows

US President Donald Trump has announced plans to remove Jerome Powell as head of the Federal Reserve, citing incompetence. Amid the plot to remove Powell, there is a five-horse race for potential replacements for the current Fed Chair as Trump’s top choice declines the offer. US President Donald Trump has fired a new round of criticisms at Jerome Powell over his handling of the Federal Reserve, hinting at an imminent replacement. According to a report, Trump noted that plans are underway to name a new Fed Chair before the end of the year. Trump disclosed the plans during a dinner for business leaders in Tokyo as part of his week-long trip to Asia. The US President has previously railed against Powell over his refusal to cut interest rates, with the Federal Reserve headquarters fiasco fuelling more criticisms. “We have an incompetent head of the Fed. We got a bad Fed guy, but he’ll be out of there in a few months, and we will get somebody new,” said Trump. Powell’s term as Fed Chair is expected to come to an end in May 2026, bringing an end to a nearly eight-year tenure at the helm of affairs. Early in the week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that the administration is considering five potential replacements for Powell. At the moment, the five finalists include White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and current Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Bessent noted that he will do one more round of interviews on the five finalists before formally submitting their names to the White House after the Thanksgiving holiday. Meanwhile, Trump had previously tapped Bessent to replace Powell, but the Treasury Secretary declined to serve as Federal Reserve chair. “I’m thinking about him for the Fed, but he won’t take the job,” said Trump on Bessent’s refusal. “He likes being Treasury Secretary, so we’re not thinking about him really.” Despite Powell’s previous reluctance to cut interest rates, cryptocurrency markets are pricing in a rate cut in October’s FOMC meeting. Data from the FedWatch CME tool pegs the probability for a rate cut to 375-400 bps at 99.9%, potentially representing back-to-back cuts after September’s easing. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at $113,096, while Ethereum is holding the $4,000 psychological price point. However, investors are eyeing a bullish upswing following forecasted rate cuts that are expected to push the global cryptocurrency market capitalization above $4 trillion.

Title: Top AIG Exec Has Major Fossil Fuel Ties

This article is published in partnership with the Center for Media and Democracy. At the end of July, a group of residents of Brownsville, Texas, gathered to discuss the risk of explosions from a new methane export facility—Rio Grande LNG—that is being built right next to a SpaceX rocket facility with a history of explosions. Their fear? That their communities risk being blown up due to ongoing accidents in both sectors. Indeed, just the month before, an enormous explosion rocked the SpaceX facility in Brownsville. “They’re attacking us. They’re killing us,” a resident told Telemundo, referring to the extraordinary fossil fuel infrastructure expansion in the border city. More from Matthew Cunningham-Cook Rio Grande LNG is one of the most expansive methane build-outs in the country, with the project set to cost $18 billion and handle a capacity of 17.6 million tons per year of liquefied natural gas, which would make it the second-largest methane export facility in the U.S. Its largest ownership stake is held by NextDecade, a publicly traded fossil fuel firm, but it is also backed by Global Infrastructure Partners, a private equity subsidiary of BlackRock, and TotalEnergies, a major French oil and gas firm. Construction has continued despite the project being in ongoing legal limbo, with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals blocking its regulatory approvals last year. Despite the challenges of explosions, legal uncertainty, and the ongoing climate crisis, American International Group (AIG) is insuring Rio Grande LNG. This insurance arrangement comes as a Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) investigation shows that John G. Rice, AIG’s lead independent director, holds the exact same position at Baker Hughes, a global fossil fuel technology company that has received major contracts from both Rio Grande LNG and Calcasieu Pass LNG, which is also insured by AIG. AIG is one of the top ten insurers of fossil fuel companies in the country, and a report by Insure Our Future, a climate advocacy group, found that it collects over $500 million annually in premiums from insuring the fossil fuel industry and held $27.4 billion in fossil fuel investments as of 2022. In addition to the Rio Grande project and Calcasieu Pass LNG Phase 1 (owned by Venture Global), AIG is also insuring Cameron LNG (majority-owned by Sempra and backed by KKR, Mitsubishi, and TotalEnergies) on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, along with historically insuring the Gulf LNG and Freeport LNG projects. The relationship between AIG and Baker Hughes has not been publicly disclosed prior to this. In its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), AIG does not disclose that the projects it is insuring give major contracts to Baker Hughes despite the fact that the relationships could be material and, as a result, compromise federal standards on director independence. AIG has only disclosed that Rice is a director at Baker Hughes, not that he is its lead independent director, which is the second-most powerful position in a company when the CEO is also the chairman of the firm, as is the case with both Baker Hughes and AIG. Yaron Nili, a professor at Duke University School of Law who has studied director independence issues, told CMD that AIG’s failure to disclose that Rice is the lead independent director as opposed to an ordinary director at Baker Hughes could be considered “problematic,” and added that there is a “requirement [by AIG] to disclose anything that materially would impact their independence.” “These industries are so intertwined, as evidenced by Rice having these dual roles,” Rick Morris, an insurance campaigner at Public Citizen, told CMD. “They’re sacrificing our ability to get property insurance … in order to continue to make short-term profits off of the very causes of climate change.” The Gulf Coast is one of the most burdened regions on the planet when it comes to fossil fuels, with 20 new or expanded export facilities currently being proposed or under construction. There are now eight functioning LNG export facilities in the U.S., but if all the proposed projects get built nationwide, that number will balloon to 31. Liquefied natural gas is mostly methane, which is 28 times more effective than CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere, and currently accounts for 11 percent of global emissions. In 2022, a “Banking on Climate Chaos” report estimated that if the 18 proposed new fossil fuel export facilities on the Gulf were completed, they would generate 1.5 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, equivalent to emissions from 320 million cars. With the growth of fracking and export infrastructure on the Gulf Coast—along with a monumental increase in demand from Europe in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022—natural gas exports have expanded rapidly, with a tripling of U.S. exports between 2019 and 2024. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. In January 2024, the Biden administration put a pause on new LNG export approvals, citing environmental and energy security concerns. A federal judge in Louisiana then blocked that pause in June of last year, but in January of this year President Trump ordered it to be lifted on the first day he returned to office. Just before the presidential transition (in December 2024), Biden’s Energy Department also released a report warning that unfettered LNG exports could drive up prices for U.S. consumers and worsen the impacts of climate change. Trump, who campaigned on the promise to “drill, baby, drill” and push American dominance in dirty energy, has firmly rejected that approach. Instead, his administration has fast-tracked new LNG export infrastructure, allowing these exports to hit record highs as the president has tied access to U.S. markets to foreign purchases of American LNG. In the first quarter of 2025, AIG posted $460 million worth of losses from the fires in Los Angeles, which were exacerbated by climate change. Insure Our Future, which advocates for insurance industry accountability in climate change, estimated in December 2024 that $600 billion in property and casualty losses globally were due to climate change–related issues, which accounted for 38 percent of total losses in the sector. “AIG is one of the largest insurers of methane export terminals on the Gulf Coast,” Ethan Nuss, an organizing strategist at the Rainforest Action Network, told CMD. He cited a major disaster in August during dredging as part of the massive new Calcasieu Pass terminal, which will be one of the largest in the world. “There was a huge overflow of dredging sediment into public waterways and fishing grounds of the local fishing communities who have fished those waters for generations,” Nuss explained. Nuss pointed out that AIG generally seems to turn a blind eye to risks when insuring the methane build-out. At one point, the company insured Freeport LNG in Freeport, Texas (also on the Gulf Coast), which experienced a major combustion event in June 2022 that “sent flames shooting 450 feet into the air, injuring beachgoers, shaking residents’ homes and sending tons of toxic chemicals into the air,” according to Melanie Oldham, a Freeport resident, in a 2023 press release. “To this day the community has not received basic safety guarantees from the company that the problems that led to that explosion have been resolved,” Nuss said. In response to investor pressure, AIG released what it calls a “climate roadmap” last year. Yet Nuss says that the firm has continued to prioritize its relationships with the fossil fuel industry. “AIG says that they care about climate and are in the process of developing a climate action plan, but they are actively insuring and backing this very industry that we know is incompatible with a livable climate,” he said. Rice’s role at Baker Hughes shows that there is a “very clear relationship between AIG at a corporate level and their stake in the methane industry. The stakes couldn’t be [higher], not only for those … who live next to these dangerous terminals, with the risk of explosions and loss of livelihood and threats to their health. There’s also the threat to [our] shared climate. We know that if we have any hope of a livable climate we cannot afford to build new methane terminals, full stop,” Nuss said, citing research from the International Energy Agency to buttress his concerns about insurers’ complicity in exacerbating the crisis. Morris of Public Citizen draws a line between AIG’s continued underwriting of fossil fuel projects amid the escalating climate crisis to its role in the 2008 financial crisis, when the company insured complex financial products that detonated the global economy, requiring a $182 billion bailout from the U.S. government. The firm’s share price has never meaningfully recovered in the 17 years since that crisis. “In 2008, the [world] faced a financial crash caused by speculative activities by companies like AIG,” Morris noted. “Those investments caused a crisis in the housing market [that] trickled down to affect every American and just about every country on the globe. [Now] AIG continues to play fast and loose with the U.S. housing market [through] their investments in fossil fuels, spiking the rates that Americans pay for their home insurance. When people cannot afford home insurance … they cannot get a mortgage to buy a home, period. When you look at AIG’s central role in the 2008 financial crisis it is difficult not to draw stark parallels to the crisis we face today.” Morris underscored the critical role insurers play in the fossil fuel infrastructure expansion, noting that “you can’t find investors for a fossil fuel project if that project is not insured first.” AIG—and the insurance industry as a whole—“is bent on squeezing every last cent out of the American people while abandoning them at the very time that they need to rely on their insurance.” In a statement, Baker Hughes told CMD that the company “is committed to ethical business practices, transparency, and full compliance with all applicable disclosure obligations”—yet it failed to make its general counsel available for an interview.

Will the incoming payment chains shake Ethereum’s stablecoin market share? If the test is successful, the payment-focused chain could soon hit the public mainnet for everyone. It signals incoming shifts across the stablecoin payment ecosystem, and whether Ethereum will hold its ground remains to be seen. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is close to launching its Arc chain – A global payment-focused L1 powered by digital dollars. In a statement on 28 October, the firm said that it had begun public testing for the chain alongside key design partners. The partners include top banks, insurers, and asset managers like BlackRock, HSBC, and Absa, among others. According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, the partners have billions of users and handle trillions of dollars in assets across the globe. He claimed that Arc can seamlessly allow local markets and builders to connect to the global economy. Allaire called it the “economic OS of the internet,” and added, “This geographic diversity highlights a defining strength of Arc: its purpose-built to connect every local market to the global economy.” Source: X Beyond global and agentic payments, Arc also aims to support on-chain FX (foreign exchange) and capital markets (tokenization). In fact, BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, underscored FX and tokenization as key interests for them in the project. He said, “Exploring Arc will provide insight into how stablecoin-denominated settlement and onchain FX capabilities might enable more efficient capital markets and unlock additional utility for onchain assets.” Arc is not the only purpose-built project seeking to rewrite payment and capital markets via on-chain rails though. Google, Stripe, and Tether have similar plans. In fact, Tether-backed Plasma [XPL] is already live and handles about $6 billion of the stablecoin supply. It’s now the fifth-largest chain for digital dollars. Source: DeFiLlama Google’s GUCL and Stripe’s Tempo are expected to launch in the near future. Collectively, the new chains could challenge Ethereum’s market share in stablecoin settlement, according to some analysts. Out of the current $305 billion in total stablecoin supply, Ethereum controls $162 billion or 53%. Tron [TRX] handles about a quarter of the overall market, while the rest is shared among other chains. However, in terms of stablecoin transfers, Ethereum’s volumes have been making record figures every month. In fact, for the first time, the stablecoin volume crossed the $2 trillion milestone on Ethereum this October. Source: The Block Even so, it remains to be seen whether Arc, Plasma, Tempo, or Google’s payment chains will grab Ethereum’s market share.

Title: Saudi Arabia could become an AI focal point

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week A state-backed AI21 project hopes to rival China and the United States China and the United States are widely seen as the top two countries making artificial intelligence advancements, but there’s another nation looking to get in the game: Saudi Arabia. The wealth of Saudi businessmen is attracting outside investors to the Gulf kingdom as it tries to entice American tech companies to expand AI operations. But many are skeptical of what Saudi Arabia’s AI push could mean for the tech world and beyond. The nation wants to expand its tech influence by using AI, as “few nations can match the kingdom’s cheap energy, deep pockets and open land,” said The New York Times. All of these things are “ingredients that tech firms need to operate the vast, power-hungry data centers that run modern AI.” The kingdom’s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, is “seizing a chance to turn Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth into tech influence.” Saudi officials have been trying to woo American tech companies to the desert, with “executives from OpenAI, Google, Qualcomm, Intel and Oracle” all set to meet at an upcoming Middle Eastern investment summit, said the Times. Many of these executives “will be keen to seek out the opportunities that change tends to bring,” said Bloomberg, and will look to “divine the kingdom’s plans for the more than $200 billion it earns each year from oil exports.” The country is additionally building several AI data centers that may further entice U.S. brands.

Riyadh is also looking to strengthen its own AI development through Humain, a state-owned AI company backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. The company believes it can eventually be the “third-largest AI provider in the world, behind the United States and China,” Humain CEO Tareq Amin said to CNBC. Humain is looking toward U.S. moguls in an effort to boost itself; Blackstone and BlackRock, two of the largest investment companies on Wall Street, are “already vying to invest billions of dollars with the firm,” said Bloomberg. Saudi Arabia is well on its way to building this AI groundwork, as Humain “offers AI services and products, including data centers, AI infrastructure, cloud capabilities and advanced AI models,” and is also developing a computer operating system that “enables users to speak to a computer to tell it to perform tasks,” said Reuters. But not everyone is happy about Saudi Arabia’s rapid development of AI, largely due to the country’s various human rights abuse allegations and treatment of women. Other experts don’t believe the hype around Saudi tech. Saudi Arabia has a notably “shallow pool of AI expertise,” and many “warn of a global glut in computing capacity as governments and companies race to build data centers faster than they can profit from them,” said the Times. Crown Prince bin Salman has said that Humain’s goal is to handle 6% of the global AI workload — but this could be a stretch. Tech experts “can never say never,” John Dinsdale, a senior analyst for Synergy, said to the Times. “But I can’t imagine any circumstances that would enable Saudi Arabia to achieve 6% of the world’s AI compute capacity.” A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Justin Klawans has worked as a staff writer at The Week since 2022.

Germany’s dramatic economic collapse is dragging its geopolitical standing down with it. Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has now learned what it means to be treated as a second-tier diplomat, receiving the red card from Beijing. A humiliation and a reprimand for Germany. The school of life can be cruel. Growing up usually means losing lofty ideals, fringe ideologies and the dreamy mindset of an inexperienced existence to the harsh reality of the world. Reality follows its own rules, unimpressed by self-delusion. That moment of maturity, the exit from the bubble of hermetically-sealed party ideology, has now arrived for Germany’s top diplomat. A Minister of Fantasies Johann Wadephul, who only recently wandered through wonderland attributing the German economic miracle to Turkish immigrants, had to cancel his first official visit to China at the last minute because Beijing saw no need to speak with a German delegation. The Christian Democrat is learning, much like his BlackRock-seasoned party colleague Friedrich Merz, that Germany’s dramatic economic decline is being followed instantly by a loss of geopolitical relevance. Wadephul’s first China trip was intended as a reset in the strained diplomatic relationship with Beijing. A high-profile business delegation was set to accompany him and help ease tensions over critical rare earth supplies. China has been threatening a complete export ban for weeks, a measure that would instantly paralyze key German industries. Suddenly Business Matters The delegation was to include representatives from the German automotive industry, Siemens Healthineers, the German Robotics Association and a leading importer of rare earth elements. Together, they were meant to relieve pressure in Beijing and secure access to the essential resources that Germany’s industrial base cannot function without. When Beijing made clear that it would not entertain additional talks beyond the mandatory meeting of foreign ministers, Wadephul was forced to cancel the trip late Friday. A last-ditch attempt to save face and limit the political damage. Perhaps Wadephul should have copied his predecessor Annalena Baerbock and focused on moral-philosophical escapism such as feminist foreign policy. It is harmless, fits the German zeitgeist, and would have earned him brownie points among left-leaning coalition partners. The Giant’s Achilles Heel Right now, Europe would desperately need a delegation that positions itself smartly in the slipstream of the Americans. Every giant has a weakness. China’s economy is caught in a self-reinforcing deflationary spiral triggered by draconian U.S. tariffs and a long-festering property crisis caused by massive state-driven capital misallocation. Deflation is fatal because China’s growth relies on the fiat-credit machine. Rising insolvencies mean shrinking loan books. The credit turbo sputters, collateral values collapse through fire sales and oversupply, especially in real estate. Then the state must intervene again, inject more government credit and weaken its currency further. It is a vicious cycle gripping nearly every modern economy. China’s answer has always been the same: a colossal export-subsidy engine, a mercantilist model built at the expense of trade partners who lost production capacity to China. Beijing’s trade surplus accounts for roughly 1 percent of global GDP. Roughly 1 trillion U.S. dollars, fueled by massive export aid. On top of that come geopolitical Trojan horses like the Belt and Road Initiative, opening markets wherever China needs raw materials. China Is Desperate for Replacement Markets Europe’s internal market has become essential for Beijing to dump excess production. The U.S. market is increasingly blocked since Donald Trump’s tariff offensive: Chinese exports to the United States have crashed by a staggering 27 percent. At the same time, Chinese exports to Germany rose 10.7 percent in the first half of the year. To prevent a labor-market meltdown at home, Beijing is flooding alternative markets with overcapacity. The Communist Party is facing a youth unemployment rate likely around 20 percent. The social explosive lies right there. This is precisely where Europe -- especially Berlin -- could apply leverage. In the escalating struggle for rare earth access, crucial for German industry and especially automakers, Europe could build real bargaining power by teaming up with the United States. Irresponsible and Stubborn It is irresponsible, considering China’s 90-percent dominance in rare-earth refining, not to side with Washington and secure strategic advantages for Europe’s own industrial survival. Ideologically rigid, strategically naive and severely weakened by its trade debacles with the U.S., EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is stumbling from one pseudo-summit to the next like a dethroned Brussels queen. One gets the impression that the entire climate circus, the theatrical solidarity on Ukraine and the delusional green posture have become a psychological overcompensation for the visible failure of the Brussels project. Time to Seek Alliance with the United States Europe should have embraced geopolitical division of labor with Washington from the start. Especially now that the U.S., under a hyperactive foreign-policy president, is openly claiming leadership. Trump is right to point at EU protectionism, ubiquitous climate regulation and a policy increasingly hostile to markets. Washington is on the offensive: deregulation, tax cuts, junking the quasi-religious climate cult. It’s working: the U.S. economy is growing 3.8 percent, new debt fell from 6.7 to 5.8 percent. Trump is recalibrating the system while Europe tumbles in the opposite direction: higher debt, deeper recession. Wadephul and his fellow European diplomats must finally accept this reality and drop their escalating crusade over censorship laws, scrap the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the online-surveillance regime entirely. Instead, they should seek fair trade with the U.S. without hidden climate protectionism. Europe is resource-poor and energy-dependent, importing up to 60 percent of its energy. Without Russian energy and raw materials, Europe’s prosperity model collapses. And the attack on a Eurasian rapprochement between continental Europe and resource-rich Russia did not come from Washington, despite media mantras to the contrary. It came straight from the heart of the European Union. Image: AT via Magic Studio Germany’s dramatic economic collapse is dragging its geopolitical standing down with it.

Washington is on the offensive: deregulation, tax cuts, junking the quasi-religious climate cult. It’s working: the U.S. economy is growing 3.8 percent, new debt fell from 6.7 to 5.8 percent. Trump is recalibrating the system while Europe tumbles in the opposite direction: higher debt, deeper recession. Wadephul and his fellow European diplomats must finally accept this reality and drop their escalating crusade over censorship laws, scrap the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the online-surveillance regime entirely. Instead, they should seek fair trade with the U.S. without hidden climate protectionism. Europe is resource-poor and energy-dependent, importing up to 60 percent of its energy. Without Russian energy and raw materials, Europe’s prosperity model collapses. And the attack on a Eurasian rapprochement between continental Europe and resource-rich Russia did not come from Washington, despite media mantras to the contrary. It came straight from the heart of the European Union. Image: AT via Magic Studio

by Pivot 5G AI BROADBAND NATION CYBERSECURITY FIBER BROADBAND FIXED WIRELESS M&A MARKET RESEARCH MOBILE POLICY RURAL BROADBAND VIDEO Verizon’s announcement this week about the company’s commercial agreement with Eaton Fiber is the latest example of how important the “killer bundle” of mobile and internet service has become. Or, as Verizon put it in the press release, the goal is to “accelerate Verizon’s broadband and mobility convergence strategy.” Customers who buy both mobile and internet from the same provider generate higher average revenue and are less likely to churn in comparison with customers who only buy a single service. While mobile service is widely available nationwide from AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, no provider has a nationwide broadband footprint. But all three providers are expanding where they offer broadband. Verizon’s plan to purchase Frontier will expand the company’s reach to 31 states and the District of Columbia. The agreement with Eaton Fiber, an affiliate of Tillman Global Holdings, will target markets outside of Verizon’s and Frontier’s current fiber-to-the-home footprint. According to the press release, Eaton Fiber will “fund and build the network and be responsible for network maintenance and installation.” Verizon’s responsibilities will include sales, marketing, and end-user customer service. The wording of the release suggests that other providers also will be able to use the network, but Verizon will have a head start. “Verizon will be the exclusive retail provider of residential fiber services over the new network through the build phase and for an additional time period, ensuring competitive advantage in subscriber acquisition,” the release states. AT&T also has been making fiber deals targeting areas outside its broadband footprint. The company also has a joint venture with BlackRock to expand its fiber reach. Although T-Mobile has had tremendous success with its fixed wireless offering, the company lacks the expansive fiber footprints that AT&T and Verizon already have. Unsurprisingly, the company’s fiber strategy, in large part, has been to acquire fiber assets that are already in the ground, through joint ventures to acquire Lumos and Metronet. In addition, T-Mobile has its own deal with Tillman Fiber. Telecompetitor is a publication of Pivot.

Title: Panama Canal Opens Search for Partners in $2.6B Dual-Terminal Project
URL: https://sourcingjournal.com/topics/logistics/panama-canal-authority-partners-dual-terminal-operators-consultation-construction-project-ports-corozal-telfers-1234786645/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T21:50:07Z
Full Content:
By Glenn Taylor As the Panama Canal’s operator turns its focus to developing new port terminals on both sides of the trade conduit, it has launched a “consultation process” designed to identify possible partners that would control the gateways. The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) made the announcement Monday after holding an invite-only meeting including members of both major container shipping lines and global port and terminal operators. In August, the ACP indicated it planned to sell rights to two plots of land reserved for the construction of two new ports near the canal. These two ports would be individual transshipment terminals—Corozal on the Pacific Ocean and Telfers serving the Atlantic Ocean. Combined, the two terminals are expected to boost the country’s overall container-handling capacity from 9.5 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) to 15 million TEUs annually. The construction of the terminals is expected to cost $2.6 billion, with both scheduled to begin operations in 2029 upon completion. As part of the process, the authority will conduct a market and feasibility study for both terminals. Following this stage, a general project plan will be developed which will lead to the initiation of a special process to select a concessionaire for each terminal. Related Stories Topics Cosco, OOCL Rack Up $43M in Port Fees in First Week After USTR Penalties Take Effect Topics Red Sea Return Could Flood Europe's Ports With Cargo The selection will include a pre-qualification phase, a one-on-one dialogue stage with pre-qualified participants, and finally, the awarding of the concession contracts. The final phase of the selection is expected to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2026. Approximately 8,100 direct and indirect jobs are expected to be generated during construction, the ACP says, with that number jumping to 9,000 once operations begin. The project is forecast to provide an economic impact of between 0.4 percent and 0.8 percent of Panama’s gross domestic product (GDP). Representatives from terminal operators included Maersk-owned APM Terminals, Cosco Shipping Ports, CMA Terminals, DP World, Port Houston, PSA International and Mediterranean Shipping Company’s (MSC) Terminal Investment Limited. The ocean carriers consisted of CMA CGM, Cosco Shipping, Evergreen, Hapag Lloyd, Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM), Maersk, MSC, Ocean Network Express (ONE), Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL), Yang Ming and ZIM. “We think that if it isn’t done here in Panama, it will happen elsewhere in the region, and we have to decide whether we want to stay competitive,” said Víctor Vial, vice president of finance at the ACP, at the Monday press conference. For the ACP, and for Panama in general, the desire to foster more competition at the canal comes as geopolitical tensions have put the waterway and the country under the microscope from both American and Chinese interests. A proposed $23 billion mega-deal which would see Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison sell off the Balboa and Cristóbal ports, as well as more than 40 others worldwide, to a consortium of MSC and BlackRock, has been in limbo since the summer. That acquisition occurred weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office, and was considered a massive win for his administration as it aims to curb Chinese influence in the region. Conversely, Beijing and China’s President Xi Jinping were unhappy with the deal, with China’s antitrust regulator opening a probe into that transaction, and later pushing for state-owned Cosco’s inclusion. The acquisition is under scrutiny from some in Panama’s government as well, with the country’s Supreme Court currently presiding over a lawsuit that alleges Hutchison’s recent 25-year extension to operate the Balboa and Cristóbal ports is illegal. If the high court rules in the favor of the comptroller general who filed the suit, the port sale would be annulled. If the contract is voided, it would take between 12 and 18 months to get a new concession tender ready, said José Ramón Icaza, Panama’s minister of canal affairs. “We don’t control the scenarios, but what I can say is that President [José Raúl] Mulino and a few members of his cabinet, including myself, are working on a plan for any of those scenarios and that if we have to take control of Balboa and Cristóbal we don’t create a disruption of the supply chain in the region,” Icaza said. The constant tug-of-war among the parties has driven concerns among ACP leadership that a concentration of terminal operators at the canal-adjacent ports would pose risks to the waterway’s neutrality. Panama’s $2.6 billion port project is one tranche of a wider 10-year, $8.5 billion plan to modernize the canal by 2023. The plan includes the $1.6 billion construction of the Indio Rio reservoir, which will be built to supplement the canal’s main supply of water from Lake Gatún and add capacity for an additional 11 to 13 daily transits. Additionally, the other major project within the 10-year blueprint is a 76-kilometer (47-mile) liquefied gas pipeline that could transfer up to 2.5 million barrels per day between the Corozal and Telfers terminals without sailing them through the canal.

Title: Oracle and IPDN signal next phase of tokenization as RWA market surges
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=541340
Time Published: 2025-10-28T20:00:49Z

Oracle and IPDN are building the next layer of institutional blockchain infrastructure. The moves highlight how legacy firms are accelerating real-world asset adoption. Both companies are capitalizing on institutional demand for blockchain-based settlement and compliant RWA trading infrastructure. According to a16z and HTX Ventures, the tokenized asset market has surged to $30 billion, quadrupling in just two years. Oracle and Professional Diversity Network [IPDN] are the latest traditional firms diving into blockchain infrastructure, underscoring a rapid shift toward institutional-grade tokenization. Oracle announced the launch of its Digital Assets Data Nexus platform on 27 October. It is built to help banks and financial institutions issue, manage, and settle tokenized assets on-chain. Meanwhile, IPDN also revealed a strategic collaboration with QBSG Limited to develop a global Real-World Asset (RWA) Exchange. This is designed to bridge regulated capital markets with blockchain rails. Together, the two announcements mark a new front in the corporate tokenization race. Legacy tech firms and public companies are now building infrastructure to bring traditional finance fully on-chain. Recent on-chain data show the RWA market has entered a period of exponential growth. According to a16z crypto report, the total RWA market has expanded fourfold in the past two years, reaching $30 billion in tokenized value. Additionally, BlackRock leads the pack with $2.6 billion in tokenized Treasuries, while Ethereum hosts $9.6 billion in total RWA issuance. Data also indicates that tokenized private credit is valued between $12–$16 billion. This represents over half of all RWA activity. Oracle’s entry shows a major shift in how institutions approach blockchain adoption. Its new platform promises compliance-ready infrastructure for on-chain settlement. This is a critical component as major banks move toward tokenized credit and liquidity products. Similarly, IPDN’s RWA Exchange adds a regulated marketplace layer, supporting the tokenization of equities, real estate, and commodities. Both efforts align with broader industry moves by JPMorgan, Citi, and BlackRock, all of which have unveiled tokenization pilots this year. From private credit to tokenized Treasuries, real-world assets are no longer a niche experiment; they’re becoming the backbone of institutional blockchain adoption. Oracle and IPDN’s latest moves reinforce that the race to tokenize traditional finance is now firmly underway — and the market, already worth tens of billions, is just getting started.

Securitize, a pioneering platform in asset tokenization, has announced its intention to go public through a merger with Cantor Equity Partners II, valuing the company at $1.25 billion. The platform disclosed the strategic move on October 28, 2025, with this set to mark a major development for the tokenization industry. Securitize is at the forefront of bringing global financial institutions onchain. The move sees it join a growing number of crypto-focused companies going public across Wall Street and elsewhere. In its case, the platform, renowned for its role in tokenizing assets for entities such as BlackRock and Apollo, will merge with Cantor Equity Partners II as it eyes the $1.25 billion listing. Cantor Equity Partners is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald. The transaction is anticipated to generate up to $469 million in gross proceeds, including a $225 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing round. This capital infusion will enhance Securitize’s ability to scale its operations and advance its mission of making capital markets more accessible and efficient through tokenization. 8/ The deal is expected to deliver $469M of gross proceeds consisting of an upsized $225 million in committed common stock PIPE, anchored by new and existing blue-chip institutional investors, and $244 million of cash held in CEPT’s trust account, assuming no redemptions. — Securitize (@Securitize) October 28, 2025 The merged entity, to be renamed Securitize Corp., will list on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “SECZ.” Going public sees Securitize cement its position as a leader in the tokenization space. The platform, which has facilitated over $4 billion in tokenized assets, could attract even more attention as a public entity. The company’s platform offers a comprehensive ecosystem, integrating with major blockchains and financial institutions. It stands out as the first vertically integrated, SEC-registered tokenization provider. BlackRock and Apollo are among firms to tokenize funds with Securitize. “This is a defining moment for Securitize and for the future of finance,” said Carlos Domingo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Securitize. “We founded this company with a mission to democratize capital markets by making them more accessible, transparent, and efficient through tokenization. This is the next chapter in making financial markets operate at the speed of the internet and is another step in our mission to bring the next generation of finance onchain and tokenize the world.” The public listing of Securitize is expected to accelerate the adoption of tokenization across traditional financial markets. Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Brandon Lutnick noted: “We believe that blockchain technology has massive potential to transform finance, and partnering with Securitize underscores our confidence in tokenization as a foundational force in the next era of capital markets.” The real-world asset (RWA) tokenization market has expanded by 135% over the past year, reaching a total value of $35 billion, according to recent data. Analysts at Citi project that the tokenized RWA sector could climb to nearly $4 trillion by 2030.

Vanguard Group has turned artificial intelligence from a pilot program into a profit engine, generating more than $500 million in measurable business value across customer service, analytics and software development, according to MIT Sloan Management Review. The $11 trillion asset manager’s methodical rollout shows how large financial institutions can use AI to boost productivity while maintaining trust, governance and employee engagement.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ As mentioned in MIT Sloan analysis on Monday (Oct. 27), Vanguard’s first wave of AI deployments focused on service and productivity. Its “Crew Assist” tool, powered by Azure OpenAI, helps call-center representatives handle investor inquiries more efficiently, while an automated report generator produces customized market summaries for more than 150,000 advisers. Both tools have reduced call-handling times and improved customer satisfaction. The firm’s “Digital Advisor” applies machine learning to model job-loss risk and unemployment duration, tailoring financial-planning recommendations even for clients with minimal balances. A separate call-summarization model automatically drafts meeting notes and follow-ups, reducing administrative work by nearly 50 percent. Vanguard’s research arm has also trained a large-language model on 22,000 corporate earnings-call transcripts to forecast dividend cuts. Companies flagged as negative were five times more likely to announce reductions within a month, underscoring how generative models can supplement traditional financial analysis. As reported by MIT Sloan, Chief Information Officer Nitin Tandon said AI is “embedded where it makes the most difference in decisions that improve investor outcomes and streamline how our teams deliver value.” While Vanguard has taken a focused, high-ROI approach, JPMorgan Chase is expanding AI across the enterprise. Its “LLM Suite” supports more than 200,000 employees and includes 175 active AI applications, from automated research assistants to wealth-management tools that helped boost sales. And JPMorgan isn’t the only company to tap into AI-powered tools for insights into wealth management. BlackRock has also integrated generative AI capabilities into Aladdin, its portfolio management platform used by global institutions, providing portfolio managers with faster insights into exposures and scenario analysis. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Half of Vanguard’s 20,000 employees have completed its internal AI Academy training program, designed to improve literacy and responsible use. Each system is monitored for drift, bias and performance under the company’s governance framework. Chief Data Analytics Officer Ryan Swann told MIT Sloan Review that Vanguard’s success sees “the best outcomes when humans and machines collaborate, not compete.” That approach mirrors findings from the World Economic Forum’s AI in Financial Services report, which found that 70 percent of financial executives expect AI to drive revenue growth but warned that scaling safely depends on workforce readiness and governance discipline. Citigroup is also emphasizing human-AI collaboration through its “agentic AI” system, Stylus Workspaces, which allows employees to perform multi-step workflows, such as market analysis and report summarization, with a single prompt. The tool connects directly to Citi’s internal databases and collaboration platforms, turning AI into an end-to-end task manager. The rollout began in September and is expected to expand globally next year. Across the industry, finance leaders are shifting from cost-based AI metrics to performance-based ones. A PYMNTS report found that CFOs increasingly view AI as a driver of growth and revenue rather than just operational savings, a change reflected in how firms like Vanguard and Citi quantify ROI in business terms rather than experimentation.

Title: Burlington Stores Takes 43K for Jackson Heights Retail Outlet
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/10/burlington-stores-takes-43k-jackson-heights-retail-outlet/
Time Published: 2025-10-28T18:03:37Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Burlington Stores, the retailer formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, has taken 42,575 square feet for a store at the as-yet-unbuilt 72-22 Broadway in the Jackson Heights section of Queens. Adam Heller, Stephen Weber and Joshua Singer from the Heller Organization represented the landlord, Werber Real Estate. Clifford Simon, David Rosen and Jake Simon from CNS Real Estate repped the tenant. The length of the lease and the asking rent were unavailable, though CNS classified the lease as “long-term.” Retail asking rents in Jackson Heights for this quarter equaled around $64.10 per square foot, according to CoStar. Burlington’s new Jackson Heights store is scheduled to open in September 2028. 72-22 Broadway is set to be a 13-story, mixed-use building with 60,000 square feet of retail on three levels, with two floors dedicated to office and the rest multifamily residential, Clifford Simon told CO. “Burlington’s arrival is a strong addition to the Jackson Heights community, bringing much-needed affordable soft goods to one of the city’s busiest transit hubs,” Heller said in an email to CO. “We’re excited about the continued momentum in the area as this corridor continues to thrive as a key shopping destination in Queens.” Traded was first to note the lease, which was signed in August. Burlington has been busy on several fronts after opening 101 new stores in 2024 and aiming for around the same number this year. The company took over 45 leases from Joann in May 2025, including at 535 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, following Joann’s second bankruptcy filing in January 2025. The month before, Burlington paid over $257 million to BlackRock to acquire an 889,445-square-foot industrial warehouse in Southern California where the company had been the sole tenant since 2019, as CO previously reported. Burlington also signed a 12-year, 77,970-square-foot lease at RXR and Hudson Bay Capital’s 620 Avenue of the Americas in December 2024 in a move from 695 Avenue of the Americas, as CO previously reported. The company took over the spot of the former Bed, Bath & Beyond outlet. Werber Real Estate, as Roosevelt 72 LLC, purchased the Jackson Heights site — also using the address 72-11 Roosevelt Avenue, according to public records — from Delco Properties for $24 million in May 2020. Representatives for Burlington Stores, Werber Real Estate and the Heller Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

It is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, open blockchain that uses USDC USDC $1.00 24h volatility: 0.0% Market cap: $76.30 B Vol. 24h: $11.48 B as its native gas token. Per the press release, it was built to support “predictable dollar-based fees, sub-second transaction finality, opt-in configurable privacy, and direct integration with Circle’s full-stack platform.” Circle also said Arc was designed to provide complete functionality for stablecoins. Gas fees are paid in USDC or other stablecoin and the firm intends to deploy native infrastructure on Arc to support core stablecoin swaps and FX liquidity. The Arc launch could cap off a demonstrably productive October for Circle. The firm started the month with analysts predicting massive growth and, by any measure, it hasn’t disappointed. As Coinspeaker reported, Paris-based finance firm Rothschild & Co Redburn started coverage of Circle Internet Group (CRCL) on Oct. 3, giving it an initial “neutral” rating and a price target of $136. As of the time of this article’s publication, CRCL is trading at $139 placing it slightly above the initial target and down nearly 3% over 24 hours. Circle has surpassed the initial target of $136 set by Rothschild & Co Redburn in October | Source: TradingView Meanwhile, on Oct. 28, Fintech banking firm Clearbank signed a strategic framework agreement with Circle to integrate the USDC and EURC stablecoins across Europe. The companies say this will enable faster cross-border remittances with lower fees. They intend to use the partnership to explore treasury and tokenized asset settlement use cases.

"Owning crypto assets or gold are assets of fear," Fink said during his appearance at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, according to a Bloomberg report. "You own these assets because you're frightened of the debasement of your assets. You're worried about your financial security. You're worried about your physical security." “The renewed focus on the so‑called ‘debasement trade’—where investors move away from fiat currencies into hard assets—is rooted in a clear trend: purchasing power is weakening in light of both fiscal and monetary policy leeway, especially on the U.S. dollar side,” Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum Bank, told Decrypt. “There are good reasons why private investors, banks, and institutions may start to hedge using Bitcoin,” he added, while warning that 24/7 volatility demands new risk systems and round-the-clock liquidity management. The concerns come as the U.S. government's debt burden is projected to exceed levels in both Italy and Greece for the first time this century. General government gross debt in the U.S. will surge by more than 20 percentage points to reach 143.4% of GDP by 2030, surpassing pandemic-era records, according to IMF forecasts. The IMF estimates the U.S. budget deficit will remain above 7% of GDP annually until 2030, the highest among rich nations tracked by the fund. Fink has gone from calling cryptos such as Bitcoin “the domain of money launderers and thieves” in 2017 to describing himself as a “major believer” in 2024, saying it’s “an instrument you invest in when you’re more frightened.” Two weeks ago, he told CBS that markets force constant reassessment, adding that crypto has "a role in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it's an alternative." With BlackRock managing $12.5 trillion in assets and operating the largest crypto ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust, with $93.9 billion under management, his views carry substantial weight across global markets. Nic Puckrin, crypto analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, told Decrypt that while Bitcoin originated as an "asset of fear" in response to the 2008 financial crisis, crypto has evolved into "a risk-on bet on the future of blockchain technology and an entirely new, borderless financial system." Bitcoin and blue-chip tokens remain viewed as hedges against fiat devaluation, Puckrin said, calling it "a secular trend, not just a short-term fear-based strategy." Bitcoin is currently trading at around $114,820, down 0.4% in the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko data. Meanwhile, users of prediction market Myriad, launched by Decrypt’s parent company Dastan, expect that Bitcoin will not outperform gold this year, suggesting lingering uncertainty about crypto's volatility despite growing institutional adoption. Sygnum’s Dori pointed to U.S. public entities exploring strategic reserves, major managers positioning Bitcoin as collateral, and the CME’s move toward 24/7 crypto derivatives as signs that the “pieces of the puzzle are coming together.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: US spot Bitcoin ETF balances are negative without BlackRock

Without BlackRock's IBIT, Bitcoin ETFs face potential outflows, showcasing a fragile market balance. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) boom has been celebrated as proof that Wall Street has finally embraced crypto. Yet the numbers reveal something far more fragile. On Oct. 28, Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, noted that US-traded Bitcoin ETFs have attracted about $26.9 billion in inflows year-to-date. However, that headline figure hides a stark imbalance that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone accounts for roughly $28.1 billion of those flows. In other words, Bitcoin ETFs would be in net outflows this year without IBIT. The product’s relentless accumulation has single-handedly offset redemptions across competitors, keeping aggregate inflows positive and sustaining Bitcoin’s narrative of institutional adoption. Since launching in early 2024, IBIT has dominated every major performance metric in the ETF ecosystem. According to SoSo Value data, it has seen about $65.3 billion in lifetime inflows, compared to $21.3 billion across all other Bitcoin funds combined. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC has suffered roughly $24.6 billion in redemptions, confirming that without IBIT, the aggregate picture would be deeply negative. This effectively means that BlackRock’s IBIT scale stands in a league of its own. The fund drew $37 billion in its debut year and has added another $28 billion so far in 2025, pushing its total assets under management past $90 billion, which is well ahead of any competitor. According to Coinperps data, Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold about 1.3 million BTC, and IBIT accounts for over 60% of that entire stash. A significant part of IBIT’s growth can be linked to the fact that BlackRock has used its $12.5 trillion AUM, retail brokerage channels, and institutional relationships to channel demand into a single flagship product. The asset manager’s entry into the emerging industry instantly conferred legitimacy on a sector still reeling from the broader crisis of trust. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg ETF Analyst, said: “When BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price was $30,000 and the stench of FTX was still in air. It’s now [over] $110k (a return that is 7x that of the mighty S&P 500) and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.” Apart from that, the fund’s recent success can also be linked to how Bitcoin has transformed BlackRock’s investor base. Last year, the firm revealed that three out of four IBIT investors were entirely new to BlackRock’s iShare product suite. This shows that IBIT has become not just a crypto ETF but also a client-acquisition engine for the world’s largest asset manager. Indeed, the asset manager’s custom creation mechanisms have become increasingly popular among large Bitcoin holders, or “whales,” who were once wary of traditional financial institutions. These mechanisms allow investors to transfer their Bitcoin directly to the ETF in exchange for new shares, bypassing the need to sell on the open market. So far, the firm has reportedly processed over $3 billion in such in-kind transfers, reflecting the strong confidence in its custodial design and long-term exposure model. This strong dominance has created a halo effect that has proven very profitable for BlackRock. Barely more than a year old, IBIT already ranks as BlackRock’s top ten revenue generators, surpassing long-standing funds like the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF. IBIT’s overarching dominance of the Bitcoin ETF space begs the question of what will happen when its numbers eventually slow down. If IBIT’s inflows taper, the immediate impact would be felt across market liquidity and price stability. At its current size, even a modest reduction in buying could remove a significant source of consistent demand. That demand has acted as a quasi-monetary inflow, offsetting miner sell pressure and exchange outflows. A slowdown would therefore widen spreads on US spot exchanges, reduce arbitrage opportunities for market makers, and weaken the feedback loop that has kept Bitcoin’s price anchored above key support levels. In essence, the ETF bid has become Bitcoin’s floor, and IBIT is most of that bid. The knock-on effects would also ripple through institutional sentiment. If month-over-month flows turn negative, family offices and RIA desks benchmarking performance to IBIT could rebalance away from Bitcoin ETFs entirely. That withdrawal would lower the “liquidity premium” currently embedded in Bitcoin’s price. Finally, a sustained stagnation in IBIT inflows could shift capital toward Ethereum and newly launched altcoins ETFs, eroding Bitcoin’s dominance ratio. However, Lunde pointed out that BlackRock’s absence from these product suites could limit their overall net flows. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: What Is the Fate of Altcoin ETFs Without BlackRock Presence?

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock was instrumental in the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, dampening sentiment with its boycott of altcoin ETFs. In this year alone, Bitcoin BTC $110 867 24h volatility: 2.0% Market cap: $2.21 T Vol. 24h: $73.64 B Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have recorded net inflows of $26.9 billion, per K33 Research. Out of this massive flow, top asset management firm BlackRock accounted for a total of $28.1 billion, covering the losses from other issuers, including Grayscale Investments. This outlook has prompted the question, “What is the fate of altcoin ETFs without BlackRock’s presence?” Even though Bitcoin ETFs recorded $26.9 billion in net inflows this year, it is obvious that BlackRock contributed the major percentage of this value. Precisely, the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) rakes in $28.1 billion in inflows. This shows that without this fund, Bitcoin ETF flows would be negative. According to K33 Research, Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $26.9 billion in net inflows this year, with BlackRock’s IBIT accounting for $28.1 billion. Excluding BlackRock, Bitcoin ETF flows would be negative. K33 noted that while competitors may gain an edge as BlackRock stays out of… pic.twitter.com/wpaCvqzRSV — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 28, 2025 The same positive trend was seen around the BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), as it dominated inflows on several occasions. Unfortunately, BlackRock has decided to stay out of the current altcoin ETF wave that is now gaining traction. 21Shares, Canary Capital, Fidelity, and many other asset managers have all filed for one or an altcoin ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the last year. Unlike these firms, BlackRock has not pursued a similar filing. Given the strong performance of the first two crypto ETFs, the upcoming funds may face challenges in achieving the same level of traction. In other words, their overall inflows could be limited, despite the massive hype trailing their respective listings. In mid-October, VanEck filed for the Lido Staked Ethereum ETF with the US SEC. Just a week before this filing, it filed a statutory trust registration for the same Ethereum ETF in Delaware. This fund is designed to track spot Lido Staked ETH (stETH) prices based on MarketVector’s LDO Staked Ethereum Benchmark Rate index. Back in August, Bitwise Asset Management submitted an S-1 filing to the US SEC to launch a spot Chainlink ETF to track the price of LINK LINK $18.32 24h volatility: 3.0% Market cap: $12.76 B Vol. 24h: $1.22 B . Details in the filing suggest standard creation and redemption mechanisms, noting that the trust can process both in-kind and cash transactions. It intends to utilize a “Trust-Directed Trade” system managed by the prime execution agent to achieve this. Interestingly, these altcoin ETFs are waiting for a green light from the SEC.

The company’s common stock will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “SECZ” once the transaction is completed, Securitize said. The firm will also issue digital representations of its stock on a blockchain, the company added. Securitize expects up to $469 million in proceeds from the proposed merger, which would stem from a private placement in public equity and Cantor Equity Partners II’s trust account. Existing backers, including BlackRock–the world’s largest asset manager–and financial services giants ARK Invest, and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, will see their equity rolled into the combined company, Securitize said. The stock price of Cantor Equity Partners II, an affiliate of the firm linked to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, fell 7% on Tuesday to $11.93, according to Yahoo Finance. Securitize offers a platform enabling companies to manage issuance of real-world assets on-chain, including stock and money market funds. Last March, the company helped BlackRock debut its $2.8 billion USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). Several crypto firms have debuted on Wall Street this year as U.S. regulators and lawmakers have moved to bring clarity to the industry. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo told Decrypt that Circle’s blockbuster IPO in June provided ample motivation. “We started thinking, maybe this makes sense for us,” he said. “We’ve been really pushing for the company to become profitable, and I think there are a lot of opportunities.” Domingo described BlackRock’s BUIDL as a “catalyst” for tokenization, and last month, Securitize reached an agreement with FG Nexus, a Nasdaq-listed Ethereum treasury firm, to issue a tokenized version of its stock on Ethereum. Securitize’s tokenization platform underpins $22 billion worth of real-world assets, but Citi analysts have projected that the sector could reach $5 trillion by the end of the decade. Having a big balance sheet gives Securitize the opportunity to participate in consolidating the industry, as opposed to being scooped up by a larger firm, Domingo said. Domingo said that Securitize’s public debut will likely take place early next year, depending on how the regulatory process plays out and when the U.S. government shutdown ends. “We’ve built a real company with 230 employees, revenue, growth, [and] profits,” he said. “We’re just scratching the surface of what the industry is.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: BlackRock Holds the Line as Bitcoin ETFs Reveal Fragile Foundations | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee to read how institutional flows tell a story of dominance, dependency, and deep accumulation. At the center stands BlackRock, propping up a fragile ETF ecosystem that may not stand so tall without it. BlackRock’s IBIT contributed $28.1 billion in year-to-date net inflows to US Bitcoin ETFs, surpassing sector gains and revealing a fragile foundation for institutional crypto adoption. Outside IBIT, Bitcoin ETFs faced negative flows, raising concerns over broader market confidence. On October 27, US Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of 1,300 BTC (about $149.3 million), equal to three days’ worth of new Bitcoin. This demonstrates lasting institutional demand, yet nearly all of it goes through IBIT. Competitors continue to face challenges, even as interest in digital assets grows. Recent figures show a stark pattern. BlackRock’s IBIT has driven the net positive flows for US Bitcoin ETFs, outpacing rivals. According to Farside Investors, US Bitcoin ETFs reported $26.9 billion in net inflows this year, but $28.1 billion came from IBIT. Without IBIT, flows in other ETFs, such as Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB, were flat or negative. “No BlackRock, no party? BTC ETFs are up $26.9bn YTD, yet $28.1bn stems from BlackRock’s IBIT. Ex-IBIT, flows are negative. BlackRock is absent from the imminent altcoin ETF wave. Opportunity for competitors to secure strong flows, but on net, likely limiting for overall flows,” wrote Velte Lunde, head of research at K33 Research. This reliance on one fund signals a critical vulnerability. If BlackRock scales back, institutional inflows could fade quickly. Such concentration can shape the perception of ongoing institutional confidence in global finance. On the same day as notable Bitcoin inflows, US Ethereum ETFs added 32,220 ETH, worth $133.9 million according to Farside. While significant, no Ethereum ETF has achieved IBIT’s dominance. This indicates growing yet more distributed interest from institutions exploring beyond Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Bitwise data shows that banks, asset managers, and payment companies treat crypto as a core part of finance. Transitioning from niche to mainstream, large firms are deepening exposure through custody, tokenization, and ETF products. This kind of change would have been unlikely just a few years ago. “Institutions are quietly going all in. Banks, funds, and payment giants keep adding exposure every week. Crypto’s no longer a side bet – it’s becoming part of the system,” wrote analyst Kyle Doops. Research by CoinShares confirms this trend. Bitcoin investment products drew $931 million in inflows for the week ending October 24, 2025, bringing the annual total to $30.2 billion. Yet, a sharp outflow the previous week highlights ongoing volatility and shifting sentiment that still affect the crypto markets.

Title: Forget the debasement trade: 2 reasons the US is the best place to keep your money, according to BlackRock chief Larry Fink.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Larry Fink isn't losing a lot of sleep over the debasement trade. The BlackRock CEO said he's still confident that US assets are the best place for investors to park their cash for at least the next 18 months. That's despite fears swirling around the debasement trade, which is the idea that investors are fleeing from dollar-denominated assets due to concerns that the US dollar is losing value, and that rising debt levels and deficit spending will broadly hurt fiat currencies. "Money is going to move around all the time. But I would say most global investors have a very large overweight in the US and I think that's going to be the best place to have your overweighting for at least the next 18 months," Fink said, speaking at a panel discussion in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. There are a few reasons Fink thinks investors' focus should still be on US markets. First, the sell-off in US assets earlier this year has largely reversed. Investors fled US stocks and other dollar assets in early 2025 as concerns mounted over tariffs, America's credit rating, and the nation's growing debt balance. But that move has largely reversed in recent months, Fink said. Foreign demand for US assets saw a strong rebound in May and June despite net selling in April, analysis from Apollo Global Management showed. Meanwhile, other safe-haven alternatives to US assets, like gold, are retreating after a big rally that some observers say was largely driven by FOMO rather than fundamental fears about financial stability. Second, there's huge faith in the investment being poured into the US, Fink said. He pointed in particular to capital expenditures spending related to AI, tech, energy infrastructure, and data centers. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google — four of the biggest companies at the center of the artificial intelligence boom — could be on track to spend as much as $320 billion on capex this year, according to a Business Insider analysis of the companies' financial statements. "You're seeing all that happening more in the United States than most places in the world today," Fink said, attributing large investment to why the US GDP has outpaced European nations. Other market pros have expressed doubt over the debasement theory. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Apollo are among the top Wall Street forecasters that have been skeptical about the "sell America" narrative this year, thanks largely to the excitement for investment opportunities in the US. The US dollar has also remained stable against other currencies in recent months, Capital Economics said in a note to clients on Monday. The 10-year US Treasury has also rallied, the firm added, signaling that investors haven't lost confidence in Treasurys. Jump to

Title: Tariffs Fuel Inflation Fears Among Insurance Companies

Time Published: 2025-10-28T14:14:00Z

Insurance firms see inflation as the biggest threat to their investment strategy over the next year, per a BlackRock report. The possibility that tariff wars will create a knock-on effect leading to higher inflation over the next year is by far the biggest concern among insurance companies during that time period, according to BlackRock’s annual “Global Insurance Report.” “Inflation remains a key concern, particularly with the renewed imposition of tariffs and their potential ripple effects,” the report stated. “Escalating geopolitical tensions and increasing market fragmentation are also shaping insurers’ investment strategies and outlook.” The report also noted that the sustained higher-interest-rate environment, combined with ongoing regulatory developments, is forcing insurance firms to adjust their strategies “to navigate a rapidly evolving landscape.” The report analyzed a survey of 463 senior investment professionals at firms representing an aggregate of $23 trillion in assets under management. It found that 63% of those surveyed cited inflation risk when asked what they consider to be the “most serious macro conditions” affecting their companies’ investment strategy during the next 12 months. This is a big jump from last year, when inflation risk ranked fifth, with only 46% of insurers saying it worried them the most. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  With respondents able to select more than one option, “rising geopolitical tension and fragmentation” was a distant second, with 50% naming it as their biggest concern. A “high-rate environment” was cited by 42%, while “regulatory developments” and “recession risk” were cited by 40% and 35% of respondents, respectively. In last year’s survey, the top concern among insurance companies was regulatory developments, cited by 68% of respondents, followed by rising geopolitical tensions and a high-rate environment at 61% and 58%, respectively, while 50% cited the risk of a recession. This year’s report also found that insurance companies have lost their appetite to increase risk, down to just 12% in 2025 from 60% in 2021. However, they are still eating up private market investments, with 30% of insurers saying they expect to increase their allocation to the asset class over the next 12 months and only 12% reporting they plan to cut back on private assets. Some 79% said they plan to raise their allocation to private markets by 1% to 5%; 13% said they expect to increase their exposure to private markets by 6% to 9%; and 1% said they plan to boost their private assets by at least 10% over the next 12 months. Within private markets, insurance companies reported the most interest in single-strategy direct lending, named by 39% of respondents, followed by special situations/opportunistic investments at 38% and citing infrastructure debt at 37%.

Solana officially joins Bitcoin and Ethereum in the ETF arena as the first U.S. spot Solana ETFs go live. 📌 What Happened Four new crypto ETFs will begin trading this week across Nasdaq and the NYSE, led by Solana, Litecoin, and Hedera. The big headline is Solana, which will see two ETFs go live: The Bitwise ETF will track 100% spot SOL and is designed to participate in staking, meaning it could compound yield through validator rewards over time. The Litecoin and Hedera ETFs, both from Canary Capital, also begin trading Tuesday. This is the first wave of altcoin ETFs to reach U.S. markets after the Bitcoin ETF launch in January and Ethereum ETF rollout in July. 🗣️ What They’re Saying “Confirmed. The Exchange has just posted listing notices for Bitwise Solana, Canary Litecoin and Canary HBAR to launch TOMORROW and grayscale Solana to convert the day after. Assuming there’s not some last min SEC intervention, looks like this is happening.” - Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg 🧠 Why It Matters Solana enters ETF land with serious momentum. SOL is now a top-5 crypto by market cap, trading near $200, and continues to dominate usage metrics with higher daily transactions than Ethereum. And the Solana ETF unlocks new access to SOL for retirement accounts, wealth advisors, and institutional portfolios that can’t touch crypto directly. It deepens liquidity and puts Solana in the same regulated bucket as BTC and ETH, something nearly unthinkable during the FTX collapse just two years ago. That means inflows and diversification buying is incoming. But, with that said, there is one key difference between these SOL ETFs and BTC & ETH - BlackRock isn’t at the table (yet). BlackRock’s IBIT (BTC) and ETHA (ETH) are the dominant players in their respective categories of ETFs. IBIT has seen $65B in net inflows. The next biggest is FBTC at $12B (so 5x bigger). Similarly, ETHA has seen $14.2B in net inflows. The next biggest is Fidelity’s FETH at $2.69B (also ~5x bigger). So while there is reason to celebrate these new ETFs, especially for SOL - take them with a grain of salt. And pop the champagne when BlackRock announces their SOL ETF… A few Crypto and Web3 headlines that caught my eye: In Corporate Treasuries / ETFs In Memes Here’s a rundown of major token, protocol and airdrop news from the day: Here is the list of other notable headlines from the day in NFTs: Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Tesla chairwoman warns Musk could quit if shareholders reject $1tn pay deal

Tesla chairwoman Robyn Denholm has stepped up her campaign to win shareholder support for Elon Musk’s $1 trillion (€859 billion) pay package, warning there is no “Elon mark 2” if the carmaker’s board is forced to try to replace the chief executive. Ms Denholm and other Tesla board members are meeting this week with the company’s largest institutional investors, which include Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street, to lobby for the plan in advance of a vote on November 6th. Mr Musk has threatened to walk out if shareholders vote down a new package of stock options that could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade. Ms Denholm confirmed that Mr Musk’s public threats had also been communicated privately to the board, but refused to explain Tesla’s contingency plan if shareholders reject the pay deal. Ms Denholm has also written to shareholders warning of his potential departure if his package is not approved. “This is a vote for shareholders on the future of Tesla,” Ms Denholm told the Financial Times. “There’s just not anybody, either inside or outside the organisation, that is Elon today,” she said. Mr Musk’s pay has been the centre of years of controversy and legal wrangling. Last year, shareholders voted in favour of a previous $56 billion pay deal. That package was originally awarded in 2018 but subsequently blocked by a Delaware court, which said the process lacked proper board oversight. The new proposal is expected to face significant opposition after advisory groups Glass Lewis and ISS recommended that shareholders reject the proposals. A group of big pension funds separately issued an open letter opposing the pay plan, claiming the board’s “relentless pursuit” of retaining its chief executive had damaged Tesla’s reputation and led to excessive compensation. On Monday, the head of the New York pension fund called the pay proposal “inflated and poorly designed” and urged investors to vote against it. Mr Musk responded to the criticism on X, the social media site he owns, last week: “Tesla is worth more than all other automotive companies combined. Which of those CEOs would you like to run Tesla? It won’t be me.” The fortune of the world’s richest man is largely tied up in the value of Tesla’s shares, which have more than tripled in value over the past five years as the carmaker’s market capitalisation soared to $1.4 trillion. Asked what the board will do if Tesla loses the vote and cannot retain Mr Musk, Ms Denholm said: “I don’t want to foreshadow anything on that front at this moment, but clearly, as a board, we have discussed what happens and we know that it wouldn’t be a good outcome for shareholders.” “If we don’t have Elon at the helm, or he isn’t as motivated or incentivised to actually create that future, then it’s actually a negative for all shareholders.” She added that she did not believe Mr Musk would do anything “sudden and detrimental” if Tesla loses the vote. Mr Musk has used large quantities of his Tesla shares as security to borrow billions of dollars to fund his other ventures, such as his acquisition of Twitter, now X, in 2022 and the development of his artificial intelligence start-up, xAI. He currently owns a 15 per cent stake in Tesla and is able to vote his shares in favour of the compensation plan. Tesla has warned investors that Mr Musk’s leadership is crucial to a strategic pivot into AI, including through autonomous driving and its plans to build millions of humanoid “Optimus” robots. Mr Musk has argued he needs to control at least a quarter of Tesla’s voting rights to stop its AI products falling into the wrong hands, using the example of him being ousted by activist investors. Last week, Mr Musk branded Glass Lewis and ISS “corporate terrorists” and said: “I just don’t feel comfortable building a robot army and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis who have no freaking clue.” Ms Denholm told the FT that the special committee set up to design the pay package – which was made up of her and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson – explored whether there was a way to give Mr Musk the voting rights he wanted without the vast payout. “There wasn’t an instrument that you could use that could do that,” she said. “We searched high and low for it, but we ended up using restricted stock, which does have economic rights.” The proposed $1 trillion compensation award includes 12 tranches of restricted stock that are each tied to ambitious milestones for its share price and operational performance. It would grant Mr Musk an additional 12 per cent of Tesla’s shares if he increases its valuation to $8.5tn, boosts earnings 24-fold and sell millions more cars and robots. Achieving even half of those targets could make him the world’s first trillionaire. Shareholders will also vote on a string of other proposals next week, including the reappointment of three directors and whether Tesla can invest in xAI. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said the project has “remarkable early momentum,” in a press release. “Arc presents the opportunity for every type of company to build on enterprise-grade network infrastructure—advancing a shared vision that a more open, inclusive, and efficient global economic system can be built natively on the internet,” he added. A testnet is separate blockchain mimicking the main blockchain network and using simulated assets, enabling developers to test new features without risking the security of the live mainnet. Companies with “billions of users” have participated in the launch, with Wall Street firms and global banks including BNY, Intercontinental Exchange, and State Street joining the Arc testnet. Wall Street giants already on the platform include BlackRock, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and Standard Chartered. There are also established tech and payments companies participating, including Amazon Web Services, Cloudflare, Mastercard, and Visa. Several crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood, are also taking part in the testnet. The blockchain network, which Circle bills as an "Economic Operating System" for the internet, aims to bring more economic activity onto blockchain infrastructure with features including predictable dollar-based fees, sub-second transaction finality, and optional privacy configurations. Circle said its Arc platform is designed to support financial applications including lending, capital markets, foreign exchange, and global payments. The network integrates with Circle's existing platform and enables the use of stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to traditional currencies. Several regional stablecoin issuers have joined the testnet, including JPYC from Japan, BRLA from Brazil, and QCAD from Canada. Circle, which issues the USDC stablecoin, is working to bring additional dollar and euro stablecoin issuers onto the platform. While Circle is currently stewarding Arc's development, the company said it plans to transition the network toward distributed governance. The long-term vision includes expanding validator participation and establishing community-driven governance frameworks.

Reuters 28/10/2025 09h41 • Atualizado 2 dias atrás 28/10/2025 09h41 • Atualizado 2 dias atrás Publicidade (Reuters) – Os Estados Unidos continuarão a atrair a grande maioria dos fluxos de investimento e os riscos de uma desaceleração na maior economia do mundo são exagerados, disseram chefes de algumas das principais empresas financeiras em uma conferência na Arábia Saudita nesta terça-feira. Os mercados acionários dos EUA atingiram recordes de alta, à medida que enormes somas de dinheiro são investidas no país para apostar na IA, levando alguns executivos e banqueiros centrais a alertar sobre riscos crescentes de uma bolha e de uma correção do mercado. Outros investidores se preocupam com a crescente dívida do governo sob o comando do presidente Donald Trump e com o impacto de suas tarifas comerciais. Ainda assim, executivos da Future Investment Initiative (FII), em Riad, passaram a maior parte do tempo falando com entusiasmo sobre perspectivas para os EUA, dizendo que o país se compara favoravelmente à Europa e a partes da Ásia. O presidente-executivo da BlackRock, a maior administradora de ativos do mundo, disse que o dinheiro tem voltado para os Estados Unidos principalmente nos últimos dois meses, revertendo uma saída de ativos em dólares no início do ano. “A maioria dos investidores globais tem um grande excesso de peso nos EUA e esse é o lugar para manter seu excesso de peso nos próximos 18 meses”, disse Larry Fink. Continua depois da publicidade O presidente-executivo do Goldman Sachs, David Solomon, disse que a “grande maioria da alocação de capital” está em ativos em dólares e que não há um catalisador óbvio para uma desaceleração econômica nos Estados Unidos nos próximos 6 a 12 meses. O presidente-executivo da Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman, disse estar confiante de que os EUA e a China farão um progresso significativo para a conclusão de um acordo comercial, com Trump se reunindo com o primeiro-ministro chinês nesta semana. O fundador da Pershing Square Capital Management, Bill Ackman, minimizou preocupações com os níveis de endividamento do governo dos EUA, destacando a força e a escala dos ativos do governo, enquanto todos se concentram em seus passivos.

October 28, 2025 05:35 ET | Source: MOVA MOVA DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Oct. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- At the Palazzo Versace Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, MOVA successfully hosted the “Vision 2030: Global Digital Economy & Brand Excellence Summit.” Distinguished guests attending the summit included:Mr. Mohammed Al Ahbabi from the UAE Ministry of Economy and Tourism;Mr. Shehab Bin Nouri from the Al Maktoum Royal Family Private Office;Mr. Khalifa Al Mazrouei from UAE Capital Group;Mr. Peter Hacham, representative of Mubadala’s Hub71 sovereign fund;Professor Peter Knez, former Investment Director at BlackRock (USA) and Chairman of Palm Global (Abu Dhabi);Mr. Samir M. Suleymanov from the World Bank’s New Economy Industry Department;Ms. Nancy Guan, Secretary-General of the International Olympic Arts Development Committee;Mr. Eric Lee, CEO of Bithumb (Korea Exchange);Mr. Bobby Zhou, Co-founder of Aqua Labs;and Ms. Christina Wang, Chief Representative of PIF China. (USD1SWAP members with Bithumb CEO Eric Lee) The summit brought together global industry leaders, capital institutions, and technology innovators to discuss the future of RWA (Real World Asset) tokenization, public blockchain ecosystems, and brand digitalization. Beyond exploring global trends in the digital economy, the event also provided an important platform for USD1SWAP and the MOVA ecosystem to showcase their latest developments. USD1SWAP: Bridging the Real and Digital Asset Worlds As a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, USD1SWAP became one of the highlights of the event. USD1SWAP’s Chief Marketing Officer, Smith, delivered a keynote speech elaborating on the project’s strategic positioning within the global digital economy—particularly focusing on liquidity solutions and decentralized financial infrastructure built on the MOVA blockchain. Smith emphasized that USD1SWAP aims to provide a secure and transparent channel for global asset exchange through innovative cross-chain liquidity protocols and intelligent risk control systems. “In the future, USD1SWAP will be more than just a decentralized trading platform—it will become a vital bridge between traditional finance and the Web3 world,” said Smith. As a major application on the MOVA chain, USD1SWAP is driving the tokenization of real-world assets, opening new possibilities for the circulation of digital assets worldwide. Global Collaboration in RWA Tokenization and Brand Digitalization The summit centered on two major themes: RWA tokenization and brand digital transformation—both of which align with USD1SWAP’s long-term strategic direction. Smith noted that as stablecoin models and cross-chain technologies mature, traditional assets such as real estate, energy, and commodities are entering a new era of digital transformation. “Digital assets are no longer confined to cryptocurrencies—they are increasingly linked to real-world asset value, forming an entirely new global capital structure,” Smith explained. Through its RWA on-chain protocol, USD1SWAP enables liquidity and value mapping for real assets, helping traditional financial assets transition smoothly into the decentralized digital economy. This strategy complements the MOVA ecosystem, jointly advancing asset digitalization and public blockchain development—ultimately creating a seamless, secure cross-chain value exchange network for users worldwide. MOVA: Strategic Partnership Empowering USD1SWAP’s Growth As a core component of the MOVA blockchain, USD1SWAP collaborates closely with MOVA on asset mapping, cross-chain liquidity, and brand digitalization initiatives. MOVA CEO Wael Muhaisen also delivered an inspiring address at the summit, highlighting the pivotal role of the MOVA chain in advancing decentralized finance and brand ecosystems. Wael noted that MOVA is not just a smart contract platform—it is the foundational engine for global decentralized asset exchange and ownership verification. The distinguished guests at the summit discussed the latest trends in RWA tokenization and cross-chain liquidity in the global financial market, offering strategic insights and validation for the USD1SWAP and MOVA ecosystems. By fostering deep integration among global capital markets, governments, and technology sectors, USD1SWAP is not only laying the technological groundwork for decentralized finance but also providing strong momentum for the convergence of capital and innovation.
