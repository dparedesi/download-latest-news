With a name like his, he was probably condemned to a foray into literature sooner or later. But the Robert Burns behind a new book called Kings and Queens of the Road is an accidental writer. He fell into the role from his day job as a civil engineer, and more particularly a civil engineer committed to creating “people-friendly public spaces”. Born in Monaghan, he’s back there now as the county’s chief executive. In between, however, he cut a swathe through south Dublin, where the former Green Party TD and junior minister Ossian Smyth recalls him as “The TK Whitaker of cycle lanes”. His book, a joint production with the Museum of Childhood Ireland, takes its inspiration from the Patrick Kavanagh poem Inniskeen Road: July Evening, in which “the bicycles go by in twos and threes”. But in Dublin, during Covid, Burns oversaw construction of the 4.5km segregated cycle route between Blackrock and Sandycove for a mere €1 million. Now the bicycles go by there, not just in twos and threes, but at a rate of 20,000 a week. The idea behind Kings and Queens of the Road was to get people – around 60 of them in this case – of all ages and backgrounds to recall their childhood journeys to school: a rite of passage that, as the anthology of their stories prove, stays with you all your life. The title too comes from Kavanagh’s poem, although it was somewhat ironic in that context, where the poet’s social exclusion from a dance in Billy Brennan’s barn makes him the reluctant monarch of a now empty road, “a mile of kingdom”. The new book, by contrast, is inclusive to a fault. Routes described range geographically from Caherdavin to China (where the Irish-exiled artist Jin Yong grew up in a town where it could be -30 degrees in winter and where once, as a nine-year-old, he took a short cut across a frozen river only for one of his legs to slip through the ice. Luckily, the rest of him didn’t, and he survived to reach school, where the teacher let him and his “rock-hard” trousers thaw out by the fire). The stories are not all about walking and cycling either. Another artist, Leanne McDonagh, a Traveller, recalls the excitement of days in the 1990s when her father would turn up at school not in the usual Hiace van but a horse and cart. “This of course was the coolest thing ever ... myself and my siblings would climb on to the sulky hoping to get the side seat first because we all knew that to be sitting on the edge was the most exciting place to be, only topped by the chance of holding the reins and taking the lead on the journey home to the site.” The well-named Aidan Herdman, now retired from a job in Guinness’s brewery, was one of several who read his contribution at the book’s launch last week. Although his school was in Stoneybatter, he recalled a time – not much more than 50 years ago – when the hazards of the route included herds of cattle being walked from a train station in Cabra to the market at Prussia Street. He was not much of a herdman in practice, alas: “I was so scared when they approached me that I ran into a house driveway and closed the gate.” [ Dublin city cycle lane funding slashed by €16mOpens in new window ] The cattle drive was a gauntlet also run by journalist Frank McDonald, formerly of this parish. He grew up just off the North Circular Road and wove his way to school through an area dominated less by cycle paths than cow pats: “It took a bit of skill on the bike to avoid them.” The longest memory in the book is that of Desmond Morris, the English zoologist and broadcaster, now in his late 90s and living in Kildare. His childhood in Swindon included the second World War, when along with his books he had to carry a gas mask to school. The war in Northern Ireland features too. Writer Sheena Wilkinson recalls 1980 and the hazards of taking two buses across a barricaded city centre to her grammar school in “posh south Belfast”. Late on her first day there, she then walked into a no-warning ambush of middle-class smugness: “’Not a good start,’ says my form mistress, and the other girls, who arrived in their mummys’ Range Rovers, or who walked through neighbouring leafy avenues with their pals form the prep school, look at me with scorn.” [ A Troubles childhood: Fifty years on, I think of how I am victim and ‘perpetrator’ at the same timeOpens in new window ] As Museum of Childhood founder Majella McAllister writes in an introduction, the anthology and a related exhibition is the product of a two-year conversation begun on “Back to School” day 2023. Part of the aim, she said, was to reframe the role of children “as rightful users of public space whose needs have been systematically marginalised”. The book, with illustrations by Molly Buí Hennessy, is available in selected shops and, as part of a travelling exhibition, will be distributed free to libraries across Ireland. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Aptos introduces post-quantum signatures before they’re urgently needed
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/aptos-introduces-post-quantum-signatures-proposal
Time Published: 2025-12-18T16:40:32Z
Full Content:
Aptos has proposed an optional post-quantum signature scheme, citing long-term risks that advances in quantum computing could pose to existing cryptography. Blockchain network Aptos is moving toward a post-quantum signature option, reflecting growing concern that advances in quantum computing are no longer purely theoretical and could eventually affect how blockchain networks secure accounts and transactions. On Thursday, Aptos outlined a proposal to introduce post-quantum signatures, addressing the network’s reliance on digital signatures for ownership, transaction authorization and overall security. While existing cryptographic schemes remain secure against classical computers, researchers warn that sufficiently powerful quantum machines could one day forge them, potentially compromising account security retroactively. “Quantum computing is not a distant spectre anymore,” Aptos Labs wrote in a post on X, pointing to early discussions around quantum scaling by IBM and growing regulatory momentum, including the publication of post-quantum cryptography standards by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). “This matters for networks like Aptos because Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) can make today’s signature schemes forgeable, possibly breaking security models,” the post said. CRQCs are machines theoretically powerful enough to break today’s cryptography. In response, developers have proposed AIP-137, an Aptos Improvement Proposal authored by cryptographers at Aptos Labs, which would add support for a post-quantum signature scheme at the account level. If approved through governance, AIP-137 would introduce SLH-DSA, a hash-based digital signature scheme standardized as FIPS 205, as an optional account signature type. The change would make Aptos one of the earliest production blockchains to natively support post-quantum accounts. However, existing accounts would remain unaffected. Post-quantum accounts would be opt-in only, allowing users to adopt selectively. Aptos is one of the larger layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchains, designed primarily to support decentralized applications. Earlier this year, its head of ecosystem, Ash Pampati, told Cointelegraph that consumer-focused applications were gaining traction on the network, particularly those blending elements of Web2 and Web3. As Cointelegraph previously reported, Aptos has also emerged as a venue for tokenized real-world assets, with asset managers including Franklin Templeton and BlackRock deploying products on the network. Related: Google announces quantum advantage, 13,000 times faster than supercomputers While many in the crypto industry argue that quantum threats to blockchains, particularly Bitcoin, remain years away, networks are increasingly taking preparatory steps, with Aptos far from alone in doing so. Earlier this month, Solana tested quantum-resistant transactions on a dedicated testnet, an experiment aimed at evaluating how post-quantum signature schemes could be integrated into its transaction model without disrupting existing accounts. Within the Bitcoin community, a smaller but vocal group of developers, researchers and fund managers has also begun pushing for faster progress on quantum-resistant cryptography. Some have rallied around BIP-360, a proposed Bitcoin Improvement Proposal that would introduce quantum-resistant signature options. However, the idea remains in its early stages and is subject to debate. Others, including early Bitcoin figure Adam Back, have dismissed near-term quantum concerns as a form of fear, uncertainty and doubt, or FUD, arguing that Bitcoin does not rely on encryption for its core security model. Instead, Bitcoin uses digital signature schemes and cryptographic hash functions, which are not imminently threatened by practical quantum computers. Related: Are quantum computers stealing Bitcoin?

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The university lauded him as "among the rare titans whose vision has reshaped not just business, but culture and society more broadly." WWD Editor, International HAILED BY YALE: Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, “embodies the rare combination of business acumen, strategic discipline, aesthetic sensitivity, moral courage, and cultural stewardship that defines history’s most influential leaders.” So said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, as the university bestowed the French luxury titan with its Yale Legend in Leadership Award on Wednesday during its Yale CEO Summit in New York City.

Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of LVMH Americas, accepted the trophy on Arnault’s behalf from Ivanka Trump, Anna Wintour, and Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and CEO of Blackstone. The event was livestreamed on CNBC.com and Arnault delivered an acceptance speech in English via a live video link from Paris. “We are part of French history. Very often when I travel around the world, I feel myself like a kind of ambassador, not only a businessman,” Arnault related, given that his family-controlled luxury group is the steward of so many European heritage brands, from Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy to wine maker Château d’Yquem, whose origins date back to 1593. “I am proud that the group has built continuously, has grown continuously because we are showing something in the world for which the interest of people is constantly growing,” he added. Sonnenfeld described Arnault as “among the rare titans whose vision has reshaped not just business, but culture and society more broadly. His leadership illuminates the extraordinary possibilities that emerge when commercial imagination is paired with cultural vision, civic engagement, social impact, and long-term stewardship. “Under his stewardship, LVMH became the first European company to surpass a $500 billion valuation, transforming a constellation of independent, often family-run ‘maisons’ into a pioneering global powerhouse — without ever sacrificing their soul, heritage, or devotion to meticulous craftsmanship,” he continued. “As the architect of the modern luxury industry, he has shown that genuine leadership in this realm is not about excess but about excellence; not about exclusivity but about enduring cultural contribution.” Arnault has served as chairman and CEO of LVMH since 1989.

Title: Why Is Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Down Today? BlackRock Deposits Spark Worry

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down today as the crypto market remains in a phase of extreme fear. This latest crash came amid BlackRock’s move, which sparked fear of a sell-off from the world’s largest asset manager. The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are down today following BlackRock’s transfer of 2,257 BTC and 74,973 ETH to Coinbase, indicating plans to offload these coins. Notably, the BTC and ETH ETFs recorded outflows on December 16, likely why the asset manager moved these coins to redeem shares for its IBIT and ETHA ETFs, which were sold that day. These Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have continued to record mixed flows, which have partly contributed to declines in BTC and ETH prices. Notably, the Bitcoin price had surged to around $90,000 yesterday from an intraday low of around $87,000, before retracing below $87,000 about an hour later. This immediately sparked theories of manipulation, with some crypto pundits revealing that BlackRock wasn’t the only one selling. Related Reading: The Bearish Structure That Puts Bitcoin Price At $92,550, And Then $82,000 Crypto pundit Kruse claimed that Binance first bought nonstop for over 30 minutes to pump the price, then started dumping millions of BTC and ETH to liquidate longs. He noted that the Bitcoin price pumped about $3,300 in 30 minutes, with $106 million in shorts wiped out during that period. Following that, BTC printed another volatile hourly candle to the downside, which flushed out $52 million in longs. A similar price action had also played out for the Ethereum price. Kruse declared that this wasn’t random volatility but rather liquidity hunting. The pundit further warned that this is how leverage gets punished in crypto. He then reiterated that the volatile Bitcoin and Ethereum price actions weren’t random, indicating the market is being manipulated. Onchain Sleuth Tracer also accused Binance of being responsible for the Bitcoin and Ethereum price declines. He claimed that the crypto exchange pumped and dumped millions of BTC to liquidate traders, with $194 million in shorts and longs liquidated in one hour. Crypto asset manager Bitwise has predicted that the Bitcoin price will break the four-year cycle and set new all-time highs in 2026. The asset manager alluded to factors such as the Bitcoin halving and interest rate cycles as what will drive this rally for the flagship crypto. The firm also remarked that crypto booms and busts fueled by leverage are weaker than in past cycles. Bitwise also stated that institutions are likely to allocate more to Bitcoin ETFs, which is why they expect the Bitcoin price to reach new all-time highs next year. Furthermore, the firm noted that the pro-crypto regulatory shift will continue to allow companies to adopt crypto at a faster rate. The crypto asset manager also predicted that the Ethereum price could reach a new all-time high if the CLARITY Act passes.

Title: The Key To Understanding The Cult Of Globalism’s War On The West
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/the-key-to-understanding-the-cult-of-globalisms-war-on-the-west/
Time Published: 2025-12-18T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
The culture war in the western world is currently hitting a crescendo. At first the media said it was all “conspiracy theory” being amplified by a “fringe minority” of radical right wingers. Then, they admitted the conflict was real but claimed that conservatives were monsters trying to “dismantle democracy”. Today, the culture war has become the dominant issue of our age with the debate echoing through the halls of the White House. Leftists hoped they could make it all go away by dismissing it. They hoped they could continue with their ideological takeover at their leisure. They failed. The rebellion in the US is a product of decades of effort by liberty advocates and it is finally bearing fruit. However, I think many Americans and some Europeans are discovering that movements like progressive wokism (essentially Cultural Marxism) are much more than a mere reaction to the return of conservatives to the cultural space. The fight that’s happening in front of the curtain is only a dim reflection of the fight that’s going on behind the curtain. Almost every facet of leftist political and social activism is bankrolled by some of the wealthiest organizations and individuals on the planet. In fact, I would argue that without the billions of dollars in global funding provided by NGOs, government entities and corporations, the political left as we know it would not exist and the world would be much quieter. A prime example is anti-ICE organizations: These groups have access to extensive cash reserves to finance call networks, they pay for hundreds or even thousand of protesters and agitators, they pay for legal representation and bail to get their activist agents out of jail, and they often obtain inside information on ICE operations before those operations occur. These groups function less like homegrown civil rights efforts and more like clandestine government agencies. And, if you check the tax backgrounds of all of them you will find, without fail, that they’re propped up by NGOs like the Open Society Foundation, Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, global corporations like Vangaurd and Blackrock, and government bureaucracies like USAID (before it was shut down). Nothing about these movements is natural, they are purely astroturf. It might look like chaos, but every time you see leftist mobs on the news trying to interfere with ICE arrests and deportations, what you are watching is a highly organized machine flush with globalist cash working to undermine US sovereignty. The mass immigration of third worlders is coordinated by globalists. The protests against deportations are funded by globalists. The politicians that promote open border policies and enable the invasion of the west are closely associated with prominent globalists. The war on the west is a globalist war; radical activists are mindless soldiers and paid mercenaries. They are not the source of the conflict; they shield the source. Unfortunately there are too many conservative commentators out there that REFUSE to accept the reality that the actions of the political left are coordinated by a deeper conspiracy. I don’t know why they deny the existence of this cabal, I can only surmise that the idea of a top-down conspiracy to bring about the downfall of western culture is too frightening for them to ponder. There is also the problem of motive. There’s plenty of conservatives and patriots with a vague notion of why the globalists do the things they do. Evil exists, that’s not up for debate. But beyond the underlying mental factors of psychopathy and delusions of godhood, the issue of relativism is ever present. It is a globalist obsession. Globalism is rooted in cultural relativism, moral relativism, legal relativism, even biological relativism. Western culture is basically the antithesis of relativism, and thus, it must be destroyed in order for globalism to thrive. Everything else is just a tactic, a strategy to destroy the west while taking none of the blame. Only the west codifies the idea of inherent liberties into its legal framework. Only the west (specifically the US) places individual citizen rights as equal to or greater than the policies of government. Only the west values free thought over uniformity. Only the west (largely the US) preaches the necessity of popular revolt in the wake of collectivist tyranny. The problem is, most of the world has no concept of these ideals. They have spent their lives acclimating to cultures where “rights” are also relative – Relative to the whims of socialist and authoritarian regimes. It therefore makes perfect sense for globalists to fund the importation of millions of foreigners, mostly from the third world, into the west. These are people whose minds are already enslaved by a lifetime of submission to collectivism and oligarchy. The migrants go along with the plan because the incentives are too enticing. Their masters are aiming them at the west and saying: “Go and pillage, take what you can! We will let you plunder these wealthy places as long as you do as we say after the coffers are looted and the blood in the streets is dry in the sun…” In other words, the globalists are giving the oppressed third worlders a steam valve, an opportunity to “chimp out” and act on their worst impulses. It is a sad but pervasive observation that the majority of enslaved minds HATE the existence of free people, even if those people live on the other side of the planet. This doesn’t only apply to hostile migrants, it also applies to the progressives that live next door to us. Look at what happened during the pandemic. Look at how they act when faced with facts that contradict their political beliefs. They snap, they crash out, they go insane. They spit and froth and rage like animals. They revile us and nothing would make them happier than to see us dead. All because we don’t blindly embrace their doctrine. Wokeness, along with multiculturalism, is a globalist construct adapted as a new world religion and all of its tenets are designed as an attack on western values. We respect meritocracy, so they create DEI and equity. We promote personal responsibility, so they promote narcissism and self worship. We revere free markets, so they enable expanding socialism. We respect biological science and the biblical definitions of man and woman, so they create gender fluid ideology. We respect moral objectivity and the reality of good and evil, so they conjure up the philosophy of moral relativism as a license for ubridled degeneracy. To be sure, there are other cultures that do not embrace wokeness, but they don’t present a legitimate threat to globalism. They don’t have a legacy of free thought, they have no interest in rebellion and they are mostly disarmed so they wouldn’t be able to fight back if they wanted to. Wokeness was specifically tailored as a weapon against the west; a weapon that targets our belief in liberty and attempts to use it against us. For if an individual has a right to choose their own path, how far does this right extend? Do individuals have the rights and the freedom to congregate into mobs and systematically burn the west down? Liberals would say “yes”, and if anyone tries to stop them those people are tyrants. Are we tyrants if we fight back? Are we fascists if we defend out culture and borders from erasure? Are we hypocrites if we ignore the sovereignty of people whose only goal is to eliminate our sovereignty? My counter-argument to this philosophy is that leftists and globalist have no right to socially engineer the west. They only have the right to leave the west and start their own systems somewhere else. If they hate the west so much, why don’t they relocate instead of staying here, or inviting in millions of immigrants that also have no respect for our heritage? Because this is not a civic disagreement between citizens with a mutual love of country – This is a war between mortal enemies who share nothing in common. They don’t want to live peacefully in another place where they can experiment with socialism to their heart’s content. They want to conquer and subjugate. Globalism must be global. If any competing systems are allowed to exist they will act as proof that the relativist method is an inferior method. The key to understanding the globalist war on the west is first to recognize that a conspiracy of “elites” is a hard, irrefutable fact. Second, we must accept that war has been declared on us and this war is one of total conquest. We are not allowed to live separately and peacefully, our very existence is seen as a threat to the establishment. Third, globalists view western culture as antithetical to their future aims. Globalism cannot prevail as long as western ideals exist. Finally, as noted, most of the world is against us whether they know it or not. Even old allies in Europe are becoming enemies. Import masses of third worlders into America and they don’t become American, America becomes the third world. Import millions of socialists into the US and the US becomes increasingly socialist. This is very simple to understand, but leftists (and some libertarians) refuse to acknowledge the truth. Not all cultures are equal. Some are better than others. It’s fascinating how liberals continue to pretend as if different nations and cultures don’t produce tribes that are contrary to each other. We are not the same and natural coexistence is a myth. Coexistence of such groups is created through intimidation, extortion and force. The liberal Utopian ideal of multiculturalism requires oppressive centralization and tyranny. Globalism is the mechanism by which total and eternal oligarchy is achieved. They use open borders, mass immigration, woke cultism, economic crisis, international conflagration, engineered pandemics, anything you can think of and more to tear their enemies down. We are their enemy. We didn’t choose this fight, they did, and they will continue changing strategies until they find one that works (or until we end their little experiment).

Title: BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton Announce Collaboration with the ADI Foundation Signaling Institutional Adoption

Time Published: 2025-12-18T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
December 18, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: ADI Chain ADI Chain ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, Dec. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Days after the mainnet launch, the MENA region's first and largest institutional L2 has secured partnerships with BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton, demonstrating institutional confidence in compliance-first blockchain architecture. The Institutional Validation Each of ADI's latest partnerships targets different infrastructure needs: Three global institutions partnering within days of launch signal what they need: a blockchain built for regulatory frameworks. These partnerships expand the ADI Foundation's influence, reach, and capabilities, bringing more projects into the ecosystem as enterprises discover ADI Chain through BlackRock, Mastercard, Franklin Templeton, and expanding institutional networks. Launch and Access The ADI utility token launched simultaneously with the mainnet across Kraken, Crypto.com, and KuCoin, and became available through Wallet in Telegram and Fasset shortly after. The market response showed demand for compliance-ready infrastructure: that interest extends beyond institutional players. The Build Continues BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton joined an ecosystem spanning partnerships across 20 countries. Over 50 institutional and enterprise projects are in the pipeline for deployment on ADI Chain, with institutional and technology partnerships continuing to expand. Projects deploying on ADI Chain already demonstrate the network's institutional use cases: The foundation's strategic partnerships expand its capabilities and market access: ZKsync powers ADI Chain's zero-knowledge proof infrastructure, Alchemy provides national-scale deployment capabilities, WalletConnect enables cross-chain interoperability, and Covalent delivers real-time blockchain data for institutional applications. Core infrastructure milestones continue advancing as well. ADI Chain was chosen to host the UAE Dirham-backed stablecoin, which will be issued by two major players in the region: First Abu Dhabi Bank and IHC, and is set to be regulated by the UAE Central Bank. Alongside technical infrastructure, the Foundation will launch an educational initiative, ‘Future Tech 4.0’ in partnership with ADGM and leading universities to develop over 10,000 Web3 specialists. A Year of Building Most L2 blockchains compete on transaction speed and low fees. ADI Chain took a different approach, building for compliance, regulatory alignment, and government deployment. The thesis was straightforward: emerging market governments and institutions need blockchain infrastructure designed specifically for them. One year ago, the ADI Foundation announced its formation at Abu Dhabi Finance Week. Last week, it returned to the same stage to announce the ADI Chain Mainnet launch. Twelve months from formation to operational infrastructure, with partnerships confirmed within days. BlackRock, Mastercard, and Franklin Templeton signed partnerships days after launch, showing they had monitored development closely. When institutions of that scale move that quickly, it validates the category itself. ADI established "institutional L2 for MENA" before competitors could claim the space. ADI aims to bring one billion people onchain by 2030. One year in: mainnet operational, partnerships across 20 countries, 50+ projects ready to deploy, 500+ million people already within reach.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs record $450M inflows in ‘early positioning’ push

Spot Bitcoin ETFs logged their strongest inflows in over a month amid renewed institutional demand tied to shifting macro expectations. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $457 million in net inflows on Wednesday, marking their strongest single-day intake in more than a month as institutional demand showed signs of re-acceleration. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) led the inflows, recording the largest daily intake at roughly $391 million, accounting for the majority of the day’s net inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) followed with around $111 million, according to data from Farside Investors. Other funds saw modest withdrawals. Bitwise’s BITB saw about $8.4 million in outflows, ARK 21Shares’ ARKB recorded roughly $37 million in outflows, and Hashdex’s DEFI posted around $1.5 million in net outflows on the day. The inflows lifted cumulative net inflows for US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs to more than $57 billion, while total net assets climbed above $112 billion, equivalent to around 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. The rebound followed a choppy stretch in November and early December, when flows alternated between modest inflows and sharp outflows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs last saw inflows above $450 million on Nov. 11, when funds pulled in roughly $524 million in a single day. Related: Crypto ETPs to enter ‘cheesecake factory’ era in 2026: Bitwise Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, said the renewed interest appears to reflect early positioning rather than late-cycle enthusiasm. “ETF inflows feel like early positioning,” Liu said. “As rate expectations soften, BTC becomes a clean liquidity trade again. Politics sets the mood, but capital moves on macro.” However, Liu cautioned that while momentum could continue, it is unlikely to be smooth. “Momentum likely holds, but expect it to be uneven,” he said. “Flows will track liquidity and price action. As long as BTC remains a clean macro expression, ETFs stay the path of least resistance.” On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said he plans to appoint a new Federal Reserve chair who strongly supports cutting interest rates. Speaking during a national address marking the first year of his second term, Trump said he would announce a successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell early next year, adding that all known finalists favor lower rates than current levels. Lower rates are usually considered bullish for risk assets like crypto. Related: Spot Bitcoin ETFs see $358M outflow: Are investors really abandoning BTC? Bitcoin has returned to price levels last seen nearly a year ago, leaving behind a dense supply cluster between $93,000 and $120,000 that continues to cap recovery attempts. This top-heavy structure has pushed the amount of Bitcoin held at a loss to 6.7 million BTC, the highest level of the current cycle, according to Glassnode. The report said demand remains fragile across both spot and derivatives markets. Spot buying has been selective and short-lived, corporate treasury flows episodic, and futures positioning continues to de-risk rather than rebuild conviction. Until sellers are absorbed above $95,000 or fresh liquidity enters the market, Bitcoin is likely to remain caught between structural support near $81,000, per Glassnode.

Title: Either way the EU loses: Why ignoring the US on Russian assets will be the bloc’s undoing
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/629570-eu-russian-sovereign-assets/
Time Published: 2025-12-18T08:21:03Z

It is crunch time for Ursula von der Leyen and her Brussels-based cabal who have attempted to bend and break EU law in order to force through a dubious legal claim for the use of sovereign Russian wealth to further fund Ukraine’s military. Kiev is long past broke, owes the EU some €45 billion and faces a fiscal shortage of €70 billion for the next year, and is suffering a slow and painful frontline collapse. Moscow has long described the EU’s attack on its assets as “theft,” the IMF and European Central Bank both oppose the move, and the ratings agency Fitch has already issued a downgrade warning to Euroclear, the clearing house at centre of the scandal. The stakes Von der Leyen, along with her compatriot German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, have managed to bring what is widely regarded as a potentially disastrous initiative to an EU vote under dubious circumstances which, if it fails, will leave the two German politicians’ reputations in ruins. Merz has been at the megaphone this week while von der Leyen has pressed the flesh with bloc members. In the past 48 hours, the former chairman of the Blackrock Germany board has declared the ‘pax Americana’ is over, compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler (Merz’s grandfather was a Nazi), and warned of direct NATO-Russia conflict. However, it could be worse. If the vote to use Russian assets to finance Kiev’s military is passed, it will permanently damage the EU’s reputation, spell the end of any Russia-EU cooperation for decades while triggering a global legal onslaught. A slew of cases will be opened in the bloc, not least by Belgium, which has protested against the EU attempts to get its hands on some €180 billion of Russian sovereign wealth held in the Belgian clearing house Euroclear. Russia has also begun legal proceedings in a Moscow arbitration court for damages. Some €280 billion of assets belonging to countries deemed “unfriendly” by Moscow, presently held in type-C deposits in Russia, could be seized in retaliation for the European attack on Russia’s funds, as well as a wave of litigation potentially targeting all complicit institutions in every major global financial hub. Death and “pax Americana” The European option also ignores the military reality in Donbass and Ukraine, by seeking to pour billions into continuing a war that Kiev is undoubtedly losing. US President Donald Trump’s team, however, have proposed a different mechanism which Russia has not outright rejected, by which the Russian funds in question are used for an investment vehicle. Such a mechanism could have a very positive impact on the investment climate in a post-conflict Ukraine, given the rampant and endemic corruption associated with the country and in particular Vladimir Zelensky’s inner circle. Effectively what we are witnessing is the European Union rejecting Washington while trying to force on Kiev a militaristic future which only promises years of warfare. The US, which let us remember initiated this entire round of diplomacy, has a proposal on the table that could secure a stable and lasting peace, offer security guarantees to all parties involved, and have a positive impact on the investment climate in a country that will need unprecedented investment. The Spin While you may have read that the European Union has already taken an indefinite hold over Russia’s assets in lieu of reparations to Ukraine, neither of these claims is true. The EU has misused article 122 of its constitution to assert a temporary hold over Russian assets for as long as they can prove that the conflict in Ukraine poses or threatens to pose an economic risk to the bloc. There is no indefinite freeze on Russian assets for reparations to speak of. Belgian Prime Minister Bart de Wever has spoken of the EU “stealing” Russian assets. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Rueben has already described the EU tactics as “a declaration of war.” Slovakia’s Robert Fico, who was shot at close range by a pro-Ukraine activist, has claimed Brussels is only “prolonging the war.” Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis has also refused to support financing Ukraine. Italy, Malta, and others are also said to be firmly against the plot to steal Russia’s assets and are advocating for a different option. The vote Though the matter is regarded as a foreign policy issue involving the assets of a non-member of the bloc and would normally require unanimity to pass, von der Leyen has managed force a vote under qualified majority voting. This means that 15 of the 27 member states, and/or states representing 65% of the EU’s population must vote in favor in order to pass the ruling. Eight votes against could be enough to force von der Leyen to have to go back to EU taxpayers, already suffering and drifting to the left and right, to seek lining for Ukraine’s donated war chest. Should the reparations loan option be defeated or removed from the table, the joint debt option, whereby EU member countries must borrow money for Ukraine, to be repaid by the countries themselves, will arise, requiring unanimity to pass. Either way, it looks like Brussels could lose. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

Title: Binance’s US Return Strategy: CZ’s Stake At Risk In Potential Recapitalization

Amid significant regulatory shifts under President Trump’s administration, Binance is gearing up to relaunch in the United States, potentially reducing the stakes held by its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Following years of legal hurdles that culminated in Zhao serving time in prison, his recent presidential pardon has revitalized the exchange’s prospects within the US crypto landscape. According to a recent Bloomberg report, Binance has been exploring options to restart operations for its American affiliate, Binance.US. This includes discussions of a recapitalization that could dilute Zhao’s majority stake, which has complicated the company’s efforts to expand in the country. At a recent Binance Blockchain Week event, Zhao expressed his commitment to transforming the US into a central hub for cryptocurrency, dubbing it “an emerging land for us.” His remarks came in the wake of a challenging period for Binance.US, which has seen its market share plummet from an impressive 35% to virtually zero since US regulatory bodies charged Zhao and the cryptocurrency exchange two years ago. Several states have also rescinded Binance’s licenses, while others, notably New York, never granted one in the first place. Supporters of the exchange believe that a forthcoming market-structure bill could establish a federal licensing regime, potentially altering the operational landscape for companies like Binance. However, Bitcoinist has continuously reported that the bill’s progress has stalled amid political divisions, casting doubt on its future. For now, the anticipated markup has been delayed until January 2026. The report suggests that if Binance were able to buy back some or all of Zhao’s holdings, it might consider new leadership and strategies to drive growth while leveraging political connections in Washington. Sources familiar with the situation emphasize a sense of urgency for the exchange to make critical decisions. In a separate effort to bolster its standing, the exchange is reportedly aiming for a closer partnership with BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the largest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. This relationship could involve the utilization of BlackRock’s tokenized money-market fund to support trades on Binance. Discussions regarding enhanced financial ties between the two have included the potential development of additional products and revenue-sharing opportunities. Additionally, Binance is looking to strengthen its relationship with World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto venture co-founded by members of the Trump family. These moves appear to have taken shape following Zhao’s pardon and signify the crypto company’s desire to recalibrate its presence in a more favorable political atmosphere. To facilitate these efforts, Binance has promoted Yi He, Zhao’s partner, as a stabilizing force for the company. Over the past few months, she has assumed a prominent role, leading strategic initiatives and revitalizing Binance’s growth narrative. However, her elevation has sparked questions regarding the dynamics of power between her and Teng, the former regulator who has been instrumental in guiding the exchange’s outreach efforts. At the time of writing, BNB, the exchange’s native token, is trading at $846. This represents a major correction of 38% over the past few months, following the cryptocurrency’s all-time high of $1,369.

Title: EU’s seizure of Russian assets sparks legal showdown as Moscow demands $230 billion

The EU is considering repurposing â¬200 billion ($234 billion) in frozen Russian sovereign assets to fund Ukraine, escalating tensions. Russia has retaliated by suing Euroclear for $230 billion, framing the move as outright "theft" and threatening financial instability. The U.S. has privately warned the EU against confiscation, fearing it could sabotage peace talks. Hungary and Slovakia oppose the plan, forcing Brussels to use emergency powers to maintain the freeze. Belgium fears legal exposure, while Ukraine's worsening debt crisis raises doubts about repayment capacity. Moscow filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in Russian courts, with expected enforcement in friendly jurisdictions like China or the UAE. Russian officials warn that asset seizures will erode trust in Western financial systems and trigger retaliatory seizures of European holdings in Russia. The EU's move would be the first time non-belligerent nations seize a belligerent's assets during an ongoing conflict to aid a third party. Historical seizures (Iran, Venezuela) set a contentious precedent, with Russia accusing the West of a "genetic urge to steal." If Russia reclaims assets via international courts, Euroclear and Western financial institutions could face chaos. Ukraine's looming default and Washington's hesitation highlight strategic fragility, with long-term damage to trust in the euro and Western monetary systems.

The European Union's plan to repurpose â¬200 billion ($234 billion) in frozen Russian sovereign assets to fund Ukraine has escalated into a high-stakes legal and financial battle, with Moscow retaliating by suing Euroclear for $230 billion in damages. Euroclear is a Brussels-based financial depository that holds and manages seized Russian assets in European banks, according to BrightU.AI's Enoch. The move, framed by Russia as outright "theft," risks destabilizing Western financial institutions and undermining international trust in the euro. Meanwhile, the U.S. has reportedly warned the EU against confiscating the funds, fearing it could sabotage peace negotiations with Moscow. Following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western nations froze approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets, with â¬210 billion held in Europeâprimarily by Euroclear. EU leaders, led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, have proposed using these funds to back a "reparations loan" for Ukraine, arguing that Kyiv urgently needs financial support as the war drags on. However, the plan has met fierce resistanceânot just from Russia but also within the EU itself. Hungary and Slovakia opposed the measure, forcing Brussels to invoke emergency powers to keep the assets frozen indefinitely. Belgium, home to Euroclear, has expressed concerns about being left vulnerable to Russian lawsuits. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk revealed that Washington has privately urged Brussels to "leave these Russian assets alone," fearing Moscow would harden its stance in peace talks. Russia's legal counterattack Russia has launched a multi-pronged legal offensive, with the Bank of Russia filing a $230 billion lawsuit against Euroclear in Moscow's Commercial Court. Legal experts anticipate a swift ruling in Russia's favor, which could then be enforced in jurisdictions deemed friendly to Moscow, such as China, Hong Kong or the UAE, where Euroclear operates. Kirill Dmitriev, Russian President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy, warned that seizing sovereign assets would erode trust in Western financial systems: "What rational investor will hold its securities in Euroclear, in euro or in the EU, if they understand that their property rights are not respected?" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went further, accusing the West of a "genetic urge to steal," citing past seizures of Iranian and Venezuelan assets. Moscow has vowed to retaliate by targeting European investors' holdings in Russia, potentially escalating into a tit-for-tat financial war. Historical precedent and financial fallout The EU's move marks an unprecedented step in modern financial warfare. A 2024 study by Sweden's Riksbank noted that this would be the first time non-belligerent nations seize a belligerent country's assets during an ongoing conflict to aid a third party. The U.S. has floated an alternative proposalâsplitting the frozen funds between Ukrainian reconstruction and a U.S.-Russia investment vehicleâbut Brussels appears determined to proceed. However, Ukraine's worsening financial crisis complicates matters. Reuters recently reported that Kyiv is nearing default on $20 billion in debt to investors like BlackRock, raising doubts about its ability to repay any new loansâeven those backed by Russian assets. The EU's gamble on Russian assets risks backfiring spectacularly. If Moscow succeeds in reclaiming its funds through international courts, Western financial institutions could face chaos, with Euroclear at the center of the storm.

Russia's legal counterattack Russia has launched a multi-pronged legal offensive, with the Bank of Russia filing a $230 billion lawsuit against Euroclear in Moscow's Commercial Court. Legal experts anticipate a swift ruling in Russia's favor, which could then be enforced in jurisdictions deemed friendly to Moscow, such as China, Hong Kong or the UAE, where Euroclear operates. Kirill Dmitriev, Russian President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy, warned that seizing sovereign assets would erode trust in Western financial systems: "What rational investor will hold its securities in Euroclear, in euro or in the EU, if they understand that their property rights are not respected?" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov went further, accusing the West of a "genetic urge to steal," citing past seizures of Iranian and Venezuelan assets. Moscow has vowed to retaliate by targeting European investors' holdings in Russia, potentially escalating into a tit-for-tat financial war. Historical precedent and financial fallout The EU's move marks an unprecedented step in modern financial warfare. A 2024 study by Sweden's Riksbank noted that this would be the first time non-belligerent nations seize a belligerent country's assets during an ongoing conflict to aid a third party. The U.S. has floated an alternative proposalâsplitting the frozen funds between Ukrainian reconstruction and a U.S.-Russia investment vehicleâbut Brussels appears determined to proceed. However, Ukraine's worsening financial crisis complicates matters. Reuters recently reported that Kyiv is nearing default on $20 billion in debt to investors like BlackRock, raising doubts about its ability to repay any new loansâeven those backed by Russian assets. The EU's gamble on Russian assets risks backfiring spectacularly. If Moscow succeeds in reclaiming its funds through international courts, Western financial institutions could face chaos, with Euroclear at the center of the storm. Meanwhile, Ukraine's economic collapse and Washington's hesitation underscore the fragility of the West's strategy. As legal battles loom and diplomatic tensions flare, one thing is clear: The financial fallout from this confrontation could reshape global trust in Western monetary systems for years to come.

EU leaders, led by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, have proposed using these funds to back a "reparations loan" for Ukraine, arguing that Kyiv urgently needs financial support as the war drags on.

Bitcoin has lost more than 30% of its value since early October, triggering a sharp shift in market psychology. What was once viewed as a routine correction is increasingly being interpreted by analysts as a potential cycle top. Sentiment has deteriorated quickly, with fear and apathy replacing the optimism that dominated earlier in the year. Many investors are now positioning defensively, preparing for what they believe could be a prolonged bear market phase similar to past post-peak cycles. However, a recent CryptoQuant report challenges this increasingly popular narrative. According to the analysis, Bitcoin may no longer be following the traditional four-year boom-and-bust cycle that has defined its historical price behavior. Instead, the report introduces the Bitcoin Supercycle thesis, which argues that the classic halving-driven cycle structure could be breaking down in favor of a more extended, structurally supported bull market. The core idea behind the supercycle framework is that Bitcoin’s market dynamics have fundamentally changed. Unlike previous cycles driven largely by speculative retail flows, the current environment is shaped by new forces that did not exist in earlier eras. These structural shifts may be altering how drawdowns, tops, and recoveries unfold, potentially smoothing volatility over longer time horizons. According to the CryptoQuant report, the case for a potential Bitcoin supercycle is built on structural forces that were absent in previous market cycles. The most significant shift comes from institutional adoption. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by issuers such as BlackRock, have introduced a persistent and regulated source of demand from traditional finance. Unlike speculative retail flows, these vehicles treat Bitcoin as a strategic asset allocation, creating steady absorption rather than short-lived hype. On-chain data further reinforces this narrative. Exchange reserves continue to trend lower, signaling long-term accumulation and reduced sell-side pressure. At the same time, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) remains relatively rational. Profit-taking is occurring, but without the euphoric spikes historically associated with cycle tops, suggesting a more mature and disciplined market structure. Infrastructure readiness is another critical pillar. While Bitcoin remains the core asset, scalability improvements across the broader crypto ecosystem—such as Ethereum’s Fusaka upgrade and the rapid expansion of Layer-2 networks—are enabling faster, cheaper transactions and real-world use cases. This enhances Bitcoin’s role as a settlement and reserve asset within a growing digital economy. Finally, the macro backdrop remains supportive. Geopolitical instability and the prospect of future monetary easing strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal as a neutral, decentralized hard asset. Together, these forces form a credible foundation for an extended supercycle, though the report cautions that external shocks could still disrupt this trajectory. Bitcoin’s short-term structure remains fragile, as shown on the 4-hour chart. Price continues to trade below the $90,000 psychological level, with repeated failures to reclaim key moving averages reinforcing the bearish bias. The 200-period moving average (red) is clearly sloping downward and acting as dynamic resistance near the $92,000–$93,000 zone, while the 100- and 50-period averages (green and blue) have compressed and rolled over, signaling fading upside momentum. After the sharp sell-off earlier in the month, Bitcoin attempted a recovery but stalled below descending resistance. Since then, the price has formed a series of lower highs and lower lows, confirming a short-term downtrend. The current consolidation around $86,000–$87,000 suggests indecision, but notably, bounces are becoming weaker, indicating limited demand on relief rallies. From a technical perspective, the $85,000–$86,000 area represents a critical support zone. A sustained break below this range would likely open the door to a deeper correction. Conversely, bulls would need a decisive reclaim of $90,000, followed by acceptance above the descending moving averages, to meaningfully shift momentum. Until then, the chart favors consolidation with downside risk.

Title: ‘Trump Accounts’ for kids get funding boost from Dalio and BlackRock
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/17/trump-accounts-for-kids-get-funding-boost-from-dalio-and-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-12-17T23:25:56Z
Full Content:
A new savings vehicle, dubbed “Trump accounts,” is designed to help the rising generation of American children build wealth into adulthood. Under the multitrillion-dollar tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump in July, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to accounts set up for every American baby born in the next few years. The initiative got a boost on Dec. 2 when billionaires Michael and Susan Dell announced a $6.25 billion gift to seed accounts for millions of older children as well. Other big names in business and finance, including Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio and BlackRock Inc., soon followed with smaller pledges of their own. Lawmakers significantly scaled back the flexibility and tax benefits of the program since the initial proposal. While the accounts could serve as a springboard for long-term savings, there are other investment vehicles, especially 529 plans, that offer greater tax advantages. Here’s how the accounts are supposed to work and how the new infusion of money might affect the program. For each account, annual contributions would be capped at $5,000, an amount that would be adjusted for inflation. The idea is for parents, relatives and even the employers of caregivers to pitch in money over time. The federal government, as well as state, local or tribal governments, could also contribute and aren’t subject to the cap. The accounts would be locked up until the child turns 18. At that point, Trump accounts essentially become individual retirement accounts, which can be used penalty-free for certain expenses such as higher education or first-time home purchases. Only one account is allowed per person. The US Treasury will issue regulations requiring the funds be invested in mutual or exchange-traded index funds (ETFs) that “primarily” hold US stocks. Funds must charge low fees and not use leverage, according to the law signed in July. Another exception to the contribution limit applies to nonprofits, including 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) organizations, which could give to recipients based on where they live. Parents, relatives, employers or philanthropists can contribute to a designated recipient’s Trump account through the year they turn 17. The Internal Revenue Service has said parents will be allowed to start contributing on behalf of children starting on July 4, 2026. Also, through a pilot program, the US government would contribute $1,000 to accounts for babies born from the beginning of 2025 through the end of 2028. Caregivers will be able to sign up children for an account through an online portal administered by the IRS. The commitments from corporations and well-heeled donors demonstrate how companies and business leaders are eager to demonstrate public support for a program that Trump views as part of his presidential legacy. Dalio said his foundation would donate $250 each to roughly 300,000 “Trump accounts” for children in Connecticut. BlackRock said it would match the federal government’s contributions to the accounts for employees’ children, seeding them with $1,000 each. Those pledges follow the Dells’ announcement in early December of a $6.25 billion gift aimed at seeding accounts for 25 million American children age 10 and under who were too old to be eligible for the initial government funding. The donation targets kids living in ZIP Codes with median incomes below $150,000. Each eligible account would receive $250 from the Dells. While that amount is unlikely to grow into a significant nest egg even over a couple decades, Michael Dell, founder of Dell Technologies Inc., said when he disclosed the gift that he hoped to inspire others to give as well. Trump accounts can’t be touched until age 18. At that point, they’re essentially treated like traditional individual retirement accounts. As with IRAs, money can be withdrawn early for certain qualified expenses, including higher education, up to $10,000 toward first-time home purchases and $5,000 per child for birth or adoption expenses. Other distributions trigger a 10% penalty. The accounts grow tax-free, and wouldn’t be taxed until money is withdrawn. Those taxes are complicated, and the US Treasury hasn’t yet issued rules on how exactly they will work. The law says recipients don’t pay taxes on any post-tax contributions to their accounts, such as those from parents and relatives. But any gains or tax-free contributions from government, philanthropists or employers will be taxed like ordinary income upon withdrawal. On top of that, beneficiaries would also face the 10% IRA withdrawal penalty if money is used for non-qualifying expenses. Lawmakers tweaked the Trump accounts so that distributions will be taxed as ordinary income. Early versions of the bill said distributions would be taxed at long-term capital gains rates, which are much lower than those on ordinary income. The accounts also were changed so that they follow IRA withdrawal rules, meaning a recipient’s small business startup costs no longer qualify for penalty-free distributions. Trump accounts have far fewer tax benefits than 529 college savings plans, which also have far higher contribution limits. With a 529 plan, withdrawals are tax-free for qualified educational expenses, and contributions are often eligible for state income tax deductions. Trump account holders would still pay taxes on withdrawals. The Trump accounts program will cost about $15 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, a tiny fraction of the overall tax and spending package approved in July. An idea for government-funded “baby bonds” was first proposed by economist Darrick Hamilton, a professor at the New School for Social Research in New York, as a way to help poor Americans build assets and narrow the racial wealth gap. Several states, including Connecticut, have set up baby bond programs or are in the process of doing so. Hamilton has been skeptical of Trump accounts, calling them an idea to “address wealth inequality on the cheap.” One impetus for the overall approach appears to have come from Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, who along with economist Robert Shapiro last year began promoting the idea of accounts seeded with $1,000 for newborns. It’s a “simple solution to help people be connected to financial markets so everybody in the country shares in the wealth,” Hassett said at a presentation to the Aspen Institute in 2024. Greg Leiserson, an economist who served in the Biden and Obama administrations, warned “tax-preferred accounts primarily benefit families that already have spare time and money, not the families that need the most help.”

Title: Coinbase announces stock trading and new Kalshi-based prediction markets
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/17/coinbase-announces-stock-trading-and-new-kalshi-based-prediction-markets/
Time Published: 2025-12-17T22:30:00Z

Coinbase is taking its biggest step yet into the broader financial sector. On Wednesday, the company announced customers will now be able to trade stocks on its platform, and also place bets on a wide range of events through a partnership with prediction market startup Kalshi. The moves signal that Coinbase is moving beyond its longtime roots as a cryptocurrency company, and are likely to intensify its rivalry with fintech firms like Robinhood. The stock trading and prediction markets announcements came at a San Francisco event titled System Upgrade that featured stage presentations by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and other executives, who also announced new trading features and a platform called Coinbase Business aimed at startups and small businesses. The event comes as the company is seeking to brand itself as an “everything exchange.” Notably, the company did not announce a release date for its own cryptocurrency token, which executives have teased in recent months, but without providing additional details beyond saying they want to ensure any token launch takes place in a fair manner. The new stock trading feature is the most significant announcement by far as it will be a crucial test of whether Coinbase can leverage its dominant crypto brand to expand into other sectors. It will also allow it to compete more directly with Robinhood, which made its name as a stock-trading app, but has since made significant inroads into crypto.Coinbase will initially offer only a curated list of major stocks and ETFs, but says it will expand this to thousands of other stocks in coming months. The company says stock trading will be available 24 hours a day on five days of the week, and that there will be no fee to trade. Early next year, Coinbase plans to roll out perpetual futures for stocks—a type of derivative pioneered by the crypto industry that lets traders hold options that do not expire. The perpetual futures offering will only be available outside the U.S. Coinbase’s new stock offerings come at a time when the financial market is beginning to embrace tokenization. The term describes turning a variety of assets into tokens that can be traded on a blockchain, a process that results in near-instant settlement and allows traders to more efficiently deploy collateral. Currently, firms like BlackRock are offering tokenized versions of Treasury bill and money-market funds. Tokenized stock offerings are still at a preliminary stage, but are expected to gain traction rapidly, which could play to Coinbase’s strengths given the firm’s longtime crypto expertise. For its prediction markets offering, Coinbase will source its order flow from Kalshi, which is the same model used by Robinhood. In practical terms, this entails acting as a distribution platform for the startup, which has grown exponentially this year by offering a new form of betting that invites users to wager against one another on the outcome of events ranging from elections to interest rate cuts to sports games. The Kalshi partnership will likely entail a revenue split of the small fee the platform collects on wagers. Stocks and prediction markets have the potential to offer Coinbase significant new revenue streams, and further the company’s long-stated goal of diversifying its business beyond crypto trading. Coinbase’s stock is roughly flat from the start of the year, having given up big gains in recent months as crypto markets have sagged and the price of Bitcoin has fallen around 30% from its October highs. Coinbase also used the San Francisco event to announce that its Base App is now available in 140 countries. The app, which debuted this summer, aims to let ordinary people launch financial and creative products on the company’s blockchain and earn a share of the revenue they create. Other services unveiled by Coinbase on Wednesday included expanded access to the Solana blockchain via a decentralized exchange, and an AI-powered wealth management tool called Coinbase Advisor.

The U.S. Treasury asked major philanthropic donors to contribute to new investment accounts for children Wednesday as part of what Secretary Scott Bessent called a “50 State Challenge” to raise funds for the Trump Accounts program. “The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said in an address. The billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio, along with his wife Barbara, announced they would commit $250 to 300,000 children under 10 in Connecticut who live in ZIP codes where the median income is less than $150,000. Dalio founded the investment firm Bridgewater Associates and lives in Connecticut. “I have been fortunate to live the American Dream. At an early age I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life,” Ray Dalio said in a statement, adding that he sees the accounts as putting children on a path toward financial independence. The Dalios’ $75 million commitment follows the $6.25 billion pledge from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell earlier in December. The Dells promised to invest $250 in the accounts of 25 million children 10 and under who live in ZIP codes across the country that also have that median income. The new investment accounts were created as part of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending legislation, passed over the summer. Under the new law, the U.S. Department of the Treasury will deposit $1,000 into the investment accounts of children born during Trump’s second term. The Treasury has not yet launched the new accounts. “Starting on July 4th, our nation’s 250th anniversary, parents, family members, employers and friends will be able to contribute up to $5,000 to each Trump Account each year,” Bessent said Wednesday. Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who championed the accounts, said the Treasury will create an account for every child in the U.S. who has a Social Security number but private companies will eventually administer the accounts. Parents or guardians will have to claim the accounts on behalf of their children. For children born before Trump came to office and who don’t qualify for the funds from the Dells and the Dalios, their families can open and fund their own Trump Account if they choose. Money in the accounts must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business. Bessent said employers, family members and philanthropists can put funds into the accounts and that the administration hopes states will also eventually set up programs to invest in the accounts. Companies including Visa and BlackRock have also pledged to contribute in some way to the accounts of their employees’ children. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

BlackRock U.S. head of equity ETFs Jay Jacobs explains why more investors should activate active investing and analyzes market performance as stocks slip to kick off December on 'The Claman Countdown.' The exchange-traded fund industry is having a record year, with assets already hitting over $1 trillion, and active managers are driving a big part of that growth. "Third-quarter activity confirmed what we’ve seen building over the past several years: Active ETFs continue to drive innovation and flows," wrote Dan Aronson, managing director, ETF client product specialist group, in Janus Henderson’s "ETF Pulse" through the third quarter. Active managers can be part of the decision-making regarding which stocks to include using the convenience of an ETF. Active ETFs account for 80% of year-to-date launches, with assets under management growing 38% compared to 6% for passive ETFs, he noted. New launches are balanced between fixed income and equities. Janus Henderson reports strong activity among active ETFs (Janus Henderson Investors ) However, not all funds are created equal.

Title: Binance mulls new US strategy, CZ potentially reducing stake: Report
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-us-strategy-cz-reduce-stake
Time Published: 2025-12-17T18:50:29Z
Full Content:
Binance exited the United States in 2019, and a separate company, Binance.US, has been serving US customers since that time. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is considering a strategic reshuffling to strengthen its presence in the US market, a move that could see Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao’s majority stake in the company reduced. Zhao’s controlling stake in Binance has been a “major hurdle” to the company expanding to strategically critical US states, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. Although no concrete plans have been announced, the conversation surrounding any potential action remains reportedly “fluid.” The company is also considering partnerships with US-based companies, including asset manager BlackRock and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which is linked to US President Donald Trump, to strengthen its footprint in the country. Rumors of Binance’s return to the US began to circulate in October after Trump pardoned Zhao, fueled by speculation from crypto industry executives and comments that Zhao made on social media. “Will do everything we can to help make America the capital of crypto and advance Web3 worldwide,” Zhao said in October after the pardon. In June 2019, Binance announced that it would stop serving US customers, and a separate company, called Binance.US and operated by BAM Trading Services, was formed to provide regulatory-compliant services to US users. In 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Binance Holdings Ltd. operated both Binance.com and BAM Trading Services. Binance.US does not feature crypto derivatives or access to the global Binance exchange’s liquidity and operates as a completely separate crypto exchange. Cointelegraph reached out to Binance and Binance.US but did not receive a response by the time of publication. The US is considered a key market for crypto exchanges and is ranked as the number two for global crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis’ 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index. Expanding to the US would open up US liquidity to the world’s largest crypto exchange. Related: Binance names co-founder Yi He co-CEO alongside Richard Teng Trump’s pardon of Zhao in October drew backlash from several Democratic Party lawmakers in the US, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and California Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Waters said the pardon was a form of pay-to-play and accused Trump of doing political favors for the crypto industry that “helped line his pockets.”Warren, who is one of the most vocal critics of the crypto industry, also criticized the pardon, characterizing it as “corruption.” The comments reflect pockets of resistance among some Democratic lawmakers to the crypto industry’s continued expansion in the US and could signal potential opposition to Binance returning to the US.

Hedge fund manager Ray Dalio has joined the list of billionaires backing President Donald Trump's new plan to give $1,000 to every child born in the next three years. Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, and his wife, Barbara, will donate $250 to about 300,000 children in Connecticut who live in zip codes where the median family income is $150,000 or less, Dalio Philanthropies said in a press release. "Barbara and I believe strongly in the importance of equal opportunity and believe this initiative is an important step in that direction," Ray Dalio said in the release. "I have lived the American dream. At an early age, I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life. By providing children with savings accounts that compound over time, we are providing them with early insights into financial literacy and a path towards financial independence." BlackRock, too, announced on Wednesday that it would "offer an employee match to the US government contribution of $1,000 for all eligible US employees to Trump Accounts." Several other business leaders, including Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, have also committed to contributing funds to the accounts of their employees' children, according to Invest America, the federal program spearheaded by Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner that is now commonly known as "Trump Accounts." BNY, a financial services company, also announced last week that it would match Trump Account funds for its employees. Since June, some of the country's wealthiest individuals have been lining up behind Trump's plan to provide a one-time, tax-free federal grant of $1,000 to every American child born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028. The accounts will be in the child's name, but their parent will remain the sole custodian until the child turns 18. Others can contribute up to an additional $5,000 tax-free to those accounts every year. The program will officially launch on July 4, 2026. The Dalios' donation follows a substantial commitment from Michael and Susan Dell, who pledged to deposit $250 into the accounts of 25 million American kids — about $6.25 billion — earlier this month. The payments will be automatically deposited into the account of any child who fits the criteria and opens a Trump Account. However, not all billionaires are rushing to contribute to the Trump Accounts. The world's richest man, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, shared his thoughts on the Trump Accounts in a response on X to Ray Dalio, who had posted his praise for the program and Dells' contribution. "It is certainly a nice gesture of the Dells, but there will be no poverty in the future and so no need to save money. There will be universal high income," Musk wrote. Musk once said that Tesla's Optimus robot would "eliminate poverty." Dalio Philanthropies and BlackRock did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) The U.S. Treasury asked major philanthropic donors to contribute to new investment accounts for children Wednesday as part of what Secretary Scott Bessent called a “50 State Challenge” to raise funds for the Trump Accounts program. “The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said in an address. The billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio, along with his wife Barbara, announced they would commit $250 to 300,000 children under 10 in Connecticut who live in ZIP codes where the median income is less than $150,000. Dalio founded the investment firm Bridgewater Associates and lives in Connecticut. “I have been fortunate to live the American Dream. At an early age I was exposed to the stock market, and it changed my life,” Ray Dalio said in a statement, adding that he sees the accounts as putting children on a path toward financial independence. The Dalios commitment, which will total at least $75 million, follows the $6.25 billion pledge from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell earlier in December. The Dells promised to invest $250 in the accounts of 25 million children 10 and under who live in ZIP codes across the country that also have that median income. The new investment accounts were created as part of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending legislation, passed over the summer. Under the new law, the U.S. Department of the Treasury will deposit $1,000 into the investment accounts of children born during Trump’s second term. The Treasury has not yet launched the new accounts. “Starting on July 4th, our nation’s 250th anniversary, parents, family members, employers and friends will be able to contribute up to $5,000 to each Trump Account each year,” Bessent said Wednesday. Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who championed the accounts, said the Treasury will create an account for every child in the U.S. who has a Social Security number but private companies will eventually administer the accounts. Parents or guardians will have to claim the accounts on behalf of their children. For children born before Trump came to office and who don’t qualify for the funds from the Dells and the Dalios, their families can open and fund their own Trump Account if they choose. Money in the accounts must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business. Bessent said employers, family members and philanthropists can put funds into the accounts and that the administration hopes states will also eventually set up programs to invest in the accounts. Companies including Visa and BlackRock have also pledged to contribute in some way to the accounts of their employees’ children. Jane Waldfogel, a professor at the Columbia University School of Social Work, said ideally, governments would provide benefits that help families with children afford immediate expenses and programs like the Trump Accounts that help families save for a child’s future. “The problem that many scholars have tried to address and many politicians have tried to address with these child savings accounts is that low-income families and even middle-income families struggle to put aside money and save money for their children’s future,” said Waldfogel, who recently published a book about child benefits. Without regular government contributions targeted toward poorer families, Waldfogel does not expect the accounts to decrease economic inequality as affluent families will take advantage of them but other families will not. Steven Durlauf, a professor at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy, said he expects the accounts to make a very modest contribution toward the resources of young adults. His research has examined what factors impact the success of children and he said improving early childhood education and rectifying racial and economic segregation at schools and in neighborhoods would do more to give children the skills and opportunities they need to be productive. Durlauf also said as much as the philanthropy of the affluent is admirable, he thinks it should remain out of politics and controversies. “This is integrating the wealthy into the support of particular government programs that are associated with particular political figures,” he said. “And that strikes me as extraordinarily dangerous.” The Dalios have granted tens of millions to Connecticut public schools over the years, though a $100 million initiative launched in 2019 that would have involved matching public funds fell apart after state lawmakers raised questions over transparency. Altogether, the Dalios say they’ve given $7 billion through their philanthropy, which has focused on education, support for economic advancement and ocean research and education. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

For more information, please contact: Sequana Medical Investor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.com T: +44 (0) 797 342 9917 About Sequana Medical Sequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload, a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease, heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study, a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada, the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1,2. Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025, CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements3. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com.

Share this article BlackRock deposited 74,973 Ethereum worth $220 million and 4,356 Bitcoin worth $382 million to Coinbase Prime today, according to data from blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. The movements come amid uneven flows across BlackRock’s digital asset funds. On Tuesday, the firm’s Bitcoin ETF recorded more than $210 million in net outflows, while its Ethereum ETF saw net redemptions exceeding $220 million. Still, daily ETF flows do not necessarily capture the immediate trading behavior of the underlying assets. Instead, the flows provide insight into share creation and redemption. That said, authorized participants may choose to hold shares in inventory, wait for buyers, or redeem shares for Bitcoin at a later time. This means that inflows and outflows often lag actual market activity, and short-term daily numbers may not accurately reflect investor sentiment or trading pressure.

Title: Most Influential: Carlos Domingo

Time Published: 2025-12-17T15:00:00Z

Eight years after co-founding Securitize in 2017, Carlos Domingo is steering what has quietly become one of the core infrastructure players of the tokenized asset trade. This feature is a part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025 list. The firm says it has about $3.6 billion in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) outstanding as of late November and expects to finish the year above $4 billion in assets under management. Securitize is profitable — revenue has grown roughly 10x over the past 18 months — and the firm is preparing to go public via a SPAC merger with Cantor Fitzgerald’s vehicle, with a listing targeted for early next year. “This has been the best year in the company's history, by far,” Domingo said in an interview with CoinDesk. “It’s been the inflection point we’d been waiting for.” If tokenization is one of crypto’s big narratives now, Domingo is quick to point out that Securitize was there when it decidedly wasn’t. “In 2021 I would talk to investors and they’d say, ‘Why would we invest in tokenization? Look at FTX, Celsius, BlockFi, they’re growing so fast,’” he said. “I’d say, ‘Sure, but are you sure those guys will be around tomorrow?’ There were a lot of red flags. Still, we were not the cool kids on the block.” It was a challenging path. Securitize had to raise fresh funding roughly every 18 months, with modest rounds compared to the mega-raises going to unregulated trading platforms. Hiring talent was harder, too. “We couldn’t give people big token packages. We couldn’t pay the highest salaries,” Domingo said. What kept him going was conviction and a bit of survivalist philosophy. “One of our board members, Brad Stephens from Blockchain Capital, told me: you need to be like a cockroach,” Domingo said. “Digitization of any industry is unavoidable, the only thing you don’t know is when. So you need to make sure you don’t die before it happens.” He’s blunt about what happened to early tokenization rivals. “If you look at the companies that looked like they were going to dominate, most disappeared, ran out of money or sold on bad terms,” he said. “Being early is a problem if you don’t survive.” Carlos Domingo will be speaking at CoinDesk's upcoming Consensus Hong Kong in February and Consensus 2026 in Miami in May. When Securitize launched, Domingo thought he was building a software company. “The original idea was to sell a tokenization platform as technology,” he recalled. Banks, asset managers and other issuers would license the stack, tokenize their assets and handle everything themselves. Securitize would just ship code. It took less than a year for reality to bite. “In 2018 it became very clear we needed to pivot from being a technology provider to being a service provider,” he said. “The people that have financial assets are not technology companies. They expect somebody to provide service to them – that’s what BNY, State Street or SS&C do.” That led Securitize to pursue licenses and roles that live deep in the plumbing of traditional finance. The firm became a registered transfer agent in the U.S., then added a broker-dealer, an alternative trading system (ATS), an investment adviser and fund administration capabilities. The transformation culminated with the acquisition of MG Stover’s unit, turning Securitize into the largest digital-asset fund administrator. Today, instead of selling a tokenization toolkit, Domingo pitches a one-stop shop to bring assets onchain. “We go to an asset manager and say: we’ll form the fund, we’ll put your securities onchain, we’ll integrate with the blockchains and DeFi, we’ll do distribution, fund admin, everything,” he said. “You do what you do well — manage assets. We do everything else.” He traces that strategy back to a dog-eared copy of “Crossing the Chasm,” Geoffrey Moore’s classic on commercializing new technologies. The core idea: early adopters are happy to stitch together multiple vendors; the mainstream market is not. “To cross the chasm, you have to offer the whole product,” Domingo said. “People are not going to piecemeal build things by putting together five different providers." The company has now moved far beyond survival, lining up a powerful roster of backers including BlackRock, Jump Crypto and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest. Securitize helped bring BlackRock’s tokenized fund to market last year and has since expanded it across multiple blockchains, including Solana and BNB Chain. It’s currently the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury offering, with a roughly $2.5 billion market cap. It also lined up a powerful roster of backers Ark Invest, BlackRock and Jump Crypto. Domingo said the important shift isn’t just about putting securities on a “better ledger,” but, instead, what happens after that. The use case he emphasized is collateral. “We’re very bullish on collateral,” he said. “You can take high-quality collateral like people use in TradFi, but move it at crypto speed, 24/7, with the quality of collateral institutions expect.” Securitize has worked with venues like Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, on using tokenized RWAs as collateral in derivatives and other products. It's the kind of plumbing that doesn’t trend on social media, but it’s where Domingo sees tokenization starting to matter for the broader crypto market structure. The SPAC listing is both a milestone and a new kind of pressure. “I’m very excited about finally going public. It’s going to be a defining moment for us,” he said. “It’s also scary. I’ve never been CEO of a publicly traded company.” While Securitize’s year may look like an overnight success, from Domingo’s point of view, it’s the delayed payoff for being early and refusing to leave. “Now it’s not about whether the industry is happening or not,” he said. “It’s about how much market share we can capture and retain. We’ve been talking about this for eight years. Finally, everybody else is talking about it too.” More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You Foundation behind restaking protocol EigenLayer plans bigger rewards for active users An Incentives Committee would direct programmatic token emissions, focusing allocations on participants that secure AVSs and contribute to the EigenCloud ecosystem.

Title: Did Bitcoin's 4-year cycle break, and is the bull market really over?
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/did-bitcoin-4-year-cycle-break-is-bull-market-really-over
Time Published: 2025-12-17T14:55:34Z

Bitcoin ETFs, corporate treasuries and macro tailwinds are challenging BTC’s traditional four-year cycle, which could result in new all-time highs in 2026. Key takeaways: ETFs, treasuries and macro tailwinds may snap Bitcoin’s four-year boom-and-bust pattern. A bearish phase should not be ruled out before new all-time highs. Bitcoin (BTC) has historically moved in four-year cycles tied to its halving events, with prices typically peaking 12-18 months after each supply cut before sliding into a prolonged bear market. This time was no different. Bitcoin peaked near $126,200 in October, exactly eighteen months after the April 2024 halving, before declining by more than 30%. The trend aligns with the early stages of past bearish phases, prompting veteran analysts such as Peter Brandt to see Bitcoin falling toward $25,000 in the coming months. João Wedson, founder of onchain analytics company Alphractal, pointed to the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Trend Signal, a metric signaling the end of Bitcoin’s bull market. Historically, SOPR marked market turning points by tracking shifts between profit-taking and loss-driven selling. In bull markets, SOPR stayed above 1 as coins were sold at a profit, often preceding local tops. Near the bottom, it fell toward or below 1, signaling a realization of loss. A sustained recovery above 1 later marked easing sell pressure and past rebounds. As of December, SOPR was trending lower, showing BTC was being spent at smaller profits or at a loss. This supported the bearish narrative based on the four-year cycle. “You may believe that Bitcoin’s cycles have changed and that this time is different,” Wedson said, adding: Multiple market observers noted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle may no longer be applicable, however. On Monday, US-based Grayscale Investments predicted that BTC’s price would reach a new record high in the first half of 2026, citing a growing macro demand due to currency debasement and a supportive regulatory environment in the US. “Fiat currencies (and assets denominated in fiat currencies) face additional risks due to high and rising public sector debt and its potential implications for inflation over time,” Grayscale wrote in its latest report, adding: Fidelity shared a similar bullish outlook in its 2026 crypto outlook report. The investment company discussed the odds of Bitcoin entering a “supercycle,” analogous to commodity supercycles in the 2000s that spanned nearly a decade. Related: Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is intact, but driven by politics and liquidity: Analyst Central to this view is what Chris Kuiper, Fidelity Digital Assets’ vice president of research, called an “entirely new cohort and class of investors,” which could support a longer market expansion than in past cycles. “We’ve seen traditional money managers and investors begin to buy Bitcoin and other digital assets,” he said, adding: As of December, US Bitcoin ETFs backed by BlackRock, Fidelity, and others collectively held over 1.30 million BTC (~$114.13 billion), a 309% increase since their debut in January 2024. At the same time, public companies held over 1.08 million (~$100.42 billion) in their treasuries, an investor cohort that hardly existed before 2020. With Bitcoin miners’ role decreasing with each halving, new demand from ETFs and corporate treasuries may be altering the boom-and-bust dynamics that have historically defined Bitcoin’s four-year cycle.

Today’s top news: Two separate announcements today pointed in the same direction. Stablecoins are moving deeper into the U.S. financial system. First, Visa expanded its USDC settlement program to U.S. banks, enabling participating institutions to settle obligations using Circle’s USDC on Solana. The expansion allows banks and payment firms to move funds outside of traditional banking hours, with onchain settlement finality and integration into Visa’s existing treasury and reconciliation systems. Visa has previously tested stablecoin settlement internationally and with select partners, but this marks a broader U.S. rollout. At the same time, the FDIC approved a proposed rulemaking to implement the GENIUS Act, outlining how FDIC-supervised banks could issue payment stablecoins through subsidiaries. The proposal describes application requirements, governance standards, reserve and liquidity expectations, and ongoing supervisory oversight. Banks would be required to maintain high-quality reserves backing issued stablecoins and operate within defined risk-management and compliance frameworks. “Visa is expanding stablecoin settlement because our banking partners are not only asking about it—they’re preparing to use it” - Visa’s Global Head of Growth Products and Strategic Partnerships Rubail Birwadker “Fintech and crypto innovators increasingly ask us to bring stablecoins into their existing product suite.” - Gilles Gade, founder, president, and CEO of Cross River Bank A powerful milestone in the mainstream adoption and acceptance of USDC, with Visa announcing that all US card issuers (banks, fintechs, crypto firms) can now settle directly with Visa using USDC.

Visa’s expansion shows how large payment networks are integrating stablecoins into existing systems, while the FDIC’s proposal outlines the framework banks would use to issue and manage them. The combination matters. Institutional adoption tends to accelerate once large financial intermediaries and regulators move in the same direction.

Title: Former SEC counsel explains what it takes to make RWAs compliant
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-sec-counsel-ownership-rwa-compliant
Time Published: 2025-12-17T13:45:00Z
Full Content:
The SEC’s changing approach to crypto is supporting RWA growth, but jurisdictional and yield constraints continue to limit compliant models. The key constraint on real-world assets (RWAs) has been regulatory engagement rather than technology, and that dynamic has been shifting in the US, said Ashley Ebersole, chief legal officer of Sologenic. Ebersole joined the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early 2015, where he served in the agency’s early internal working groups on crypto and the application of securities law to blockchain-based assets. The securities regulator published the DAO Report in 2017, asserting its jurisdiction over tokens that met the definition of securities. What followed was an enforcement-led approach that left little room for sustained dialogue with the industry. “After the DAO Report, it was an enforcement response for the next two years. I expected there would be more of a rotation toward policy while I was still there — that didn’t happen,” he told Cointelegraph. Ebersole said that posture hardened after he left the agency, shortly before Gary Gensler took the helm in April 2021. From private practice, he continued engaging with the SEC until staff were later discouraged from interacting with crypto firms. The communication breakdown made it difficult for companies to design legally compliant RWA products and delayed the development of onchain securities models that are now moving into production. The market for tokenized real-world assets is scaling quickly. Standard Chartered has projected that the value of non-stablecoin RWAs could reach $2 trillion by 2028, driven largely by tokenized equities, funds and other traditional financial instruments migrating onto blockchains. Major financial institutions are positioning for that shift. BlackRock is reportedly exploring tokenization to modernize fund infrastructure, while JPMorgan has launched tokenized money-market products on Ethereum. “There is a right way to do compliant tokenization and issue tokenized assets. It absolutely can be done,” Ebersole said. Related: Ronin and ZKsync’s onchain metrics fell the most in 2025 One model he pointed to involves stock tokens that function similarly to depository receipts. When a user purchases a token, a corresponding share is acquired and held by a regulated clearing broker, while a token is minted to represent contractual rights to that share. “You own it. It’s minted at the time of purchase, and it references contractual rights to a share of stock that was purchased at the same time,” Ebersole said. Ebersole said this approach differs from other tokenized stock products that offer price exposure without conferring ownership. In those cases, stock tokens function as synthetic instruments that track the price of an equity without granting shareholder rights or a legal claim on the underlying asset. The distinction remains relevant today. In late July, Robinhood promoted tokenized exposure linked to OpenAI. The private company publicly distanced itself from the product and said that any transfer of its equity requires approval, which did not occur. Interest in tokenized RWAs is accelerating, but Ebersole warned that it does not eliminate the geographical constraints of securities regulation. In practice, many RWA initiatives run into legal and jurisdictional limits. Securities laws remain nationally bound even if blockchain infrastructure is not. An RWA structure that complies with US requirements does not automatically translate to the European Union or Asian markets, where separate licensing, disclosure and distribution rules apply. “The toughest thing we hear about with tokenized RWA projects is the maze of legal requirements that apply to these assets if you’re doing them in a fully legally compliant way,” Ebersole said. “That’s true in the US, and it’s even more complicated globally.” Related: How crypto is used in 2025: YouTube, Pokémon cards and more That fragmentation has pushed many platforms toward region-specific offerings. Robinhood’s tokenization offering is limited to EU users. It allows trading in tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded products but does not confer direct ownership of the underlying shares. Instead, the tokens mirror the prices of publicly traded securities and are regulated as blockchain-based derivatives under the bloc’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). Yield is another area where RWA tokenization often runs into regulatory friction. Ebersole noted that regulators draw a sharp distinction between yield generated through a holder’s own actions — such as participating in transaction validation — and yield that accrues passively simply by holding a token. “If you buy an asset with an inherent yield just by virtue of holding it, regulators are still going to look at that as the hallmark of a security,” he said. That distinction has already shaped enforcement decisions and continues to influence how tokenized products are structured. While regulatory views on staking and other forms of yield have evolved under the current SEC administration, Ebersole said inherent yield remains a sensitive trigger under current law. The practical shift for RWAs has come from a change in how the SEC approaches the industry. During an enforcement-heavy period under the Gensler-led SEC, when staff were discouraged from engaging with crypto firms, would-be issuers were left without a workable path to build compliant onchain products, even when attempting to operate within existing securities law. That posture has begun to soften as the agency signals greater openness to engagement. Ebersole pointed to recent leadership changes at the SEC, including the arrival of Paul Atkins, as contributing to a tone that treats blockchain technology as infrastructure with potential applications for securities markets rather than as an inherent regulatory risk. “Now the SEC is engaging a lot with the industry and saying, ‘Come in and tell us if you are trying to do what we’re trying to do, how would you do it?’” Ebersole said. In that environment, compliant models such as tokenized equities structured through regulated intermediaries and custody arrangements can move from concept to production, even as legal friction persists around cross-border distribution and yield-bearing designs that can still trigger additional securities obligations. Existing securities law continues to govern RWAs, but the move away from an enforcement-only posture does not, in Ebersole’s view, foreclose the possibility of more tailored rules over time if regulators and the market continue working through remaining gaps.

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the industry-owned clearing and settlement market infrastructure, has selected the privacy-focused Canton Network as a tokenization partner, the companies said on Tuesday. The partnership, which will enable a subset of U.S. Treasury securities custodied at DTC to be minted on the Canton Network, follows DTCC’s recent receipt of a No-Action Letter from the SEC to implement and operate a new service to tokenize real-world, DTC-custodied assets. The organizations are working towards an MVP in a controlled production environment during the first half of 2026, with plans to expand the project's size and scope in the months that follow, based on client interest, according to the press release. “DTCC’s partnership with Digital Asset and the Canton Network is a strategic step forward as we collaborate across the industry to build a digital infrastructure that seamlessly bridges the traditional and digital financial ecosystems and provides unmatched scalability and safety,” said Frank LaSalla, CEO of DTCC. The Canton Network was designed to enable institutions to issue and trade tokenized real-world assets, such as bonds, loans, and funds, on a shared ledger while maintaining privacy and compliance with legal requirements. Digital Asset, the firm behind Canton, is backed by powerful Wall Street firms including BlackRock, Blackstone, Nasdaq, S&P Global, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel Securities. In addition to the tokenization initiative, DTCC will assume a leadership position within the Canton Network’s decentralized governance structure, joining the Canton Foundation as co-chair alongside Euroclear. This new role will enable DTCC to actively participate in setting industry-wide standards for decentralized financial infrastructure, the companies said. “DTCC’s leadership in this space not only accelerates industry adoption but establishes a foundation for meaningful innovation, unlocking new liquidity opportunities, products, and operational improvements,” said Yuval Rooz, Co-Founder and CEO of Digital Asset.

Why does India need a 𝗧𝗼𝗸𝗲𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗕𝗶𝗹𝗹?I explained in Parliament today. pic.twitter.com/Ucw395cWpg — Raghav Chadha (@raghav_chadha) December 16, 2025 "Just as UPI (Unified Payments Interface) made digital payments inclusive in a way, similarly, to make investment and asset ownership inclusive, we will have to bring a law on tokenization in this country,” Chadha said. He noted that India’s middle class is largely confined to bank savings, mutual funds, and fixed deposits, and that tokenization could open high-return assets to them while providing instant, broker-free liquidity. Chadha said the nation now needs its own “bespoke legislation for asset tokenization” along with a dedicated regulatory sandbox to safely test new models. Such a framework, he argued, would make investment and ownership “truly inclusive for the common man,” while giving India the clarity required to attract global capital flows from hubs like Singapore, the UAE, and Hong Kong. Raj Kapoor, founder and CEO of the India Blockchain Alliance, told Decrypt that India stands at a “decisive inflection point in the evolution of global finance,” calling a dedicated tokenization bill “no longer optional… a strategic necessity to anchor India in the next financial architecture.” Such a law could unlock India-native tokenization of “infrastructure, MSMEs, real estate, carbon credits, gold, and receivables,” he noted, aligning tokenized instruments with existing securities and contract law. "Jurisdictions that provide legal clarity are rapidly becoming magnets for global capital," Kapoor said, noting that India remains, "constrained by regulatory ambiguity around tokenized assets" despite its leadership in the field of digital public infrastructure. “India needs a tokenization bill to retain economic sovereignty, ensuring Indian assets, capital formation, and innovation are tokenized onshore under Indian law, not exported to foreign jurisdictions,” he said. Without a clear statutory framework, Kapoor warned, India risks its assets, startups, and capital formation migrating offshore into friendlier jurisdictions, "often through complex SPVs that strip domestic value creation." His caution comes as global financial heavyweights are already signalling where the world is headed, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein recently writing in The Economist that finance is "entering the next major evolution in market infrastructure" driven by blockchain-based tokenization, comparing today's stage to "the internet in 1996." Musheer Ahmed, Founder and MD of Finstep Asia, told Decrypt that while there is skepticism around crypto assets in India, "one needs to distinguish between the asset here being a crypto asset or digital asset, which may have a variety of use cases and concerns around cross-border or money laundering."

Databricks has announced plans to raise more than $4bn in a Series L funding round that values the company at $134bn. The San Francisco-based data and AI company surpassed a $4.8bn revenue run-rate during its third quarter, with year-on-year growth of more than 55%. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more The run-rate figure includes more than $1bn from its data warehousing business and more than $1bn from its AI products. The company has delivered positive free cash flow over the 12 months since December 2024. Insight Partners, Fidelity Management & Research Company, and JP Morgan Asset Management are leading the Series L investment. Additional investors in the round include Andreessen Horowitz, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, funds managed by Blackstone, Robinhood Ventures and Thrive Capital. The funding will support product development in three strategic areas: Lakebase, Databricks Apps and Agent Bricks. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The funding will be used to help customers develop AI applications and agent-based tools using their own proprietary data. The approach will position Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user-facing experience layer and Agent Bricks as the engine for multi-agent workflows. It linked this focus to what it called the parallel rise of “vibe coding” and generative AI (gen AI), which is accelerating the development of data data-intelligent applications in enterprises. Databricks Apps enables organisations to build and deploy data and AI applications quickly and securely. Agent Bricks is designed to simplify the creation and scaling of high-quality agents using an organisation’s own data. According to Databricks, Lakebase is a serverless PostgreSQL database designed specifically to support AI-era workloads. Databricks co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi stated: “Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads. “With this investment, we’re deepening our commitment to help every organisation innovate with AI on their own data.” In its first six months, Lakebase has drawn thousands of customers and is generating revenue growth at twice the pace of its data warehousing product. The Data Warehousing product reached a revenue run-rate of more than $1bn in less than four years from general availability. Databricks’ AI products have achieved a revenue run-rate of more than $1bn. Its net retention rate remains above 140% and more than 700 customers are consuming at an annual revenue run-rate of more than $1m. Databricks expects the new capital to support its growth and to be used to provide liquidity for employees. The company also said the investment is expected to support future AI acquisitions and deepen its AI research.

Title: BlackRock moves 47K Ethereum in a day: But the real story isn’t a sell-off

What are institutions seeing that retail traders are missing? Even as Ethereum’s price hesitates around the $3,000 price level, the institutional engine behind the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) is running at full speed. On the 16th of December, on-chain data flagged a massive $140 million transfer as BlackRock deposited 47,463 ETH into Coinbase Prime. Far from a simple “sell-off” signal, this move reflects the complex rebalancing needed to manage the leading spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF during heavy market liquidations. While retail traders hesitate, BlackRock’s major rebalancing shows strong institutional confidence, as ETF issuers must keep adjusting ETH holdings to match inflows. This strategy helps stabilize the fund during volatility and reinforces Ethereum’s growing acceptance in traditional finance. Though BlackRock remains the institutional “gold standard,” it is no longer the undisputed heavyweight in the Ethereum treasury race. As of mid-December, BlackRock’s ETHA fund holds approximately 3.7 million ETH (approx. $11 billion). However, this massive stash has officially been eclipsed by BitMine Immersion (BMNR). Under the leadership of Tom Lee, BitMine has aggressively expanded its treasury to nearly 4 million ETH, signaling a “MicroStrategy-style” accumulation play that prioritizes protocol-level dominance over simple ETF fee collection. The timing of BlackRock’s 47,463 ETH deposit follows a turbulent period for US-based Ethereum ETFs. On the 16th of December, Farside Investors’ data revealed a staggering net outflow of $221.3 million from BlackRock’s ETHA. This single-day redemption accounted for nearly 99% of the total $224.2 million pulled from all US Ethereum ETFs combined. All in all, this suggests that while the “institutional machinery” is moving funds on-chain, it is largely to facilitate heavy redemptions from investors who are rotating capital or de-risking amidst a lackluster Q4 performance for the asset. That being said, this institutional reshuffling occurred against a backdrop of technical fragility. At the time of reporting, Ethereum was trading at $2,935.44. Despite a microscopic 0.77% gain in a 24-hour window, the broader trend remains bearish with ETH plummeting by 11.58% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap Hence, for BlackRock, the challenge is now two-fold: managing the logistics of massive ETF outflows while simultaneously defending a price floor that retail traders seem increasingly unwilling to support. This coincided with BlackRock’s recent $28.78 million acquisition of Ethereum, which the broader market has largely misread as mere price speculation. In reality, this move signalled BlackRock’s formal validation of Ethereum not as a “digital gold” alternative to Bitcoin, but as the essential financial infrastructure of the future. By securing this bundle of ETH, the world’s largest asset manager is effectively stockpiling the “fuel” necessary to run its BUIDL fund, which operates exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain. Ultimately, this acquisition shows BlackRock is no longer just participating in crypto, but actively building on Ethereum as mission-critical infrastructure for future global finance.

Title: Meet one of BlackRock's top technologists who is supercharging its investment teams with AI

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For 15 years, BlackRock's Kirsty Craig has operated as a kind of "translator" inside the world's largest asset manager, sitting between portfolio managers making big bets and engineers building the systems that help inform those decisions to get both sides aligned on driving returns. This skill set is part of what earned Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, the title of Tech Fellow, one of the firm's high technological distinctions, held by only two dozen of its thousands of engineers. Craig is one of five new fellows that the firm announced on December 16, recognized for supercharging the asset manager's investment team. This year, she is the only woman and the only fellow who works outside of Aladdin, the lucrative spine of BlackRock's investment technology. When it comes to her impact on how $13.5 trillion money manager BlackRock uses AI, Craig said she's especially proud of her role in Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. The "virtual investment analyst" was unveiled by Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein at the firm's investor day in June. It leverages AI to automate workflows and research, as many firms race to adopt the technology to speed up what were once monthslong investment processes. Now, as a fellow, Craig is even more embedded in BlackRock's efforts to stay ahead, as the firm continues to center on technological prowess.

At first, Craig wasn't sure she'd become a tech fellow, largely because her work is different than most of the other fellows who work squarely within BlackRock's data analytics and risk platform, Aladdin. Her team of around 60 software engineers, data engineers, and data scientists "sits at the horizontal" across various investment capabilities to help drive investment research. She found out about the honor at the beginning of the month when a meeting was added to her calendar. When she heard the news, Craig started by telling the manager who had nominated her, her sponsor during the application process, her team, and her family, "but they've got no idea what it means," she told Business Insider. Nish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and the co-executive sponsor of the fellows program, said that existing tech fellows knew Craig not only for her innovation with AI in investing, but for her collaborative efforts. He described Craig as an "AI native," and added that her team is at the "tip of the spear" when it comes to applying AI to investment. Craig's time at different offices — Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia — has, she thinks, given her a strong foundation of horizontal leadership across teams. "I am responsible for really trying to find the dial movers across data, AI, and technology that really help our investment pillars drive investment research," she said of her work. Craig has learned how to communicate with both investors and Aladdin technologists, and said that building deep trust with both groups has been key to her success. "If you put both of those different personalities or personas together, quite often they're talking above or below each other. They struggle to connect. So for me, it's really been being able to translate both and then come up with a strategy in the middle," she said. For Craig, being a woman in a position of visible leadership is "a huge honor." Of the 24 tech fellows, five are women, including Craig. Women make up 43.8% of BlackRock's global workforce and 33.1% of senior leadership, according to data from January 1, 2025, posted on the firm's site. Craig said being involved in BlackRock's women and LGBTQ+ resource groups has informed her other work at the firm, especially in how they've taught her how to collaborate with people from across divisions and explain complicated topics. "If anything has probably helped me with, one, building my network; two, softer presentation skills; and then three, around how to communicate with impact," Craig said. With the title, she hopes to help more junior female technologists "lean in." For Ajitsaria, it's also important to have a diversity of expertise in the program and ensure that fellows represent all arms of BlackRock. When it comes to driving technology strategy itself, Craig said she's excited to keep figuring out how to leverage AI in active investing. Right now, her team is thinking about how to expand the scope of agentic research, potentially to areas like fixed income and macro investing. As she continues to soak up the news, Craig is also preparing for a very different big life change. Her partner is scheduled to give birth in early January, so, with the due date mere weeks away, Craig said they've kept all celebrating fairly tame so far. "We did go out for a meal. Nothing has been purchased, apart from cribs and bottles," she said. "Definitely some more celebrating will be done post January 6." Jump to

Title: Solana Foundation Outlines Plans To Combat Emerging Quantum Computing Risks

Time Published: 2025-12-17T09:00:41Z

As concerns about the potential risks posed by quantum computing to the cryptocurrency landscape grow, the Solana Foundation has taken new measures by announcing a collaboration with Project Eleven, which specializes in post-quantum security. In a Tuesday press release, the Solana Foundation outlined its commitment to fortifying the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem against the implications of quantum computing. Through this initiative, Project Eleven has conducted a comprehensive threat assessment and successfully prototyped a functioning testnet utilizing post-quantum digital signatures. Under their engagement, Project Eleven undertook a risk analysis to evaluate how forthcoming breakthroughs in quantum computing could impact various facets of Solana’s infrastructure. Areas scrutinized included user wallets, validator security, and the foundational cryptographic assumptions that underpin the network. Moreover, Project Eleven has implemented a working post-quantum signature system on a Solana testnet, demonstrating that quantum-resistant transactions can be both practical and scalable. Matt Sorg, VP of Technology at the Solana Foundation, emphasized the organization’s approach: “Our responsibility is to ensure Solana remains secure not just today, but decades into the future.” He noted that the culture of innovation within the Solana ecosystem would continue to thrive with the upcoming release of a second client and an advanced consensus mechanism this year. Alex Pruden, CEO of Project Eleven, echoed this sentiment, stating, “Solana didn’t wait for quantum computers to become a headline problem. They invested early, asked the hard questions, and took actionable steps today.” Solana’s stance comes amid alarming reports indicating that quantum computers could potentially undermine blockchain security by developing algorithms capable of deciphering private keys. This scenario raises significant concerns for any digital assets operating on blockchain technology that rely on digital signatures, making them vulnerable to quantum hacking. As such, industry experts are actively exploring various measures to bolster cryptocurrency networks against these threats. Doug Finke, Chief Content Officer at Global Quantum Intelligence, pointed out that several groups are integrating the three post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms established by NIST into their platforms. He emphasized the uncertainty surrounding when a sufficiently powerful quantum computer might be developed, raising the stakes even further. Finke stated, “What’s worse, if an unfriendly party does develop such a computer, they may not let anyone know about it.” Currently, several cryptocurrencies have already begun incorporating quantum-safe cryptography into their architecture, including Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL), Cellframe, and Bitcoin Quantum from BTQ. Among those issuing warnings about the looming threats from quantum computing are notable figures such as Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, Capriole Investment founder Charles Edwards, and representatives from major firms like BlackRock and Google. Yakovenko has urged the Bitcoin community to accelerate efforts to implement quantum-resistant upgrades. He believes there is a 50% chance of a significant quantum breakthrough occurring within the next five years, further emphasizing the need for vigilance. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $127, which is a 6.7% decrease in price over the past seven days. Compared to the all-time high of $293 reached earlier this year, SOL is trading at almost 56% below this threshold.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs See Another $277 Million Outflow with Long-Term Holders Selling

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $277 million in net outflows on December 16, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, as total ETF AUM fell sharply over the past two months. Amid the strong Bitcoin BTC $88 095 24h volatility: 1.0% Market cap: $1.76 T Vol. 24h: $65.78 B price correction, spot Bitcoin ETF outflows have surged simultaneously, clocking another $277 million on Dec. 16. This surge in outflows, along with the sell-off from long-term holders, highlights the waning institutional sentiment. BTC price is currently around $86,500 as analysts brace for further volatility ahead of the US CPI, and BoJ rate hike decisions this week. On Tuesday, Dec. 16, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows for the second consecutive day at $277 million. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the most outflows at $210 million, followed by Bitwise’s BITB at $50 million as per Farside Investors data. Fidelity’s FBTC was the only Bitcoin fund to see positive inflows at $26.7 million, while the rest others saw zero or negative flows. As per the on-chain data, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) dumped a total of 2.405 BTC yesterday. However, the trading activity remains elevated with $2.8 billion in total volumes. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF trading: Source: Trader T Moreover, the net assets under management (AUM) across all Bitcoin ETFs saw a sharp drop from $169.5 billion to $120.7 billion over the past 60 days. November alone saw net outflows totaling $3.79 billion, reported market analyst Shanaka Anslem Perera. He added that BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, accounted for a significant portion of the decline, recording approximately $2.7 billion in redemptions over a five-week period. The sustained outflows suggest strong institutional selling pressure in the market. On-chain data shows that long-term holders (LTH) of Bitcoin are locking in gains, while selling on every rise. According to data from CryptoQuant, the recent sell-off from LTHs over the past 30 days is one of the largest in the last five years. It added that selling by this cohort has historically occurred closer to market highs rather than during price bottoms. Current data shows long-term holder supply declining from record levels, while Bitcoin continues to trade well above the LTH realized price. This shows that the recent selling reflects profit-taking behavior instead of any panic-driven capitulation. Market experts like Peter Brandt expect an 80% Bitcoin crash from the highs. Bitcoin long-term holder selloff | Source: CryptoQuant All eyes will be on the macro events such as the release of US CPI data and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike. The Bank of Japan is expected to raise its policy rate to 0.75%, making it the country’s highest interest rate level since 1995. Each of the Bank of Japan’s previous rate hikes has coincided with sharp declines in Bitcoin, with past drawdowns ranging between 23% and 31%.

Title: SPYM’s $100B Milestone Might Be the Last of Its Kind

The fund is State Street’s way of tapping the retail market, but it might be the last new dominant S&P 500 entrant. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com A hundred billion is the new hundred million. State Street’s SPYM fund surpassed $100 billion in assets last week, making it the fastest to grow from $50 billion to $100 billion, taking just 283 trading days, according to State Street. The ETF is the latest entrant to the core S&P 500 cast and represents the firm’s efforts to access growing retail markets via low fees; SPYM’s is just two basis points. But it may be the last core S&P 500 product breakthrough for a while because of all the funds already tracking the index — and their sheer size. This means advisors shouldn’t expect any new core S&P 500 funds anytime soon, experts said. “It’s more likely that other kinds of broad equity ETFs will be launched in the future as opposed to [trying to] do battle with $100 billion ETFs that are out there,” said Loren Fox, director of research at Fuse Research Network. “At this point, it’s hard to see a lot of space in the market for another S&P 500 ETF that is just tracking the straight beta.” SPYM, which formerly operated under the ticker SPLG, is one of the four primary S&P 500 ETF offerings, said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF Research & Analytics at CFRA Research. The others include the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). But they cater to different segments of the market: While SPY has traditionally been a fund for institutions, such as asset managers and hedge funds, IVV has honed in on advised retail and VOO on self-directed retail investors. Because of State Street’s institutional focus, added Ullal, the company didn’t really have a product that prioritized the retail segment. “SPYM basically is their way of accessing retail money, by going with a lower-cost product and competing more directly with VOO and IVV,” he said. Inflows and outflows among the rest of the four were varied. In Q3 2025: S Tier. The ETF industry as a whole, Ullal said, can also be broken down into three main price segments: the passively managed, low-cost beta tier; the mid-priced segment, which has more active management; and high-priced funds of roughly 75 basis points and above, including things like derivatives and buffer products. “The newer entrants, like Capital Group, JPMorgan [and] Goldman Sachs, they’re focused more on active management, derivatives and those kinds of products,” Ullal said. But the low-cost segment, he added, is dominated by the likes of Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock — something he doesn’t see changing: “It’s hard to see anybody coming and disrupting these three big players.” With the average cost of health care regularly outpacing inflation, Americans are struggling to afford it. A new legal standing for marijuana could help change how ETFs track and invest in the cannabis industry. The company is planning to add 10 target-maturity ETFs. Vanguard and State Street have also moved to fill out their bond-ladder lines. With more than $1.4 trillion in flows and more than 1,000 product launches, it’s safe to say the industry is booming. A new proposed ETF would hold bitcoin only after markets close. Wanna bet? ETFs aren’t for gambling, but a rise in risk-on products could prove irresistible to a population obsessed with sports betting. After a dive, the company’s stock is still up 8% in 2025, while both long and short leveraged ETFs are down. The world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the biggest crypto ETF is expanding into staked Ethereum. Is there room for anyone else? Active fixed-income strategies accounted for nearly half of ETF inflows so far this year. Niche strategies, like buffer ETFs, could play a larger role in deal activity. Its price is up 100%, significantly ahead of gold’s surge, and the (very) few silver ETFs on the US market have benefited. The company’s flagship ETF, QQQ, is just shy of enough votes to approve its reclassification as an open-end fund. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Court to reconsider inquest into death of infant born at Bessborough mother and baby home

Cork South Coroner’s Court will reconsider holding an inquest into the death of a baby boy shortly after his birth at Bessborough mother and baby home, after the court’s chief coroner conceded a High Court challenge brought by the infant’s mother. Madeleine Bridget Marvier was 17-years-old when she was admitted to the home in Blackrock, Cork city, in August 1960. About two months later, she gave birth to her son, William Gerard Walsh. In December 1960, at 37 days old, William died at St Finbarr’s Hospital, Cork. In October 2023, Ms Marvier wrote to the Cork South Coroner asking that an inquest be held into the death of her son, on the grounds that his death was violent or unnatural, or was unexpected and from unknown causes, or was in suspicious circumstances. This request was refused. Ms Marvier brought judicial review proceedings against the Cork South Coroner in July challenging the refusal, claiming that a conclusion that the infant’s death is beyond doubt “cannot reasonably be drawn or inferred” and is “without basis” in the evidence she had put before the coroner. Ms Marvier brought the case alongside her daughter, Carmel Cantwell. On Tuesday, barrister Cillian Bracken, appearing for Ms Marvier, told Mr Justice Micheál O’Higgins that an order could be made on consent quashing the coroner’s decision to refuse to hold an inquest into the infant’s death. Mr Bracken said an order could also be made remitting the case to the deputy coroner for Cork South for reconsideration. An order against the coroner for his clients’ legal costs could also be made, counsel said. Barrister Eoin Sreenan, appearing for the coroner, said his client was consenting to the reliefs. Mr Justice O’Higgins granted the orders. Bessborough mother and baby home was operated by the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, an order of nuns, between 1922 and 1998. In 2021, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes concluded that 923 babies associated with Bessborough died during that time, but burial records for only 64 of them could be found. According to Ms Marvier’s court documents, her son’s death certificate – which she obtained in 1999 – attributed his death to renal abscess septicaemia, sepsis caused by an abscess in the kidney. Ms Marvier said she was previously unaware of the cause attributed to her son’s death. In 2019, after obtaining documents from Tusla, Ms Marvier learned for the first time that William had been buried at Carr’s Hill Cemetery in Cork, within the jurisdiction of the Cork South Coroner. In October 2023, Ms Marvier wrote to the Cork South Coroner asking that an inquest be held into the death of her son, on the grounds that his death was violent or unnatural, or was unexpected and from unknown causes, or was in suspicious circumstances. Included in her request was a report compiled by Dr Michael Munro, a consultant neonatologist, who opined that the death certificate’s stated cause of death was speculative and conjectural. In January this year, the coroner wrote to Ms Marvier refusing the request to hold an inquest. The coroner stated William did not die in a violent or unnatural manner, and on the balance of probabilities, did not die unexpectedly or from unknown causes, Ms Marvier’s court papers stated. Ms Marvier’s case noted the coroner’s purported assumption that in the absence of any record of a postmortem examination of the infant, there was no doubt around the cause of death of the infant, and therefore, there was no sufficient evidence available now to cast doubt on the death certificate’s cause of death. Ms Marvier claimed that the coroner made this assumption while at the same time acknowledging that medical records pertaining to the infant’s care at St Finbarr’s are now unavailable, and that it was not known what medical skills were employed in establishing William’s cause of death.
