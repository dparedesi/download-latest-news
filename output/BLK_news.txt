(AP Photo/Matias Delacroix) By DIDI TANG and ALEX VEIGAA Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its controlling stake in a subsidiary that operates ports near the Panama Canal to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control after President Donald Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt.The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, as well as others in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.The transaction, which must be approved by Panama’s government, does not include any interest in a trust that operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China.In addition to BlackRock, a New York-based global investment management company with $11.6 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, the consortium includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited. The deal gives them 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing.Some 70% of the sea traffic that crosses the Panama Canal leaves or goes to U.S. ports.The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. Trump and his supporters have also complained about the fees that ships are charged to use the waterway and alleged that China has been operating the canal, an assertion denied by Panama’s government. In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports “give China ready observation posts” to take action. “This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,” Cruz said.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President José Raúl Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.Panama quit China’s Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio’s visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing.But while much attention was focused on Trump’s threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the ports key ports at either end of the canal.Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.”“I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt said.BlackRock declined to comment outside of a press release touting the deal.

Title: Trump’s tariffs are tool to ‘level the playing field,’ says Goldman’s David Solomon
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/03/04/business/trump-wants-to-level-the-playing-field-with-tariffs-goldman-sachs-ceo/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T15:36:37Z
Full Content:
Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon called President Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico an effort to “level the playing field” – but said the trade policy has caused heightened caution among his fellow business leaders. The stiff 25% tariffs on the North American neighbors, as well as a 20% levy on China, took effect Tuesday after Trump had agreed to a monthlong pause. “The president firmly believes that there are imbalances with respect to how trade exists, and he has a strong point of view that he wants to level the playing field aggressively,” Solomon said during the Australian Financial Review Business Summit in Sydney on Tuesday. “He’s executing on that view,” he added. On Monday, Trump told reporters there was “no room left” for the nations to avoid the tariffs, arguing they had not done enough to curb the flow of illicit fentanyl over the border. The president has also indicated the import tariffs are a way to bring more manufacturing jobs to the US. How long the new levies will last has become the hot topic on Wall Street, according to Solomon. “How things stay in place, how far it goes … is some of the uncertainty that I’m talking about,” he said. Economists have warned the trade policy could reheat inflation, spooking investors and causing prolonged market volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy S&P 500 have erased their post-inauguration gains. Solomon said, “the chance of recession in 2025 is small but it’s not zero.” The chief executive also discussed Goldman’s move to remove its diversity, equity and inclusion section from its annual shareholder filing, echoing a reversal by other Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Bank of America. “With some of the changes given [with] the executive orders, and law, we have to communicate differently around these things,” Solomon said. He nodded to Trump’s executive order banning DEI across the federal level, as well as his statements pushing private companies like Apple to end the controversial commitments. “That doesn’t stop us from our mission to have the most extraordinary talent to serve our clients,” Solomon added.

Title: This Brutal Investment ‘Rule’ Will Clobber Your Returns In Trump 2.0
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2025/03/04/this-brutal-investment-rule-will-clobber-your-returns-in-trump-20/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T15:26:00Z
Full Content:
Feeling sad. getty There’s no doubt it’s been a rough couple weeks for stocks: Both the S&P 500 and the tech-focused NASDAQ have wiped out most of this year’s gains, as of this writing. The bigger decline among the NASDAQ, compared to the S&P 500, is notable here because the NASDAQ involves both higher risk and higher reward: With a heavier focus on tech stocks, it’s more volatile than the more diversified S&P 500. But it also reflects where many of the higher profit margins have been among U.S. firms. Hence, it has outrun the S&P 500 for a long time. With the big run-up we’ve seen in stocks, high valuations for both indexes and higher volatility, it’s fair to wonder if now is a good time to add to your holdings of stocks, or stock-focused closed-end funds. Diversification is, of course, the key to managing risk. That includes spreading our money across the world, across stocks in different sectors and across asset classes, including bonds, real estate investment trusts and preferred shares. It also includes, crucially, continually adjusting our allocation to stocks, bonds and other assets as our goals, age and risk tolerance change. That’s in contrast to one so-called “diversification” strategy we want to avoid like the plague, especially in times like these: sticking to the rigid “60/40 portfolio,” a tired “rule of thumb” that, as the name suggests, involves devoting 60% of your portfolio to stocks and 40% to bonds. This might sound familiar if you have a financial planner, as many stick to the 60/40 asset split. Even if you don’t, you might have gotten a recommendation to buy a fund like the Vanguard Wellington Fund (VWELX). This fund has been around for nearly a century (its IPO was in 1929), and it has nearly a 60/40 allocation (closer to 67% and 33%, but no matter). Unfortunately, owning VWELX (in orange below) has resulted in a big lag in performance compared to the S&P 500 over the decades. 60/40 Lags Ycharts In more recent history, we’ve seen VWELX do poorly compared to the market along with other, newer funds with stricter 60/40 allocations, like the BlackRock 60/40 Target Allocation Fund (BIGPX). Its performance since 2007 (in purple below) has been worse than that of the Wellington fund (in blue). 60/40 Lags Ycharts What about times of extreme stress, like the 2022 crash? These periods are, after all, supposed to be what the 60/40 allocation is made for. Well, it didn’t exactly pan out that way: In this case, the S&P 500 (in orange below) recovered faster than 60/40—measured by BIGPX (in blue) and VWELX (in purple). In other words, this “conservative” rule didn’t protect investors much. 60/40 2022 Bear Market Ycharts Now here’s where the story takes an interesting turn. Because there have been times when the 60/40 portfolio has worked. Take the period following the dot-com bubble, when the Wellington fund (in orange below actually turned a profit while the S&P 500 (in purple) sagged. 60/40 Wins Once Ycharts But this doesn’t really happen anymore; not only did stocks recover faster than 60/40 in 2022, but following the subprime mortgage crisis, stocks recovered at about the same pace as a 60/40 did. This, again, shows that this “rule” worked in the past but, as of the early to mid-2000s, was no longer a realistic way to lower your risk. Why did the 60/40 allocation outperform the stock market back then and stop succeeding in the mid-2000s? One part of the answer comes down to regulation. In 2000, the SEC cracked down on analysts’ practice of giving sneak previews of research to top clients, which allowed big funds to front-run retail investors. They did this with a law called Regulation Fair Disclosure in 2000. Then, a settlement with bankers, analysts and regulators called the Global Research Analyst Settlement of 2003 restricted how well funds could use research to get ahead of other investors. Further tightening of regulations beyond these new rules also ensured that big investors’ advantages were reduced, if not scrapped altogether. This hurt the 60/40 strategy in one crucial way: It made the stock market more efficient. By ensuring information wasn’t selectively sent to big investors, the stock market instead began to go up more gradually and more directly, based on fundamentals. That, in turn, produced more reliable returns, helping attract more investors throughout the 2000s and 2010s, and lowering demand for bonds in the process. Again, these rule changes are just part of a bigger story. But they help explain why 60/40 is still a fixture in the financial planning-world, even though it began to lose its punch over 20 years ago.

This move, Conlan says, is likely to influence global regulatory approaches, encouraging other nations to explore similar initiatives and brining in a more structured environment for institutional participation. Paras Malhotra - SVP - Trade, Custody and Business Operations at CoinDCX,says the series of announcements by Trump, starting with the creation of a strategic crypto reserve, followed by the scheduled hosting of the first-ever White House Crypto Summit, has ‘truly energised the industry’. “The market’s reaction has been remarkable — ADA surged past $1, XRP reached $3, and Bitcoin crossed $92,000. In just 24 hours, nearly $315 million in Bitcoin shorts were liquidated, and over $330 billion flowed into the crypto markets,” he said. As US’ crypto push sets global precedent, Indian industry wants similar ‘progressive policies’ Trump’s digital asset reserve: How the US could shape the future of crypto While industry executives are upbeat around the developments in the US on cryptocurrency adoption, the prices of major cryptocurrencies have seen volatile movements. As at 18:08 IST, Bitcoin’s price is down 10 per cent at $83,497, while Ethereum was down 11 per cent at $2,091. Malhotra from CoinDCX says, institutional investors, particularly firms like BlackRock, have played a central role in sell-off, offloading significant amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The sell-off is being further compounded by macroeconomic factors, with the tariff war between the US and China intensifying, he said. User sentiment was also hit after major global crypto exchange Bybits saw a $1.4 billion hack, often touted as the biggest robbery in history. According to Ashish Singhal, co-founder at CoinSwitch, with creation of a strategic crypto reserve, we could be on the brink of a global crypto accumulation race — one that could push regulatory clarity forward and accelerate Web3 innovation. Singhal says with its deep pool of tech talent, entrepreneurial spirit, and thriving start-up ecosystem, India has everything it takes to lead the next wave of blockchain-driven transformation. “But to do so, we must act now — embracing progressive policies, fostering innovation, and positioning ourselves as a hub for decentralisation,” he said.

Title: Crypto Market in Full Bear Mode After the $1.4B Bybit Hack. The Best Meme Coins to Lock in Now

Time Published: 2025-03-04T14:24:58Z
Full Content:
On February 21, 2025, the North Korean hacking group Lazarus managed to steal approximately $1.5B worth of Ethereum. Despite the initial whiplash effect, the $1.5B Bybit hack could paradoxically boost the best meme coins in 2025 and beyond. Let’s dig into it. Subsequent investigations showed that the hackers used malware to display a fake UI to all signers. This could’ve only been achieved if the bad actors somehow infected each multisig signer’s device, suggesting that the hack was more complex than initially thought. The conclusion was that, in this particular case, the weakest link was probably the human element rather than Bybit’s security profile. So, why is crypto so down today, so long after the hack? According to EmberCN, the hackers managed to launder the entire $1.4B (499,000 ETH), causing ETH’s price to drop 23% following the event. Today, Bitcoin’s chart tells a sad story after falling to below 83K. Indeed, the whole crypto market seems to have collapsed, with even the best altcoins joining the bear movement. The Bybit hack didn’t impact cryptos alone. DeFi exchanges suffered, too. Chainflip, in particular, as the hackers started funneling the stolen assets through its platform mere hours after the breach. Chainflip, to its credit, identified the suspicious activity and took action immediately. The hackers also used THORChain, another high-profile DeFi service, to swap over $742M shortly after the event. Unlike Chainflip, which has a central authority, Thorchain is regulated by a network of validators, making it more difficult to implement any time-sensitive measures. The THORChain network recorded massive trading volumes following the hack, reaching an all-time record of $859.61M on February 26. This caused $RUNE, the official THORChain token, to surge by up to 33% between February 21 and February 26. In the spirit of ‘damned if you do, damned if you don’t’, both Chainflip and THORChain were heavily criticized by the community for how they handled things. Chainflip took the most heat, with many arguing that disabling swaps goes against the platform’s commitment to decentralization. At the opposite poll is THORChain, criticized for not taking action. So, where does this leave us? The crypto market is slowly recovering, but it’s still not out of the bear-infested woods. Even so, some see this as the best time to invest in new crypto projects in preparation for the next bull run. Especially, given the SEC’s upcoming series of roundtables on crypto security and regulation could turn the trend around. The following are some of the most promising meme coins to buy while the market is down. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is a meme project tied to Bitcoin’s market performance. The ongoing presale has raised over $3.1M with a token price of $0.00239. BTC Bull has several mechanisms to support its long-term development: Stakers also enjoy a 135% APY with a dynamic reward rate (it self-adjusts based on the number of stakers, and the later you start staking, the smaller the APY you receive). The project shows long-term promise as it rewards hodlers specifically and evaluates alongside Bitcoin. The tokenomics data looks solid, and the project’s whitepaper does a good job of detailing the BTC Bull vision. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is an advanced AI entity designed to spur on the crypto conversation and mine the chatter for trading cues. The self-evolving and self-sovereign AI agent interacts with people on X and Telegram and offers predictions and insights into the most promising crypto trends. The roadmap hints at great things to come, with the final stage allowing MIND of Pepe to create and advertise its own tokens. $MIND holders will gain exclusive insights into these projects so that they can tune in early to maximize their profits. The presale has raised over $7M with a $MIND valued at $0.0034402. MIND of Pepe currently rewards stakers with a 321% APY and a dynamic reward rate, so the earlier you invest, the higher the post-launch ROI. Dogecoin ($DOGE) started as a joke in 2013 and quickly became a crypto sensation. While the project has no real-life utility, its fired-up fanbase gave it one; to take Doge to the moon. They evidently succeeded, as today, Dogecoin is a top cryptocurrency with the 9th largest market cap. You can spend $DOGE in over 2.5K online stores to purchase anything from clothing and software to domains and private jets.$DOGE currently sits at $0.1939 after it gained 19% over the past year. The coin lost around 11.6% of its value in charts over the past 24 hours but appears to be in a consolidation phase, which could be the sign investors were looking for. Now that we’ve answered the question of the day, ‘Why is crypto crashing?’, let’s look to the future. Coindesk reported on March 1 that the crypto market may be showing the first signs of recovery, with Bitcoin moving slightly past $84K. This assessment tends to be supported by the Fear and Greed Index, with Bitcoin’s price sitting above the community’s pessimistic predictions. This positive outlook also comes in the context of BlackRock finally adding Bitcoin EFT to its $150B portfolio. This supports the trend of wider crypto institutional adoption, which could be another trigger for the next bullish wave. For this reason, the best meme coins, especially ones like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) that are still in presale, are looking more appealing by the day.

Title: Wall Street's hottest trade is coming to retail investors. Here's why experts are warning about buying into private credit.

It's a tricky time to be an investor. The anticipated Trump Bump is turning into a tariff meltdown, and Big Tech appears to no longer be driving the S&P 500. In this uncertain environment, alternatives like private credit offer promising returns for investors. And it's easier than ever to put money into the asset class as institutions race to democratize the asset. Apollo and State Street just launched the SPDR SSGA Apollo IG Public & Private Credit ETF (PRIV). But before you rush to add private credit to your portfolio, some wealth managers recommend proceeding with caution. While private credit can be a lucrative investment, it's not the best fit for everyone. Private credit started getting hot after the 2008 financial crisis. As banks reduced risky lending activity in the face of increased regulation, businesses began seeking loans from non-bank lenders. Private credit loans are typically made to middle-market companies for three to seven years and can yield double-digit annualized returns. They also have low correlation with public markets and provide regular income through interest payments. Because of these characteristics, institutional investors have piled in and supercharged the asset class. The private credit market is currently worth around $2 trillion, with the potential to hit $3.5 trillion by 2028, according to BlackRock. To continue on this trajectory, asset managers are looking to expand their customer base and make the asset class more available to everyday investors, Brian Payne, chief private markets and alternatives strategist at BCA research, told Business Insider. "It's more assets to manage, more fee dollars," Payne said. The pool of traditional buyers, such as insurance companies and asset managers, has shrunk, so originators are looking for new customers, according to Payne. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital, agrees. "Private credit managers now see a huge opportunity within individuals and they're going to go after it and create vehicles attractive to individual investors," he said. Among individuals, the ultra-wealthy have been leading the charge in tapping into the private credit market. Because of the illiquid nature and high fees associated with private credit, the investments have traditionally been more suited to more sophisticated investors with large amounts of capital to deploy. For example, a high net-worth individual with $20 million in liquid assets might allocate half of their wealth to equities and split the remainder between fixed income, private credit, and other alternatives, said Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement. Yoshioka also pointed out that alternative investments do come with higher fees than traditional public investments, so investors interested in the space should make note of that. The State Street and Apollo ETF charges a 70 basis-point fee. For comparison, the iShares 1-10 Year Laddered Corporate Bond Index ETF has an expense ratio of 28 basis points. Democratizing private credit with more retail-accessible channels like an ETF means that investors no longer need millions to participate. But Ablin isn't so sure that ETFs are the best way to get exposure to private credit. "When your ultimate asset is illiquid, it's really difficult to create liquid access to it without diluting what you're trying to do. If you're going to create an ETF of these things, chances are you're going to have to supplement it with publicly traded income vehicles and cash to make sure you can meet the daily redemption requirements your fundholders have," Ablin said. ETFs can be traded during market hours, but traditional private credit funds often involve a lock-up period of several years, which is why private credit offers an illiquidity premium. To Ablin, those two assets seem antithetical. State Street and Apollo's private credit ETF contains 80% investment-grade debt securities, up to 20% of non-investment grade securities, and up to 15% of assets in private funds. The liquidity is backed by a contractual agreement with Apollo to provide executable bids on Apollo-backed assets in the fund. The ETF "raises potential risks arising from reliance on Apollo's ability to purchase securities from PRIV, and the reliance on Apollo's market making to set the pricing for these trades," Neal Epstein, vice president of private credit at Moody's Ratings, commented. Don't just take it from wealth managers. The SEC is concerned about the structure of the State Street/Apollo fund as well and has sent a letter requesting more information from the firms "We have concerns regarding the Fund's liquidity risk management program," the SEC wrote last Thursday. The SEC also flagged that including "Apollo" in the fund name could be misleading, as Apollo isn't obligated to sell debt to the fund. The fund responded that it "will review and, if necessary, revise the registration statement disclosure to ensure that it is consistent with the above representation" and change the fund name "as soon as practicable."

Say you’re an American worker with a retirement plan. Out of concern for the planet — or how wildfires, heat waves, and hurricanes might affect your portfolio — you want the company managing your money to consider the environment in deciding where to invest. If one of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet secretaries gets his way, you might not have much choice. Chris Wright, recently confirmed as U.S. secretary of energy, has been aiming to dismantle a U.S. Department of Labor rule that governs 401(k)s and other private retirement plans for more than 150 million people. The regulation allows asset managers to weigh environmental, social, and governance — or ESG — factors as long as they financially benefit retirees. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How Wright was CEO of fracking company Liberty Energy in 2023 when the company and about two dozen states sued the agency to overturn the rule. Liberty’s case was dismissed in February by a federal judge in Texas, but the battle over ESG finance may be just beginning. The fossil fuel industry and its allies have launched a multipronged assault against sustainable investing, suing asset managers and pension funds and federal regulatory agencies that oversee them. ESG investing can illegally put political ideology over the financial interests of retirees, they argue in lawsuits. The conservative policy guide Project 2025 has called for the Trump administration to overturn current rules and prohibit ESG for most retirement plans. With roughly $14 trillion held in private retirement funds alone, their approach to investing has high stakes not only for individual retirees but also for the oil and gas industries. In January, an investigation by The Examination found the fossil fuel industry taking advantage of sustainable finance. More than $286 billion in a lax form of green finance called sustainability-linked loans were made to companies in polluting industries — from oil and gas to mining and timber — the investigation, published in partnership with Mississippi Today and the Toronto Star, revealed. This money was often counted by banks toward their sustainable investing targets, even though in some cases companies expanded polluting activities and increased their carbon emissions while they benefited from the loans. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How But in the months since Trump’s election, fear of political fallout and legal attacks on sustainable investing have prompted many financial institutions to abandon ESG goals altogether. In January, Texas federal Judge Reed O’Connor ruled against American Airlines in a case alleging that the airline’s 401(k) investments with BlackRock violated its duty to retirees because BlackRock considered ESG criteria in its investments and American failed to keep its own corporate interests separate from its obligations to retirement investors. Around the same time, BlackRock dropped out of the Net Zero Asset Managers, an industry group dedicated to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. BlackRock joined an array of leading U.S. and Canadian banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and Goldman Sachs, that recently withdrew from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. In a video appearance on February 17, Wright denounced net-zero targets as “sinister” and said they are being used to “shrink human freedom.” Lisa Sachs, director of the Center on Sustainable Investment at Columbia University, said efforts to ban ESG policies seek to help the fossil fuel industry at the expense of retirees. Prohibiting ESG factors from retirement plans would put blinders on asset managers, she said, forcing them to ignore real financial risks, such as floods affecting real estate value. This would undermine their ability to make safe long-term investments for pensioners, she said. “This is the exact opposite of free-market ideology,” Sachs said. Much of the legal dispute revolves around how ESG investing is defined — and experts agree the term is vague and easily manipulated. An ESG investment fund is one that takes environmental and social risks into account in its decision-making, not necessarily one that invests for social purposes, Sachs said. She cites Coca-Cola as a company that has a high ESG rating because assessors have deemed it does a good job managing the environmental and social risks to its business, even though its product contributes to obesity and chronic disease worldwide. Financial companies have misrepresented how ESG considerations are most often used, Sachs said, calling the marketing a form of greenwashing. Sachs said it is largely these misrepresentations that have put ESG policies in the crosshairs. “The greenwashing is what led to the political backlash,” she said. Jonathan Berry, the attorney for Liberty Energy in its suit against the labor department, said Liberty’s challenge doesn’t object to asset managers considering environmental factors when they are financially material. Instead, the company opposes a “tiebreaker” provision in the rule that allows asset managers to weigh non-financial ESG factors when deciding between investments that are economically equal. “It cracks open the door for divided loyalties,” Berry said. Berry is also one of the authors of Project 2025, the policy playbook whose proposals have been reflected in many of the Trump administration’s early actions. Among Project 2025’s prescriptions: removing ESG considerations from private retirement plans and a similar plan for federal employees, as well as possible enforcement actions against asset managers that have ESG policies while managing federal retirement plans. But not all conservatives are on board. Some Project 2025 contributors argue in an “alternative view” section that these recommendations go too far and that workers should be able to decide on investments in their retirement plans for themselves. “Even though ESG investing is often not a sound financial strategy, it is not wrong for retirement plans to offer ESG investment options,” the dissenters write. Berry agreed that the term ESG is “deliberately elastic.” But he said it often works the other way around: ESG investing is defined as considering environmental risks to get a foot in the door, and then used to push for political goals like divesting from fossil fuels. In 2023, conservative groups sued New York City pension funds that divested from fossil fuels, alleging the funds had breached their duties to retirees; that case was dismissed last year. In February, the campaign against ESG suffered another setback. Matthew Kacsmaryk, a conservative federal judge in Texas appointed by Trump, dismissed Liberty Energy’s lawsuit seeking to overturn the labor department’s ESG rule. Liberty’s argument that the department cannot apply ESG factors when deciding between financially equal plans, he ruled, would require it to choose based on “arbitrary randomness” instead. The ruling means that if the Trump administration wants to restrict financial options and prohibit ESG considerations from the retirement plans of the majority of American workers, it will likely have to act on its own, through the labor department. Dan Terpstra, a retired supercomputer scientist at the University of Tennessee, has been careful over the years to ensure his retirement funds are not invested in fossil fuels. An active member of the Presbyterian Church and an advocate for sustainable investing, Terpstra worries that a crackdown on ESG policies would be “forcing us away from doing the right thing.” The prospect of banning such plans, he said, would be “an erosion of our personal freedoms in service of a vision of America that I barely recognize.” A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Flowdesk has secured $102 million in fresh funding to expand its digital asset trading and liquidity business, backed by HV Capital and a debt facility from BlackRock-managed funds. “This funding round marks a pivotal moment for Flowdesk as we accelerate our expansion into key global markets,” said CEO Guilhem Chaumont in an email to CoinDesk. “Institutional demand for market-making infrastructure is growing rapidly, and we are committed to scaling our technology and services to meet that need.” In a release, Flowdesk said it will use the proceeds of the round to scale its over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives business and launch a dedicated crypto credit desk while also doubling headcount at the trading firm. "Flowdesk has built one of the most robust global infrastructures for digital asset trading, with unparalleled market connectivity, regulatory coverage, and a broad range of liquidity solutions," Chaumont continued. It also plans to expand into the Middle East, with the UAE being the next potential hub. Flowdesk is known for making bold bets when opening new offices; it expanded to the U.S. during the height of the Biden White House's war on crypto, a move that seemed risky at the time but ended up paying off handsomely for the company. Tokenization is also a major focus for Flowdesk as institutional interest in on-chain assets grows. The company has worked with token issuers to facilitate liquidity for tokenized assets and plans to expand its services to include stablecoins, tokenized securities, and money market funds. "From day one, Flowdesk has been built on the vision that tokenization would redefine financial markets. Over the past years, our work with token issuers has positioned us at the forefront of this transformation," Chaumont said in an email. Flowdesk's existing investors, Eurazeo, Cathay Innovation, and ISAI, also participated in the round. Sam Reynolds is a senior reporter based in Asia.

Title: Caelan Doris v Gregory Alldritt head-to-head: Two outstanding number eights set to battle it out

Time Published: 2025-03-04T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
Born: Ballina, Mayo. April 2nd, 1998 (age 26). Caps: 49 (9 tries). Position: Number eight. Height: 1.93m (6ft 4in) Weight: 111kg (245lb; 17st 7lb) Did you know? Educated in Blackrock College, while growing up in Lacken, Co Mayo. Doris’s father, Chris, was an artist in residence at Mayo County Council, who once spent 40 days at the top of Croagh Patrick interviewing pilgrims as part of a ‘social sculpture’. Though a true-blue Leinster rugby man, Doris supports Mayo in Gaelic football. Has a degree in psychology. Strengths: His carrying and tackling numbers are invariably among the highest and, with his footwork, among the most dynamic too, and he usually has big, match-influencing moments. Many strings to his bow, he times his poaches effectively and not many backs could have made that pass for Garry Ringrose’s try two years ago. His presence this Saturday is vital. He also benefits from the Irish system. A year younger than Alldritt, Doris has played 140 games for province and country (48 less than Alldritt), and this season he has accumulated markedly less minutes (1,031) in 14 games. Doris has quickly embraced captaincy too. A truly exceptional rugby player. Born: Toulouse, 23rd March 1997 (age 27). Caps: 54 (6 tries). Position: Number eight. Height: 1.91m (6ft 3in) Weight: 115kg (254lb; 18st 2lb). Did you know? Alldritt’s father, Terence, moved to Stirling in Scotland aged 12 after being born in Kenya and attending boarding school in South Africa. Alldritt regularly visited Scotland as a child and his brother, Scott, has played for Stewart’s Melville in Edinburgh. Strengths: Natural born leader who has captained La Rochelle in all their clashes with Leinster and, fuelled by Ronan O’Gara, has evidently built up some antipathy towards Irish teams. He actually has a winning record against Leinster, having scored a key try in the semi-final win in an empty Stade Deflandre in the 2021 semi-final, while he was a key absentee when Leinster won on a sodden day in La Rochelle last season. Even the indefatigable Alldritt had to take a post-World Cup break. He invariably plays a huge amount of minutes for both La Rochelle and France, whom he also captained in last season’s Friday night opener in Marseille. A year older than Doris, he has played 188 games for club and country (48 more) and this season has accumulated 1,355 minutes in total (324 more than his Irish counterpart). Colossal work-rate, too, as both an ever-willing and direct carrier, and a powerful tackler, who always seems to be in the coalface of the game. Typically, in six games against Leinster and five against Ireland, he has played 80 minutes every time. Previous meetings: Played 9, Doris 5 wins, Alldritt 4 wins.

Title: Spicy Bond Funds
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/03/spicy-bond-funds/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T01:12:57Z
Full Content:
I wrote Business Cycle: Boring Bond Funds at Seeking Alpha in June 2019, describing the yield curve and that conditions were favorable to increase allocations to bonds. In hindsight, I believe that a “soft landing” would have been achieved had it not been for the COVID-induced recession. The conservative accounts that I manage are now fully invested in bonds. In this article, we will look at “Spicy Bond Funds” for those who are interested in high yield and safety. Spicy, but not too hot, and easy to manage! There are several important considerations for investing in bonds. First, the S&P 500 earnings yield is less than the 10-year Treasury which has not occurred since the Dotcom Bubble. The stock market is overvalued by most metrics, and the return on the S&P 500 has slowed to 1.4% over the past three months. Second, the risk premium for duration and investment-grade bonds is low. This favors shorter-duration bonds with opportunities in investment-grade bonds. Third, inflation is sticky and expectations for higher inflation are rising. Fourth, policy uncertainty about tax cuts, tariffs, deporting immigrants, and spending cuts are adding to volatility and the long end of the yield curve is flattening. I use about twenty metrics from Mutual Fund Observer to rank over three hundred bond funds by Risk, Yield, Quality (including duration), Trends, and Returns weighted for a conservative investor such as myself to identify favorable Lipper Categories and high-performing funds. I preselected the funds based on risk-adjusted return and Fund Family Rating, among other factors. Performance during the COVID bear markets is one of the twenty metrics used in my ranking system. I use the MFO Great Owl rating to increase the “Rank” of funds and the “Three Alarm” rating to punish those with deteriorating performance. I use “Bullish” and “Bearish” ETF bond screens at Fidelity and Relative Strength Index (RSI) from Seeking Alpha to “bend” my rating for shorter-term momentum. The Core, General, and Corporate BBB-rated funds that I track had an average annualized return of 4.7% over the full cycle from November 2007 until December 2019 with an average APR of 0.6% during the Great Financial Crisis bear market. This compares to 8.4% for the S&P 500 over the same full cycle and -41.4% during the bear market. The bonds have a 30-day yield of 4.8% compared to 1.2% for the S&P 500. Bonds are subject to inflation, duration, and quality risk. Uncertainty can also impact bond performance. Figure #1 shows the expected inflation to be around 2.6% in the next 5 years, on average as estimated by the breakeven inflation rate. It has risen from a recent low of 1.9% in September as inflation has proven to be sticky and concerns over tariffs. The consumer price index came in higher than expected for January increasing 3.0% over the past twelve months, and 0.5% for the past month. In reaction, the yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 4.64%. Figure #1: 5-Year Breakeven Inflation and Yield on 10-Year Treasuries Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED Database: 5-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate [T5YIE]; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US), Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity [DGS10] The Republican administration has suggested opening more federal land for oil leases. It takes time and money to explore these fields, evaluate the results, build the infrastructure, and drill the production wells. I don’t expect the benefits to lower inflation in the near term especially when the $72 price per barrel provides little incentive to invest. I use the yield curves from the 2004 to 2007 period to demonstrate duration risk. Bond values are inversely related to yields, and longer durations are more sensitive to changes in the yield. During this period, yields on the 10-year Treasury fluctuated around 4.5% within a range of +/- 0.6%. The dark line is the yield curve at the time of this writing. I expect it to be range bound between roughly 4.0% and 5.5% until inflation is under control and there is more clarity on the budget deficit. Figure #2: Anatomy of the Yield Curve and Inflation (2004 to 2007) Source: Author Using St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED Database Pola Rocha at Investopedia explains why yields on longer duration bond rates are likely to stay higher for longer in The Treasury Secretary Says Trump Wants Long-Term Rates to Fall—It May Take a While. The Federal Reserve controls short-term rates, but long-term rates are driven more by inflation and government borrowing among other factors. Since the middle of September, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose from 3.6% to 4.8% before declining to 4.4% recently. Today, it has risen back above 4.6% over hotter-than-expected inflation readings for January. Preston Caldwell, Hong Cheng, and Dominic Pappalardo at Morningstar explain in Why Long-Term Interest Rates Aren’t Falling—And What That Means For Your Portfolio that the biggest driver of higher inflation expectations is probably higher expectations for economic growth and the strength of the labor market leading to more upward pricing pressure. They suggest investors should consider moderately extending the duration of their portfolios to capture potential gains despite the likelihood of further steepening. They favor intermediate-term Treasuries. Figure #3 is based on median yields for bonds from Fidelity. For investing in investment grade bonds with a 3-year duration, an investor is receiving a historically low premium of only 0.5%, and to invest in Treasuries with a 10-year duration instead of a 2-year duration, that investor receives the same yield with no duration premium. I find the one-to-four-year duration in investment-grade debt to be attractive for taxable bonds. Figure #3: Median Yield Curves and BBB to Treasury Spread Source: Author Using Fidelity Fixed Income Data The policy changes from the new administration add uncertainty regarding tariffs, inflation, tax cut stimulus, spending cuts, budget deficits, and national debt levels. The Federal Reserve’s continuing Quantitative Tightening adds supply of long-term debt. I created Table #1 to show a comprehensive snapshot of how bond funds are performing and to better understand how I am invested. They are sorted from my highest ranked Lipper Category to lowest. The highest-ranked five funds are shown for each Lipper Category. The Tier One Categories are those with a higher risk-adjusted yield with better recent performance. They tend to have shorter durations. Tier Two Categories step further into the risk spectrum with slightly longer durations and lower quality, but still have a high risk-adjusted yield. Tier Three Categories are those with longer durations and lower risk-adjusted yields. I adjusted the yields and returns of tax-exempt funds higher to be the tax equivalent for an investor in the 22% tax bracket. Of the bond funds that Fidelity, Vanguard, or I manage, 21% are in Tier One, 12% are in Tier Two, and 48% are in Tier Three with another 18% in bond ladders. Fidelity and Vanguard manage the more aggressive side of investments and use more core bond funds, while I manage the conservative side of Bucket #2 for the intermediate term. The yield on the taxable bond funds that I manage is 5% excluding the bond ladders. I built the bond ladder mostly in Treasuries and Agency bonds with yield to maturity of 4% or higher but with low dividends. I will be investing for a sustainable higher yield as the bonds mature.

The barbell strategy is a tactical strategy that involves buying short-term and long-term bonds depending upon the shape of the yield curve but nothing in between. Steve Johnson describes the barbell strategy in ‘Barbell’ Effect Helps Fixed Income Newcomers Usurp Traditional Bond Funds published in the Financial Times. Investors are moving away from actively managed mutual funds that sit in the middle to lower cost, actively managed funds on one end, and alternative vehicles, such as private credit and infrastructure debt funds, at the other. Of the top five bond funds per Lipper Category that I track, 75% are actively managed and 65% are exchange-traded funds. The bond ladder strategy is an all-weather strategy that invests in bonds that mature in given years in order to produce a steady stream of income. The main advantage is that rates can be locked in when high. The disadvantages of bond ladders are the high barrier to entry, less liquidity, default risk, and the risk of rates rising. I have about 18% of my bond investments in individual bonds (rungs) that mature each year (spacing). Exchange-traded funds that are designed to be rungs on an ETF bond ladder have been around for over a decade. Invesco manages Bulletshares bond funds and BlackRock has iShares iBonds that pay a dividend and mature in a particular year. They come in the flavors of Corporate Debt BBB-Rated, High Yield, Inflation Protected, U.S. Treasury General, and Municipal Bonds. Table #2 shows the number of funds and assets under management of these funds. Table #2: Bond Ladder ETFs. Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. They have the advantages of simplicity, diversification, liquidity, and flexibility. The disadvantages are that an active investor has the advantage of being able to selectively pick higher-yielding bonds, the dividends are not as predictable, and in the final year bonds that have matured are reinvested in Treasury bills. As a retiree, I am interested in stability and a steady stream of income. As I have written previously, traditional portfolios with a stock-to-bond ratio of 60/40 are expected to have below-average returns of around 6% in the coming decade compared to 8.3% during the 2010 decade. I see opportunities in short to intermediate-term investment-grade credit. I have been shifting from core bond funds in Tier Three to short and short-intermediate investment grade bond funds in Tier One and Two. I have been spicing up my portfolio with lower risk, higher yielding funds in the Loan Participation, High Yield with 1-to-3-year durations, and multi-sector bond funds. I avoid high-yielding funds that require a significant amount of time tracking the industries and management changes as well as hot new funds without at least three years of performance history. One of the funds that I have been buying is the Janus Henderson Aaa Clo ETF (JAAA) in the Loan Participation category. It is not the spiciest fund in the spice rack. The reasons that I like it are that it invests 95% in “AAA” bonds, only has 15% in the top ten holdings, has $20B in AUM, 92% is securitized, and expense ratio of 0.21%. During its four-year life, it has returned 4.6% annually with a maximum drawdown of 2.3%. It has a TTM yield of 6.32%. It has an MFO Risk of “1” for “Very Conservative” and is in the top quintile for risk-adjusted performance in the loan participation category. It has a FactSet rating of A, and a 5-star Morningstar rating. It is not without its risks though, with 58% invested in South America, and with 68% of its investments classified as long-term. It is not a tax-efficient fund, so I own it mostly in Traditional IRAs. Table #3 compares the highest-performing loan participation funds by my ranking system. Table #3: Bond Ladder ETFs – Three-Year Metrics Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset.

Title: FTC Lawsuit Temporarily Halts ‘Phantom Debt Collection’ Scheme
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/fraud-prevention/2025/ftc-lawsuit-temporarily-halts-phantom-debt-collection-scheme/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T00:18:32Z
Full Content:
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) said Monday (March 3) that its lawsuit led a federal court to temporarily halt the operations and freeze the assets of a “phantom debt collection” scheme and its operators. The commission’s complaint alleges that the operators of the scheme are Ryan and Mitchell Evans and their affiliated companies that have operated under the names Blackrock Services, Blackstone Legal Group, Capital Legal Services, Quest Legal Group, Viking Legal Services, and others, according to a Monday press release. The complaint alleges that the scheme also operated under the names of unaffiliated existing businesses and law firms, per the release. The FTC complaint alleges that debt collectors working for the operators and their affiliated companies called or wrote to consumers to collect on debts that never existed; threatened legal action that they had no basis to undertake; and falsely claimed that the fictitious debt could damage consumers’ credit and that a payment to settle the debt would lessen that harm, according to the release. “The complaint notes that letters sent by the operators often contain a wealth of sensitive personal information about the consumer, including the last four digits of their Social Security number, leading consumers to believe the letter may be legitimate,” the release said. In its complaint, the FTC asks the court to stop the defendants’ alleged unlawful conduct and provide redress to consumers they harmed, per the release. In another, separate case, the FTC said Dec. 10 that it began sending over $540,000 in refunds to consumers harmed by a debt collection scheme. The refunds followed the FTC’s filing of lawsuits in September 2020 and reaching settlements in March 2021 and December 2021 with National Landmark Logistics and Absolute Financial Services, which also operated under other names. In the settlements, the defendants were permanently banned from the debt collection industry and were required to pay money to compensate the consumers. In November, the FTC took action against Global Circulation and its owner, Kenneth Redon, III, alleging that the debt collector tricked consumers into paying more than $7.6 million in bogus debt by threatening them with unlawful actions. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Joe Rogan & Elon Musk Spark Conspiracy Theory About CNN
URL: https://littlethings.com/entertainment/joe-rogan-elon-musk-spark-conspiracy-that-cnn-was-involved-with-assassination-attempt
Time Published: 2025-03-03T22:05:11Z
Full Content:
Home Entertainment Joe Rogan had Elon Musk back on his podcast heading into the weekend, and after the two got through talking, the conspiracy theorists were fired up about the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. And CNN … well, it can’t be appreciating the unwarranted heat directed at it. Rogan and Musk also discussed the billionaire’s controversial hand gesture at President Donald Trump’s inauguration that many believed resembled a Nazi salute, and Rogan said he thought it was “strange” that people that people would think that way. Then Musk threw out a few Nazi puns, telling Rogan “I did not see it coming,” while discussing folks calling him a Nazi on X after the incident. “People will Goebbels anything down,” he added. More from LittleThings: Joe Rogan Calls Girl Scout Cookies ‘Toxic As [Expletive]’ On His Podcast The two found that pretty darned funny, and had some laughs, but that wasn’t the issue for CNN. That came when Rogan wondered openly about the assassination attempt on Trump at his rally in Butler in 2024. After first wondering if BlackRock was involved, Rogan pivoted. “I highly doubt it would be a corporation that chooses to do something like this,” he said. “I think more likely it’s individuals involved that recognize that it’s beneficial to them if he gets assassinated. And so, a small group of people carry something out, and with this kid, we don’t know anything, and everyone stopped asking question and there was never a formal report. There was never press conferences when they detailed all the information that we know currently and where the investigation stands at the moment. What we know is we have a very young kid, who was filmed, they knew he was there with a rangefinder a half an hour before the event.” The next part is what had folks targeting CNN. “You also know that CNN streamed it live, which I do not believe they did for any other rally, and certainly not for a rally in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania,” Rogan said. “Like, there’s a lot of weird s—.” That led many of the conspiracy theorists to believe that Rogan was suggesting that CNN might have known about the attempt in advance. Of course, Rogan is a big enough name that he could have reached out to CNN to ask about that, and all of this could have been avoided. But he didn’t and so folks took it and ran with it. “What are the chances @CNN was tipped off to stream the Butler rally?” billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman wrote on Twitter. “Why isn’t this worthy of an investigation? It shouldn’t be too hard to figure out who orders the coverage and why.” CNN, of course, did have an answer and it does make sense. If anyone cares. “CNN provided live coverage of President Trump’s Butler, PA, rally in anticipation of news about his pick of Vice President,” the network said while responding to several accounts on X. “Any suggestion contrary to that fact is completely false.” —Brian Linder, pennlive.com (TNS) ©2025 Advance Local Media LLC.

Title: Far away, so close – Fionnuala Ward on measuring distance
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irish-diary/2025/03/03/far-away-so-close-fionnuala-ward-on-measuring-distance/
Time Published: 2025-03-03T18:49:00Z
Full Content:
I’m not good at gauging distance. As a non-driver, I’ve been in that navigator role in the front seat and been told to watch out as the sat-nav woman talks about turning left in 300 metres or 500 metres or something like that. I find myself fixating on that initial number and deciding, in my scientific way, that if it’s below five metres, that turn must be pretty close, and if above, means I can take a breath here. And as for talk of heading east or west, north or south or, better still, northwest or southeast? So this is what civilisation has wrought? Useful perhaps when traversing the Savannah, not so much when negotiating the labyrinth of roads around a busy city centre. However, I comfort myself in the knowledge that distance and length issues aside, when it comes to spatial awareness and our understanding of our location in the universe, together we are all on a downward trajectory. Maps blew about in the wind, got torn and never folded away properly. But they did marshall a platoon of brain cells to jump into action and make sense of those squiggly lines which has to have been a good thing. So the phone has a lot to answer for. The phone and the car. Years ago now, I went on the Dart to visit a school for a particular event. I knew where it was, kind of, and the plan was to make my way there on foot. But I somehow managed to wander off in the wrong direction when coming out of the station and even with my Google Maps app got completely lost. I rang the school, apologetic and embarrassed, and asked for directions. No need, I was told. A parent was on her way down right now. And one materialised, very kindly, 10 minutes later. Walking from the station wasn’t an option, she explained as we wound our way to the school gates. That would have taken 20 minutes, probably more. Once the event in the school was over, I made my goodbyes and with directions freshly explained, headed for the station. I was there in six minutes. The car. What is it good for? Well, when it comes to assessing distance, absolutely nothing. My uncle used to tell the story about how he and my father would head from Dundalk to Blackrock on Thursday afternoons during the summer. Their parents’ grocery-pub business closed early on a Thursday which meant they were off duty and could go for a swim. But they only had access to the one bicycle which, for some reason since lost in the mists of time, didn’t have a crossbar, so no carrying of passengers could take place. Walking all the way was out of the question for the two young lads so instead they came up with a system, whereby each could have a go on the bike. They would head off, one walking one cycling, with the cyclist inevitably overtaking the pedestrian, although generally not without some obligatory jeering and minor threats to stay on the bike for the entire trip. Further along the route, he would drop the bicycle at the side of the road and continue on foot. The pedestrian would find the bicycle, jump on board and the process was repeated. Without a shadow of a doubt, the pair developed a forensically analysed and mathematically correct understanding of what three miles entailed. And more, much more, given the fact that once they arrived in Blackrock, yet more walking had to be undertaken to catch the tide – this lovely, seaside Louth village having at best an intermittent relationship with the sea. I can attest to this from childhood experience as on trips to Dundalk, we would occasionally pour into the car, Blackrock-bound, confident in fact that those rocks and rock-pools would be as explorable as ever, the tide having only an occasional interest in them. But back to the present or maybe not quite. The lockdowns helped. For a while there, we knew what a radius of 2km entailed and then 4km and wider. But even that momentary epiphany came and went. I like walking to work. It wakes me up and, having arrived at my destination, elicits a feeling of exquisite self-righteousness that starts the day off very nicely. But I recently overheard someone living locally speak of a similar distance as being “too far” for anything other than the car. It seems that distance, like time, is entirely measurable and yet also oddly subjective. We experience it in different ways. Mind you, we still need a common understanding of what 300 metres or 500 metres actually means. And I’m still working on that. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Conspiracy Theorists Think Mark Zuckerberg Started Myrtle Beach Wildfires
URL: https://gizmodo.com/conspiracy-theorists-think-mark-zuckerberg-started-myrtle-beach-wildfires-2000570780
Time Published: 2025-03-03T18:25:13Z
Full Content:
At least 175 wildfires have been burning in the Carolinas since this past weekend, with one fire near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, burning about 1,600 acres and forcing residents to evacuate, according to CNN. Enormous wildfires are atypical for North and South Carolina, but dry and windy conditions, with gusts over 130 mph, explain why these fires are so difficult to fight. That’s not good enough for conspiracy theorists, of course. X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, has been flooded in recent days with conspiracy theories insisting the fires were started by powerful tech figures like Mark Zuckerberg as part of some dastardly attempt to turn Myrtle Beach into a so-called smart city. And while that’s an absurd claim, it’s becoming an extremely common one as climate change creates the ideal conditions for intense fires in very odd places. Right-wing influencer John Sabal, tweeting as The Patriot Voice, insisted that what was happening in Myrtle Beach was so unusual it must be something suspicious, even claiming that local news held clues about what was in store. “WHEN is the last time you have EVER heard of Myrtle Beach having damn ‘wildfires’?!?!?!” Sabal tweeted. “They think we are STUPID. If you pay close enough attention, they ALWAYS tell you in advance what they are planning, like on this news broadcast.” Sabal went on to insist the fires were started with directed energy weapons, another way of saying that these wildfires were probably started by some kind of space laser. “The ‘wildfires’ are being set off INTENTIONALLY by DEWs (Directed Energy Weapons) so they can easily burn down the area, where Blackrock can then come in and buy it all up cheap and rebuild it into a 15 minute ‘smart city’ PRISON,” Sabal continued. Sabal claimed this is “EXACTLY what happened” in other recent fires in Hawaii, Texas, and California, all places where conspiracy theorists have previously claimed space lasers were being used to create destruction. Then, Sabal pointed out this was happening “even” as Donald Trump was president and claimed that Zuckerberg might be behind it. “It looks like this time, Mark Zuckerberg has his hands ALL over this one, VERY CONCERNING considering he was just at the Inauguration and now is looking at moving D.C. to be close to Trump,” Sabal claimed. Zuckerberg has indeed been cozying up to Trump ever since the assassination attempt against the president last summer. The Meta CEO even donated money and showed up at Trump’s inauguration. But everything else about what Sabal is saying isn’t true. Sabal shared a video from TikTok about Meta’s plans to add new technology to Myrtle Beach. The local news clip from June 2023 talks about how technology was helping add 3D simulations for tourism promotion and how gunfire detection tech might make the city safer. Reasonably, people can debate whether these are good uses of taxpayer resources, but it’s not exactly evidence of some grand conspiracy to burn Myrtle Beach to the ground. Sabal was far from the only one spreading these conspiracy theories on social media. HustleBitch, a right-wing account you may recognize from previous debunkers, tweeted Sunday the same baseless conspiracy theories, making similar connections to fires in Lahaina and Maui, Hawaii. HustleBitch also shared the same video from WMBF in South Carolina as some kind of gotcha moment, as though trying to introduce some extremely tame tech upgrades to any city is evidence of anything more nefarious. Responses to HustleBitch’s tweets insist the fires are also being caused by weather modification, something that’s apparently easier to believe than pointing at climate change. And that seems to be the crux of the problem. Whenever something terrible is happening, people naturally look for ways to prevent it from happening again. That sometimes leads people to find causal connections that simply aren’t there. There’s no evidence that any Big Tech figures are intentionally starting wildfires to buy up land and start their own cities from scratch. There is, however, lots of evidence that the wealthiest guy in the world is currently dismantling the federal government and setting the U.S. economy on a path of destruction to line his own pockets. But believing a guy like Elon Musk could be doing everything he promised doesn’t quite fit with their worldview. No, we need space lasers for some reason. Apparently, it’s more exciting that way. Musk doesn’t need space lasers. But he’s going to do a lot more damage than any space laser has ever done if he’s allowed to continue.

Target’s online traffic dropped during The People’s Union USA Economic Blackout on Feb. 28, according to data from website analytics platform Similarweb. And while the boycott was not explicitly targeting brands that rolled back diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Costco’s uptick in online traffic on the same day, brings the conversation back to the forefront. On Feb. 28 blackout day, Target website visitors dropped 9% compared to Friday, Feb. 14, from 5.2 ... [+] million to 4.7 million. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) On blackout day, Target website visitors dropped 9% compared to Friday, Feb. 14, from 5.2 million to 4.7 million. Target app user traffic, representing the most loyal Target customers, was off even more, down 14%, from 4.2 million to 3.5 million. By comparison, Costco experienced a 22% rise in Feb. 28 web traffic, from 2.4 million Feb. 14 to 2.9 million and Costco app user visits rose 3%, from 1.3 million to 1.34 million. On blackout day, the nation’s number one retailer, Walmart, experienced a 5% slump in web traffic, down from 11.7 million on Feb. 14 to 11.2 million and number two Amazon dropped by 2%, from 67.1 million to 65.9 million. However, Amazon app traffic rose 1% to 51.4 million visitors while Walmart’s dropped 2% to 13.6 million. Ever since Target announced at the end of January that it had concluded its three-year diversity, equity and inclusion goals, calls for boycotts against Target have been growing, most recently with Black faith and civil rights leaders advocating for a 40-day “Target Fast” over Lent starting this Ash Wednesday. About the same time as Target was dialing back DEI, Costco affirmed its strong DEI commitment after striking down a proxy vote to evaluate its current policy’s risks in light of rising anti-DEI political and legal pressure. While website traffic can rise and fall sharply on any given day for any number of reasons, it would appear that Target is beginning to experience pullback from its most loyal app-user customer base. Target reports full-year 2024 earnings tomorrow at 9 a.m. ET and its fourth quarter will only include results covering a week or so after the DEI pushback began. So we’ll have to wait for next quarter to see impact from the boycott calls. However, Target gave a sneak peek at holiday results and reported a 2.8% net sales increase over November and December, including a nearly 9% increase in digital sales compared to prior year. Blackrock, the world’s largest investment firm and one of the leading advocates for strong DEI and environmental, social and governance policies, has been “walking back” its ESG/DEI positions, the Wall Street Journal reported. Last Friday, it told employees it was ending “aspirational workforce representation goals” as a result of “significant changes to the U.S. legal and policy environment.” “In recent days, we have witnessed a disturbing retreat from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives by major corporations—companies that once pledged to stand for justice but have since chosen the path of compromise. These rollbacks represent more than just corporate decisions; they reflect a deeper erosion of the moral and ethical commitments necessary to build a just society. As people of faith, we cannot be silent. We are called to resist systems that perpetuate exclusion and inequity,” states the TargetFast.org website.

BlackRock-backed CTV advertising platform MNTN is divesting production shop Maximum Effort “to an affiliate of its original owner,” according to an IPO securities filing made Friday. Maximum Effort was founded by actor Ryan Reynolds and producer George Dewey in 2018. In the filing, MNTN said that on Feb. 28 “the Company entered into an agreement to transfer its interest in Maximum Effort to an affiliate of its original owner.” Whether the indicated “affiliate” is Reynolds, Dewey, or a third party is unclear. Reynolds currently serves as chief creative officer for MNTN. Neither MNTN nor Maximum Effort responded to requests for comment by press time. Maximum Effort, which has produced splashy ads for Match.com, Peloton, and Mint Mobile, “will continue to provide creative services” to MNTN, per the agreement. In short, Maximum Effort will begin operating as an independent organization but will remain a creative partner for MNTN. The transaction is expected to close on April 1. MNTN acquired Maximum Effort in 2021 for an undisclosed sum. Citing strong revenue growth, the SEC filing also spells out MNTN’s plan for a U.S. IPO. The company saw revenue climb nearly 28% in 2024, up from $176 million in the prior year. The Texas-based firm plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker MNTN.

Title: 1900 Scientists Say ‘Climate Change Not Caused by CO2’ – The Real Environment Movement Was Hijacked
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/1900-scientists-say-climate-change-not-caused-co2/5881282
Time Published: 2025-03-03T13:59:22Z
Full Content:
Millions of people worldwide are concerned about climate change and believe there is a climate emergency. For decades we have been told by the United Nations that Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from human activity are causing disastrous climate change. In 2018, a UN IPCC report even warned that ‘we have 12 years to save the Earth’, thus sending millions of people worldwide into a frenzy. Thirty-five years ago, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the (World Meteorological Organization) WMO established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide scientific advice on the complex topic of climate change. The panel was asked to prepare, based on available scientific information, a report on all aspects relevant to climate change and its impacts and to formulate realistic response strategies. The first assessment report of the IPCC served as the basis for negotiating the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Governments worldwide have signed this convention, thereby, significantly impacting the lives of the people of the world. However, many scientists dispute with the UN-promoted man-made climate change theory, and many people worldwide are confused by the subject, or are unaware of the full facts. Please allow me to provide some information you may not be aware of. 1. Very few people actually dig into the data, they simply accept the UN IPPC reports. Yet many highly respectable and distinguished scientists have done exactly that and found that the UN-promoted manmade climate change theory is seriously flawed. Are you aware that almost 2,000 of the world’s leading climate scientists and professionals in over 30 countries have signed a declaration that there is no climate emergency and have refuted the United Nations claims in relation to man-made climate change? See this. 2. I have also signed this declaration. How can I make such an assertion? I have experience in the field as a former scientist at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, UK Government; and as former staff member at United Nations Environment, where I was responsible for servicing the Pollution Release and Transfer Register Protocol, a Multinational Environmental Agreement, involving the monitoring of pollutants to land, air, and water worldwide. Real pollution exists, but the problem is not CO2. Industrial globalisation has produced many substances that are registered as pollutants, including thousands of new man-made chemical compounds, toxins, nano-particles and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that are in violation of the scientific pre-cautionary principle. A book I published also provides ample evidence and testimony from renowned scientists that there is no ‘CO2-induced’ Climate emergency. The book titled ‘Climate CO2 Hoax – How Bankers Hijacked the Environment Movement’ is available on Amazon here. 3. Next, I will mention the Irish Climate Science Forum (ICSF) website, a valuable resource founded by Jim O’Brien. I am grateful to the ICSF for their excellent work in highlighting the scientific flaws in the UN climate narrative. The ICSF provides a comprehensive lecture series from renowned international scientists providing much evidence, analysis, and data that contradicts the UN assertions. The lectures are available here. The ICSF scientific view coincides with those of the Climate Intelligence (CLINTEL) foundation that operates in the fields of climate change and climate policy. CLINTEL was founded in 2019 by emeritus professor of geophysics Guus Berkhout and science journalist Marcel Crok. Based on this common conviction, 20 Irish scientists and several ICSF members have co-signed the CLINTEL World Climate Declaration “There is No Climate Emergency” (see this). 4. The reality is that the climate has always been changing, the climate changes naturally and slowly in its own cycle, and CO2 emissions (and methane from livestock, such as cows) are not dominant factors in climate change. In essence, therefore, the incessant UN, government, and corporate-media-produced climate hysteria in relation to CO2 emissions (and also methane from cows) has no scientific basis. It appears to me the UN narrative is yet another example of fake science being used to drive an ulterior agenda, see also the book Godless Fake Science. In truth I am against ‘real’ pollution, and the reality is that the CO2 component is not a pollutant. Unfortunately, many misinformed environmentalists are driving around in electric cars, the battery production for which has caused vast amounts of ‘real’ pollution via the industrial mining and processing of rare earth metals, and the consequent pollution to land, air and water systems. See also this article. Note that the UN does not focus on the thousands of real pollutants that corporate industrial globalisation creates. 5. The conclusions of the Climate Intelligence foundation include the following There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm. Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause warming: The geological archive reveals that Earth’s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, with natural cold and warm phases. The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850. Therefore, it is no surprise that we now are experiencing a period of warming. Warming is far slower than predicted: The world has warmed significantly less than predicted by IPCC on the basis of modeled anthropogenic forcing. The gap between the real world and the modeled world tells us that we are far from understanding climate change. Climate policy relies on inadequate models: Climate models have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as global policy tools. They blow up the effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2. In addition, they ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial. CO2 is plant food, the basis of all life on Earth: CO2 is not a pollutant. It is essential to all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth: additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide. Global warming has not increased natural disasters: There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent. It also appears to me that various catastrophes attributed to “CO2-induced climate change” are nothing of the sort. I note the following articles: 6. In the above book I reference the relevant work and scientific presentations of some of the world’s leading climate scientists. Let us examine some of the work and testimonies of these scientists: “deeply flawed logic, obscured by shrewd and unrelenting propaganda, actually enabled a coalition of powerful special interests to convince nearly everyone in the world that Co2 from human industry was a dangerous plant destroying toxin. It will be remembered as the greatest mass delusion in the history of the world – that Co2 the life of plants was considered for a time to be a deadly poison.” – Professor Richard Lindzen, Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric Sciences at MIT. Dr Nils-Axel Mörner was a former Committee Chairman at the UN International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). He was an expert involved in reviewing the first IPPC documents. He says the UN IPPC is misleading humanity about climate change. He tried to warn that the IPPC were publishing lies and false information that would inevitably be discredited. In an interview, he stated: “This is the most dangerous and frightening part of it. How a lobbyist group, such as the IPPC, has been able to fool the whole world. These organised and deceitful forces are dangerous” and expressed shock “that the UN and governments would parade children around the place at UN Climate summits as propaganda props”. He states: “solar activity is the dominant factor in climate and not Co2… something is basically sick in the blame Co2 hypothesis… It was launched more than 100 years ago and almost immediately excellent physicists demonstrated that the hypothesis did not work. I was the chairman of the only international committee on sea levels changes and as such a person I was elected to be the expert reviewer on the (UN IPPC) sea levels chapter. It was written by 38 persons and not a single one was a sea level specialist… I was shocked by the low quality it was like a student paper… I went through it and showed them that it was wrong and wrong and wrong…The scientific truth is on the side of the sceptics… I have thousands of high ranked scientists all over the world who agree that NO, CO2 is not the driving mechanism and that everything is exaggerated. In the field of physics 80 to 90% of physicists know that the Co2 hypothesis is wrong… Of course, metrologists they believe in this because that is their own profession – they live on it.… I suspect that behind-the-scenes promoters… have an ulterior motive… It’s a wonderful way of controlling taxation controlling people” – Dr Nils-Axel Mörner, a former Committee Chairman at the UN IPPC, and former head of the Paleo Geo-physics and Geo-dynamics department in Stockholm Another climate scientist with impeccable credentials that has broken rank is Dr Mototaka Nakamura. He asserts: “Our models are mickey-mouse mockeries of the real world”. Dr Nakamura received a Doctorate of Science from MIT, and for nearly 25 years specialized in abnormal weather and climate change at prestigious institutions that included MIT, Georgia Institute of Technology, NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, JAMSTEC and Duke University. Dr Nakamura explains why the data foundation underpinning global warming science is “untrustworthy” and cannot be relied on and that: “Global mean temperatures before 1980 are based on untrustworthy data”. Professor John R. Christy, Director of Atmospheric and Earth Sciences, University of Alabama, has provided detailed analysis of climate data[1]. I summarise the main points from his analysis below: “The established global warming theory significantly misrepresents the impact of extra greenhouse gases; the weather that affects people the most is not becoming more extreme or more dangerous; temperatures were higher in the 1930s than today; between 1895 and 2015, 14 of the top 15 years with the highest heat records occurred before 1960; the temperatures we are experiencing now in 2021 were the same as 120 years ago… the number of major tornadoes between 1954 and 1986 averaged 56/year, but between 1987 and 2020 the average was only 34/year; between 1895 and 2015 on average there has been no change in the number of very wet days per month, and no change in the number of very dry days per month, and the 20 driest months were before 1988. Between 1950 and 2019 the percentage of land area experiencing droughts has not increased globally – the trend is flat; the incidence of wildfires in North America between 1600 and 2000 has decreased substantially. Sea levels rose 12.5 cm per decade for 8,000 years and then it levelled off, now it rising only 2.5 cm per decade… worrying about 30 cm rise in sea level in a decade is ridiculous, in a hurricane the east coast of the U.S. gets a 20 foot rise in 6 hours, so a 30 cm rise will be easily handled!” In a lecture titled The imaginary climate crisis – how can we change the message? Available on the Irish Climate Science Forum website[2]. Richard L Lindzen, Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric Sciences at MIT summarises the battle against the climate hysteria as follows: “in the long history of the earth there has been almost no correlation between climate and co2… the paleoclimate record shows unambiguously that Co2 is not a control knob… the narrative is absurd… it gives governments the power to control the energy sector… for about 33 years, many of us have been battling against the climate hysteria… There were more important leading people who were objecting to it, they were unfortunately older and by now most of them dead… Elites are always searching for ways to advertise their virtue and assert their authority. They believe they are entitled to view science as a source of authority rather than a process, and they try to appropriate science, suitably and incorrectly simplified, as the basis for their movement.” “CO2… it’s not a pollutant… it’s the product of all plant respiration, it is essential for plant life and photosynthesis… if you ever wanted a leverage point to control everything from exhalation to driving, this would be a dream. So it has a kind of fundamental attractiveness to bureaucratic mentality.” – Prof. Richard Lindzen, Professor Emeritus of Atmospheric Sciences at MIT Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace, and President of Greenpeace in Canada for seven years, states: “the whole climate crisis is not only fake news its fake science… of course climate change is real it’s been happening since the beginning of time, but it’s not dangerous and it’s not caused by people… climate change is a perfectly natural phenomenon and this modern warming period actually began about 300 years ago when the little ice age began to come to an end. There is nothing to be afraid of and all they are doing is instilling fear. Most of the scientists who are saying it’s a crisis are on perpetual government grants. I was one of the (Greenpeace) founders… by the mid-80s… we were hijacked by the extreme left who basically took Greenpeace from a science-based organisation to an organisation based on sensationalism, misinformation and fear… you don’t have a plan to feed 8 billion people without fossils fuels or get the food into the cities…” – Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace Professor William Happer, Princeton University, Former Director of Science at the US Department of Energy, is also a strong voice against the myth of man-made global warming. He states: “More CO2 benefits the Earth”. 7. The UN IPCC cherry picks data, uses flawed modelling and scenarios not remotely related to the real world The UN climate crisis predictions are not based on physical evidence, rather they are based on complex computer modelling. One has to decode and analyse the modelling process to ascertain whether or not the models are valid and accurate or whether they have obvious flaws. The vast majority of scientists, economists, politicians and the general public have simply assumed that the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models are accurate. Very few people have the time or skills to analyse these models, not to mention actually dispute them. Nonetheless, there were many senior and highly distinguished scientists that did exactly that – they claimed the UN narrative was incorrect and that there was no climate emergency. Their voices have been drowned out by a vast money-driven political and media establishment of the globalised ‘system’. The vitally important work of some of these renowned scientists is referenced in the above book. “The computer models are making systematic dramatic errors… they are all parametrised… fudged… the models really don’t work” – Patrick J. Michaels, Director, Cato Institute Center for the Study of Science Dr Roger Pielke Jr, University of Colorado, has conducted a detailed scientific review and analysis of the UN IPCC AR6 report[3]. He describes that in relation to climate modelling, the IPCC detached the models from socio-economic plausibility. In creating the models, instead of first completing integrative assessment models (IAMs), the IPCC skipped this essential step and jumped straight to radiative forcing scenarios and thus these scenarios are not based on competed IAMs. This led much of climate modelling down the wrong track. I quote points from Dr Pielke’s analysis as follows: “The four IPCC scenarios came from a large family of models so instead of splitting modelling from socio-economic assumptions the models already had the assumptions faked and baked in to them, because they had to have those assumptions to produce the required radiative forcing (to produce a desired climate ‘crisis scenario’ outcome). In another fateful decision the 4 representative concentration pathways (RCPs) came from 4 different IAMs, which was a huge mistake. These models are completely unrelated to each other, but the impression has been given that they are of a common set, only differing in their radiative forcing, this was a huge mistake. Furthermore, no-one has responsibility for determining whether these scenarios are plausible. The climate community decided which scenario to prioritise and they chose the two most implausible scenarios! There are thousands of climate assumptions, but only 8 to 12 of them are available currently for climate research. The IPCC report even states that “no likelihood is attached to the scenarios in this report”. The likelihood is considered low they admit – This is an incredible admission by the IPCC. These extreme unlikely scenarios dominate the literature and the IPCC report; therefore, the IPCC report is biased. Bottom line is that there is massive confusion. The IPCCs’ Richard Moss warned that RCP 8.5 was not to be used as a reference for the other RCPs, but 5,800 scientific papers worldwide misuse it like that… The whole process is seriously flawed… Nothing close to the real world is represented by the IPCC scenarios. Climate science has a huge problem! The IPCC currently uses RCP 8.5 as the ‘business as usual’ scenario, but RCP 8.5 is wild fantasy land and not remotely related to current reality at all… climate science has a scientific integrity crisis.” – Dr Roger Pielke Jr, University of Colorado 8. Financialization of the entire world economy is now based on a life-killing ‘net-zero’ greenhouse gas emissions strategy. The UN Agenda 2030 plan and the Paris Agreement goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 7% per annum until 2030 is in effect a plan that would seemingly disable the current fossil-fuel-based mechanisms of the industrial economy for the food, energy and goods that enable human life and survival. Yet the narrative is quite hypocritical as the production of green energy infrastructure, and mining of rare earth metals for batteries for electric vehicles, is, and will most likely continue to be, very fossil-fuel intensive. Globalisation resulted in much of humanity becoming largely dependent on the trans-national industrial economy rather than on traditional more self-sufficient local/regional economies. Therefore, one has to ask where is this all going to lead if the plug is truly pulled on fossil fuels? Almost all of us are seemingly locked into, and have become dependent upon, the current economic paradigm of globalisation. A system rigged by debt-money created from nothing; created and controlled by private mega-banks and behind the scenes money-masters; and which can induce boom, bust, bailout scenarios that detrimentally effect the populace. It should be noted that for decades, these same political, government, and corporate powers have rampantly promoted corporate economic globalization and fossil fuel dependency. Whilst, at the same time actively hindering the funding, creation, or government support of, more self-sufficient local communities/regions, and local co-operatives. Most of the world population thus became reliant on the globalized fossil-fuel driven system. I explore this topic in the books Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers and Transcending the Climate Change Deception Toward Real Sustainability Zero carbon emissions, in essence, means pulling the plug on current systems of industrial agriculture, transport, goods production, electricity production, etc. This could have terrible consequences, particularly in locations and countries, that are currently unable to produce much food. In Ireland, the deluded greens in government had planned to close the coal-fired power station Moneypoint, in the name of reducing CO2 emissions. However, as the price of electricity increased and the dawn of so-called ‘green energy’ began to evaporate like the Irish morning mist, the government scrapped this plan in 2022, instead deciding to convert the station to an oil-burning facility. The Irish Times newspaper reported: “With growing concerns over security of the energy supply in the State, the Government is not in a position to decommission Moneypoint as a fuel-burning station in the near future. It was confirmed by the Irish Government in 2022 that Moneypoint will convert to oil generation from 2023.”[4] The so-called ‘green economy’ (for it is not environmentally friendly in reality) and UN Agenda 2030 are resulting in increased energy poverty and decreased energy independence for the masses, while also developing trillions of dollars for the behind-the-scenes mega-banks. “Stop burning coal and wood logs that causes climate change don’t ya know” my deluded neighbour informed me last year, having threw out her wood burning stove and installed solar panels. Then a typical winter storm in Ireland last month left many thousands of people without electricity or heating for almost a week, shivering and wishing for a wood burning stove, while their solar panels produced little electricity in winter. 9. Central bankers are entirely funding / controlling the advancement of the worldwide climate change ‘project’ The decision to drastically reduce CO2, one of the most essential compounds to sustain all life, is no co-incidence. It should be noted that it is the world’s central bankers that are behind this decision and are entirely funding and controlling the advancement of the worldwide project of ‘combatting man-made climate-change’. This project involves an attempt to de-carbonise the activities of the entire world population. In December 2015, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) created the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), which represents $118 trillion of assets globally[5]. In essence this means that the financialization of the entire world economy is based on meeting nonsensical aims such as “net-zero greenhouse gas emissions”. The TCFD includes key people from the world’s mega-banks and asset management companies, including JP Morgan Chase; BlackRock; Barclays Bank; HSBC; China’s ICBC bank; Tata Steel, ENI oil, Dow Chemical, and more. The fact that the world’s largest banks and asset management corporations, including BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, the UN, the World Bank, the Bank of England and other central banks of the BIS, have all linked to push a vague, mathematically nonsensical ‘green’ economy, is no coincidence. There is another agenda at play that has nothing to do with environmentalism. When the world largest banks, corporations, and institutions, all align to push a climate change agenda that has zero evidence, one can see there is another major agenda going on behind the scenes. This agenda tries to convince the common people of the world to make huge sacrifices under the emotive guise of “saving our planet.”. While all the time the corporations and banks make vast profits, and political institutions implement worldwide technocratic control systems under the banner of combatting, and adapting to, so-called man-made climate change. “The links between the world’s largest financial groups, central banks and global corporations to the current push for a radical climate strategy to abandon the fossil fuel economy in favor of a vague, unexplained Green economy, it seems, is less about genuine concern to make our planet a clean and healthy environment to live. Rather it is an agenda, intimately tied to the UN Agenda 2030 for “sustainable” economy, and to developing literally trillions of dollars in new wealth for the global banks and financial giants who constitute the real powers that be… “ – F. William Engdahl, strategic risk consultant and lecturer Back in 2010, the head of Working Group 3 of the UN IPCC, Dr Otmar Edenhofer, told an interviewer, “…one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy. One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore.” To better perceive what is ‘behind the curtain’ of the climate hoax and the UN/WEF agenda it also helps to examine what has happened in the decades beforehand. It is important to perceive the implications of the worldwide fractional-reserve debt-money banking scam and the subtle system of debt-slavery that has existed for decades. If you look at the World Bank website you will see that virtually every nation on Earth is in vast debt. In debt to who you may ask? The answer is to privately owned mega-banks. See also the book Demonic Economics and the Tricks of the Bankers. For many decades the so-called banking and corporate elites have had full control of the source of money creation and its allocation, via the debt-money system, and have therefore, by default, been able to fund, and increasingly control and manipulate the entire world spectrum of industry, media, government, education, ideological supremacy and war to their own design, agenda and benefit. Mayer Amschel Rothschild (banker) is widely reported to have said: “Give me control of a nation’s money supply and I care not who makes its laws.” 10. Central bankers hijacked the real environmental movement in 1992 creating the fake climate change agenda Psychopaths can utilise any ideology and, change it from within to something that may eventually be entirely different to its original purpose. Meanwhile, the original followers and advocates continue to pursue what they believe is the original ideology, but gradually become mere pawns in the agenda of a self-serving elite. Unfortunately, over the past decades, this is exactly what has happened in the environmental movement. Whistleblower George Hunt served as an official host at a key environmental meeting in Denver, Colorado in 1987, and states that David Rockefeller; Baron Edmund De Rothschild; US Secretary of State Baker; Maurice Strong, a UN official and an employee of the Rockefeller and Rothschild trusts; EPA administrator William Ruccleshaus; UN Secretary General in Geneva MacNeill, along with World Bank and IMF officials were at this meeting. Hunt was surprised to see all these rich elite bankers at the meeting and questioned what they were doing there at an environmental congress. In a video recording available here Hunt later provided important evidence from the documents of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 3-14 June 1992. This conference was the well-known UN ’92 Earth Summit and was run by UNCED. According to Hunt, via the Earth summit, the UN was setting a net, an agenda, to place the power over the Earth and its peoples into their own hands. The world private banking cartel are the same ultra-rich banking families that had been instrumental in the setting up of the World Bank, the UN, and other international institutions, after WW2. Their political cohorts included Stalin (the leader of a brutal communist regime in the USSR that committed genocide of millions of people), UK Prime minister Churchill, and US President Roosevelt. Hunt refers to these banking families and their financial and international institutional networks as: “The same world order that tricked third world countries to borrow funds and rack up enormous debts… and purposely creating war and debt to bring societies into their control. The world order crowd are not a nice group of people…”– George Hunt, Whistleblower speaking about the UN Earth summit of 1992 As a consequence of the UN Earth Summit, it appears the genuine environment movement that actually cared about real pollution to land, air and water, was politically hi-jacked by powerful political and financial interests with a different agenda. Maurice Strong, a UN official and an employee of the Rockefeller and Rothschild trusts, had convened the first UNCED congress in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1972. Then, 20 years later he was the convenor and secretary general of UNCED. Hunt also provided video evidence from the Fourth UNCED World Congress meeting in 1987 of an international investment banker, stating that: “I suggest therefore that this be sold not through a democratic process that would take too long and require far too much funds to educate the cannon-fodder, unfortunately, which populates the Earth. We have to take almost an elitist program…” Thus, the decrees leading to the 1992 UN Earth summit were dictated without debate or opportunity for dissent and would supersede national laws. According to Hunt, the decrees were dictated into existence by the banker Edmund de Rothschild, who got these major decrees into the ’92 UN resolutions without debate or challenge. Hunt asserts that he was denied the opportunity to openly challenge Rothschild’s remarks by the meeting Chairman; and that the Rothschild bank of Geneva is the nucleus of the World Conservation bank and the wealthy elite are integrated into the bank via the Rothschilds private offering of shares. 11. Despite the deceptive and fake environmental facade, it has adopted, the vast institutional entity of the UN has fully endorsed environmentally destructive industrial globalisation for the past 70 years. The UN climate change, sustainable development and green economy policies over the past 30 years are little more than worldwide marketing tricks that have tragically brainwashed two generations of young people who do not understand what the UN actually is, and who is it is really designed to serve. This current globalised system involves the promotion of beliefs and fake science that claim to be unchallengeable truths, but are, in fact, ideologies in which evidence is manipulated, twisted, and distorted to prove the ‘governing idea’, and thus promote its worldwide dissemination. They start with the conclusion they want and then wrench and manipulate what scant evidence they can to fit that conclusion. Man-made climate change due to anthropogenic carbon emission is a major example of this. Institutions, including the UN, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and the World Health Organisation (WHO), are privately-motivated unelected unaccountable organisations controlled by the source of debt-money creation, i.e., the world private-banking cartel; and are just clever marketing tools and political mechanisms for implementing and maintaining a corrupt worldwide system, under the clever guise of ‘fixing the problems of the world’. These powerful special interests have been promoting certain ‘ideologies’ for decades to advance their corporate and political aims. The word “sustainable” was hijacked decades ago, and it is now deceptively used to advance the agendas of globalist mega-corporate interests who couldn’t care less about the environment. The aim is to catapult humanity into the arms of UN Agenda 2030 and the WEF ‘reset’ plan, which are clever marketing plans entirely designed by the so-called elite mega-corporate interests of the WEF Davos group. 12. Furthermore, the current green energy/renewable technologies being promoted by the UN and WEF, are not a viable solution for the world’s energy supply. Although these technologies have some limited viability in certain locations and scenarios, the fact remains that the Energy Returned on Energy Invested is much too low – in essence the entire process is mathematically flawed. This is evidenced by the work of scientists, including Professor David MacKay (1967 – 2016), former Regius Professor of Engineering at Cambridge University, and former Chief Scientific Advisor at the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change. In summary, CO2 reduction is the main focus of the UN-promoted climate-change-hysteria that has been rampant among the world’s population. However, the proclaimed climate crisis exists in computer models only. The cult of ‘manmade climate change’ is a media and UN politically-promoted ‘ideology’, that is used for a wider political and corporate agenda. Manmade climate change is not based in fact, and has hijacked real environmental concerns. Due to incessant UN, government, and corporate-promoted climate change propaganda, many people are, thus, in a media-induced state of confusion, and, thus, blindly assume their pre-determined role in society under this ‘dictatorship of words’ without even being aware of it. The unpalatable reality is that people’s access to energy and resources is being intentionally reduced via bogus climate change policies, inflation, ongoing geo-political theatre and intentionally instigated war. We cannot understand how to create a truly resilient society unless we correctly perceive the current society we live in and how it came to exist. Unless we recognize the untruths of the current paradigm, even if it is not ‘politically correct’ to do so, then we will not be able to make the correct adjustments to our communities and local/regional networks, or create a truly resilient thriving society. In this spirit of truth, new networks are emerging worldwide. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

US-based Bitcoin ETFs lead record $2.9 billion outflow as global crypto products face pressure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Last week, the crypto market witnessed its most significant weekly sell-off, with outflows hitting a record $2.9 billion, according to CoinShares‘ latest weekly report. This marked the third consecutive week of capital exiting digital asset investment products, bringing total outflows to $3.8 billion. CoinShares’ Head of Research, James Butterfill, pointed out multiple reasons for the downturn. According to him, the recent security breach at Bybit, alongside a more assertive stance from the US Federal Reserve, contributed to weakened investor confidence that spurred capital withdrawals. Butterfill also noted that investors took profits following a 19-week inflow streak of $29 billion. Investors pulled $2.87 billion from US-based funds, dealing a significant blow to major spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers. CoinShares reported that BlackRock recorded $1.3 billion in withdrawals, while Fidelity lost over $569 million. Grayscale also faced steep exits, with $421 million leaving its funds. Other firms, including Bitwise and 21Shares, saw combined outflows surpassing $130 million. Outside the US, Switzerland and Canada saw net outflows of $73 million and $16.9 million, respectively. Germany, however, bucked the trend, attracting $55.3 million as investors maintained a bullish outlook. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s decline to a three-month low below $80,000 triggered a modest rise in short Bitcoin product inflows, which reached $2.3 million. Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization, also faced a sharp sell-off, registering record weekly outflows of $300 million. Investment products in other digital assets, such as TON and Solana, also struggled, shedding $22.6 million and $7.4 million, respectively. Additionally, blockchain equities ETPs didn’t escape the negative sentiment, seeing $25.3 million outflows. However, despite the widespread sell-off, some assets attracted fresh capital. Sui led inflow, securing $15.5 million. XRP followed with a $5 million inflow, fueled by the continued speculation over a potential US spot XRP ETF and the belief that the digital asset is well-positioned for regulatory clarity under the Donald Trump administration.

The bitcoin price shot toward $90,000 per bitcoin following Trump’s post, despite not initially being named as part of the planned U.S. crypto reserve.

[+] bitcoin, Ripple's XRP, solana and cardano sharply higher. “A U.S. crypto reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration, which is why my executive order on digital assets directed the presidential working group to move forward on a crypto strategic reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA," Trump posted to his Truth Social account, referring to Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano and without mentioning bitcoin. “I will make sure the U.S. is the crypto capital of the world. We are making America great again.” In a follow up post, Trump added: “Obviously, bitcoin and ethereum, other valuable cryptocurrencies, will be the heart of the reserve. I also love bitcoin and ethereum.” 03/03 update: Bitcoin and crypto trader attention has now turned to the upcoming White House crypto summit, set for this coming Friday, in which influential crypto executives, founders and investors will meet with representatives of the president’s working group on digital assets. “The announcement comes ahead of this Friday’s crypto summit at the White House. The timing means expectations going into Friday will be for something concrete,” Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered Bank’s head of crypto research, said in emailed comments. A regulatory road map is expected, as well as more details on the crypto strategic reserve, with many analysts questioning how Donald Trump’s proposed crypto strategic reserve will work. “Yesterday’s proposal lacks details on size, timing, and whether it will be managed by the Federal Reserve or another new or existing entity,” Andrew O’Neill, digital assets managing director at S&P Global Ratings, said in emailed comments. “The Jan 23rd executive order only initiates the exploration of a digital asset reserve, with recommendations to follow.” David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar, weighed in on criticism of the crypto reserve coming from Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale who had complained of tax dollars being used to fund "crypto bro schemes," posting: “Nobody announced a tax or a spending program. Maybe you should wait to find out what’s actually being proposed," sparking speculation the U.S. strategic crypto reserve might involve holding seized assets rather than the U.S. buying more crypto to stock it. "More to come at the summit," Sacks added. “White House crypto czar David Sacks will shed more light on what is coming at the crypto summit set to take place on Friday,” Petr Kozyakov, chief executive of crypto payment infrastructure platform Mercuryo, said via email. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market—including Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano—all surged following Trump’s election victory in November, climbing as traders bet he would follow through on his campaign promises to roll back Biden-era regulatory crackdowns on crypto markets and companies. “The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government’s engagement with the crypto industry,” Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer 21Shares, said in emailed comments. In December, Trump confirmed he plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve. "We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead," Trump told CNBC. "Yes, I think so," Trump said in response to a question about whether the U.S. will create a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its oil reserve. In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price rose sharply following Donald Trump's post, announcing he planned to create a ... [+] crypto reserve that includes Ripple's XRP, solana and cardano. Alongside plans to create a bitcoin reserve, Trump and his family—led by Trump’s sons Don Jr and Eric—have been expanding their businesses into the world of bitcoin, crypto and blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi). In January, Trump and his wife Melania launched twin memecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that’s traded on community interest, which both surged before crashing back. Both memecoins are now trading down more than 80% from their all-time highs. The Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform that is expected to facilitate users earning yield through stablecoins and allow them to borrow bitcoin and crypto, also began buying up various cryptocurrencies, including the ethereum-based wrapped bitcoin. Meanwhile, Trump’s social media company Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which runs the Truth Social platform and has recently announced its expanding into the world of crypto and finance, has taken steps toward launching a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)—putting on course to compete with the likes of Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity.

Title: Israel Takes Steps Toward Resuming War and Left-Wing Bureaucrats Hijack Georgia's Multibillion-Dollar Medicaid Contract

Last week, we reported that Israel planned to resume the war in Gaza with a wave of airstrikes and a reduction of humanitarian aid to the strip. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began putting those plans into motion on Sunday, announcing that he had halted the entry of any "goods and supplies into Gaza." Netanyahu, the Free Beacon's Andrew Tobin reports from Tel Aviv, "said the decision was a response to Hamas’s rejection of a proposal by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to extend the phase one hostage-ceasefire deal that expired a day earlier." Under the proposal, which Israel had agreed to, Israel and Hamas would take another 50 days to negotiate the ceasefire’s second phase. Hamas would release half of the remaining Israeli hostages on day one and the remainder on the final day. If Hamas continues to reject the proposal, Netanyahu said, "there will be additional consequences." "The blockade of Gaza is one of a series of escalatory steps that Israel, backed by President Donald Trump, is prepared to take in order to end Hamas's control of Gaza," writes Tobin. "Israel expects it will ultimately have to take full military control of Gaza and is developing plans to do so starting in several weeks." "Israel’s Channel 12 reported on Saturday that Southern Command is on high alert and preparing for a return to fighting on short notice. In recent days, Israeli troops have been training to retake the strategically important Netzarim Corridor and other areas of Gaza from which the military withdrew during the ceasefire and for the possible relocation of the civilian population from the north of the strip to humanitarian zones in the south, according to the report." READ MORE: Israel Cuts All Aid To Gaza in Step Toward Resumption of Full-Scale War When Georgia's community health department solicited bids for the state's blockbuster Medicaid contract in 2015, it asked insurers basic questions about dental care access and congestive heart failure. Things changed last year when the department's senior staffers hijacked the bidding process to insert questions related to transgender children. That's according to internal documents reviewed by our Andrew Kerr. They show that the bidding application for the multibillion-dollar contract initially asked insurers "about a hypothetical 14-year-old white female with anorexia and depression who shares a bedroom with her younger sister." But career staffers "swapped the biological female for a transgender person"—and subsequently dinged bidders who provided answers that strayed from liberal orthodoxy on the issue. The state scored applications out of 1,000 possible points, and the difference between winning and losing came down to less than 10 points. The transgender question was worth 10 points. The application also included a DEI question worth 15. "The staffers' decision to insert that question—and reward companies that regurgitated left-wing positions on transgender care—reflects a significant disconnect between Kemp's policy preferences and the career staffers tasked with carrying them out," writes Kerr. "Kemp signed a law banning gender surgeries and hormone therapies for children in 2023. One year earlier, he signed a law that allowed the Georgia High School Association to bar biological men from competing in women's sports." READ MORE: How Left-Wing Bureaucrats Hijacked the Bidding Process for Georgia's Multibillion-Dollar Medicaid Contract North of the Beltway, in Delaware, state Democrats passed a 2021 law forcing 40 percent of power production to come from green energy by 2035. As a result, the state's main utility company, Delmarva, must import large amounts of electricity produced by wind and solar, purchase renewable energy credits from other states, or face fines. So far, it's struggled to fill the first two buckets to the state's satisfaction—and paid $26 million in fines to stay in compliance. In the meantime, electric bills are skyrocketing, with some residents facing a 350 percent spike in recent months. Those increases, to be sure, come amid a period of extremely low temperatures. But the green energy side of the equation is raising questions: State senate minority leader Gerald Hocker said a "meeting with stakeholders in the energy sector" made it clear "that Delaware's green energy mandates … are a significant factor in driving up costs." Delaware's green push comes in spite of the state's unique reliance on fossil fuels. Green energy sources generate just 6 percent of Delaware's total electricity output, while natural gas generates 87 percent. Nationwide, those numbers are 21 percent and 43 percent, respectively. At the same time, most of Delaware's electricity comes from out of state, a dynamic "that has become more acute as it has moved to stop building gas power plants and shut down existing fossil fuel power generation," our Thomas Catenacci reports. "The situation—which has emerged as a key political issue, resulted in packed town halls where angry citizens have voiced concerns and has led to the creation of a petition against Delmarva and a local Facebook group named 'Delmarva Power Victims' with more than 14,400 members—may force lawmakers to reckon with the state's far-left energy policies."

Title: Podcast: S4Capital’s Martin Sorrell on AI and the enterprise
URL: https://www.computerweekly.com/podcast/Podcast-Sir-Martin-Sorrell-on-AI-and-the-enterprise
Time Published: 2025-03-03T10:36:00Z

Coloures-pic - Fotolia In this podcast, we look at artificial intelligence (AI), its benefits and what it can bring to the enterprise, with Martin Sorrell. Sir Martin – founder of what became the world’s largest advertising company, WPP – is now chairman of the board of S4Capital, which aims at digitally native delivery of services. He talks about the use cases in advertising and marketing, limited currently, but where activities like planning and buying media will likely become automated by AI and work algorithmically. Sir Martin also talks about how AI can bring a huge leap in productivity across all sectors and why enterprises need to take advantage of that by integrating the work of the chief information officer (CIO) and chief marketing officer (CMO) and bring data to the fore in their work. Well, significantly, I guess. I mean, there’s a caveat with that in that the actual use cases are few and far between. So, when you work with the leaders in the AI industry, like an Nvidia or whoever, they are very focused on what are the use cases. And when you look at use cases, I would say we've got a lot of tests going on, audits, workshops going on. But actually the number of clients who are willing, for whatever reason, to implement at scale are relatively limited. But, with that as a sort of health warning, if that’s the right way of putting it, basically we see five things happening in our industry. The first is around visualisation and copywriting. • Download this podcast • So, that’s producing ads. It takes less time. And that is a two-edged sword because our business, our industry, the industry is a trillion dollars. Clients spend about a trillion dollars on advertising, about $700bn in digital and about $300bn in traditional. Digital is growing, probably at around 10% or 15% a year, and growing its share. So, when we started S4 six years ago, digital was probably about 50% of the market – it’s now 70%. And traditional is declining – probably about 0% to 5% a year if you have live sport. And, if you don’t have live sport, you’re probably down 5%, 10% or 15%. And that continues to be the dynamic in the industry. So, really there are two industries. But with that as background, a lot of that revenue is generated by agencies, by time. And, if you’re compressing the amount of time for making ads, as you are with copywriting and visualisation, what took you weeks or days is now taking you hours or minutes. The amount of time is reduced, and procurement departments, the clients – quite rightly – say, it takes you less time, it should cost you less. So I would say there’s compression. There will be fewer copywriters and fewer art directors as a result. So, that’s one area. The second area, which I think is really interesting from a growth point of view, is personalisation at scale. So, we work for a Netflix, or an Amazon Prime, or Disney Plus or Univision, and we can produce, if we’re launching Squid Game or Narcos for Netflix, historically we might produce about a million and a half assets, at least in theory. We’re now producing multiples of that using AI and personalisation at scale and using first-party data and signals from the platforms. So, that’s a huge area of opportunity. The price per asset is falling, but the number of assets used is rising at such a rate that there will be more employment for people in that area. So, that’s the second area. The third area is media planning and buying. Unfortunately, for the holding companies that dominate the media planning and buying space – probably there are six of them of scale, which probably have about 60% between them of the market in terms of planning and buying – they employ about 200,000 people [but] there won’t be 200,000 people in two or three years’ time. Unfortunately, also, the processes are very manual. If you compare it to the investment industry, to a BlackRock or a Blackstone, which manage more than one trillion each in terms of funds under management, they don’t manage those investments and the distribution between property or equities, or private equity, or gold, or bitcoin, real estate, or whatever it is, they don’t manage it manually or semi-manually, they manage it algorithmically. And the same thing is going to happen with media planning and buying. And, you see that already with the platforms like Google and Meta – Google had with Pmax, Performance Max, and Meta with Advantage Plus. Actually, it was really interesting. The CFO [chief financial officer] of Meta said in the fourth quarter earnings for last year, or this year, but commenting on last year, Meta’s total ad revenues are about 160 billion versus Google’s 260 billion and Amazon’s 61/60 billion and TikTok’s 40 billion outside mainland China. So, those four platforms are half of total ad spending – 500 billion between them – and about 70% of digital. But the CFO of Meta said Advantage Plus accounted for about 17 or 18 billion of the 160 billion. So really 10% of Meta’s media planning and buying is being done on a program which basically delivers algorithmic answers to small and medium-sized businesses, just like Performance Max does at Google, although we don’t have the data. So, really interesting what’s happening on media planning and buying. So, you won’t depend on a 25-year-old media planner and buyer in the future for input and output. That buyer will have a much more sophisticated output coming from algorithmically analysed planning and buying decisions. So, that’s the third area. The fourth area is general efficiency. I’ll give you an example of that. We have a joint venture with Nvidia and AWS [Amazon Web Services] and Adobe around outside broadcasting. If you’re doing an outside broadcast, you need a truck for that in conventional ways. And that truck will cost you 10 million [dollars], you’d amortise it over five years at two million [dollars] a year. We can provide a cloud-based solution with Nvidia, AWS and Adobe for $100,000 or $200,000. I referred before to the traditional media companies being under heavy pressure, so you can see that they would leap at the opportunity of reducing their costs and becoming more efficient. It’s a good example of agency and client efficiency. And the fifth area, the last one, is democratisation of knowledge. I don’t think there’s any accident that [Nvidia CEO] Jensen Huang has 51 direct reports. If Computer Weekly went to McKinsey and said, ‘What’s the ideal organisational span or spread for a CEO?’, you would say 12 or 13. Jensen manages it apparently with 51 direct reports or thereabouts. He also doesn’t have as many one-to-one meetings. What he tends to have is ... KPIs [key performance indicators] for his direct reports and then monitors their progress. So, what you’re getting is the flattening of organisations and AI reducing the silos and the politics that go on inside big companies, and making them much more efficient and effective, and simplifying processes and bringing people together in much more effective ways. So, those are the five areas – just to sum up: visualisation and copywriting, personalisation at scale, media planning and buying, general efficiency and democratisation of knowledge. The answer is it will affect ... sorry, not ‘will affect’; it is affecting everything. Probably, to be fair, affecting things like manufacturing more so than mine because, with the exception probably of General Motors – that’s the biggest example that we’ve come across. I mean, we have Google Hatch, we have Forever 21 with Meta, we have some work with SC Johnson and others. But with those exceptions, I think the one case study in our industry where a company has literally turned itself, its marketing model on its head and it’s doing that for competitive reasons. We’re seeing in the auto industry and the financial services industry the rise of lower-cost, lower-price competitors. So, in the case of the auto industry, Chinese EVs [electric vehicles] and autonomous vehicles; in the case of financial services, fintech companies. Now, these new competitors can produce products or services at lower costs and therefore the traditional manufacturers or the traditional financial services companies have to make their model much more efficient. So, the answer is it affects other verticals deeply, and probably more fundamentally so far. I think it will fundamentally affect advertising and marketing in the future, but I think it’s affecting things like manufacturing and distribution far more quickly. There are three pieces of advice we – CMOs or CIOs – would focus on, because when you talk about AI, it’s really uniting several functions. It’s uniting marketing, it’s uniting technology and IT. I often think there should be conferences with CMOs and CIOs – those are the two. I remember John Chambers used to run at Cisco every two years a conference for CEOs and CIOs, and I think that from an AI point of view, it’s really important to get the CMO and the CIO together because their worlds are colliding, for want of a better word, but I think there are three areas. Agility is key. Everybody talks about agility, but delivering it is much more difficult, so that’s one thing. I would say taking back control after the great financial crisis in 2008, people tend to outsource. You know, finance and procurement said outsource, get the headcount out of the company. So a lot of functions were delegated outside, and that may sound strange coming from somebody in the agency business, but that may be misdirection and what you have to do is to exercise more control. And the third and final point is the importance of first-party data, which is very much more focused. So, with deprecation of third-party cookies by Google – not totally, but directionally. [And] with the change in the IDFA rules with Apple moving from individual IP addresses to cohorts, to groups. The use of first-party data – that is, consumer consented data which can be used freely, or as freely as possible – combined with the signals from the platforms, from the three western ones I mentioned before, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and then in the east, Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance (or TikTok); those are the three, the six games in town really in terms of scale, using the signals from those platforms, plus the first-party data critical. I would say those are the skills, organisational skills – agility, as I say, everybody talks about it, but it’s very difficult to deliver it, particularly in a volatile, you know, in a Trump 2.0 world, you have to be very adaptable and very agile. So, that’s one area, take back control. You’re going to have to control the data, integrate the data. Very few clients have first-party data at scale in a fully integrated way. And then finally, first-party data.

Title: How hedge funds became an industry of haves and have-nots — and what it means for the $4.5 trillion sector

Time Published: 2025-03-03T10:02:02Z

The four biggest multistrategy firms' dominance in the industry has made it harder for under-the-radar names to compete. For years, it was common knowledge that smaller hedge funds outperformed larger peers. Investors focused on finding up-and-coming managers before they made it big and raised billions. Big-name institutions like Blackstone and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas seeded new funds and sought out emerging managers. While there was safety and, typically, capacity in the biggest funds, there was alpha in unknown names. This has all changed with the yearslong industry takeover by the biggest multistrategy firms. The big four — Millennium, Citadel, Point72, and Balyasny — have in recent years outperformed peers despite their ballooning sizes, dominated the fundraising environment even though they're mostly closed to new money, and turned the talent market on its head with eye-popping offers for investors. For the first time, scale benefits both the manager and the LP, and the result is four managers with overwhelming clout. Business Insider talked to more than a dozen fund founders, allocators, and industry experts, such as top prime brokers and recruiters, to understand how smaller platforms plan to survive the unprecedented concentration of capital and talent and where allocators are turning in this new reality. Goldman Sachs' prime brokerage desk, using regulatory filings, estimated in July that 53 multistrategy firms employed a total of 18,600 people. More than 71% of them worked for one of the big four, leaving the 49 other funds with a combined head count smaller than Millennium's. Fundraising — which came easy for big and small platforms alike when interest rates were lower three years ago — is now a slog for many smaller multistrategy funds, several executives told Business Insider. The shift has cramped some firms' expansion plans that commenced during the boom times following the pandemic and put pressure on a business model that thrives with scale. Meanwhile, Point72 and Citadel have returned capital to investors, and Millennium can command a five-year lockup period for new money, a term length previously unheard of in the hedge fund world. One allocator told BI that Point72, the $39 billion firm run by the billionaire New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, had a $9 billion waitlist — which is more capital than firms like Eisler and Walleye manage. A different allocator compared the concentration of capital in the four largest firms to passive investing, in which all the assets flow to Vanguard, BlackRock, or State Street. "For people who can't get into the top guys, they're saying they'll just invest in some other structure or asset class instead," this person said, pointing to private credit as a landing spot for some of this capital. The big four platforms have grown to a point where smaller rivals aren't battling another hedge fund — they're fighting with institutions. "They're becoming more and more like investment banks to an extent," said one platform founder with less than $10 billion in total assets. Others in the industry likened Citadel in particular to pre-IPO Goldman Sachs — a comparison Ken Griffin would most likely welcome, given his laudatory comments about the firm. A hypothetical $5 billion multistrategy manager has a much different existence than even the $21 billion firm Balyasny. One smaller platform executive hoping to grow said that, even as Citadel and Point72 returned capital to LPs, "it was a bitch last year raising money." A February report from JPMorgan's capital advisory team said hedge funds with assets between $500 million and $5 billion had net outflows of $21.5 billion in the past two years, while firms with assets greater than $5 billion hauled in $12.2 billion in net new money. Goldman Sachs' July report noted that allocators were starting to balk at the high costs required to run multistrategy firms. The trickle-down effect is that firms such as ExodusPoint have accepted a cash hurdle — where performance fees accrue only when returns surpass that of a Treasury bond — to appease antsy LPs. Despite the buzz around the launch of Jain Global, the firm raised billions less than it was expected to pull in. Several smaller-platform executives said LPs were also worried about a platform unwind and what a significant market event could do to these firms, given that they operate with so much leverage. With more capital in multistrategy funds than ever before, some market watchers have been sounding the alarm about the knock-on effects of this investing style. These funds use borrowed money to juice their bets, meaning any significant movement against their position can cause losses to accumulate quickly. The risk-management systems of these platforms will often force their investors to shed positions quickly in the face of mounting losses, which can exacerbate a stock's decline. It's a market risk that Viking Global's chief investment officer, Justin Walsh, said he monitors closely and that the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, raised concerns about last month. But now that scale has become necessary for those competing directly with the four biggest firms, any slowdown in growth can be fatal, and suddenly tepid allocators could cause a domino effect, a former hedge fund allocator said. "Without capital, you can't get a diversity of return streams," they said. "Without a diversity of return streams, the model doesn't really make sense." Those that can't beat the biggest players at their own game need to offer something different. "If you're going to compete with Citadel and Millennium in their own backyard, you're already dead," one person who's building out their multistrategy offering told BI. They added, "Do you have a right to exist — or are you on borrowed time because you raised money when all multistrats could raise money?" Matthew Barrett, the head of manager research at Kepler Partners, who works with allocators searching for funds, said smaller platforms must offer a "derivative" of the main models the big four have perfected. For Dymon Asia, a $3 billion multistrategy fund with offices in Asia and the Middle East, the differentiator is geography. At SummitTX, Crestline Investors' recently rebranded multistrategy fund, "what resonates is the alignment of the whole package," the firm's chief investment officer, Caroline Cooley, said. This includes fees, liquidity, transparency of positioning, and risk so that institutional investors have a more personalized setup. Other midsize shops focus on investment opportunities that are more niche and wouldn't move the needle at the biggest platforms. "They need PMs to run $2 billion to $4 billion and manage seven to nine people," said Rich Schimel, who cofounded the $3 billion firm Cinctive Capital and once ran a stock-picking unit at Citadel. "There are not a lot of people out there who can do that. Not efficiently, at least." "It's a whole different model than ours," he said. At his firm, he said, the focus is partially on "low-hanging fruit" in mid-cap stocks that are too small for the biggest funds, for example. The Holy Grail, though, might be finding a way to offer multistrategy returns at a fraction of the price. The pass-through fee structures nearly everyone has adopted to keep up in the war for talent have LPs on the hook for billions in employee compensation. Several allocators said a firm able to recreate multistrategy returns without relying on dozens of human portfolio managers would have plenty of backers. While Doug Haynes' Norias Research never ended up launching, reportedly because of an inability to raise sufficient capital, hedge fund LPs said his proposed firm's algorithm-driven and less-people-intensive structure made sense. And gross returns from a manager like this could be muted compared with high-head-count peers and still come out on top. "If a full pass-through fee is 10%," Barrett said, "you're already running at a significant head start." Consolidation in top-heavy industries snowballs, and the multistrategy space is not immune. While the Millennium-Schonfeld tie-up was called off in 2023, the big four platforms have warped the industry by bringing independent external funds in-house and spinning off new firms backed by the mother ship. While there's optimism around hedge funds generally, a different Goldman report from last summer said that assets in the multistrategy industry had tapered off and that outflows outpaced performance gains through the first half of 2024. The talent pool can barely handle the big four, much less additional platforms hoping to replicate their models. "There is definitely a difference between A talent and B talent, and you see it across different platforms," said Justin Young, the director of investments at Multilateral Endowment Management Company, an allocator that manages assets for Oklahoma State University's endowment and other institutions. Even those on the smaller end of the spectrum acknowledge there will probably be fewer platforms going forward. "Are there too many? There could be," one founder with under $10 billion in assets said. "There could be some consolidation." Jump to

Title: AIL wrap: Clontarf produce another great escape

Clontarf have certainly mastered the art of Houdini-like escapes this season. The Energia All-Ireland League Division 1A leaders only took the lead in Terenure for the first time with the last kick of the game, which is the fifth occasion in this campaign they’ve won a match with the final play. Terenure dominated the first hour and led through Jordan Coughlan’s seventh try of the season against his former club and their Kerry-born former Glenstal and Trinity full-back Aran Egan, who converted his own try from the touchline. Leading 12-0, Terenure were held up over the line, by which point Clontarf hadn’t fired a shot. But a procession of penalties against Terenure and a failure to exit effectively led to Clontarf going to the corner several times. Their trademark power plays led to tries by hooker Dylan Donnellan (his tenth of the season), Conor Kelly and replacement hooker Barry Gray, which was awarded by the touch judge seven minutes into overtime, after a contentious penalty and yellow card against Terenure captain Luke Clohessy. Having missed his previous two, up stepped Kelly, the Division’s leading scorer, to land a difficult conversion to take his seasonal tally to 164. Terenure’s third annual charity match in aid of Childline by ISPCC and the Children’s Health Foundation raised in excess of €27,000. With a fortnight’s break before the three-game run-in, Clontarf lead the way on 56 points, with St Mary’s (563) second after they ran in ten tries in a 64-22 win away to relegation-bound Garryowen. Mark Fogarty’s hat-trick took his tally to 14. Terenure did move above Constitution on points difference on 48 points but Lansdowne, the division’s in-form team, moved to within two points of the play-offs thanks to a 28-12, bonus point win at Temple Hill before hosting Terenure next time out. Lansdowne’s aggressive defence disrupted Con and they also stole four lineouts in their own 22. Barry Fitzpatrick scored in the second minute and after Peter Sullivan finished of a good move, Con centre Sean French scored his seventh of the season. But Rob Hedderman scored against his former club before Sullivan intercepted James Taylor’s pass early in the second half to render George Good’s late try academic. Ballynahinch are alongside Lansdowne on 46 points after a 28-14 bonus point win at home to Young Munster featuring a brace of tries by Ulster winger Zac Ward. UCD’s 29-21 win over City of Armagh, Bobby Sheehan scoring his tenth of the season and one of the students’ five tries, moved them to within two points of the Ulster side in their battle to avoid a relegation play-off. Old Belvedere sealed their return to the top-flight with a 34-22 win over second-placed Nenagh Ormond at Ollie Campbell Park, their 12th in a row. Instonians took another step towards a fourth successive promotion with a 19-12 win at Navan, while Cashel (31-13 at Ballymena), Barnhall (34-33 at Greystones and Corinthians (22-17 at Greystones) maintained their pursuit of the play-offs.

[+] bitcoin, Ripple's XRP, solana and cardano sharply higher. “A U.S. crypto reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration, which is why my executive order on digital assets directed the presidential working group to move forward on a crypto strategic reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA," Trump posted to his Truth Social account, referring to Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano and without mentioning bitcoin. “I will make sure the U.S. is the crypto capital of the world. We are making America great again.” In a follow up post, Trump added: “Obviously, bitcoin and ethereum, other valuable cryptocurrencies, will be the heart of the reserve. I also love bitcoin and ethereum.” 03/03 update: Bitcoin and crypto trader attention has now turned to the upcoming White House crypto summit, set for this coming Friday, in which influential crypto executives, founders and investors will meet with representatives of the president’s working group on digital assets. “The announcement comes ahead of this Friday’s crypto summit at the White House. The timing means expectations going into Friday will be for something concrete,” Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered Bank’s head of crypto research, said in emailed comments. A regulatory road map is expected, as well as more details on the crypto strategic reserve, with many analysts questioning how Donald Trump’s proposed crypto strategic reserve will work. “Yesterday’s proposal lacks details on size, timing, and whether it will be managed by the Federal Reserve or another new or existing entity,” Andrew O’Neill, digital assets managing director at S&P Global Ratings, said in emailed comments. “The Jan 23rd executive order only initiates the exploration of a digital asset reserve, with recommendations to follow.” David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar, weighed in on criticism of the crypto reserve coming from Palantir cofounder Joe Lonsdale who had complained of tax dollars being used to fund "crypto bro schemes," posting: “Nobody announced a tax or a spending program. Maybe you should wait to find out what’s actually being proposed," sparking speculation the U.S. strategic crypto reserve might involve holding seized assets rather than the U.S. buying more crypto to stock it. "More to come at the summit," Sacks added. “White House crypto czar David Sacks will shed more light on what is coming at the crypto summit set to take place on Friday,” Petr Kozyakov, chief executive of crypto payment infrastructure platform Mercuryo, said via email. The bitcoin price and wider crypto market—including Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano—all surged following Trump’s election victory in November, climbing as traders bet he would follow through on his campaign promises to roll back Biden-era regulatory crackdowns on crypto markets and companies. “The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government’s engagement with the crypto industry,” Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer 21Shares, said in emailed comments. In December, Trump confirmed he plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve. "We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead," Trump told CNBC. "Yes, I think so," Trump said in response to a question about whether the U.S. will create a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its oil reserve. In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price rose sharply following Donald Trump's post, announcing he planned to create a ...

Alongside plans to create a bitcoin reserve, Trump and his family—led by Trump’s sons Don Jr and Eric—have been expanding their businesses into the world of bitcoin, crypto and blockchain-based decentralized finance (DeFi). In January, Trump and his wife Melania launched twin memecoins, a form of cryptocurrency that’s traded on community interest, which both surged before crashing back. Both memecoins are now trading down more than 80% from their all-time highs. The Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform that is expected to facilitate users earning yield through stablecoins and allow them to borrow bitcoin and crypto, also began buying up various cryptocurrencies, including the ethereum-based wrapped bitcoin. Meanwhile, Trump’s social media company Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), which runs the Truth Social platform and has recently announced its expanding into the world of crypto and finance, has taken steps toward launching a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)—putting on course to compete with the likes of Wall Street giants BlackRock and Fidelity.

Title: The Man Who Would Remake Europe

Time Published: 2025-03-02T15:48:03Z
Full Content:
Germany’s incoming leader is an unlikely force for change. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Hours after his election victory last Sunday, Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany’s center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), said on national television that he would try to “achieve independence from the U.S.A. I never thought I would have to say something like this on a television program,” Merz continued, but “it is clear that the Americans … are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.” American security guarantees have protected the Federal Republic of Germany since 1945. Never since then has a chancellor of that country suggested that it emancipate itself from Washington. Not even France’s Emmanuel Macron, who has called for building a “sovereign Europe” capable of defending itself since he was first elected in 2017, could have put the imperative in starker terms. So who is the incoming German chancellor making this transformative demand? Merz is a conservative by any measure—social, fiscal, political—and far from being the avatar of a freethinking new generation in Germany, he may wind up being the last chancellor to hail from the old one. But history has plans for him. He will likely step into the highest office of Europe’s biggest economy and most powerful state just as the United States, under Donald Trump, abandons its post–World War II role on the continent. Merz, with his right-wing instincts and establishment roots, will be guiding his country, maybe even the continent, through a period of epochal change. Already, Merz has pledged to increase defense spending and put Paris, Warsaw, and London at the lead of a new policy to shore up Ukraine’s sovereignty and defend Europe from Russia with or without the United States. He has even sought to explore whether France and Britain might extend their nuclear umbrella to the rest of Europe, in place of American protection. At any other time, this agenda of European self-reliance might be a radical one. Now it’s a logical response to events. When he takes office, most likely at the end of April and at the helm of a coalition government with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), Merz will not be riding a wave of enthusiasm. The CDU won just 28.6 percent of the vote in this election—almost eight points more than the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), and the second-worst showing of the party’s history. And Merz has a personal reputation for being cocky, ambitious, and overly cerebral. He’s a politician with hard edges, and many Germans, especially women, find him hard to like. Read: Germany’s anti-extremist firewall is collapsing At 6 foot 5, the incoming chancellor literally looks down on most people he talks with. He is also a self-made multimillionaire who describes himself as “upper middle class” yet flies his own private propeller plane. He is a former artilleryman in the Bundeswehr who likes authority and orderliness, and he has a taste for cashmere V-neck sweaters and checkered shirts. Once, when a TV crew was following him for a day, he admonished an employee to brush their hair. The postwar generation to which Merz belongs has governed Germany for decades. Its men and women were raised amid the country’s immediate moral reckoning with the horrors of the Nazi Reich, and they have made this imperative central to their vision. Merz’s grandfather was a Nazi brownshirt and the mayor of Brilon, a picturesque town in the country’s west where Merz also grew up. Two generations later, Merz has watched the rise of the far-right AfD with profound concern, calling it a “disgrace for Germany.” Merz’s life in Brilon was economically comfortable but not always easy or orderly. As a child, he spent six months in a tuberculosis clinic run by nuns—an experience he has dryly described as “not nice at all.” His sister was killed in a car crash at age 21. And he was an impatient and irascible teenager who had to leave his local high school for disciplinary reasons, and whose grades were so bad that he had to repeat a year. Merz’s political career has been similarly jagged; he has probably survived more defeats than any other living German politician. A former judge, he rose to prominence as a member of Parliament in the 1990s as the standard-bearer for the conservative camp within the CDU. Yet in 2000, Merz lost a bid for party leadership to an unassuming East German named Angela Merkel. Once she became chancellor, Merkel made a point of marginalizing her most threatening rival. Merz left politics in 2009 to make money—lots of it. He joined a law firm in Düsseldorf and sat on the boards of many big corporations, including prestigious investment firms such as BlackRock Germany, of which he was chair, as well as run-of-the-mill companies such as the toilet-paper producer WEPA. Nine years would pass before he returned to politics. By then, in 2018, Merkel was engulfed in criticism for having let nearly a million refugees into Germany from the Syrian civil war. Within minutes of her announcement that she would step down from the CDU leadership, Merz had a statement ready announcing his candidacy. But the CDU didn’t choose him—at least, not at first. Twice, it picked centrists in the mold of Merkel. But the party kept losing electoral ground. Finally, in 2022, its members saw fit to give Merz a chance to revive the CDU by shifting it to the right. Read: MAGA has found a new model Merz favored a politics of law and order and a relatively hard line on immigration. He has at one point even advocated declaring a state of emergency in order to push migrants back from Germany’s borders, something European Union law would otherwise prohibit. Only weeks ago, he passed a parliamentary motion calling for placing undocumented migrants awaiting deportation in closed facilities. This proposal got through only because it won the votes of the AfD. Merz had earlier promised never to work with the far-right party. Now he told critics that if the AfD wanted to vote for his proposal, he could hardly prevent it. Some of Merz’s rhetoric around immigration sounds a lot like that of the populist right. He once called Ukrainian war refugees “social-welfare tourists”—though he later apologized for it. He has also designated the sons of migrants who fail to respect female schoolteachers “little pashas.” If all this was meant to reduce the AfD’s appeal by moving the CDU to the right, however, it was a failure. His tough talk did not prevent the AfD from capturing almost 21 percent of the vote this year—double what it got in 2021. Merz’s economic views may be the ones most starkly challenged by the geopolitical moment he finds himself in. To wrest European security from the North American framework will require new investments, new programs, and, almost inevitably, big spending. Merz brings to this task the instincts of a free marketeer impatient with government outlay and bureaucracy. In the 2000s, he promised that if he became finance minister, he’d make the income-tax form, which in Germany runs to dozens of pages, fit on a beer tap. In 2008, the year of the global financial crisis, Merz published a book arguing that Germany should cut back its welfare state, deregulate its economy, and encourage people to buy more stocks instead of letting their savings languish in bank accounts. Germany’s economy has stagnated for the past five years, and most of Merz’s solutions to that seem to come at the expense of workers or the environment: reducing unemployment benefits, creating incentives for Germans to work longer hours, and rolling back climate regulation. With the auto industry in crisis, he advocates removing the EU ban on internal-combustion-engine cars that is supposed to begin in 2035. But conservative economic orthodoxies may soon run up against other priorities, some of them every bit as close to Merz’s core. Like most German politicians of the immediate postwar generation, Merz is a Europeanist. He sees the EU not as a constraint but as a conviction. He is an ardent supporter of Ukraine, having criticized his predecessor, Olaf Scholz, for backing Kyiv too timidly and walking in lockstep with President Joe Biden instead of choosing a more assertive course with Paris and London. Scholz once marketed himself as a “peace chancellor,” to which Merz quipped: “Peace you can find in any cemetery. It is our freedom that we must defend.” Read: Is it time to bury Merkel’s legacy? Merz wants Europe to become sovereign and free of foreign interference because he believes that the new administration in Washington, like Moscow, seeks to divide and undermine democracy in Europe. The White House, like the Kremlin, seems intent on intervening in elections on behalf of the far right, and on forcing Brussels to walk back regulations on Big Tech that might curtail disinformation and hate speech. Countering this agenda, when it was only a Russian one, was well in line with conservative German values. On Sunday, the chancellor-in-waiting said: “I have absolutely no illusions about what is happening from America. Just look at the recent interventions in the German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk … the interventions from Washington were no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow.” Merz’s conservatism may be what allows him to shepherd Europe through a historic transformation. Just as the anti-communist hard-liner Richard Nixon was uniquely situated to establish American relations with the People’s Republic of China in 1972, and just as the left-wing Chancellor Gerhard Schröder was best placed to cut back Germany’s welfare state in the 2000s, Merz, with his stodgy, center-right credentials and postwar pedigree, may be just the leader to get Germans and Europeans to spend big for their emancipation from the United States.

Title: ‘Next in is Micheál Martin with a bowl of shamrock’: Irish Times readers react to Trump-Zelenskiy meeting

Sir, – I have just been watching, with horror, the meeting in the Oval Office between Presidents Trump and Zelenskiy. In my opinion President Zelenskiy is a man of courage, dignity and principle. We’ve seen him standing up, unlike Macron and Starmer, to Trump’s out-of-control bullying and his sycophantic vice-president Vance telling him he wasn’t grateful enough to his host, despite the fact Zelenskiy has repeatedly thanked America for its help and support. It raises the uncomfortable question of how far countries are willing to go to placate the unhinged, so called “leader of the free world”. And what happened to the message we were always taught growing up, that we should stand up to the bully, who is a coward at heart? Trump wanted a deal that suited just himself. This, of course, involved access to Ukrainian “earth minerals” plus a cosy relationship with Vladimir Putin, who wouldn’t break any agreement with his pal Trump – despite the fact that Putin has undoubtedly broken numerous deals he has signed, and invaded Ukraine despite his promise he wouldn’t. In the Oval Office discussions, Trump shouted out over Zelenskiy, jabbing his finger continually and aggressively at him. And then both Trump and Vance hollered about Zelenskiy’s “lack of respect”. The only people showing lack of respect were Trump and Vance. Those 10 minutes of argument showed us Trump for the horrendous bully he is. And, of course, he then began asserting that all the problems of this diplomatic debacle were Zelenskiy’s fault. I wonder how Prince Charles feels now about his letter inviting the American president to Britain? And, will Micheál Martin follow the Macron and Starmer route and try a charm offensive on Trump? Maybe it’s time, in the name of democracy, to stand up and be counted. As Edmund Burke said, “All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.” In my opinion, it’s Zelenskiy who should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Yours, etc, Martha McCarron, Blackrock, Co Dublin. Sir, – It’s hard to imagine that Theodore Roosevelt ever expected the “bully pulpit” to be abused in the manner in which Trump humiliated Zelenskiy in the Oval Office and delighted Putin in front of the international press. Has the US lost its moral compass completely? Yours, etc, Philip Carroll, Celbridge, Co Kildare. Sir, – Anyone who witnessed President Trump’s imperious chastisement of President Zelenskiy must be wondering whether we should give the Taoiseach Covid before St Patrick’s Day. It is well to remember that American isolationism is not new. But this new leadership style where a Russian autocrat is encouraged at every turn and a courageous democrat such as Volodomyr Zelenskiy is chided and belittled like an errant child is no good for anyone. It was very interesting to see the dexterous way in which vice-president Vance stirred the contumelious pot. Let us pray his predatory and opportunistic politics do not prosper. For the first time in my life, I find myself agreeing with President Trump. It is time Europeans stopped depending on the United States. No one is dancing. But this is most certainly a crossroads. Ritual humiliation has no place in transatlantic relations. Yours, etc, Michael Deesy, Bandon, Co Cork. Sir, – And next in is Micheál Martin with a bowl of shamrock. Yours, etc, Thomas Morris Gormally, Rathangan, Co Kildare. Sir, – The White House is indelibly stained. The presidency is disgraced. Let us not entirely discard our values by having our Government represented there. Yours, etc, Denis Meehan, Valencia, Spain. Sir, – I definitely feel closer to Kyiv than Washington right now. Yours, etc, Joe Molloy, Oranmore, Co Galway. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: War Harvesters Bleed Ukraine for Profit

Ukrainians in particular have been duped and propagandized to support a catastrophic war that continues to bleed their country of its youth and its sovereignty. The duplicitous West and its agencies have been the architects of the entire catastrophe. Wikileaks, for example, recently revealed that 9 out of 10 media outlets in Ukraine have relied on USAID funding. Hence, Ukrainians have been drowning in Western intelligence-based messaging (1) that controls the narrative and subverts the truth in favour of certain Western-based financial interests. . . From a distance, it should have been clear that the Western-fuelled, nazi-impregnated Maidan protests and crimes which deposed the elected government of Viktor Fedorovych Yanukovych was the turning point. (2) . . From a distance, Ukrainians should have seen that Nazism and war would serve transnational capital interests and not their own interests. Prof Chossudovsky notes that, “(t)he Neoliberal Endgame for Ukraine –resulting from unsurmountable debts– largely attributable to military aid is the outright privatization of an entire country by Blackrock which is a giant portfolio company controlled by powerful financial interests with extensive leverage. Black Rock signed an agreement with President Zelensky in November 2022.” (3) RFK Junior, currently U.S Secretary of Health and Human Services, elaborated upon Black Rock and the behind-the-scenes financial interests here: Financial interests and Big Business have historically aligned themselves with Nazism and against Russia. Jacques R. Pauwels notes in Big Business and Hitler that “the branch plants of US corporations in Germany managed to realize major profits during the war,” and “these profits did not end up in the pockets of the Nazis, but ended up fattening the wallets of the owners and/or shareholders in America.” (4) Black Rock and others are the hidden villains behind this catastrophe. Those blaming Russia or Putin for the catastrophe have been diverted from the truth. As long as war lies remain ascendant, misery and blood will continue to be shed globally. And the profiteers will continue to benefit from the harvests of war. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: Elon Musk Issues ‘Foolish’ Crypto Price Warning As Memecoin Crash Threatens Bitcoin

Elon Musk is currently battling to reduce the “terrifying” $36 trillion U.S. debt through his dogecoin-inspired Doge department of government efficiency, fueling wild bitcoin adoption speculation. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price, which soared in the aftermath of president Donald Trump’s November U.S. election victory, has dropped back as fears swirl U.S. tariffs could hit the global economy—with some analysts warning a recent bitcoin price plunge could be just getting started. Now, as Musk confirms he wants to put the U.S. Treasury on bitcoin and crypto blockchain technology, the Tesla billionaire has warned those expecting to "win" through betting on so-called memecoins are being “foolish"—as a memecoin crash threatens the bitcoin price rally. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Elon Musk, who's leading the dogecoin-inspired Doge department of government efficiency, has warned ... [+] those buying memecoins shouldn't expect to "win" as a crash threatens to tank the bitcoin price. "I mean it’s sort of like if you go to the casino, if you expect to win at the casino, you’re being a fool," Musk told comedian podcaster Joe Rogan in a wide-ranging three-hour interview. Dogecoin, a tongue-in-cheek bitcoin rival that was embraced by Elon Musk, is one of the original memecoins and rocketed to an $80 billion market capitalization during the Covid-era crypto rally before crashing back. However, dogecoin managed to hold on to more of its gains than its critics expected and is currently worth around $30 billion. “If you expect to win at meme coins you’re being foolish, you’re not going to win, don’t sink your life savings into a memecoin … don’t bet the farm," Musk said. The latest memecoin market frenzy began last year, helped by the launch of platforms like Pump.fun that allow memecoins to be easily created in seconds. Memecoins such as dogwifhat, pepe, bonk and shiba inu saw their prices surge, culminating with the launch of Donald Trump-themed memecoin that was endorsed by the president. “We’ve been hypnotized by price spikes, memecoin frenzies, and media spectacles, forgetting that crypto was meant to be a new financial system—one built on decentralized protocols that make finance accessible to everyone," Dom Harz, cofounder of decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Build on Bitcoin (BOB), said via email. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen sharply, dragged down by a memecoin price crash that Elon Musk has ... [+] could cost people's "life savings." The memecoin market peaked in December last year at a combined $137 billion market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap data, before dropping sharply and then bouncing back when Trump posted about his $trump memecoin. The $trump memecoin soared to over $60 before crashing back and is now trading at under $14. “The issue isn’t just price declines—it’s the realization that insiders could accumulate large amounts early, leverage major crypto exchanges for liquidity, and then sell to retail investors at over $60 per token, only for it to trade below $16. This growing awareness may be discouraging further speculative frenzy," 10x Research founder Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note. “This shift in sentiment has significantly dampened retail speculation, reinforcing our cautious outlook. Daily meme coin launches peaked shortly after the $trump coin debut but have declined sharply. $Trump is now down -85% from its highs, trading at just $11.5, leaving retail investors again sitting on heavy losses after buying into the hype."

Title: Athletes running abroad: why more Irish medal hopes are being driven by foreign coaches

Before the European Indoor Games grew into a proper championship event and podium places became harder to find, Irish athletes enjoyed a rare and special medal winning streak. Three golds and two bronzes, all won within four years. Beginning in 1966, Noel Carrol won his first of three successive gold medals in the 800m, the smooth-running machine from Annagassan adding another bronze in 1969. Maeve Kyle also won a 400m bronze in 1966, a decade after first blazing the trail for Irish women’s athletics at the Melbourne Olympics. Different times maybe, classy athletes nonetheless. Then in 1970 it expanded into the European Indoor Championships, later becoming a biennial event, during which time the Irish medal success became a lot more sporadic before drying up completely. Marcus O’Sullivan, for instance, won 1,500m silver in 1985, and it took another 15 years before we saw the next medal, Mark Carroll winning 3,000m gold in swashbuckling style, and James Nolan the 1,500m silver. So to Apeldoorn next weekend, where at the Omnisport arena in the centre of the Netherlands a team of 19 Irish athletes will look to restore that medal-winning streak of old, and not without considerable hope and expectation. Although there have been bigger Irish teams at this event over the years, none have boasted more medal prospects, between individuals and the relays. After coming home empty-handed in 2021 and 2023, the team this time includes four Irish athletes ranked in top three positions among the final entries, based on European indoor performances this season. Sarah Healy is ranked second in the 3,000m, Kate O’Connor second in the pentathlon, with Andrew Coscoran ranked third in the 3,000m, and likewise Mark English in the 800m. Four years after making his senior debut, Cian McPhillips has made a welcome return to form and is ranked fourth in the 800m, and Ireland’s two relay interests – the mixed 4x400m and women’s 4x400m – will both contest the straight six-team finals. No Rhasidat Adeleke this time, but there’s still ample baton experience in Sharlene Mawdsley, Phil Healy and Lauren Cadden. Sarah Lavin is ranked ninth in the 60m hurdles, and you know what they say about making the final in that event, and Cathal Doyle is fast adjusting to the banked tracks in his first professional season as a 1,500m runner. His greatest asset is his fearlessness. What also sets this Irish team apart from recent years is the fact so many are training abroad, under foreign coaches. Which is by no means a bad thing. At least not when considering the stage of their careers, where they have come from, and more importantly where they want to go. Mawdsley spoke recently about her need to shake things up after the Paris Olympics: “I’d always said I’d love to train in a professional group, because in Ireland I was very much training on my own. It was never a chore, but I knew after 2024 I would struggle a little with the motivation.” With that she’s moved away from Tipperary’s two-time Olympian Gary Ryan and linked up with London-based Tony Lester, whose group includes the Nielsen twins, Lina (who won Olympic bronze in the 400m hurdles in Paris) and Laviai (who won bronze in the 4x400m and mixed relay). English has changed his set-up too, now training under Australian coach Justin Rinaldi at the Fast 8 Track Club. A four-time European medal winner in the 800m, twice indoors and twice outdoors, English is certainly seeing the benefits of that switch, last month improving his Irish indoor record by almost a second when running 1:45.15. Also part of Rinaldi’s group, incidentally, is Josh Hoey, who last weekend improved the US record to 1:43.24, the second fastest indoor time ever. Coscoran and Doyle have also moved on since Paris, Coscoran joining the New Balance Manchester group under coach Helen Clitheroe (where Ciara Mageean was also successfully based before opting to move home this year). At 28, Coscoran last month improved the Irish indoor record to 7:30.75, and appears well capable of making the podium in Apeldoorn – although he will have Jakob Ingebrigtsen to contend with. The Norwegian hasn’t raced the distance this season but looks certain of a third successive 1,500m/3,000m double. Doyle is now coached by Jon Bigg, husband of Sally Gunnell and former training partner of Steve Ovett, whose training group is based in Brighton. Conor Kelly, only 17 and part of the mixed 4x400m relay, is coached by Paul Miller at the Hercules Wimbledon club in London. And Jodie McCann, who races the 3,000m next weekend, is working with Dutch coach Tomasz Lewandowski, along with her father Clark. Of all these, however, none have benefitted more from moving abroad than Healy, who has just turned 24 and heads to Apeldoorn in the form of her young life. Healy has now broken a record of some sort every time she’s raced this season, twice improving her own indoor 3,000m mark, plus the 1,500m mark, before twice improving the 1,500m championship record at last weekend’s National Indoor Championships. Healy won everything possible “all the way up”, as they say, including double gold at the European Under-18 Championships in 2018, all while carefully nurtured by her coach Eoghan Marnell at Blackrock AC. Then when entering the final year of her law degree in UCD, they realised the need to think outside the big-fish-in-a-small-pond scenario, and Healy moved to the husband-and-wife coaching team of Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, based in Wigan. Their group includes Keely Hodgkinson, who won the Olympic 800m gold in Paris. After joining their training camps in France and South Africa, Healy relocated full-time to Wigan in May 2023, and the move has proved transformative. There’s a confidence and consistency about her running now, which Healy attributes to being in such a competitive training group. This is no slight on the standard of Irish coaching. There’s nothing wrong with Irish athletes needing or wanting to look beyond the horizon to discover a more competitive step up, and it can sometimes lesson the pressure when it comes to winning medals.
