Lyn Alden and Vijay Boyapati urge gold maximalists to hedge risk by allocating 5% of their metals portfolio to Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate.

When gold maximalist Debra Robinson jeered, “Imagine paying $118k for a set of man-made numbers,” she echoed a familiar skepticism among precious metal enthusiasts. Lyn Alden, a respected macro analyst and Bitcoin bull, responded with pragmatic advice: “Precious metal enthusiasts could buy a bitcoin position of like 5% of their metals position. That hedges their risk of bitcoin gradually taking market share, so they can go to the beach and forget about the asset forever. Plenty of folks have recommended that for years.” As of the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at just under $118,000, having recently hit new all-time highs, reflecting global economic uncertainty and inflation concerns. The “set of man-made numbers” now has a market capitalization that exceeds $2.2 trillion, putting it ahead of silver and making it one of the world’s most valuable assets, and 100 public companies, including BlackRock and Strategy, collectively hold nearly 1.3 million BTC, about 6% of the total supply. In fairness to Debra, gold has also favored well of late, trading close to its record high of just over $3,500 at $3,355 an ounce. However, Alden’s 5% allocation suggestion is not about abandoning gold, but about risk management. For a gold holder with $100,000 in metals, a $5,000 position in Bitcoin acts as a hedge against the risk that Bitcoin continues to eat into gold’s traditional role as a store of value. This small allocation to Bitcoin can provide upside exposure if Bitcoin continues to outperform; even a modest position can have a significant impact on total portfolio returns. If Bitcoin fails, as many gold maximalists absolutely believe it will, the loss is limited to a small fraction of the overall portfolio. As Alden puts it: “They can go to the beach and forget about the asset forever.” Vijay Boyapati, author of The Bullish Case for Bitcoin, offered a historical perspective. He commented: “I was recommending this in 2013. At that time, I viewed Bitcoin as insurance against gold. Now I view gold as insurance against Bitcoin.” Boyapati’s comment reflects the dramatic shift in Bitcoin’s perceived risk profile over the last decade. What was once a speculative hedge for gold bugs has, for many, become the main event, with gold now playing the supporting role. Not everyone is convinced, however. CryptoSlate reported on the ongoing debate over gold vs Bitcoin yesterday, when notorious Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff came out to criticize the number-one crypto asset once more. Despite Bitcoin’s new highs, Schiff recently urged investors to sell BTC and buy silver, arguing that: “Bitcoin remains a risky bet, while silver offers more upside and minimal downside.” Yet, as corporate and institutional adoption of Bitcoin accelerates, Schiff’s warnings increasingly fall on deaf ears. Allocating even a small percentage of a metals portfolio to Bitcoin is a rational hedge against being blindsided by technological change, and as Boyapati stated, the logic of hedging with Bitcoin has only grown stronger as adoption, liquidity, and institutional interest have surged. Gold maximalists may scoff at the idea of paying six figures for man-made numbers, but the numbers don’t lie: Bitcoin’s rise is reshaping the store-of-value landscape. As Lyn Alden and Vijay Boyapati suggest, a modest Bitcoin allocation is not just speculation, it’s prudent risk management in a rapidly evolving world.

Title: Dave Fanning: ‘I felt very sorry for Ryan Tubridy, he was vilified’

Full Content:
Dave Fanning has a man bag. It’s a battered brown leather satchel full of notebooks containing playlists and ideas for programmes, the notes written neatly in longhand. “Old school,” he says. We’re in The Mercantile Hotel on Dame Street sipping a latte and when I ask how he’s doing he says “Ah, sure, you know yourself, I’m working in RTÉ – have you heard about it lately?” He very much wants to keep working there – “I love what I do” – so he’s careful about what he says about the broadcaster. “I mean sometimes you have to say something, I’ve done that a few times over the years and there’s one or two things I wish I hadn’t said, but such is life.” We’ll come back to some foot-in-mouth moments later but for now we’re interrupted by a middle-aged man at the next table. “I recognised your voice,” he tells Fanning. “It was a pleasure growing up with you.” This kind of thing happens to him a lot. Turning 70 next February, he has been playing music for audiences since the late-1970s. “People say they grew up with me but they’d no f**king choice, it was 1980s Ireland; it’s like when there was a really bad movie on a plane, you had to watch it,” he says. He makes the point that when he started playing records on RTÉ there wasn’t much else going on. “I mean we weren’t bad, I’ll say that, but we were only doing what Joe Bloggs would have done, playing records. Like, it wasn’t science – we were just lucky to be the ones doing it.” And he’s still doing it, nearly 50 years later, which is something he doesn’t take for granted. He finds it hilarious that for the next few weeks there’s a Dave Fanning show on seven days a week on RTÉ radio. He breaks it down. There’s his RTÉ Gold show from 6pm to 8pm Monday to Friday. On Saturday, he has a show that is his take on music through the decades. (He gives 16 hours to each decade so that one will go on for a while.) Then on Sundays, for the next several weeks, he has an hour in the evening where 24 Irish bands or artists will pick one favourite album and discuss it. “So that’s me, seven days a week for the next while,” he says with a laugh. The other programmes are more chatty but his Monday-to-Friday gig, Dave Fanning on RTÉ Gold, is just about the music. Across the two-hour programme you’ll hear his voice, and he’s timed it, for a mere five minutes. “There’s no news, there’s no sport, there’s no ads, there’s no demo tapes, there’s no weather,” he says. Here’s his pitch to listeners, who he is well aware are a specific demographic. “I’m saying to people, listen, you know that record collection you have at home, the one you are going to buy a new turntable for? You’re never going to buy a new turntable, with all due respect, blokes, and anyway your wife has put your record collection in the attic. Or in the skip.” If this resonates, Fanning’s message to you is: “Worry not. I’ll play your record collection for you. I’ll play the music you like and I’ll shut the f**k up.” At this point, another person approaches, a younger man this time. He wants Fanning’s advice about whether he should go to see Paul Weller or Van Morrison play live this summer. Fanning gives him a five-minute answer but the short version is “Paul Weller, because Van Morrison is hit and miss and 80 per cent of the time he’s a miss”. [ From the archive: Dave Fanning moving on from 2FM after 44 yearsOpens in new window ] He describes himself as a music veteran from an early age thanks to the record collections and excellent taste of his older siblings. The youngest of six growing up in south Co Dublin – “well, my mother would say youngest of seven; one brother, Brian, died at the age of nine months”. Fanning had an “idyllic” childhood and went to Blackrock College. A fully paid-up member of the official Beatles fan club since he was eight, at 11 he went to his local record shop and put a “10 bob note down as a deposit on the Beatles’ new album which wasn’t due out for six months”. Fanning remembers the record shop assistant asking him what it was called. “It’s called Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” 11-year-old Fanning declared. He’d read about the album in his brother’s NME magazine. The publication was on order in the Fanning family’s local shop for six decades. While he went on to train to be a teacher in UCD, his musical education continued in the college’s Theatre L where he saw everyone from Paul Brady to Thin Lizzy. Then there was an ad on the back of The Irish Times, “editor wanted for Scene Magazine”. His mother saw it and said “give it a bash”, while friends encouraged him. He got the job. While working there he was also with pirate station Big D Radio and DJing three nights a week in McGonagles. That’s when his relationship with U2 began. He’d play them more than any other band “because they were good but they also had more demos than anyone else”. In 1979, RTÉ decided they had better start a pop station to target younger listeners and RTÉ Radio 2, now 2FM, was born. Until then people were “listening to Radio Luxembourg with the radio out the window but they didn’t have to do that any more because we were playing the music”. I think about that 11-year-old putting down a deposit for the new Beatles album. Could he believe playing records was his actual job? “I can hardly believe it now,” he says. “There are people who say ‘never make your hobby your job’. F**k that.” U2 were the first unsigned band to record one of his Fanning Sessions where up-and-coming bands were paid to come and record songs. “Public service broadcasting at its finest,” Fanning says. This was the start of the tradition where the band let Fanning be the first DJ in the world to play their new releases. He was considered a “good luck charm” by the band’s former manager Paul McGuinness. He still gets invited around to Bono’s house for a listening party every time there’s a new album. Why does he think Bono gets such a hard time from some? “He wears his heart on his sleeve and some people don’t like that.” The other obsession that he managed to turn into a profession is cinema. He has presented film shows for decades and for the past 40 years he has watched a minimum of a movie a night. His wife Ursula is about to go away with friends and this means he will probably watch two. Hitchcock’s Psycho is a favourite. He saw a list of top 100 movie stars in Empire recently. “I had interviewed 84 of them,” he marvels. He mentions Ursula, a solicitor, a lot. He says he wasn’t keen to settle down but that getting married “was the best decision that was ever made for me”. Fanning makes a living from talking but sometimes his mouth gets him into trouble. When Aslan’s Christy Dignam died, he made comments about the singer’s earlier heroin use which understandably angered and upset his family. He made a heartfelt apology at the time. He’s reluctant to get into it again, only saying: “Christy was brilliant, I loved him”. He got into trouble when the RTÉ payments scandal broke, tweeting: “I think we all need a distraction from that nonsensical Oireachtas Nuremberg trial … So listen to our Rory Gallagher special tonight.” He later apologised unreservedly, saying he did not mean to trivialise proceedings. He is friends with Ryan Tubridy, and they are both represented by Noel Kelly who was a central figure in the RTÉ scandal. He doesn’t get into the detail of the controversy but says “the way Ryan was treated was appalling. He was a scapegoat … he’s paid enough of a price and was hounded out of this country in many ways. I felt very sorry for Ryan, he was vilified.” Conceived in the pandemic, his Fanning At Whelan’s showcase for Irish music on Virgin Media is a sort of family cottage industry, with his wife, son and daughter involved in production. He’s never been staff at RTÉ which has allowed him work for other organisations and, crucially, being a contractor meant he did not have to retire at 65. He’s in good health? “Yes. And I think I look OK, but then you are out for a pint and you go for a pee and look at yourself in the mirror and think, who the f**k is that?” [ Dave Fanning missed the point about Aslan. Fans loved the fact that they were underdogsOpens in new window ] He still plays his records at home – the record collection is not in the attic – but he streams music too. Best new Irish act? “A. Smyth.” He hates how difficult it is for bands now, how financially impossible to hit the road and find an audience. “It’s terrible.” He gets wound up by injustice and follows US politics closely – he can rant for Ireland about the current state of affairs. He’s not a rap fan but on the Kneecap furore he says: “I can’t understand it. What’s wrong with saying you are against genocide?” Our lively Fanning session has lasted more than two hours. I could talk to him all day. If you are interested in music or film or whether Yoko Ono broke up the Beatles – “she definitely did” – time spent with Fanning is pure entertainment. He interviewed David Bowie five times. Paul McCartney six times. His enthusiasm and energy are impressive. He really can’t believe his luck, still getting to do what he does all day – seven days a week, in fact, for the next while. He throws his battered bag over his shoulder and heads off into the Dublin sunshine. “I never want to stop,” he says. “I mean, why would I?” Dave Fanning on RTÉ Gold runs Monday to Friday 6pm to 8pm Róisín Ingle is an Irish Times columnist, feature writer and coproducer of the Irish Times Women's Podcast © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Dave Ramsey Caller Says Her 80-Year-Old Mother-In-Law Is A Serial Cheater Who's Given Away Almost $1M To Internet Scammers

A woman who called into “The Ramsey Show” recently shared a shocking story about her in-laws, saying her 80-something-year-old mother-in-law had drained nearly $750,000 from a retirement account and given it to an internet scammer. Today's Best Finance Deals “My father-in-law went to the hospital about a year ago,” the caller said. “He decided to go ahead and give my mother-in-law access to her retirement account, thinking that he didn’t have much longer. She drained that within about a week, giving it to some online scammer.” Don't Miss: The caller said her in-laws had been married for 60 years and built up a nest egg of roughly $3.5 to $4 million. Her father-in-law had always managed the finances and kept them debt-free. But once his health started to decline, things unraveled. The woman said the family later discovered that her mother-in-law had been giving money away for years. They believe she is involved in delusional, one-sided online relationships, calling it a possible mental illness. “She’s involved in a one-way romantic relationship with this person she’s never met,” the caller said. “She’s got multiple Facebook profiles, same picture, different name, doing the same thing all over the country.” Despite being visited by the FBI and local police, the mother-in-law still believes her relationship is real. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. The caller expressed deep concern that her mother-in-law will blow through the rest of their joint assets after her father-in-law passes, potentially leaving the family on the hook for her care. “My husband and I—I’m in my late 40s, he’s in his mid-50s—we’re going to be debt-free in the next two years,” she said. “I don’t want to go into debt to take care of somebody else who… I don’t even like her like that.” John Delony and Jade Warshaw, who hosted the show that day, advised the caller that she and her husband had no legal or moral obligation to rescue someone who continued to make reckless choices. “There are times where you feel the need to swoop in… but those are choices,” Warshaw said. “It’s not your responsibility.” See Also: Many are surprised by Mark Cuban's advice for lotto winners: Cash or annuity? Delony recommended pursuing conservatorship through the courts, though he warned it would be difficult and possibly met with resistance. “You’re just throwing a Hail Mary pass, hoping somebody catches it,” he said. She’d have to prove she’s a harm to herself. The caller said her husband had talked to his father about giving financial power of attorney to one of the sons, but they have no proof that anything was filed. She suspects embarrassment is stopping him. “I think there’s a part of him that’s very embarrassed about this,” she said. “We’re just finding out about this, and it’s been going on to a certain degree for 60 years.” Delony emphasized the urgency. “Your husband and his brothers are faced with: Do we watch our mom burn her life to the ground, or do we go down swinging?” Read Next: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.

That's because volatility in the biggest and oldest digital coin is dampening, experts told Decrypt. And as the asset matures and sophisticated traders make more intelligent bets with Bitcoin, it's unlikely to boom as quickly as before. "Think of it like someone who's working out—a massive spike higher is like someone crash dieting to hit their weight goal, and then they just lose it three weeks later," Greg Magadini, Amberdata's director of derivatives, said. He added: "But a slow and steady grind higher is sustainable, unlike a massive, bubble-like rally. As Bitcoin grows in market cap, it takes more money to move it around." Bitcoin in previous cycles made sometimes absurd climbs. In 2017, for example, BTC rocketed to $19,345 in December, data provider CoinGecko shows, after starting the year at $786—a 2,360% surge. The flagship cryptocurrency's price hit a new high of $118,667 on Friday, up about 25% from the start of 2025 when it was trading at roughly $93,500. BTC's realized volatility is now 29.5%, far off 2021's 100%. The derivatives market indicates why. In 2021, the options market was considerably smaller, hitting a peak in October of that year of over $15 billion. In May, BTC open options contracts surged to over $42.5 billion on Deribit. Now traders are now buying Bitcoin via the new exchange-traded funds—approved last year—and using trading features on them. It works like this: investors with a lot of BTC are able to sell call options—contracts betting on the future price of an asset—adding liquidity to the market. Volatility decreases as sophisticated traders using this strategy sell options not expecting big price moves. Traders more widely than adjust their expectations and bets accordingly. "We see this with equities: When markets are bullish, they grind higher at a slower pace with less volatility," Magidini said. "With [BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust] we have a new class of market makers with deep pockets who can warehouse volatility bets easily," he added, noting that Bitcoin was a smaller asset class previously with smaller market makers. The asset is now attracting a more mature class of investor with institutional capital hitting the Bitcoin space, mainly through the new ETFs, market observers told Decrypt. Bitcoin spot ETFs pulled in $1.17 billion on Thursday, their second-biggest day since their debut in January 2024, led by BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK Invest. On Friday, they remained strong, with about $1.03 billion worth of inflows. Still, Bitcoin's dramatic swings may not vanish completely. "I would definitely not rule out periods of high volatility," David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, told Decrypt, adding that price surges from now might "be locked into a tighter time period."

Who are anchor investors? Rahul: Anchor investors are a special class of institutional investors that SEBI introduced in 2009. They invest in IPOs one day before it opens to the public. Think of them as early movers who help build trust in the IPO. Nirmal: Oh! So, they get early access before everyone else? Rahul: They don’t just get in early, but they also invest big. Only qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) like mutual funds, insurance firms, pension funds, and foreign investors that can put in at least ₹10 crore qualify as anchor investors. Their presence can strongly influence pricing and create a buzz. For example, in the HDB IPO, top names like BlackRock, LIC, and Goldman Sachs came in as anchors that boost confidence for others. Nirmal: How does this affect me as a retail investor? Rahul: When big institutions back an IPO, it signals quality. Also, SEBI mandates that 35 per cent of the IPO is reserved for retail investors, 15 per cent for HNIs or non-institutional investors (NIIs), and up to 50 per cent for QIBs. Anchor portion includes up to 60 per cent of the QIBs’ portion. Anchor investors bid and get their shares allotted a day before the IPO opens for public subscription. But they can’t sell those shares immediately. Nirmal: Why not? Rahul: SEBI imposes a lock-in period; 50 per cent of the shares they get are locked for 30 days and the remaining 50 per cent for 90 days from the date of allotment. This prevents them from dumping the stock right after listing, which could tank the price. Nirmal: That makes sense. Keeps the IPO price stable after listing. Rahul: Exactly. Without the lock-in, prices could be very volatile post listing. Anchor investors are expected to be serious and long-term participants. Nirmal: And you said they play a role in price discovery too? Rahul: Yes. Because they put large sums into the IPO, their valuation acts as a benchmark. Nirmal: But have they ever gone wrong? Rahul: Good question. Not every IPO with anchor participation is a winner. Paytm, LIC, and SBI Cards had strong anchor backing but struggled on listing. Also, some SME IPOs like Wagons Learning failed due to poor anchor and public interest. Nirmal: Then why should I care about them? Rahul: Because unlike analyst reports or hype videos, anchor investors actually buy the shares. If serious institutions stay away, it might be a red flag. They help validate or question the company’s valuation. Nirmal: So, the anchor response tells me how trustworthy or overpriced an IPO might be? Rahul: Exactly! While it’s not the only factor, strong anchor participation is one of the key signals to consider when evaluating an IPO. IPO investing is all about informed decisions. Anchor investors give you a useful clue. Nirmal: Got it! Thanks, Rahul. Published on July 12, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: The Pentagon’s Bold Move To Secure U.S. Rare Earth Mineral Needs

ByDavid Blackmon ByDavid Blackmon, Senior Contributor. FORT BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINA - JUNE 10: U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete ... More Hegseth are greeted by 18th Airborne Corps Commander Lt. Gen. Gregory Anderson and other military and civilian leaders at the Holland Drop Zone on June 10, 2025 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Trump is traveling to Fort Bragg Army base to observe a military demonstration and give remarks in honor of the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Acting on President Donald Trump’s April 15, 2025 executive order directing cabinet officials to take action to enhance U.S. energy security by lessening dependence on imports of rare earth minerals, the Pentagon moved in recent days to secure a major ownership interest in America’s only operational rare earth mine. The U.S. Department of Defense, headed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, acquired a 15% position in the MP Materials mine, located adjacent to Interstate 15 in southeast California, making it the largest single shareholder in this critical national resource. MP Materials common stock spiked 54% on July 10 following the announcement. It has been well reported that rare earths are crucial to the wind, solar, battery, and electric vehicles industries. Less reported until recently is the fact that rare earth metals are critical elements for making high-grade magnets that go into every modern military weapons system, jets, and ships. In addition to producing a large percentage of rare earths in its own mines, China holds a dominant position in the refining and processing of the minerals and manufacturing of the magnets from which they are made. Ongoing tensions between the two countries make America’s heavy reliance on imports of these metals via China-dominated supply chains represents a significant national security risk. The Pentagon maintains significant stores of these minerals for its own use, but restrictions on rare earth exports invoked by China in recent months could threaten to force a depletion in those inventories. An analysis posted on June 25 by S&P Global notes that those restrictions “led to a 32.1% year-over-year decline in US rare earth imports, highlighting mainland China’s dominance in supplying critical minerals.” The chart below, published along with that S&P Global analysis, details that China controls either the production of or supply chain for almost 70% of U.S. rare earth imports, based on data compiled by the U.S. Geological Survey: S&P Global chart depicting U.S. reliance on imports of rare earth and other minerals from China and ... More other countries. In addition to its status as America’s only active rare earth mining operation, MP Materials is a fully integrated operation which also refines and manufactures magnets at its California operation. MP Materials was created in 2017 to acquire and restart the Mountain Pass mining operation which was originally discovered in 1949 and was a dominant player in the global rare earth market from the 1960s into the 1990s. According to the Science History Institute Museum and Library, production at Mountain Pass “increased dramatically in 1965, after the discovery that europium phosphors could be used to make a much brighter red in color television screens. The Mountain Pass Mine and the Molybdenum Corporation of America (often referred to as Molycorp) dominated world rare earth production and global exports from about 1960 until the 1990s. During the early 1990s California environmental regulators detected low-level radioactive wastewater leaking from the separation plant’s pipelines. Market prices for rare earth metals were low; Molycorp shut down the separation plant in 1998 and then the mine in 2002.” “This initiative marks a decisive action by the Trump administration to accelerate American supply chain independence,” said James Litinsky, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of MP Materials said in a release. “We are proud to enter into this transformational public-private partnership and are deeply grateful to President Trump, our partners at the Pentagon, and our employees, customers and stakeholders for their unwavering support and dedication.” CNBC reports that the deal between the Pentagon and MP Materials involves the DoD investing in a “newly created class of preferred shares convertible into MP Materials’ common stock, in addition to a warrant convertible at $30.03 a share for 10 years that allows the U.S. to buy additional common stock.” The 15% share held by the Pentagon would be almost double the shares held by Litinsky (8.61%) and BlackRock Fund Advisors (8.27%). MOUNTAIN PASS, CA - SEPTEMBER 1: The Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine & Processing Facility, owned by ... More MP Materials, is viewed from a United Airlines Airbus A319 commercial flight flying at 37,000 feet on September 1, 2023, in Mountain Pass, California. The Colorado River, flowing from Colorado's Rocky Mountains through Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and California, is heavily dependent on a winter snowfall that was mostly below average this year. (Photo by George Rose/Getty Images) As part of the deal, the Pentagon will guarantee a minimum price of $110 per kilogram for neodymium-praseodymium oxide (NdPr) produced at the facility for 10 years and agrees to buy 100% of the magnets manufactured by MP Materials. JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have pledge $1 billion in financial support for the expansion of the site’s manufacturing facility. MP Materials says it also expects to receive a loan of $150 million from the Pentagon “in connection with its plan to expand its heavy rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass.” Once improvements and expansions are completed, the MP Materials site will be the only site of its kind in the Western Hemisphere. Speaking at an April conference organized by the Hamm Institute in Oklahoma City, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum advocated for the federal government to make direct investments in critical energy resources. “We should be taking some of our balance sheet and making investments,” Burgum said, adding, “You’re competing against state capital because China is picking these strategically as areas that they want to invest in.” Burgum also advocated for the establishment of a U.S. sovereign wealth fund similar to those held by countries like Norway and Saudi Arabia. “Why wouldn’t the wealthiest country in the world have the biggest sovereign wealth fund,” the Interior secretary said. This bold move to enhance U.S. energy and national security by reducing U.S. dependence on China for its rare earth mineral supplies is an outcome of the vision laid out by Burgum. It also represents another example of the administration moving quickly to keep a promise made by candidate Trump during his 2024 presidential campaign.

Title: What Passive Investing Has Done To Our Retirement

By Dan Amoss PostedJuly 12, 2025 There’s a famous economic law you may not have heard of, but it is valuable to understand. It goes like this: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” It’s called Goodhart’s Law, named after British economist Charles Goodhart. He meant it as a warning to policymakers. If you fixate too much on one data point – like inflation, test scores, or unemployment – you can end up distorting the very thing you’re trying to measure. Here are ten relatable examples of Goodhart’s Law in action. Think about the common thread. But fair warning: once you see them, you can’t un-see them. You’ll be prone to think of the incentives and structure behind every complex system you encounter: Today, this warning embedded in Goodhart’s Law applies with alarming precision to the stock market. The “measure” that’s been corrupted is the S&P 500 index itself. The S&P 500 used to tell us something meaningful about the real economy. Today, it tells us more about the mechanical flow of retirement money than the health of American business. For long-term investors, this index does not offer much value relative to risk. It trades at 29 times earnings. It is far above a simple moving average (100-month, in blue). The SPY ETF which tracks the index pays a 1.1% dividend yield at a time when a 2-year Treasury note pays 3.9%. And the S&P 500’s earnings support, in green, is also far above its own trendline. The index’s GAAP earnings stream is vulnerable to the refinancing of its companies’ bonds at higher interest rates, plus lower profit margins in a slowing economy. This shift didn’t happen overnight. It’s the result of a long, slow move away from active investing and toward passive strategies. Instead of picking individual stocks, most investors now buy broad index funds, like those from Vanguard or BlackRock. These funds don’t try to beat the market. They are the market. They buy stocks based on their size in the index, no questions asked. On the surface, this passive revolution appears brilliant. Passive funds are cheap, with management fees close to zero. They have performed well in the past. And they require no effort. But like so many financial innovations that seem too good to be true, this one comes with hidden risks that few investors understand. According to Mike Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management, this passive revolution has created unintended side effects that could end in disaster. Green calls passive investing the “giant mindless robot.” Why? Because when new money flows into index funds, it doesn’t sit on the sidelines. This money flow is not completely isolated from the index it tracks. Rather, it buys stocks immediately. And not just any stocks. It allocates the largest share of incremental purchases to the largest stocks (like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon) because those names dominate the index. This creates what economists call a “price-insensitive buyer” – the most dangerous type of market participant. The money flows in, the big stocks get bigger, and the index rises. That rise draws in more money, which buys more shares, pushing prices even higher. It’s momentum on autopilot. Here’s where Goodhart’s Law reveals the fundamental problem. The index has become the target of trillions of dollars in retirement accounts, pensions, and ETF flows. It’s no longer as good a measure of economic strength as it once was! But policymakers, journalists, and even many investors still treat it like it is. This creates a dangerous illusion that recalls the housing bubble’s false signals. When markets rise, it looks like all is well. But the rise may have nothing to do with rising profits or productivity. It may simply be the result of mechanical buying by investors who have abdicated all responsibility for the deeper thinking that drives price discovery. Consider the math of this distortion. Passive funds don’t care if stocks are expensive. They buy based on market cap, not fundamentals. If Apple doubles in price, index funds buy more Apple. If Tesla triples, they buy three times as much Tesla as they did before it triples. Does that make logical sense? Not really – at least not to people who understand the history of large, bureaucratic companies and the law of large numbers. As long as prices are perceived to be on a permanent trend higher, few ask whether those companies are overvalued. This is like judging a company’s value by its popularity rather than its earnings potential. Green explains that this creates a multiplier effect. If you gave $1 to an old-school, active mutual fund manager, they might have sat on it, waiting for better stock prices or more favorable economic conditions. The market barely moves because back in the day, when value investing ruled, fund managers were liquidity providers and volatility dampeners. That is, when stocks went on sale, their demand for stocks rose. When stocks reached objectively expensive levels, they sold and raised cash. But give that same $1 to a passive fund, and it gets deployed immediately into the biggest stocks. The impact that the marginal dollar has on stock prices when it goes to a passive fund is massive – up to 20 times greater than the same dollar going to an active fund, according to Green. A price-insensitive buyer is by definition not fazed by having a 20x impact on the marginal stock price. Even worse, the larger passive funds get as a share of the total market, the more they will become volatility amplifiers. That is, passive fund inflows tend to rise as stock prices rise and slow as stock prices fall. We haven’t seen a lengthy episode of passive outflows, but it’s daunting to imagine, especially with passive having become such a large component of the market. Green shows it in this chart of market structure evolution from 1995 to 2022: A memorable insight from Green comes from a simple analogy he shared in a recent podcast interview with Thoughtful Money’s Adam Taggart, linked here. Green asks us to imagine walking into a rug shop where the shopkeeper offers a Persian rug for $1,000. A normal buyer might hesitate and start to walk away. The shopkeeper then says, “Okay, $500,” which entices the buyer. They perceive it as a bargain and decide to purchase. Now, imagine how a passive fund would behave in the same scenario. Green explains: “The shopkeeper says, ‘$1,000,’ and they say, ‘Okay, I’ll take it.’ Then he says, ‘No, no $1,500,’ and they say, ‘I’ll take it.’ ‘$2,500?’ ‘I’ll take it.’” This scene captures the absurdity of passive investing’s price-agnostic behavior. As Green notes, it’s not that passive funds are price insensitive. They’re actually price-responsive in the worst possible way. “The next dollar that goes in rewards the stocks whose prices have already gone up,” he explains. Meanwhile, as the expensive “rug” gets more expensive, other investments that are becoming better long-term investments at lower prices get smaller in the index and receive fewer marginal dollars. It’s a system that systematically reinforces momentum and punishes value. Green points out that even John Bogle, the father of index investing, misunderstood his own creation. Bogle used to say investors should “ignore price.” But as Green notes, “What was your allocation mechanism? Price times shares outstanding, relative to price times shares outstanding for everything else. That is paying attention to price.” In Green’s view, Bogle’s interpretation of his own method was “180 degrees wrong.” The index doesn’t ignore price – it slavishly follows price, buying more of what’s already expensive and less of what may have become cheap. This is how the feedback loop forms, and why it’s so dangerous. Passive inflows drive prices up. Those rising prices attract more inflows. But what happens if the flows stop – or worse, reverse? That’s the nightmare scenario that keeps thinking investors awake at night. Passive funds are price-insensitive buyers. But they’re also price-insensitive sellers. When the selling begins, there will be no human judgment to moderate the process. If investors start pulling money out of index funds (because of rising unemployment, mass retirements, or fear), those funds will be forced to sell. And they’ll sell without thinking. Other than maybe Warren Buffett in the twilight of his career, no analyst will broadcast a powerful enough second opinion to suggest, near the worst of a hypothetical future bear market, “Maybe this isn’t a good time to dump shares.” It’s just sell, sell, sell – with the same mindless efficiency that drove prices up. That could turn the feedback loop in reverse. Prices fall, which triggers more selling, which pushes prices down further. Calls for a more powerful force – say, the Fed? – to buy stocks will be deafening. One major, related issue is demographics. The math here is unforgiving. Baby Boomers hold most of the wealth in America. But they’re aging. At age 72, they must start withdrawing money from tax-deferred retirement accounts like IRAs. Some of that money gets reinvested. But much of it leaves the market altogether. This creates a steady, growing headwind for passive inflows. At the same time, younger generations face economic headwinds that didn’t exist for their parents. Entry-level job prospects are weak. Wages are stagnant relative to asset prices. Many aren’t contributing to retirement plans at all. That limits the next generation’s ability to offset the Boomer outflows. Green also warns in his interview that technological change is eating away at the job market faster than new jobs are being created. That means fewer workers, fewer contributions, and more early retirements – exactly the opposite of what passive investing requires to function. In this environment, passive outflows are not a remote possibility. They’re a real and growing risk that most investors refuse to acknowledge. If and when these outflows arrive, the entire illusion could break. Investors have come to believe the S&P 500 will deliver 8% annual returns forever, almost as if this expectation is an unstated, unlegislated federal entitlement program. They observe past performance and make the faith-based leap to project the past endlessly into the future. But that belief ignores the distortions baked into the market. It ignores how passive flows inflate prices. It ignores how market cap weighting favors the already big. It ignores how the index is no longer a tool of discovery, but a target of blind capital. In other words, it ignores Goodhart’s Law. Markets are not miracles. They reflect human decisions, or lack thereof. When the majority investing strategy becomes “just buy the index,” the system becomes fragile. It works as long as the flows are one way, into index funds. But history teaches us that trends never last forever. This isn’t a call to panic. But it is a call to think – and to prepare. The passive bubble may not pop tomorrow. But it’s built on assumptions that can’t hold forever. One of those assumptions is that indexes still tell us the truth about real, sustainable value creation in Corporate America. Goodhart’s Law says they don’t. And when the flows eventually turn, the truth will hit with the force of mathematical inevitability.

Top Cat! The most effectual! Top Cat! Who’s intellectual! Close friends get to call him ‘TC,’ Providing it’s with dignity! Thomas Clarkson, known as TC to his team-mates and friends, gets the reference to the lyrics of the 1960s Hanna-Barbera cartoon, Top Cat. Leinster forwards coach Robin McBryde got there first when he played the theme tune for the 25-year-old tighthead prop. He’s a good sport when the tune breaches the peace in the sweaty confines of a Portakabin at Ireland’s training ground on the outskirts of Lisbon. He occasionally mops his brow and it’s nothing to do with the questions, rather the lack of air conditioning in 30 plus degree temperatures. Clarkson lived in Brittas Bay until he was nine, played rugby for Wicklow RFC, before his family – dad Finbarr, mum Nina, and his siblings, Catey, Freddie and Dominic – moved to Blackrock where he went to school, first in Willow Park and then in the senior school. He swam competitively, butterfly his stroke of choice, before rugby subsumed his interest. Rugby was a good fit. “I was always the bigger kid, so I suppose it was always kind of fun just running through. I always got the ball on tap penalties and stuff,” Clarkson explains. His current Ireland team-mate Nick Timoney coached him in first year. He won a Schools Senior Cup under Liam Turner’s captaincy, a Grand Slam with the Irish under-20s in 2019 (the first of two years on the age-grade team), and toured South Africa with Emerging Ireland in 2022. Smaller in stature relative to the behemoths he faced when playing international age-grade rugby, he quickly realised that good technique was a prerequisite. “I was never the biggest, because coming out of school I was pretty small, only 110kg or something like that. I’m 128kg (now), or something like that. There were lads (at under-20s) that had played (in the French) Top 14 and the (English) Premiership. They were up in the 120kgs then, so I knew I had to be technically good.” Clarkson smiles in recounting the struggle, not so much putting on size but muscle. “I was pretty chubby leaving school. I got put into fat camp with Dave Fagan (the late Leinster strength & conditioning coach). “I was put on gym-heavy programmes, trying to put on muscle and get stronger. You see some of lads coming through now, like (Alex) Usanov and Paddy (McCarthy), putting up big numbers in the gym. I was nowhere near that. It’s something I had to work on a lot over the last few years. It’s probably why it took me a few years before I started playing in bigger games and capped and stuff. “You can put on loads of weight, and it can be bad weight. You can’t move with it on. I think I took it a bit slower, it took me a few years to put it on. Now, I feel like I can move better than when I was lighter.” Ireland’s interim head coach Paul O’Connell referenced Clarkson’s diligence in working to get the right body shape for a tighthead prop. “He’s been excellent for us. We had him on the Emerging Ireland tour and he’s a considerably bigger man since then. Obviously, he’s in a pushing competition there in the front row. “He’s worked really hard, even from the Six Nations to the summer tour, he looked even in better shape again and it’s a great sign of a guy because he’s in that position where he’s trying to put on size. It can be hard work at times when you’re playing games and training. “Players know good players. Johnny (Sexton) would have always said that (Clarkson) is a very good footballer, and paid him compliments about his all-round game. He’s very comfortable on the ball. He had a few good, tough carries (in Tbilisi), particularly early in the game. Like all these guys they just need time in the saddle. “There’s plenty of things from the game he needs to work on, a little bit on maul defence, but he gets a chance now to go and do it again and show that he can improve.” Clarkson made his Leinster debut five years ago and by his own admission he wasn’t ready. He isn’t patient by nature. “It was frustrating. I made my debut quite early. There were a few injuries. I probably got thrown in before I’d shown I was ready. “The fact that I got a taste of that so early, I didn’t have to wait so long to break through. It’s been frustrating. There have been a few lows.” He continued: “At the end of the 2023 season, I had a run of games (for Leinster) where the scrums went really badly. It was during the Six Nations (and then) we went to South Africa, I got absolutely destroyed. “(It’s the) worst place to go if you’re low on confidence. That was probably the lowest. Since then, I’ve been building nicely.” It taught Clarkson resilience. The lessons were occasionally painful, but the quality of the person and the player ensured he made progress. The rehabilitation process was overseen by Cian Healy, Andrew Porter, Tadhg Furlong and Rabah Slimani in Leinster training. “You’re scrumming against (them), you must learn. When you do get to the standard it gives you confidence for the matches.” Psychologically it allowed Clarkson to shed any doubts. The last couple of years he’s kicked on, winning his first Ireland cap against Argentina last November having originally been brought into the squad as a training panellist. Injuries within the squad provided the opportunity, but Clarkson grabbed it with both hands. In Lisbon he will win his eighth cap, a tally he’s accumulated in eight months. He’s had to remain patient too. “Tadhg (Furlong) and Slim (Rabah Slimani) got the nod for those few European games. I was getting the matches in between and felt like I was putting a lot of pressure on myself to play well. It wasn’t happening and I was feeling a bit low about it. The Glasgow game was when I felt that was probably my best game. “Different things are expected of you (with Ireland). I want to put my hand up here. These are probably lesser profile games for the public but it’s important for me that I can come in off the back of playing well for Leinster and translate it to playing well (for Ireland). “You’re not just going to walk in having played well on the outside. Obviously, they have the lads that they can trust, and they’ve been in the system for years.” He’s earning that faith and trust, game by game. And maybe one day very soon, like Top Cat, Clarkson can become “the indisputable leader of the gang”. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

It was a chilly night in Dublin on July 1st, 1996, when soprano Virginia Kerr appeared on the crow’s nest balcony of The Ark children’s cultural centre in Meeting House Square to deliver a soulful rendition of Seán Ó Riada’s arrangement of Mná na hÉireann. Her star turn was followed by a concert on the stage featuring Anuna, Shaun Davey and The Corrs to inaugurate Ireland’s presidency of the European Union and celebrate the completion of this new public space in the heart of the city. The Temple Bar project was on a roll, with its sophisticated mix of renovated historic buildings and stylish contemporary interventions testifying to the Europeanisation of Dublin. The Ark, designed by Group 91’s Michael Kelly and Shane O’Toole, was installed behind the retained facade of a 1728 Presbyterian meeting house on Eustace Street, with a stage that could play to the square by raising horizontal hinged, slatted doors invented by Spanish architect and engineer Santiago Calatrava. There was something surreal about sitting out in Meeting House Square on balmy summer nights to watch movies projected on to a screen rolled down over the facade of the new Gallery of Photography, with everyone getting a plastic cape in case of rain. It didn’t feel like Dublin at all. Only a few years previously, the new square had been a surface car park, as was Temple Bar Square, while Curved Street – bisecting the urban block between Eustace Street and Temple Lane – was a pair of derelict sites. Group 91, the consortium of 13 talented younger architects who won a competition for the Temple Bar Architectural Framework Plan and then divvied up the plum cultural projects among themselves, were showered with awards for their work, and some of them went on to win accolades abroad. Architects, planners, urbanists and geographers flocked to Dublin, hailing what had been achieved in this 10-hectare chunk of the city’s historic core as one of the finest urban renewal projects in Europe. [ The real Temple Bar: Thriving cultural quarter or ‘a violent post-apocalyptic place’?Opens in new window ] And we were in right the middle of it all. My partner Eamon Slater and I (with help from some friends) had queued for a week in February 1995 to make sure of getting what estate agents would call a “duplex penthouse” on the upper floors of a renovated 1840s warehouse building at the corner of Temple Lane and Cecilia Street. I had been writing in The Irish Times about the vital need for people to live in the city centre, so the time had come for me to put my money where my mouth was. Temple Bar Properties, the State agency set up to oversee the renewal and development of the area, was selling apartments on a “first come, first served” basis, so queueing became de rigueur – though the length of time we did it for set a new record. The sale of our previous home, a lovely end-of-terrace house on Casimir Road in Harold’s Cross, and an EBS mortgage enabled us to pay £195,000 for this 124sq m apartment, and there were generous tax incentives that made it feasible. We were so full of optimism about the future of Dublin then. At last, things were going in the right direction. People were moving into town, populating the upper floors of buildings, whether renovated or newly built. And during that first summer in Temple Bar when the sun shone every day, it was a bit like Barcelona. Nearly everywhere in the city centre, there was something new to marvel at and celebrate. It seemed that pre-Celtic Tiger Dublin had truly become a European capital city. It was such a privilege to walk out of our building – The Granary – and find everything within easy reach. There was a newsagent’s across the street, an internet cafe on our ground floor, plus all the shops on Grafton Street and Henry Street. And good restaurants like Fitzer’s and Trastevere on Temple Bar Square, Nico’s and Frères Jacques on Dame Street, the Clarence Hotel’s Tea Room and Eden on Meeting House Square, where there used to be a wonderful food market every Saturday. Premier among the area’s cultural offers was the Irish Film Institute (IFI), installed by O’Donnell + Tuomey Architects in the former Quaker meeting house on Eustace Street. It was so close that we could be sitting in its cinema seats within five minutes of leaving “the flat”, as we always called it. Whenever I gave walking tours of the area, I would always bring groups through it, noting the metaphorical roll of film in the middle of the corridor leading in from its entrance to the central roof-lit courtyard foyer. Our apartment had an east-west orientation, with loading bay doors opening out into Curved Street. After The Ark opened as Europe’s first purpose-built children’s cultural centre, we would see excited primary school kids making their way there, walking in pairs with a teacher at the front and another bringing up the rear. That was a charming image of the daytime Dr Jekyll ambience of Temple Bar, by contrast with the after-dark, drink-fuelled Mr Hyde persona that it acquired over time. Earmarked in the 1970s for development as a mega transportation centre, CIÉ had bought up lots of buildings in the area and made the mistake (from its viewpoint) of letting them on short-term leases at affordable rents to artists and galleries, funky clothes shops, bookstores, cafes, pizzerias, community resource centres, recording studios, performance spaces and other activities that generated a “Left Bank” bohemian atmosphere, even in the midst of endemic urban decay. [ From the archive: Thirty years of Temple Bar: A cultural quarter or overblown drinking space?Opens in new window ] By 1987, Charles J Haughey could see its potential, famously pledging that he “wouldn’t let CIÉ near the place”. And so, in 1991, Temple Bar Properties – initially headed by Paddy Teahon, then assistant secretary general in the Taoiseach’s department, and later by Laura Magahy – was set up with a mission to create a “bustling cultural, residential and small business precinct that will attract visitors in significant numbers ... building on what has already taken place spontaneously in the area”. There was significant funding from Brussels for what was planned as “Dublin’s Cultural Quarter”, but the money was coming from the EU’s tourism programme – and the easiest way to increase footfall and “put bums on seats” was to facilitate the development of pubs and restaurants. Within the first five years, almost an acre of drinking space was added to the area, turning it into “the Temple of Bars” and drawing revellers from all over Europe on Ryanair flights to enjoy the “craic” in Dublin. In April 1997, two years after moving in, I flagged in The Irish Times that Temple Bar was turning into Dublin’s version of Sachsenhausen, the entertainment zone of Frankfurt in Germany, where nearly every building on its quaintly cobbled streets is either a bar, a restaurant, a nightclub or a tourist trinket shop: “The main drag, along Temple Bar and East Essex Street, is thronged at weekends by drinkers on a seemingly endless pub crawl. The atmosphere can be unsavoury, even dangerous.” [ The future of Temple Bar: Dystopian wasteland or ‘thriving cultural scene’?Opens in new window ] Gates had to be erected around Meeting House Square in 1997 to close it at night because of fears that it would be trashed. Given that one of the primary goals of the Temple Bar project was to create new public spaces, this in itself was an admission of failure – and an official acknowledgment that we have a real problem in Ireland with our “public realm”. Over the years since, policing in the area has been light touch, with an increased Garda presence only after serious incidents happen. In 1998, the Dublin City Development Plan was amended to ensure that there would be a suitable mix of day and night-time activities so that pubs and other licensed premises would not dominate cultural, residential and retail uses in the area. But this was quietly dropped in 2005, probably because Temple Bar had become such a key element in the State’s tourism offer that the need for balance was seen as an impediment to its “success”. Increasingly, the residents were marginalised. At its peak in 2011, there were around 2,000 people living in the Temple Bar area – mainly in the west end, between Parliament Street and Fishamble Street. From 2015 onwards, the number was eroded as many apartments that had been occupied by long-term renters were turned into tourist short-lets via Airbnb, the Key Collection and other platforms. Day after day, we would see (and hear) tourists trundling wheelie bags through the cobbled streets to find flats they had booked that used to be people’s homes. Noise was a persistent problem. Not so much street noise, but heavily amplified music from pubs, venues and nightclubs. As chair of an informal group, Temple Bar Residents, I spent a lot of time making “observations” on planning applications or enforcement complaints to Dublin City Council and appeals to An Bord Pleanála. And turning up in the District Court to object to the renewal of music and singing licences for abusive pubs blasting out noise with doors wide open and even external loudspeakers. Proposals to change the licensing laws so that late bars and nightclubs could stay open until 6am if they chose to do so – in response to the Give Us The Night lobbying campaign by DJs, publicans and other vested interests – filled us with dread and required a serious investment of time and effort in making submissions to the Night-time Economy Taskforce, the Department of Justice and others, stressing the need for an effective European-style noise control regime to protect city centre residents. [ ‘A lot of local leaders lost patience with Dublin’: Give Us The Night campaign renews the fight for a level playing fieldOpens in new window ] The final straw for us came in January 2022 when we heard loud dance music emanating from a premises next door that used to be occupied by Shan, an Indian restaurant, which had been turned into the DL Bar. When I went in to find out what was happening, there was a DJ with decks playing at 88dB according to my decibel meter, and a crowd bopping on the floor in front of a fully stocked bar. If this racket was to continue night after night, I feared that our home would become uninhabitable. We managed to put a stop to it. But we were getting older and there was no lift in The Granary nor any space to install one, so the stairs would have defeated us in the longer term. So we put the flat up for sale in an off-market transaction and got a good price for it, which enabled us to buy a beautiful new apartment in deepest, leafiest Blackrock with views south towards Three Rock Mountain. Monty Python’s catchphrase sprang to mind: “And now for something completely different.” Having made the move in November 2022, we’ve got used to everything being at a distance rather than close at hand. One social downside of being in “the burbs” is that friends no longer call in casually, as they used to do so often when we lived in the city centre; now they have to plan a trip. We still go into town for a variety of reasons, but don’t miss living there because the tranquillity out here is beyond measure. A bit like Temple Bar during the Covid lockdowns, really. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

There are no signs of our chronic housing shortage being fixed any time soon The observations on the Government’s latest ‘plan’ to tackle the housing crisis are welcome, though they will most certainly fall on deaf ears (‘Bringing back the bedsit? Housing Minister James Browne’s ‘radical’ new apartment plan’, The Indo Daily, July 11). The danger now is that discuss­ion of the issue is stifled by being conducted in the false context that solving the housing shortage is complex. It is no such thing. It requires only that those with their hands on the levers of power approach the issue with the sole focus of ensuring an adequate supply of fit-for-purpose housing, rather than straining every sinew creating and sustaining a source of wealth for the chosen few. Jim O’Sullivan, Rathedmond, Co Sligo I feel I must apologise to the Irish nation in advance. I intend to barbecue tomorrow. I realise this virtually guarantees the immediate collapse of the high-pressure system currently blessing our shores. The gods of weather, as we know, are petty and vindictive, and nothing tempts their wrath quite like the sight of someone confidently wheeling out a barbecue, charcoal at the ready, burgers defrosting, with dangerous optimism. Still, hope springs eternal, and the delicious Armagh delicacy, vegetable roll, is already sitting in the fridge. I ask only for forgiveness – and perhaps a brief, merciful window of sunshine between 1pm and 3pm. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Armagh Your editorial is spot on (‘Make the most of this welcome weather, we don’t see it too often’, July 11). Even when we see the sunshine, we don’t always feel its warmth with that annoying cold east wind that seems to shadow us for most of the year. Sunshine is the best daily medicine for our body, mind and soul. So soak it in to a factor of 50 and let those shadows fall away behind you. Aidan Roddy, Cabinteely, Dublin Education Minister Helen McEntee has announced the establishment of a Commission of Investigation into sexual abuse in all day and boarding schools. I attended Willow Park and Blackrock College as a boarder in the 1960s. Sadly, I experienced many years of physical and mental abuse. It is very disappointing that corporal punishment, suffered by so many in this country, has not been included in this investigation. Any kind of abuse, be it sexual or otherwise, stays with victims for the rest of their lives. Brian McDevitt, Glenties, Co Donegal I concur with the gist of your editorial (‘Talking about peace prizes as bombs fall is in appalling taste,’ July 10) that Benjamin Netanyahu’s nomination of Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize is distasteful. Israel has always enacted a system of oppression, colonialism and hege­mony in historical Palestine. Its policies were intended to spur territorial fragmentation, segregation, displacement of indigenous people, dispossession of lands and properties and the utter revocation of political, social, cultural, religious and economic rights. Until Israel dismantles its repugnant apartheid system and addresses the underlying causes of this intractable conflict, peace will remain a mirage. Dr Munjed Farid Al Qutob, London The time, effort and energy that went into the construction of the bonfire in Moygashel ahead of the commemorations of The Twelfth, as well as the placards and ‘migrant boat’ on the top, must have been considerable (‘Act that fuels racism – outrage as ‘migrant boat’ placed on top of loyalist bonfire in Co Tyrone’, Irish Independent, July 9). It is not the first bonfire controversy, and is unlikely to be the last. One wonders if it is time to bring down peace walls, do away with segregated schooling and deploy a concerted effort at cross-border relationship-building and foster community civic engagement in the true spirit of the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement. Stephen O’Hara, Carrowmore, Co Sligo There is no doubt that life moves pretty fast. If one does not stop and look around once in a while, one could miss it. Someone recently said they were just minding their own business when all of a sudden 1975 was 50 years ago. Even though we are passing through life, we should never stop having fun. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary The heading of your editorial of July 4 (‘In Trumpian world, our rich ties to US need to be solidified’) is somewhat contradicted by the reference in July 8’s ‘Donald Trump now unhappily president of the US’. Somewhat undiplomatic, don’t you think? Of course, it is in line with utterances from our Government and media. All of this doesn’t look like consolidating our ties with the US. Generally, is it not time to promote balanced and factual reporting on the US, not dependent on biased reporting constantly lamenting Trump’s election? Do we not care enough to seek accommodation rather than confrontation? Mary Stewart, Donegal town RTÉ says the council is giving out free factor-50 in Cork city parks.

Title: How much did a Bono self-portrait sell for? – and the growing trend of investing in wristwatches

One would almost think, that with the ubiquity of smart phones and other devices with prominent digital displays of time, wristwatches would have become a thing of the past. Not so, it seems. During the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in demand for high-end watches - almost ironically give that with lockdowns, there was a sense of time standing still. Noting that many people had more disposable income during Covid, “some people saw it as a good time to make an investment in a watch,” says Sophie Duff, jewellery valuer with Adams Blackrock, the Irish auction house that recently relocated to 17 Kildare Street, Dublin. The auctioneer’s current jewellery timed online auction – which ends on Thursday, July 17th from 7pm - has a few stand-out watches among the lots. Perhaps the most prominent of the watches in Adams Blackrock’s forthcoming auction is the Patek Philippe “Golden Ellipse” 18 carat yellow gold man’s watch, dated 1988 (€7,500-€8,500). “This model allows Patek to flaunt its expertise in the field of watchmaking, particularly in the beautifully textured Milanese bracelet strap,” explains Duff. Patek Philippe is one of the world’s most luxurious watchmakers. The Geneva-based company has an on-site museum which chronicles the 500-year history of watchmaking. It includes exhibits of 2,500 watches including a range of its own pocket and wristwatches since it began making watches in 1839. Incidentally, the Irish Museum of Time in Waterford city also has displays of Irish-made wristwatches and the best collection in the world of Irish-made pocket watches, from the 18th to 20th century. Another interesting watch at the Adams Blackrock auction is the Chopard “Happy Sport” stainless steel diamond-set lady’s wristwatch (€1,800-€2,000). “Chopard are known for their iconic ‘Happy Diamonds’, a design feature where loose diamonds appear to float within the piece,” explains Duff. Adams Blackrock, which was recently acquired by Belfast-based Ross’s auctioneers and valuers, offers dual-currency bidding, with buyers able to submit bids in euro or sterling. Items are also on view in both auction houses in advance of their monthly auctions. [ Belfast-based watchmaker Nomadic moves with the times to reinvent retail experienceOpens in new window ] Ken Israel, head of watches at Adam’s Fine Art Auctioneers, 26 St Stephen’s Green, Dublin, says there is a strong and consistent demand for vintage Patek Philippe watches. “In our latest sale [May, 2025], a beautiful Patek Philippe model no 3940 J achieved €40,000, demonstrating the ongoing appetite for refined dress watches,” says Israel. He adds that Cartier watches are also in demand, particularly those designed from the 1930s to the 1970s. “These early watches represent a golden age of design and craftsmanship, that is now being rediscovered and reappreciated,” says Israel. More specifically, he suggests that pre-1973 models, especially those cased by Edmond Jaeger and featuring Jaeger or early European Watch and Clock (EWC) company movements, are particularly sought after by collectors. According to Israel, collectors are more educated now and digging deeper in the history of each brand. “This is reviving interest in forgotten references that combine mechanical excellence with striking aesthetics,” he explains. There will be watches in Adam’s next jewellery auction on September 9th. Duff from Adams Blackrock agrees that customers – male, female, old and young - know what model they are looking for. “We get a lot of interest in Cartier watches too – particularly models from the 1990s and 2000s that are no longer in production,” she explains. Generally speaking, Duff says, customers are more interested in bracelet-style watches, rather than those with a leather strap. Omega watches are also in demand. And although neither Ross nor Adams Blackrock have sold an Omega Seamaster – famously worn by the James Bond characters since 1995 - she says customers do make reference to it quite a bit. Fans of 007 will no doubt be familiar with the product-placement of these luxurious watches, which superseded other high-end brands Rolex and Seiko, worn by previous James Bond characters in the decades before 1995. O’Reilly’s Fine Art Auctioneers on Francis Street, Dublin, notes two other strands of interest in watches outside the vintage and designer watch market. These are outdoor watches, such as the Tag Heuer models, which range from classic watches and racing-themed chronographs [watches which incorporate a stop watch function] to water-resistant sports models from brand such as Raymond Weil and Longines. “Pocket watches – often offered with their accompanying gold chain made from 9 or 18 carat gold – are de rigueur for gentlemen who wear three-piece suits,” says Natasha Bernon from O’Reillys. Its next auction, on July 23rd, features an early 20th century 18 carat (ct) gold pocket watch (€1,200-€1,800). The auction also includes a lady’s Rolex Cellini cream face wristwatch with Roman numerals. It has an 18ct gold case, clasp and buckle on its black leather strap. (€3,000-€4,000). “With no VAT on pre-owned items, you can find iconic brands at a fraction of the retail cost and all our watches are carefully inspected by our specialists to ensure authenticity and quality,” says Bernon. adamsblackrock.com; ross.com; patek.com; adams.ie; oreillysfineart.com Estimate €1,200-€1,500 Hammer price €1,700 Auction house Whyte’s Estimate €300-€500 Hammer price €440 Auction house Whyte’s Estimate €300-€500 Hammer price €1,050 Auction house Whyte’s Estimate £70,000-£100,000 Hammer price £115,000 (€135,000) Auction house Bonhams Sylvia Thompson, a contributor to The Irish Times, writes about health, heritage and the environment Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

July 11, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: MintMiner MintMiner Los Angeles, CA, July 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, soared to a high of $118,000 during Asian trading hours on Friday, and has risen by more than 24% so far this year.

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, James Van Straten BlackRock’s IBIT becomes third-largest revenue driver among nearly 1,200 funds as spot bitcoin ETFs reshape the investment landscape. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now holds 700,000 bitcoin according to Glassnode data, and has amassed $76 billion in assets under management in just 18 months, outstripping both the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which tracks the U.S. equity benchmark, and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap U.S. stocks. The figures beats the 600,000 BTC held by Strategy (MSTR), which started purchases in 2020, and compares with Fidelity FBTC’s 203,000 BTC and Grayscale GBTC’s 184,000 BTC. “New milestone, iShares Bitcoin ETF now holds over 700,000 BTC. 700,000 Did this in 18 months. Ridiculous,” Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, commented in a post on X. The U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) debuted in January 2024 and have become the most successful ETF introductions of all time. Since inception, they have attracted $50 billion in net inflows. IBIT is now the third highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock across all its ETF products. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that BlackRock operates a total of 1,197 funds. Crypto Crypto Crypto Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Title: Exclusive: Crypto and stablecoin infrastructure startup zerohash to raise $100 million at almost $1 billion valuation
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/07/11/zerohash-stablecoin-fundraise-interactive-brokers-100-million-1-billion-valuation/

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Stablecoin fever is still running hot. Zerohash, a crypto and stablecoin infrastructure startup, is set to raise about $100 million at nearly a $1 billion valuation, according to two sources familiar with the deal. The publicly traded online brokerage Interactive Brokers is leading the funding round, said the two sources, who spoke to Fortune on the condition of anonymity to discuss private business dealings. Spokespeople for Zerohash and Interactive Brokers declined to comment. The fundraise follows Zerohash’s Series D from 2022, when the company raised $105 million from investors including Bain Capital, Nyca, and Point72 Ventures. The Series D valued the company at $340 million, according to data from PitchBook. Founded in 2017, Zerohash (formerly styled as Zero Hash) provides backend infrastructure that helps banks, brokerages, as well as fintech companies offer cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other digital assets to their customers. Now, the company has become an influential player in the hot sector of stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar. Zerohash partnered with Stripe to help the fintech giant’s customers go from cash to stablecoins through Zerohash’s network of banking relationships and regulatory licenses. It has also worked with Securitize, another crypto startup, to help traditional finance titans like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton enter the tokenization race, or when issuers put traditional financial assets like money market funds into blockchain wrappers. Zerohash lets customers exchange stablecoins for tokenized assets. Other Zerohash clients include prediction marketplace Kalshi as well as neobank MoneyLion. Zerohash isn’t the only stablecoin startup to attract tens of millions of dollars in venture capital over the past year. After Stripe announced its acquisition of the stablecoin company Bridge for $1.1 billion in October, similarly positioned startups have raked in investor funds. In December, BVNK raised $50 million in a Series B that valued it at around $750 million. In March, Mesh said it had raised $82 million. And on Thursday, Nick van Eck, son of noteworthy investment management CEO Jan van Eck, announced that Agora, a stablecoin company he cofounded, had raised $50 million in a round led by longtime crypto investor Paradigm. The Bridge acquisition is just one reason why investors are piling into stablecoins. The crypto markets are frothy again as Bitcoin has repeatedly notched new all-time highs in 2025. In early June, the stablecoin issuer Circle went public in a gangbusters IPO. Its shares have more than quintupled since its stock started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company’s market capitalization is around $46 billion as of Friday morning. And in mid-June, the Senate passed a bill that would regulate crypto assets. The House is now considering the legislation. Amid the regulatory push and crypto boom, Fortune 500 companies have shown interest in the technology. Retailers like Walmart and Amazon are looking into stablecoin adoption. And Big Tech firms like Meta, Apple, Airbnb, and Google have all spoken with crypto companies since January about integrating stablecoins into their payments infrastructure. As opposed to issuers like Agora, which has its own stablecoin and creates white-label tokens for its partners, Zerohash acts as the connective tissue for the stablecoin ecosystem. Its tools for developers let customers more easily go between cash and stablecoins, serving as an intermediary amid skyrocketing demand for the sector. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Bitcoin surges above $118,000 in a record-breaking rally driven by institutional demand, corporate adoption, and strong support from Trump’s pro-crypto policies. The cryptocurrency’s momentum mirrors gains in tech stocks like Nvidia, highlighting its close link to the Nasdaq’s record highs. With Congress set to begin "Crypto Week" on July 14 and discuss key regulations like the GENIUS Act, investor confidence is soaring. Companies like MicroStrategy, GameStop, and Trump Media are expanding their Bitcoin holdings, while platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood see stock price boosts. Bitcoin's rally signals a shift towards mainstream crypto acceptance in both finance and policy.

Title: Bitcoin ETF IBIT Sees Surge In AUM, Marking New Institutional Peak

Time Published: 2025-07-11T16:30:40Z

Since its inception early last year, Bitcoin Spot ETFs have become a crucial part of its market dynamics. During inception, several spot BTC ETFs were launched, but BlackRock’s IBIT has turned out to be quite successful, which currently stands as the biggest BTC spot exchange product. While Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) continue to record inflows, BlackRock’s BTC ETF, IBIT, is witnessing substantial growth compared to other products. Presently, the product appears to be leading the charge with a surge to new levels, surpassing other funds. In a post on the X platform, The Kobeissi Letter, a leading commentary on the global capital market, announced that the Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has hit a new milestone in terms of assets under management. The assets under management have surged to a value of $76 billion, highlighting the quickening rate of institutional acceptance in the cryptocurrency industry. According to the Kobeissi Letter, total assets have tripled over the past 200 trading days, as per ZeroHedge. This fresh milestone by IBIT cements BlackRock’s dominant position in the broader spot BTC ETF sector. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust generates unprecedented AUM, it demonstrates the increasing belief among major investors that Bitcoin merits a crucial place at the global investment table. BlackRock’s IBIT sharp rise in AUM to a new high appears to be exceptional, as many funds took several years to experience this growth. It is worth noting that it took more than 15 years for GLD, the biggest gold ETF, to achieve the same feat. The Kobeissi Letter also reported that the IBIT’s Bitcoin holdings have increased substantially during the period. Data from the market expert shows that IBIT BTC holding has grown to over 700,000 BTC for the first time in history. Comparing this amount of Bitcoin acquired with that of MicroStrategy, a firm that is mainly recognized for its strategic accumulation of BTC, it is 100,000 BTC more than the total holdings of the company. Given the stunning growth of the IBIT, the Kobeissi Letter believes that the overall “crypto markets are making history.” Lark Davis, a crypto expert and entrepreneur, has outlined a new trend in buying activity among institutional players. Despite the continuous capital inflows into ETFs, many investors appear to be more interested in acquiring Bitcoin directly than through ETFs. The expert revealed that BTC purchases by public businesses are outpacing those of ETFs. In addition, Davis stated that the number of Bitcoin Treasury businesses is growing every week, as institutional investors continue to hoard BTC in unprecedented quantities. Considering this mass accumulation by public institutions, the expert is confident that the market is about to go insane from here. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: ‘You’re going to die tonight’: Former garda attacked and threatened to kill partner in Dublin home
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/07/11/youre-going-to-die-tonight-former-garda-attacked-and-threatened-to-kill-partner-in-dublin-home/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T15:39:54Z
Full Content:
A man has been jailed for 20 months for attacking and threatening to kill his then partner in their Dublin home while he was a serving member of An Garda Síochána. Ian Gillen, of Carysfort Avenue, Blackrock, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to threatening to kill or cause serious harm to Jennifer Clinton on December 23rd, 2021, at Trafalgar Lane, Monkstown, and to assaulting Ms Clinton on the same occasion. After hearing facts in the case on Thursday, Judge Martin Nolan adjourned overnight. He on Friday said the custody threshold had been crossed, noting that he had considered the facts of the case, Gillen’s circumstances and mitigation. Judge Nolan said Gillen was a front-line garda who had to “make difficult decisions, and this can have an effect on a person”. He also noted that Gillen was “visited with a tragic event with the death of his son”. He imposed a prison sentence of four years, with the final 28 months suspended on strict conditions, which he said was due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in Gillen’s life. Insp Rachael Kilpatrick testified that the couple had socialised together in Blackrock Tennis and Bowling Club, where they were members, before the attack. They had gone home separately, with Ms Clinton arriving first. Ms Clinton told gardaí that when Gillen arrived home, he called her downstairs to sit by the fireside, where he stood over her in an intimidating manner, rebuking her and calling her names. She said he told her ‘Jen, I’m going to rip your head off’, putting her in fear, and prompting her to make an audio recording of the rest of the incident on her mobile phone. She said he punched her with a closed fist three times on top of her head. In an effort to get away, she said she needed to go to the toilet, but he refused to let her go. She eventually managed get away and locked the bathroom door behind her. She cleared the windowsill and eventually made it out of the house. She had managed to record 40 minutes of the threats. An attempt was made to play this in court, but it was not possible due to technical difficulties. A transcript of the recording was handed to the judge instead. Ms Clinton described Gillen’s conduct as pure anger. She said that any time she tried to get up, he kept telling her to sit back down. “You’re going to die tonight,” he told her three times. After Ms Clinton escaped, Gillen was arrested for coercive control. He was interviewed and the recording was played to him. He said he was embarrassed and it was not in him to hit her, but indicated it was another person in his body. “He was shocked by his own behaviour,” said Insp Kilpatrick. Gillen accepted he could snap and be angry when drinking. He said he had issues in his background, including the death of his son, which caused him to drink. He has since retired from the Garda on medical grounds and has no previous convictions. Under cross-examination by the defence, Insp Kilpatrick agreed that Gillen was a front-line garda for 40 years and had dealt with many stressful situations. She accepted that it was in the line of duty that he had to deal with his son taking his own life in his early 20s. Gillen was the first responder on the scene. His mental health deteriorated afterwards and he relied on alcohol, the court heard. Ms Clinton entered the witness box to deliver her victim impact statement. She said her life had been marked by fear and deep trauma since the prolonged assault, during which she felt overpowered and trapped. She said she still lived with the consequences every day, having been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. “I live in a state of hypervigilance,” she said. “I lost my confidence. The memory of that night is etched into my mind and body like the cross he etched into the front door of our shared home one night in a rage.” She said that Gillen’s rising aggression while they socialised earlier that evening had prompted her to leave, but he had arrived home full of fury. “I wanted my family to know the truth if I did not survive,” she said, referring to the 40 minutes of the assault that she captured on her phone. At one point, she said, Gillen mockingly suggested that she ring Blackrock Garda station, insinuating that nobody would help her if she did because he was a serving garda. “Living with him took a deep emotional toll. I felt smaller and smaller all the time,” she said. “The man I once loved became someone I feared.” She added: “As a long-standing member of An Garda Síochána, he would present himself as a figure, someone to be believed and relied upon to uphold common decency and morality.” However, she said that he did not tarnish the reputation of An Garda Síochána, but just his own. “I’m here for justice,” she said, asking the court to take into account the enduring horror Gillen had caused. Kathleen Leader SC, defending, handed the court two testimonials and a psychologist’s report on behalf of her client, who she said was deeply ashamed and apologised for what he put Ms Clinton through. She said he had faced a number of traumatic incidents in his 40 years in the force, which had taken a toll on him and probably had not been dealt with as they should have been. She described the death of his son, while Gillen was on duty, as the worst nightmare of every guard and parent, and asked the court to take it into account. His two referees were in court to support him, she said, with one crediting her client with saving his life and the other saying that he had helped him in the prevention of suicide.

Title: Ant International refutes reporting Circle partnership, but stablecoin ambitions remain clear

Every Wednesday and Friday, TechNode’s Briefing newsletter delivers a roundup of the most important news in China tech, straight to your inbox. Ant International, the overseas arm of Ant Group, has refuted reports that it is in talks with Circle Internet Financial to integrate USDC stablecoin into its blockchain platform. Bloomberg first cited unnamed sources on July 10, claiming the two companies were exploring cooperation plans following USDC’s compliance in the United States. Just hours later, Ant International responded, stating, “The media reports are inaccurate. We currently have no such plans.” Why it matters: Ant’s quick denial underscores its cautious approach to publicizing any stablecoin tie-ups. However, it does not diminish the company’s broader ambitions in blockchain and stablecoins. As global stablecoin adoption accelerates and regulatory clarity improves, Ant is actively seeking licenses, forging partnerships, and advancing technology to bring large-scale, trusted applications to the market. Each step by Ant in this space has the potential to reshape the global digital finance landscape. Details: According to people familiar with the matter, Ant processed more than $1 trillion in transactions worldwide last year, with around one-third conducted on its blockchain infrastructure. They also said in June that Ant International is pursuing stablecoin licensing in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. Context: Stablecoins are a type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to another currency. As of June, the total circulation of stablecoins stood at around $250 billion. According to Bloomberg, in June this year, the US Senate passed legislation setting out rules for dollar-linked cryptocurrencies, a move that has further legitimized stablecoins. As of 9 am local time on Friday (July 11), shares of Circle rose 4.4% to $209.57, marking a surge of over 500% since its listing. Although Ant International has denied reports of a partnership with Circle, its ambitions and active positioning in the stablecoin sector are undeniable. These moves underscore how traditional fintech giants are taking stablecoins seriously, particularly in the wake of the US Senate’s legislative push in June to regulate dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, which has accelerated mainstream acceptance of stablecoins.

Currently, there are 18 new fund offers of MFs waiting to be grabbed by investors, and this trend is likely to gain momentum, with new entrants in the asset management space launching NFOs in the next few months. In fact, in the last 10 days, five mutual fund houses have filed papers with SEBI to launch six NFOs. Interestingly, all of them are on the passive side and returns from these funds are linked to the movement of a particular index with no discretion of fund managers. Amid a volatile equity market and tepid returns from IPOs, investors have been lapping up NFOs. Markets embolden Trump on tariffs, stoking fear he’ll go too far Among the latest entrants, JioBlackRock AMC — a joint venture between Reliance Industries and global fund manager BlackRock — recently mopped up ₹17,800 crore through the launch of overnight, liquid and money market funds. The NFO witnessed participation from over 67,000 individual investors and more than 90 institutional investors. Buoyed by the tremendous response from investors, the digital-focused JioBlackRock AMC has filed draft documents to launch eight schemes, focusing on low-cost, direct-to-investor offerings. The JV aims to disrupt the ₹72 lakh crore fund management business in India with a minimum investment limit of ₹500. Additionally, new entrants in the MF space, such as Bajaj Finserv, Groww, Samco, Zerodha and CapitalMind have lined up NFOs to compete in the 47-member asset management business. The MF industry has raised ₹19,164 crore through the launch of 117 NFOs in the first six months of this year. Of this, 25 equity NFOs have mopped up ₹10,690 crore, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India. Venkat Chalasani, CEO, AMFI, said, “The launch of NFOs is expected to continue with the new entrants trying to make a space for themselves and the focus may be on the passive front to cater for the mass market.” Global markets: Asian shares up on Nvidia high, investors unfazed by Trump's tariff moves “Retail investors have reposed their faith in the MF industry by pouring into equity schemes consecutively for the last 52 months despite market volatility and geopolitical tensions,” he added. The MF industry has managed to attract investors’ interest despite the sharp increase in fundraising through initial public offerings. Swapnil Aggarwal, Director of VSRK Capital, said, “NFOs offer immediate diversification across multiple stocks and reduce single company risk. On the other hand, IPOs give direct ownership in a specific company, and investors’ returns depend on the financial performance of a single company,” he said. While all investors in NFOs get units at ₹10 a piece, there is no guarantee of allotment in IPOs, and bids can be placed only in specific lots, besides the IPO shares are allotted on a pro rata basis, he said. IPOs are best suited for investors with a higher risk appetite, while NFO offers a unique and compelling investment strategy that aligns with long-term gains, he said.

Title: Bitcoin – How $1.18B in ETF inflows could push BTC’s price higher
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-how-1-18b-in-etf-inflows-could-push-btcs-price-higher/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T15:00:13Z

Selling pressure from miners increased slightly as BTC hit a new ATH. Bitcoin [BTC] has hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $118k on the backdrop of strong ETF inflows and demand from treasury firms. On the 10th of July, U.S. spot ETFs attracted $1.18 billion in daily inflow, bringing monthly demand to $2.3 billion. In fact, that was the second-largest daily inflow since the products debuted in January 2024. Analytics firm Ecoinometrics said that the strong ETF demand could push BTC to $119K, citing its proprietary model data. Source: Ecoinometrics/X At the time of its post, BTC hovered at around $112K, and soon afterward, the asset extended its rally to $118.8K. The analytics firm said, “Bitcoin is already at an all-time high, and the macro backdrop is shifting into a full risk-on regime.” As expected, BlackRock’s IBIT led the Thursday demand, commanding nearly half of the inflows ($448.5 million). Fidelity’s FBTC followed closely at $324.34 million. Overall, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF recorded $5 billion in trading volume on the 10th of July, following $3.5 billion the day before, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The analyst projected that ETFs would likely hit a billion-dollar flow on Thursday and Friday. “When IBIT sees big volume surges on up price days it portends big boy flows (as seen in chart) = good chance we see $1b in flows over next two days. It’s also a hair away from $80b.” Source: Eric Balchunas/X As of press time, the first $1 billion flow had already been hit. If Friday’s session (July 11) rake in another $1 billion in ETF inflows, then BTC could likely tag $120K or zoom above it. The Options market data showed that the highest volume by strike for calls (bullish bets) was parked at $130K, $120K and $125K. These suggested that bulls were betting that BTC could extend the rally and hit these levels. Source: CoinGlass At the same time, the downside risk positioning showed that most puts (red, bearish bets) were piled at $102K and $100K. In other words, institutional players expected a floor price of $100K, meaning they viewed the level as the new support. Despite the bullish structure, there appeared to be one caveat worth tracking. CryptoQuant reported that the new ATH high had triggered miners to book profit, as indicated by the spike in Miner Position Index (MPI). Source: CryptoQuant While the metric’s reading was at 0.6 at the time of writing, an extended jump to 2 would mean a heightened miner sell-off. A similar move marked a local top back in May, and could be crucial to track.

She said that Gillen's rising aggression while they socialised in the club that evening was what had prompted her to leave, but that he had then arrived home full of fury. "I wanted my family to know the truth if I did not survive," she said, referring to the 40 minutes of the assault that she captured on her phone. "I’m the biggest white psychopath you’ll ever meet," he had told her. At one point, Gillen mockingly suggested that she ring Blackrock Garda Station, insinuating that nobody would help her if she did, because he was a serving garda. Ms Clinton said that she had to work out how she would escape from the home, where she had previously felt safe. "I thought of my children and grandchildren and made a break for it. I still have recurring nightmares where I did not get out," she explained. "Living with him took a deep emotional toll. I felt smaller and smaller all the time," she said. "The man I once loved became someone I feared." She said that she was in a state of heartbreak and vulnerability when he attacked her, having lost her sister, her mother, her best friend, as well as Gillen’s son, Cathal. "I’m not the person I was before this happened to me," she continued. She said that the horror of that night still affected and echoed through the lives of those she loved. "As a longstanding member of An Garda Síochána, he would present himself as a figure, someone to be believed and relied upon to uphold common decency and morality," she said. She said she had not included the most appalling part of what he had said about being a garda, but that they were in the recording. However, she said that he did not tarnish the reputation of An Garda Síochána, but just of himself. "I’m here for justice," she said, asking the court to take into account the enduring horror Gillen had caused. Kathleen Leader SC, defending, handed the court two testimonials and a psychologist’s report on behalf of her client, who she said was a deeply ashamed man and apologised for what he had put Ms Clinton through. She said he had faced a number of traumatic incidents in his 40 years with the force. They had taken their toll on him and probably hadn’t been dealt with as they should have been. She described the death of his son in the very recent past, while Gillen was on duty, as every guard’s and parent’s worst nightmare, and asked the court to take it into account. She said that he had retired from the gardaí on medical grounds. Counsel explained that Gillen was a former senior international bowler and a member of Blackrock Bowling Club, while his son had been involved in Cabinteely Soccer Club. He now works to prevent suicide through these clubs. "He has become involved as a person to speak to about mental health issues," she said. His two referees were in court to support him, she said, with one crediting her client with saving his life and the other saying that he had helped him in the prevention of suicide. "He was enduring a very traumatic event at the time," she said. "It was an out-of-character incident." She said that her client attends his GP and a psychiatrist, who told him that he was dealing with his trauma appropriately by helping others. Ms Leader quoted the psychologist’s report as saying Gillen was at a low risk of domestic violence in future, provided things are maintained as they are. "This was a man who was stressed at the time for very good reason, not appropriately dealing with the stress," she said. Passing sentence, Judge Martin Nolan said: "It seems only he knows why he attacked her. He beat her over a period of time and slapped her and made very serious threats that were believable. "This injured party was terrified, and she eventually made her escape." Judge Nolan said the background to this case is that this defendant is a retired member of An Garda Síochána. He said Gillen was a frontline garda who had to "make difficult decisions, and this can have an effect on a person". He also noted that Gillen was "visited with a tragic event with the death of his son, which must have affected him". He said there was a report before the court which outlined how this tragic incident impacted the defendant. The judge said the mitigation in this case is clear, that Gillen entered a guilty plea, there was a general level of cooperation, he has no record of conviction, and he has a good work history, all of which the court must acknowledge. Judge Nolan said: "I believe that he has crossed the custody threshold", noting that this is a very serious matter. "I don’t know what was going through his mind on that night," he said. Judge Nolan sentenced Gillen to four years in prison, but due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in his life, he suspended the final 28 months. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Proxy voting giants investigated by Missouri AG for misleading clients about their DEI and ESG priorities

Fox News Digital spoke to Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks at the State Financial Officers Foundation conference in Orlando, Florida FIRST ON FOX: Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey launched parallel investigations this week into two of the nation's leading proxy advisory companies, alleging they have abdicated their fiduciary duties and violated state consumer protection laws by misleading consumers about their prioritization of ideology over investor returns. Bailey argued in civil investigative demands sent to Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) that they are violating state consumer protection law by assuring their customers that their proxy voting recommendations are based solely on data and research – and are entirely neutral. But, simultaneously, Bailey argues that publicly available documents from the firms show that their proxy voting recommendations are designed to advance DEI and environmental causes regardless of whether they undermine investor returns. Glass Lewis and ISS are two foreign-owned powerhouses that control roughly 97% of the U.S. proxy advisory market, according to an April report from the House Financial Services Committee. The firms specialize in providing voting recommendations to institutional investors – such as pension funds, retirement systems and mutual funds – on how to vote during corporate shareholder meetings. These votes frequently include decisions related to board member elections, executive compensation, company policies and other proposals. BLACKROCK ADDS NEW PROXY ADVISORY FIRM AMID ESG CRITICISM AS LEADING EXPERT SAYS ‘TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE’ Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is accusing two major proxy advisory firms of misleading consumers by hiding their prioritization of DEI and ESG policies, even at the cost of investor returns. (iStock; Getty Images) "Missourians deserve answers as to why the unseen power brokers, controlling much of corporate America, are pushing a leftist worldview at the expense of millions of honest investors," Bailey said. "These are foreign-owned actors manipulating the U.S. economy, and we will not let them thrive any longer. We are going after the source. These proxy advisors have held corporate America hostage with their radical ideologies. We are putting them on notice: Missouri will not tolerate ideological coercion disguised as investment guidance." In an enforcement petition Bailey sent to the state circuit court in an effort to compel the companies' compliance with the new probes, the attorney general points to statements on both ISS and Glass Lewis's websites, respectively, that insist they provide "objective and impartial offerings" that are "based on research and data." At the same time, Bailey points to internal company documents, such as a document titled "2025 Benchmark Policy Guidelines" from Glass Lewis, which includes numerous sections on the importance of advancing DEI and ESG causes. "This means that Glass Lewis’s statement that it provides ‘research and data’ that allows its customers to ‘make informed investment decisions’ is false," Bailey wrote in his enforcement petition against Glass Lewis. SEVERAL STATE OFFICIALS DEMAND FEDS PROTECT AMERICANS' RETIREMENT PLANS BY CLEARLY REGULATING ESG INVESTMENTS Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey addresses members of the press in the old post office building in Downtown St. Louis on Thursday, Feb. 2, 2024. (Vanessa Abbitt/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/Tribune News Service via Getty Images ) Similarly, at ISS, Bailey points to company statements claiming it provides customers with "objective and impartial offerings," while simultaneously producing internal company reports that include commitments to recommending votes in favor of proposals "calling for the reduction of [greenhouse gas] emissions." In addition to allegedly misleading consumers about their company priorities, Bailey is accusing Glass Lewis and ISS of omitting or failing to disclose material information about how it weighs DEI and ESG standards when recommending votes. Bailey's investigation is requesting a range of internal documents and communications to help determine whether Glass Lewis or ISS violated state consumer protection laws through its allegedly misleading claims and lack of transparency. FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS HE IS PUTTING THE STATE’S WOKE COMPANIES ‘ON NOTICE’ Proxy advisory firms are key players in the American financial system, providing recommendations for institutional investors on how to cast their votes on critical shareholder resolutions and proposals. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) "ISS and Glass Lewis have been harming consumers and misleading institutional investors by promoting a radical political agenda instead of focusing on maximizing returns. By taking legal action against both firms, Attorney General Bailey is doing the right thing and holding them accountable for selfishly prioritizing racist DEI quotas, climate activism, and other outdated ESG nonsense," Will Hild, Executive Director at conservative nonprofit Consumers' Research said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "Such deception is not just financially reckless but also illegal and must be met with consequences," Hild continued. "This necessary investigation will aid in exposing these activist proxy advisors for deliberately ditching fiduciary duty in the name of furthering the ESG scam."

Earlier this year, Glass Lewis was served with a similar civil investigative demand by Florida's Republican Attorney General.

Title: The EU and the US May Be at Odds, but Is the Animosity Real?

US President Donald Trump secured his second term in office, and a new narrative has emerged. One in which the United States is at odds with the European Union. Alongside newly established 20% tariffs against EU goods, SignalGate painted Europe in unflattering terms during a group chat on the Signal messaging app, where US officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, participated. Vance and Hesgeth depicted EU/NATO allies as “freeloaders” and “pathetic”. At one point, Vance stated that he hates “bailing Europe out again”. This shift in rhetoric has not gone unnoticed abroad. In early March, French President Emmanuel Macron noted in a TV address that the West is entering “a new era”, in which the US may no longer be a trusted ally. That warning adds weight to speculation that Washington’s relationship with Europe may face a structural breakdown. Whether this conflict reflects genuine strategic divergence or a manufactured narrative requires further scrutiny. How much of that purported animosity is real? If it is real, will it lead to a permanent restructuring of world powers? If not, why does it seem so real? To untangle these critical questions, we must first examine the system that produces public belief: governance technology. Since the advent of mass media, governance has undergone permanent changes in its form, and in doing so, altered its nature as well. Walter Lippmann was one of the first to notice, in his 1922 book Public Opinion, that modern democracy relies on mass media. In turn, the mass media helps inform public opinion. However, as mass media consists of nodes that disseminate information to form public opinion, it follows that those who control the nodes control the public consciousness. If that is the case, democracy itself is simply a well-crafted illusion of agency. Key tools of power centralize mass media nodes. Noam Chomsky & Edward S. Herman further detailed this mechanism in their 1988 book Manufacturing Consent. Shoshana Zuboff is one of the latest contributors to this thesis with her 2018 book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, in which she warned that: Two men at Google who do not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercise control over the organization and presentation of the world’s information. One man at Facebook who does not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercises control over an increasingly universal means of social connection, along with the information concealed in its networks. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new agency launched in 2024, revealed just how deeply this control runs. Internal documents from DOGE show that governments worldwide use taxpayer money to fund propaganda and censorship operations without public consent. Even before DOGE, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg regretted his role in colluding with the government to enact mass censorship. It also seems that the division between capitalism and government may be a meaningless exercise, to the chagrin of Zuboff and her concept of “shareholder governance.” Yet, the underlying feature of this phenomenon, this governance technology, is clear. We can divide it into two key components: Specifically, the vast majority of people either lack the time or the cognitive capacity to pick up the implied messaging or delve into secondary information rails. Instead, they absorb only the surface-level messaging, which is visible and promoted by established authority nodes. This topic is also not new in literature, as Antonio Gramsci explored it in his 1929 Prison Notebooks. Gramsci described most people (peasantry, workers) as “subaltern groups”, dominated by the ruling class, whichever type it may be. At the end of the line, in terms of evolutionary biology, it appears that human societies mirror a dominance hierarchy. Perhaps Vilfredo Pareto summed it up best with his theory of the circulation of elites, which Robert Michels later framed as the “iron law of oligarchy” in his seminal 1911 work, Political Parties. Pareto’s theory implies that it is entirely irrelevant what kind of -ism runs society (communism, liberalism, capitalism) because an elite always rules the majority. Naturally, this would make “democracy” both practically and theoretically unfeasible. In this light, it is easy to see why dual-rail messaging and cognitive conversion have become pervasive in modern governance technology. One could even see “democracy” itself as an embedded part of dual-rail communication. One would be remiss not to revisit the most densely packed period in recorded history to point out governance technology in action — the highly anomalous 2020–2022 period. Not to delve too much, here are the basic outlines: This was a fantastic case study of dual-rail messaging and cognitive conversion. In the first half of 2020, it was already discernible that: Later, various countries acknowledged all of this through official statistics. Not only do mask mandates harm people, but vaccinations also do. Professor Stefan Homburg summarized these findings for Germany, which apply to other countries. Of course, the unprecedented coercive measures enacted during the pandemic narrative created the incentives for novel mRNA injections. It turned out in the most extensive vaccine safety study, covering 99 million people, that these injections are exceedingly dangerous, having increased myocarditis risk by 610% among many other conditions. However, as was the case during the entire pandemic narrative, warnings about such a scenario were present long before a single person received the shot. From a governance technology perspective, the pandemic narrative highlighted the following dynamic: To maintain a favorable cognitive conversion rate, global and unprecedented mass censorship had to occur as a matter of structural suppression. Otherwise, all the dissenting doctors, journalists and scientists, as authority nodes in their own right, had the potential to dilute the impact of the first rail messaging. To preserve Rail 1 dominance, it was necessary. Every Rail 1 claim collapsed post-factum, yet zero accountability followed. One could also see the Iraq War in the same light. The Rail 1 promoted the idea of “weapons of mass destruction,” but of course, no one ever found such things. Interestingly, the unprecedented mass censorship and coercion tactics were tonally off, potentially serving as a giant red flag. Yet, this too failed to disrupt the first rail messaging for most people. Again, this is another arrow in Michels’ “iron law of oligarchy” quiver. Now that we understand the key aspect of governance technology, what about the purported deterioration of relations between the EU and the US? The highlighting of nodes during the pandemic narrative is also helpful here. First, let’s review what the “pandemic” actually produced. Perhaps even more importantly, the pandemic narrative highlighted that all major nodes of messaging proliferation are US-centric: Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others.In concert with the US dollar being the world’s reserve currency, this affords the United States unmatched hegemonic power — cultural, economic, political and technological. Likewise, the Federal Reserve is effectively the world’s central bank. Case in point, just as the Fed launched the historic monetary intervention via BlackRock, so did the European Central Bank (ECB) when it launched the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). However, another intervention occurred that remains in the public spotlight, generating significant attention and influencing events. Overnight, the pandemic narrative shifted to the Russia–Ukraine conflict in February 2022: the same mediatic intensity, the same censorship, the same deplatforming, the same string of absurdities. The US State Department paved the road for this conflict back in 2014, led by Victoria Nuland, by toppling the pro-Russian Ukrainian government. Nuland supported the Maidan coup through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a CIA intervention front. At the revolving door point, William J. Burns is currently listed on NED’s official website under the “experts” section, having served as CIA director under the Biden administration. In this company, Nuland was recorded saying “fuck the EU” when discussing the post-toppling regime in Ukraine. Later on, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy ramped up hostilities toward the Russian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which prompted Russia’s direct involvement. Of course, the tie that binds all of these events is NATO’s expansion into Russia’s backyard, as NATO repeatedly broke assurances not to expand. Russia sees this as an existential threat because NATO is a US proxy. The overarching reasoning for all of this is simple. If there is an EU–Russian alliance, economically or politically, this would spell doom for US hegemony. After all, the combination of Russia’s vast land mass and resources with European technology and population density would make the US a second-rate power at best. With this in mind, how does this affect the present EU–US relations? Clumsy clues of deception In the last month, discussions about the EU rearming itself have dominated headlines. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the EU Commission and known for the Pfizergate scandal, announced an expenditure of up to €800 billion ($938,086,304,000) for this effort. The new America First realignment presents this as a consequence. To that end, do you know how the aforementioned leaks happened in which both the US Defence Secretary and Vice President maligned Europe? Well, they invited the Atlantic editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, into their Signal group chat. Again, dual-rail is afoot: Is there evidence for the Rail 2 this time? Just a month before Leyen’s rearming commitment, the US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth noted that the EU/US must establish a “division of labor that maximizes our comparative advantages in Europe and the Pacific, respectively.” The Pacific is a reference to the US shift from Ukraine to China and Taiwan. In other words, the US is using the EU as a counter to Russia’s interests, which leaves it with a larger budget to handle China. There is another deception clue in the mix, quite a big one. In September 2022, targeted bombings rendered the Nord Stream pipeline defunct. This was the key economic instrument that had the potential to bring the EU closer to Russia. Specifically, to bring Germany, the EU’s economic engine, closer to Russia. Ever since, without Russian cheap gas, Germany has been undergoing a rapid process of deindustrialization due to higher energy prices. Simultaneously, more entrepreneurs and industrialists are moving from EU nations to the US. Most tellingly, in its presentation of antagonism between the US and the EU among the European ruling class, there is not a single mention of this international act of terrorism that had such devastating economic consequences. It remains a mystery, as inquiries by the Swedish and Danish authorities yielded no results. Altogether, does this seem clumsy? The core problem is that such adjectives are not meaningful. From the perspective of people with a high cognitive ceiling, the entire pandemic narrative was extremely clumsy. Yet, it was successful nonetheless, still accepted and talked about as real by the majority. Such is the case with the most recent narrative about EU/US relations. The first rail absorbs, while the second delegates to the fringe. With the “iron rule of oligarchy” in mind, which excludes democracy as a coherent concept, it is increasingly apparent why both the EU and the US accrued such massive government deficits. To defend US hegemony, both in the intermediate and distant future. However, the US now holds all the cards. With tariff tools, President Trump can start reshoring American industry. And even without being beholden to the Federal Reserve, Europe faces a massive problem of bureaucratic parasitism, which disincentivizes taxation and undermines net-zero policies. While the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement and ramped up its “drill, baby, drill” approach, Europe is still on a path to net zero. This puts Europe at a severe and crippling disadvantage. One should also remember that Germany systemically denuclearized its power grid, despite this type of power being considered net zero. Without such suicidal policies, even the Nord Stream bombing would have had a muted effect. One wonders if there was external NED-like pressure for Germany’s denuclearization​​ to increase its vulnerabilities. Post-World War II, Europe entered into a vassal relationship with the US. This relationship has only grown stronger, owing to carefully nurtured American dominance in Big Tech, Big Bank and Big Pharma. The present framework doesn’t make the EU stronger but cements US dominance. Both Americans and Europeans have little to no input in what their respective governments do. That’s because the private-public ruling class easily deploys and controls narratives. In turn, a construction that enables people to work against themselves is all too readily available. With the dawn of AI that brings about algorithmic interception, such capacity is likely to increase further. The pandemic narrative and the complete absence of a meaningful response have vindicated Robert Michels, as we can confidently assert. In the new algorithmically powered governance, thoughts will be much easier to intercept. If someone intercepts them, they can modify their behavior accordingly. [Liam Roman edited this piece.] The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy. A lot of important truth here. At the core, industrial capitalism and democracy are incompatible. But we’re fed the lie that they are natural bedfellows. Gramsci was right: “the vast majority of people either lack the time or the cognitive capacity to pick up the implied messaging or delve into secondary information rails.” But unlike in Gramsci’s time when peasants and factory works literaly lacked both leisure time and education, the advent of the abundantly supplied consumer society — inducing habits of hedonistic indiviualism — has effectively limited and maybe even annihilated a leisured population’s “cognitive capacity.” And, yes manufacturing consent has now become a science as well as a strategic discipline for both government and business.I’m not sure it’s about “intercepting” thoughts, however. Rather, it appears to be more about preventing any kind of structured thinking from being widely shared. Let it play out freely on alternative media and then ignore it!

A MAN HAS been jailed for 20 months for attacking and threatening to kill his then partner in their home at a time when he was a serving garda. Ian Gillen of Carysfort Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin was before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court today, where he pleaded guilty to threatening to kill or cause serious harm to Jennifer Clinton on December 23, 2021, at Trafalgar Lane, Monkstown, and to assaulting Ms Clinton on the same occasion. After hearing facts in the case yesterday, Judge Martin Nolan adjourned the case overnight. Today, Judge Nolan said the custody threshold had been crossed in this case, noting that he had considered the facts of the case, Gillen’s circumstances and mitigation. He imposed a prison sentence of four years, with the final 28 months suspended on strict conditions due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in Gillen’s life. Inspector Rachael Kilpatrick testified yesterday that the couple had socialised together that evening in Blackrock Tennis and Bowling Club, where they were members. They had gone home separately, with Ms Clinton arriving home first. Ms Clinton told gardaí that when Gillen arrived home, he called her downstairs to sit on a pouffe by the fireside, where he stood over her in an intimidating manner, rebuking her and calling her names. “Jen, I’m going to rip your head off,” he had said, putting her in fear, and prompting her to make an audio recording of the rest of the incident on her mobile phone, should she not survive. He punched her with a closed fist three times on top of her head. In an effort to get away, she said she needed to go to the toilet, but he refused to let her go. She eventually managed to go, locked the bathroom door behind her, and cleared the windowsill so she’d have a route out. She eventually made her way out of the house. She had managed to record 40 minutes of the threats. An attempt was made to play this in court, but it was not possible due to technical difficulties. A transcript of the recording was handed to the judge instead. Ms Clinton described Gillen’s conduct as pure anger. She said that any time she tried to get up, he kept telling her to sit back down. “You’re going to die tonight,” he told her three times. He also said that he was going to die that night, and she believed her life was in serious danger. After she escaped, Gillen was arrested for coercive control, was interviewed, and the recording was played to him. He was embarrassed and said it wasn’t in him to hit her, but indicated it was another person in his body. “He was shocked by his own behaviour,” said Inspector Kilpatrick. Gillen accepted that he could snap and be angry with drink. He said he had issues in his background, including the death of his son, which caused him to drink. He has since retired and has no previous convictions. Under cross-examination by the defence, the inspector agreed that Gillen had been a front-line garda for 40 years and had dealt with a lot of stressful situations. She accepted that it was in the line of duty that he had to deal with his son taking his own life in his early 20s. Gillen was the first responder on the scene. His mental health deteriorated, and he relied on alcohol. Ms Clinton entered the witness box to deliver an emotional victim impact statement, having to take a break to dry her tears at one stage. She said that her life had been marked by fear and deep trauma since the prolonged assault, when she felt overpowered and trapped. She said she still lived with the consequences every day, having been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. “I live in a state of hypervigilance,” she said. “I lost my confidence. The memory of that night is etched into my mind and body like the cross he etched into the front door of our shared home one night in a rage”. She said that Gillen’s rising aggression while they socialised in the club that evening was what had prompted her to leave, but that he had then arrived home full of fury. “I wanted my family to know the truth if I did not survive,” she said, referring to the 40 minutes of the assault that she captured on her phone. Advertisement “I’m the biggest white psychopath you’ll ever meet,” he had told her. At one point, Gillen mockingly suggested that she ring Blackrock Garda Station, insinuating that nobody would help her if she did, because he was a serving garda. Ms Clinton said that she had to work out how she would escape from the home, where she had previously felt safe. “I thought of my children and grandchildren and made a break for it. I still have recurring nightmares where I did not get out,” she explained. “Living with him took a deep emotional toll. I felt smaller and smaller all the time,” she said. “The man I once loved became someone I feared.” She said that she was in a state of heartbreak and vulnerability when he attacked her, having lost her sister, her mother, her best friend, as well as Gillen’s son, Cathal. “I’m not the person I was before this happened to me,” she continued. She said that the horror of that night still affected and echoed through the lives of those she loved. “As a longstanding member of An Garda Síochána, he would present himself as a figure, someone to be believed and relied upon to uphold common decency and morality,” she said. She said she had not included the most appalling part of what he had said about being a garda, but that they were in the recording. However, she said that he did not tarnish the reputation of An Garda Síochána, but just of himself. “I’m here for justice,” she said, asking the court to take into account the enduring horror Gillen had caused. Kathleen Leader SC, defending, handed the court two testimonials and a psychologist’s report on behalf of her client, who she said was a deeply ashamed man and apologised for what he had put Ms Clinton through. She said he had faced a number of traumatic incidents in his 40 years with the force. They had taken their toll on him and probably hadn’t been dealt with as they should have been. She described the death of his son in the very recent past, while Gillen was on duty, as every guard’s and parent’s worst nightmare, and asked the court to take it into account. She said that he had retired from the gardaí on medical grounds. Counsel explained that Gillen was a former senior international bowler and a member of Blackrock Bowling Club, while his son had been involved in Cabinteely Soccer Club. He now works to prevent suicide through these clubs. “He has become involved as a person to speak to about mental health issues,” she said. His two referees were in court to support him, she said, with one crediting her client with saving his life and the other saying that he had helped him in the prevention of suicide. “He was enduring a very traumatic event at the time,” she said. “It was an out-of-character incident.” She said that her client attends his GP and a psychiatrist, who told him that he was dealing with his trauma appropriately by helping others. Ms Leader quoted the psychologist’s report as saying Gillen was at a low risk of domestic violence in future, provided things are maintained as they are. “This was a man who was stressed at the time for very good reason, not appropriately dealing with the stress,” she said. Passing sentence today, Judge Martin Nolan said, “It seems only he knows why he attacked her. He beat her over a period of time and slapped her and made very serious threats that were believable”. He said, “This injured party was terrified, and she eventually made her escape”. Judge Nolan said the background to this case is that this defendant is a retired member of An Garda Síochána. He said Gillen was a front-line garda who had to “make difficult decisions, and this can have an effect on a person.” He also noted that Gillen was “visited with a tragic event with the death of his son, which must have affected him”. He said there was a report before the court which outlined how this tragic incident impacted the defendant. The judge said the mitigation in this case is clear: Gillen entered a guilty plea, there was a general level of cooperation, he has no record of conviction, and he has a good work history, all of which the court must acknowledge. Judge Nolan said, “I believe that he has crossed the custody threshold”, noting that this is a very serious matter. He said, “I don’t know what was going through his mind on that night”. Judge Nolan sentenced Gillen to four years in prison, but due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in his life, he suspended the final 28 months for 28 months.

The massive inflows to Bitcoin ETFs were led by BlackRock's IBIT with $448.5 million, followed by Fidelity's FBTC at $324.3 million and ARK's ARKB with $268.7 million, according to Farside Investors data. Even with $40.2 million in outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC, total net flows turned sharply positive. The influx comes as Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $118,000 Friday morning, pushing total net inflows across all U.S. Bitcoin ETFs above $50 billion since their launch last January. Ethereum ETFs locked in $383 million in net inflows on Thursday, their second-highest day on record, dominated by BlackRock’s ETHA with $300.9 million in inflows, per Farside Investors data. The biggest day for spot Bitcoin ETFs was on November 7, with $1.374 billion in inflows following Trump's election victory. "The recent surge in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs signals a significant shift in how large capital allocators are engaging with the digital asset space," Charmaine Tam, head of OTC sales and trading at Hex Trust, told Decrypt. "It reflects a disciplined approach to capital allocation into custody-grade, regulated vehicles." Tam said the institutional embrace gained momentum following the SEC's July 1st guidance on crypto ETF disclosure standards, providing the “regulatory clarity” that risk-averse allocators demanded. "Looking ahead, this momentum could unlock substantial incremental institutional allocation potential, estimated to be in the range of $8-$10 billion in the second half of 2025," she said. Bitcoin is currently trading at $117,899 according to CoinGecko data, having surged to a new all-time high of $118,667 Friday morning. "What stands out is that this buying pressure is occurring even as BTC trades in a tight range near all-time highs, suggesting that the bid is less about chasing momentum and more about strategic allocation,” Chris Colman, Head of Trading, APAC at Gemini, told Decrypt. Colman noted that "spot ETFs now manage close to $150 billion in assets, and because they require the actual purchase of Bitcoin, these inflows represent real demand—not just synthetic exposure." “Macro conditions are supporting the bid," he said, with softer yields and a stable Fed outlook encouraging rotation into "alternatives with asymmetric upside." The supply-demand imbalance triggered massive forced selling, with short sellers getting crushed as Bitcoin surged to new highs. Over $1.14 billion in crypto short positions were liquidated in 24 hours, with Bitcoin shorts bearing the brunt at $679.8 million as the asset demolished resistance levels, per CoinGlass data. The combination of institutional ETF flows, corporate treasury adoption, and retail FOMO has created what Tam describes as "float-adjusted scarcity" premium. Both institutional and retail investors are “bullish on a short term interest rate cut, based on the latest developments around the Fed chair,” Ganesh Mahidhar, investment professional at Further Ventures, told Decrypt. “This is also being supported by more BTC strategies being announced," he added. President Donald Trump ratcheted up pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell Thursday, demanding rate cuts in a Truth Social post: “"Too Late" DEMEANS THE GREAT CREDIT OF THE USA... LOWER THE RATE!!!" Users of on-chain prediction market Myriad are split, with 43.1% predicting the Fed will cut rates in July, while 35.7% of predictors expect no change. The administration also opened a new front against Powell, with Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought accusing the Fed chair of "grossly mismanaging" the central bank and citing a "pricey and ostentatious" $2.5 billion headquarters renovation, roughly $700 million over budget.

US stock market futures fell after President Donald Trump announced a 35% tariff on Canada, starting August 1, intensifying global trade concerns. Despite positive earnings from companies like Delta and Levi Strauss, investor sentiment weakened as Trump warned of more tariffs on key trading partners including the EU, Japan, and Brazil. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures slipped by 0.6% or more early Friday. Meanwhile, all eyes are on next week's CPI data and Q2 earnings from major banks. Oil prices ticked higher on Russia sanction talks, but growth worries persist. This evolving trade agenda has markets on edge.

Title: The Big Bad Republican Bill Wasn’t Regressive Enough for the Anti-Tax Crusaders
URL: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/index-capital-gains-inflation-republican-bill-regressive-antitax-grover-norquist/

Full Content:
Mother Jones illustration; Samuel Corum/Getty It is apparently not enough for America’s anti-tax crusaders that Congress just passed one of the most expensive and regressive tax bills in our history. The Washington Post reports that Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform and other conservative groups are now urging the Trump administration to change how investment profits are taxed—unilaterally, if need be—in a way that would overwhelmingly favor the wealthiest Americans. Sound familiar? Namely, they want to index capital gains to inflation. Suppose I bought $100,000 worth of Apple stock on July 10, 2020, and kept it. Today, I could sell that stock for $170,383—a tidy $70,383 profit. That’s a 74 percent overall return and an average annual return of 11.7 percent. Pretty good, right? Not good enough for Norquist et al. These players want to let me adjust the “cost basis”—the price I originally paid for the stock—for inflation. Using this inflation calculator, I could then tell the IRS that my initial $100k investment was in fact a $120,407 investment, and so my profit for tax purposes is only $40,976. This is insane—for several reasons. First, read the room. Congress just passed a megabill whose benefits are deeply skewed in favor of the wealthy. Its tax provisions and spending cuts, taken together, will result in a 4 percent increase in average after-tax income for the richest 1 percent of American households and a nearly 4 percent decrease for the poorest 20 percent, based on the Yale Budget Lab’s analysis. This is very, very unpopular. The bill will add at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt—more like $5 trillion if expiring provisions are extended in the coming years. And indexing capital gains to inflation, according to 2018 estimates from the Tax Policy Center and the Penn Wharton Budget Model, would add yet another $100 billion to $200 billion to the tab—with the richest 1 percent reaping 86 percent of the benefits. “I don’t think reducing [capital gains rates further] will change investor behavior,” says billionaire Mark Cuban. Norquist told the Washington Post he recently spoke with President Donald Trump and recommended the president implement the change with an executive order. Indexing capital gains to inflation was considered during Trump’s first term, the Post‘s Jeff Stein reports, but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin felt Congress should handle it—current secretary Scott Bessent may prove more compliant. “I said something like, ‘Mr. President, after we do the bill, we will need more economic growth,” Norquist told Stein. “The Big Beautiful Bill is very pro-growth, but with this, we can have even more growth.’” In reality, not one of the Republican tax packages enacted since Ronald Reagan became president has lived up to its sponsors’ economic promises. “The economy may well enjoy a sugar-high the next couple of years, as borrowing stimulates near-term consumption,” Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement after Congress passed the “One Bie Beautiful Bill” on July 3. “But a sugar-high won’t be sustained, it will do real damage, and often what comes next is the crash.” As for the notion of indexing fueling “more growth,” the billionaire investor Mark Cuban told me in an email that he thinks the current tax rates on capital gains are fair, and “I don’t think reducing it will change investor behavior.” (He added that he would support even lower rates—even zero—under certain circumstances, for ordinary employees of a company that gets liquidated, as a way to reduce wealth inequality.) Yet the fairness of those rates—and their justification—is the subject of fierce debate. Suppose I’m a wealthy investor and I sell assets I’ve held for at least 12 months—stocks, bonds, real estate, or even, say, a stud racehorse—netting my family $1,000,000 in profits. The federal tax on those capital gains ranges from zero for the first $94,000 to 20 percent for the portion that exceeds $583,750. Because my spouse and I have income of more than $250,000, we also have to pay a 3.8 percent “net investment income tax.” This all adds up to an effective tax rate of about 19 percent. But tax rates for wage income are much higher. A couple reporting $1,000,000 in salary income pays an effective rate of about 30 percent. That’s a huge difference, and part of why families whose money comes primarily from asset growth have amassed wealth so much faster than working families have. It no lefty exaggeration to say America’s economic system is rigged against workers and in favor of investors. It’s right there in the tax code. “This kind of proposal will only widen the economic inequality we’re facing.” So how do conservative policy wonks justify the low capital gains rates? A key argument, interestingly, is that inflation eats away at the value of long-term gains. One “solution” would be to index the gains to inflation, notes the libertarian Cato Institute, “but most countries instead roughly compensate” by offering reduced tax rates for investors. And now the anti-taxers want to have it both ways. Investors enjoy other economic advantages, too. Notably, their gains are counted as income only when the assets are sold. In practice, this allows people with a large portfolio of appreciated assets to borrow against their holdings at single-digit interest rates and live off those loans instead of selling assets and paying a double-digit tax. As ProPublica discovered, many of America’s wealthiest families have been doing precisely that. (As a result, from 2014 to 2018, Jeff Bezos paid an effective income tax rate of less than 1 percent.) Or say you have a $100 investment that grows by 10 percent a year during a period of 2 percent annual inflation. The first year’s profit, after inflation, is $8. “But I don’t pay tax on that $8 until I sell, which may be decades later,” says Bob Lord a former tax attorney and associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies. “I’m basically getting a free ride on the appreciation of that $8 portion of my investment.” Doesn’t that benefit, he asks, more than offset any detriment from inflation? And also, isn’t investing supposed to contain an element of risk management? Isn’t the ability to beat inflation part of what separates a savvy investor from a useless one? Indexing for inflation, combined with favorable tax capital gains rates and an exemption for unrealized gains—doesn’t that basically reduce investing to shooting fish in a barrel? It is worth noting, too, that most Americans work for a paycheck, and the ones who make their living via investing are by and large quite wealthy. More than half of Americans now own some stock, but not much. As of January 2024, per Federal Reserve data, 93 percent of US stock holdings were owned by the most affluent 10 percent of the population, and the richest 1 percent owned more than half of all public equities—not to mention private equities. Indexing gains to inflation “would really codify the notion that income taxes are only for people who work for a living,” says Morris Pearl, a former managing director at BlackRock and current chairman of the board of Patriotic Millionaires, a nonprofit that advocates for higher taxes on the rich. If the Trump administration were to attempt the change Norquist recommended—unilaterally or otherwise—its not even clear how it would work. You would presumably need to make changes on both the profit and loss sides of a balance sheet. Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, has concluded that indexing is complex and unlikely to generate significant economic impact, and is therefore “more trouble than it’s worth.” “Indexing has been rejected in the past to avoid opening new tax shelters,” says Steven Rosenthal, a Washington tax policy expert and former legislation counsel for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “If investors were permitted to index their assets, but not required to index their liabilities, debt-financed investments would explode. Investors could exclude profits and deduct interest. But indexing both assets and liabilities is a mess, which I, as a congressional staffer, discovered when we tried to draft it.” “This kind of proposal will only widen the economic inequality we’re facing,” adds Patriotic Millionaires’ Pearl. “It’s absurd that all I would need to do is buy property that I can rent out, and make a lot of money, and never have to pay taxes again!” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

Title: EU ‘has no money except for war’ – Hungarian official
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/621327-hungary-eu-ukraine-fund/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T09:58:50Z
Full Content:
The EU is placing Ukraine’s military needs above the priorities of the bloc’s member states, Hungarian government adviser Balazs Orban has said. He accused EU leaders of always finding money for “war” but not other causes. Leaders of EU nations are considering the creation of a new €100 billion ($117 billion) fund under the bloc’s upcoming seven-year budget to cover expenses for the Ukrainian government, Bloomberg reported this week, citing people familiar with the discussions. Budapest, however, has been a vocal critic of the bloc’s approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict since its onset. “Europe has run out of money – except when it comes to war. There is always 100 billion euros for that,” Orban wrote on Wednesday on social media. He warned that such an allocation of funds would likely lead to further proposals to spend EU taxpayers’ money on Ukraine. Orban pointed to Kiev’s estimate that it would require $1 trillion over 14 years for reconstruction and modernization, a figure shared by Prime Minister Denis Shmigal during a donors conference in Rome this week. “While Europe cannot climb out of its own economic, social and security crisis, Brussels would continue to finance the war – weapons instead of peace, new debt instead of a competitive Europe,” Orban said. Last week, Bloomberg reported that US investment firm BlackRock had abandoned efforts to attract private investors for a Ukraine reconstruction program. The fund was expected to be launched at the Rome conference, but potential participants reportedly expressed “a lack of interest amid increased uncertainty” over the country’s future. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky said at the event that “only friends are invited” to help rebuild the country. He reiterated his call to confiscate Russian state assets frozen by Western nations and transfer them to Kiev. Moscow has warned that such actions would constitute international theft. EU members have voiced concern that expropriating Russian assets could significantly erode global confidence in their financial systems. As an alternative, Ukraine’s backers have been imposing a “windfall tax” on profits from the immobilized Russian funds and channeling the money to Kiev – an approach Moscow has described as another form of criminality. Hungary has accused the EU leadership of inflicting major economic harm on member states through sanctions on Russia, and of wasting resources on a war effort that it argues cannot deliver a military victory over Moscow.

The uptrend remains intact as long as BTC holds above $1,13,500. Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of above $1,16,000, marking a 101 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) gain. With momentum intact, Bitcoin could next target $1,20,000, and possibly more, if ETF inflows and macro conditions stay supportive. The Fear & Greed Index now signals “greed,” reflecting strong investor sentiment and sustained buying interest, observed Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO of Mudrex. He added that institutional participation remains a key driver, with $1.52 billion flowing into crypto funds over the last five trading days. Pankaj Balani, CEO & Co-Founder of Delta Exchange, expressed optimism on the next leg targeting $1,30,000 and beyond, with support from macro conditions and ETF inflows. A sudden surge in Bitcoin’s price triggered a short squeeze, where traders betting against it were forced to buy back in, resulting in over $1 billion in losses and accelerating the rally. The uptrend remains intact as long as BTC holds above $1,13,500. Ethereum’s breakout past $3,000 and its brief lead over Bitcoin in futures volume at $62.1 billion reflects increasing risk appetite and expanding trader interest in ETH derivatives, Balani also said. Many altcoins followed the broader market uptrend, with GRIFFAIN, SAGA, GOAT, and SEIU rallying more than 20 per cent. “If Bitcoin keeps climbing, altcoins could see a surge in optimism and potentially even larger gains.” Institutional demand remains a major driver of this momentum, with US Bitcoin ETFs surpassing $50 billion in net inflows to date. Himanshu Maradiya, Founder & Chairman, CIFDAQ shared that BlackRock alone holds over $65 billion in BTC, while corporate treasuries continue to accumulate. Macroeconomic shifts including a weaker dollar, rising treasury demand, and sovereign credit downgrades are further positioning BTC as a hedge. Ashish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch, attributed the rise in institutional demand to more favourable signals from the Trump administration in the US. “This rally is not just about price; it reflects how crypto is maturing into a recognised asset class within the global financial system. With smart regulations, policy clarity, and support for homegrown innovation, India can become a global leader in crypto innovation. India can’t afford to be on the sidelines and a time-bound plan to regulate crypto in India is the need of the hour. On the investor side, it’s encouraging to see most portfolios in green,” he said.

Title: Melting glaciers awaken hundreds of dormant volcanoes, threatening global chaos
URL: https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-07-11-melting-glaciers-awaken-hundreds-of-dormant-volcanoes.html
Time Published: 2025-07-11T06:00:00Z

Key points: Glacier melt is destabilizing volcanoes, triggering more frequent and explosive eruptions. Historical data reveals that rapid ice loss following the last ice age unleashed violent volcanic activity â a pattern repeating today. High-risk zones include North America, New Zealand, Russia, and Antarctica, where pressure shifts threaten dormant magma reservoirs. Underground nuclear tests and deep drilling may artificially hasten volcanic awakenings, with catastrophic environmental consequences. Governments and corporations remain dangerously unprepared for the cascading effects of multiple eruptions, including climate disruption and mass displacement. Ice retreat, volcanic awakening: A ticking time bomb A groundbreaking study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison has revealed a chilling connection: As glaciers vanish, the suppression they once exerted on magma chambers beneath them weakens, allowing pent-up gases and molten rock to expand explosively. By analyzing crystal formations in Chilean volcanoes, researchers confirmed that rapid glacial retreat 18,000 years ago led to volcanic eruptions of unprecedented scale â a phenomenon poised to repeat itself. "Glaciers act like a lid on a pressure cooker," explained geologist Pablo Moreno-Yaeger. "When that lid melts away, the buildup beneath can detonate violently." His teamâs findings suggest that regions once blanketed by thick ice â such as North Americaâs Cascade Range, Russiaâs Kamchatka Peninsula, and New Zealandâs Taup? Volcanic Zone â are now primed for disaster. Even more alarming? The Antarctic ice sheets, which conceal dozens of hidden volcanoes, are melting at accelerating rates, raising fears of a continent-wide eruption cycle never witnessed by modern civilization. Human meddling: Hastening nature's wrath Human interference deep within the Earthâs crust may be exacerbating the danger. Since the mid-20th century, underground nuclear tests have unleashed shockwaves powerful enough to fracture tectonic fault lines â potentially destabilizing nearby volcanic systems. Meanwhile, large-scale drilling projects â whether for oil, geothermal energy, or carbon sequestration â puncture fragile geological layers, creating pathways for magma to surge toward the surface. Evidence of this tampering already exists. In 1961, the Soviet Unionâs Tsar Bomba â the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated â triggered seismic waves equivalent to a magnitude-5.0 earthquake. More recently, the controversial HAARP program in Alaska, designed to manipulate the ionosphere, has been accused of inducing seismic disturbances near volcanic zones. "When we bombard the Earth with these unnatural forces, we gamble with forces we barely understand," warns seismologist Dr. Ken McGee. "A single misplaced detonation or drill hole could be the spark that lights the fuse." Human activities â such as fluid injection, extraction, reservoir impoundment, and mining â can induce earthquakes, a phenomenon known as induced seismicity. Fluid injection: Pumping fluids (e.g., fracking wastewater, geothermal injection) deep underground increases pore pressure in rock formations, lubricating faults and prompting slippage that results in earthquakes. Fluid extraction: Removing large volumes of oil, gas, or groundwater alters crustal stress patterns, destabilizing fault zones and potentially triggering seismic events. Reservoir impoundment: The immense weight of water in dammed reservoirs shifts stress on underlying faults, occasionally causing earthquakes. Mining: Excavation disrupts the stress equilibrium of rock masses, leading to small tremors or earthquakes. Global unpreparedness The grim reality is this: Global disaster response systems are woefully unequipped for a wave of super-eruptions. The 2010 eruption of Icelandâs EyjafjallajÃ¶kullâa relatively minor eventâgrounded air traffic across Europe for weeks, costing billions in economic losses. A Yellowstone-scale event, by comparison, could blanket the U.S. Midwest in ash, collapse supply chains, and trigger mass famine. Yet instead of investing in decentralized survival strategies â such as natural medicine stockpiles, community-based food reserves, and independent energy grids â governments funnel trillions into militarization and corporate bailouts. Private contractors like BlackRock and Halliburton already position themselves to monopolize on reconstruction efforts. Meanwhile, the same elites pushing climate lockdowns and digital IDs quietly purchase underground bunkersâluxury shelters where they plan to ride out the chaos they helped unleash. The awakening of Earthâs slumbering giants is no longer a question of if but when. Survival demands an immediate rejection of the corrupt institutions that downplay these threats â and a return to self-reliance, truth-telling, and natural resilience.

The 2010 eruption of Icelandâs EyjafjallajÃ¶kullâa relatively minor eventâgrounded air traffic across Europe for weeks, costing billions in economic losses. A Yellowstone-scale event, by comparison, could blanket the U.S. Midwest in ash, collapse supply chains, and trigger mass famine. Yet instead of investing in decentralized survival strategies â such as natural medicine stockpiles, community-based food reserves, and independent energy grids â governments funnel trillions into militarization and corporate bailouts. Private contractors like BlackRock and Halliburton already position themselves to monopolize on reconstruction efforts. Meanwhile, the same elites pushing climate lockdowns and digital IDs quietly purchase underground bunkersâluxury shelters where they plan to ride out the chaos they helped unleash. The awakening of Earthâs slumbering giants is no longer a question of if but when. Survival demands an immediate rejection of the corrupt institutions that downplay these threats â and a return to self-reliance, truth-telling, and natural resilience. Sources include: Dailymail.co.uk ScienceDaily.com TheIndependent.com Glacier melt is destabilizing volcanoes, triggering more frequent and explosive eruptions. Historical data reveals that rapid ice loss following the last ice age unleashed violent volcanic activity â a pattern repeating today. High-risk zones include North America, New Zealand, Russia, and Antarctica, where pressure shifts threaten dormant magma reservoirs. Underground nuclear tests and deep drilling may artificially hasten volcanic awakenings, with catastrophic environmental consequences. Governments and corporations remain dangerously unprepared for the cascading effects of multiple eruptions, including climate disruption and mass displacement. Ice retreat, volcanic awakening: A ticking time bomb A groundbreaking study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison has revealed a chilling connection: As glaciers vanish, the suppression they once exerted on magma chambers beneath them weakens, allowing pent-up gases and molten rock to expand explosively. By analyzing crystal formations in Chilean volcanoes, researchers confirmed that rapid glacial retreat 18,000 years ago led to volcanic eruptions of unprecedented scale â a phenomenon poised to repeat itself. "Glaciers act like a lid on a pressure cooker," explained geologist Pablo Moreno-Yaeger. "When that lid melts away, the buildup beneath can detonate violently." His teamâs findings suggest that regions once blanketed by thick ice â such as North Americaâs Cascade Range, Russiaâs Kamchatka Peninsula, and New Zealandâs Taup? Volcanic Zone â are now primed for disaster. Even more alarming? The Antarctic ice sheets, which conceal dozens of hidden volcanoes, are melting at accelerating rates, raising fears of a continent-wide eruption cycle never witnessed by modern civilization. Human meddling: Hastening nature's wrath Human interference deep within the Earthâs crust may be exacerbating the danger. Since the mid-20th century, underground nuclear tests have unleashed shockwaves powerful enough to fracture tectonic fault lines â potentially destabilizing nearby volcanic systems. Meanwhile, large-scale drilling projects â whether for oil, geothermal energy, or carbon sequestration â puncture fragile geological layers, creating pathways for magma to surge toward the surface. Evidence of this tampering already exists. In 1961, the Soviet Unionâs Tsar Bomba â the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated â triggered seismic waves equivalent to a magnitude-5.0 earthquake. More recently, the controversial HAARP program in Alaska, designed to manipulate the ionosphere, has been accused of inducing seismic disturbances near volcanic zones. "When we bombard the Earth with these unnatural forces, we gamble with forces we barely understand," warns seismologist Dr. Ken McGee. "A single misplaced detonation or drill hole could be the spark that lights the fuse." Human activities â such as fluid injection, extraction, reservoir impoundment, and mining â can induce earthquakes, a phenomenon known as induced seismicity. Fluid injection: Pumping fluids (e.g., fracking wastewater, geothermal injection) deep underground increases pore pressure in rock formations, lubricating faults and prompting slippage that results in earthquakes. Fluid extraction: Removing large volumes of oil, gas, or groundwater alters crustal stress patterns, destabilizing fault zones and potentially triggering seismic events. Reservoir impoundment: The immense weight of water in dammed reservoirs shifts stress on underlying faults, occasionally causing earthquakes. Mining: Excavation disrupts the stress equilibrium of rock masses, leading to small tremors or earthquakes.

Global unpreparedness The grim reality is this: Global disaster response systems are woefully unequipped for a wave of super-eruptions. The 2010 eruption of Icelandâs EyjafjallajÃ¶kullâa relatively minor eventâgrounded air traffic across Europe for weeks, costing billions in economic losses. A Yellowstone-scale event, by comparison, could blanket the U.S. Midwest in ash, collapse supply chains, and trigger mass famine. Yet instead of investing in decentralized survival strategies â such as natural medicine stockpiles, community-based food reserves, and independent energy grids â governments funnel trillions into militarization and corporate bailouts. Private contractors like BlackRock and Halliburton already position themselves to monopolize on reconstruction efforts. Meanwhile, the same elites pushing climate lockdowns and digital IDs quietly purchase underground bunkersâluxury shelters where they plan to ride out the chaos they helped unleash. The awakening of Earthâs slumbering giants is no longer a question of if but when. Survival demands an immediate rejection of the corrupt institutions that downplay these threats â and a return to self-reliance, truth-telling, and natural resilience.

Fluid extraction: Removing large volumes of oil, gas, or groundwater alters crustal stress patterns, destabilizing fault zones and potentially triggering seismic events.
