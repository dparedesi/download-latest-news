LAST UPDATE | 28 Jan CORK GAA HAVE responded to RTÉ’s claim that the county ‘could not accommodate’ televised coverage of Saturday night’s hurling league showdown with Limerick. Rebels officials have revealed that the Division 1A fixture was not chosen for TV coverage at its designated throw-in time of 7.30pm, and that they were asked to bring the game forward to facilitate broadcasters. Cork say that they declined to do so on the basis that the game would then clash with Ireland’s Six Nations opener against England, which kicks off at 4.45pm on Saturday. Over 20,000 tickets have been sold for the game with only terrace tickets at the Blackrock End still available. The game is not scheduled for live TV or streaming coverage, with RTÉ showing Armagh against Tyrone in Division 1 of the football league at 6pm, while TG4 have Donegal against Dublin in football live at 7.30pm. Earlier on Tuesday, RTÉ said that they “sought Cork-Limerick in the Allianz Hurling League as our match selection a number of months ago but the counties could not accommodate. Advertisement “RTÉ subsequently chose Armagh-Tyrone.” Cork CEO Kevin O’Donovan said: “Having been particularly surprised to hear from Croke Park a number of weeks ago that Cork v Limerick was not to be the chosen game by broadcasters at the appointed time on Saturday, February 1st @7.30pm, we were then asked if we wished to consider changing our game to an earlier time to facilitate broadcast. “As this alternative time clashed directly with the Ireland v England Rugby game on the same evening, we sought not to deprive our own supporters of seeing both games. “We remain disappointed that our fixture will not be televised at the appointed time, but look forward to another spectacle with a packed house here at SuperValu Páirc Uí Chaoimh on Saturday next.” RTÉ sought Cork-Limerick in the Allianz Hurling League as our match selection a number of months ago but the counties could not accommodate.

The combined capacity of the North Stand and South Stand at Páirc Uí Chaoimh is for 21,000 spectators, which will see the game surpass the 19,516 that attended the last league fixture between the counties at the stadium in February 2023, when Cork won out 2-17 to 0-22. In February 2020, when the teams met on a Sunday afternoon at the stadium in the league, Limerick defeated Cork 0-29 to 2-21 before a crowd of 11,212.

By Blizzard Entertainment 1 day ago Every year, the druids of Moonglade celebrate their city’s great triumph over an ancient evil. During the Lunar Festival, citizens of Azeroth have the opportunity to honor their elders by celebrating their sage wisdom, sharing in magnificent feasts…and, of course, lighting fireworks. The celebration has begun in Moonglade, and your Lunar Festival Invitation is waiting. Join in the fun by dressing up in your Lunar Festival finery, launching fireworks, and paying homage to the Elders throughout Azeroth. When: January 28–February 11 Where: Moonglade, with camps in Ironforge, Stormwind, Darnassus, Thunder Bluff, Orgrimmar, Dragon Isles zones, Khaz Algar zones, and the Undercity Currency: Coin of Ancestry Khaz Algar is joining in Lunar New Year festivities as eight new Elders (two per zone) make their way to the island, bringing with them a new Achievement, "Elders of Khaz Algar," and a new reward for trading in Coins of Ancestry, the Lunar Launcher. "It's always a festival when you are on the Lunar Launcher." The Lunar Festival is a time of celebration for the peoples of Azeroth. At the beginning of each year, elders of generations past manifest around the world to impart their wisdom upon all who listen. Should you encounter these venerable spirits in your travels and take the time to heed their words, they may even pass along tokens of their gratitude—Coins of Ancestry, the lessons of a past age in physical form. Gather enough Coins of Ancestry and the Cenarion Circle will open their stores of celebratory garb, fireworks, trinkets, and recipes! The Cenarion Circle has good cause to celebrate, for the Lunar Festival marks the return of many Ancients that fell in battles past: Goldrinn, Malorne, Aviana, and Cenarius himself. But this celebration is darkened by the eternal torment of one of their own—Omen, a wolf Ancient blessed by the moon goddess Elune, has risen from the depths of Moonglade’s lake. Though Omen was once as noble and proud as any Ancient, he was driven mad by the Burning Legion’s tainted magics during the War of the Ancients. Omen’s immortality means that he is forever cursed to return in his maddened state at the advent of each new year—and this year, he has grown further in power. Heroes level 20 and above must make haste to ease this tormented Ancient’s suffering, in the hopes that perhaps next year he will return with a clearer mind. The great wolf Omen was once a hero of this world. An embodiment of strength and fortune, Omen fought beside the heroes of the War of the Ancients until he succumbed to demonic magics. Turning against his allies, he raged across Azeroth, leaving death and terror in his wake. Omen was finally defeated in Moonglade, and he now sleeps among the silt of Lake Elune'ara. But each year, at the beginning of the festival, he stirs... The celebration begins with an introductory quest, The Lunar Festival. The Cenarion Circle has invited all denizens of Azeroth to take part in the celebration of the Lunar Festival. You can learn more about the event by meeting with the Lunar Festival Harbinger. It wouldn’t be a celebration without fireworks. You’ll be asked to buy some Lunar Fireworks and Cluster Fireworks to launch and complete the quest Lunar Fireworks. Once you’ve proven your pyrotechnic prowess, you’ll receive your Lunar Festival Invitation to travel to Moonglade and speak with Valadar Starsong in Nighthaven. With your invitation in hand, you’ll be able to travel quickly to Moonglade by standing within Greater Moonlight throughout the holiday. The Lunar Festival features 18 achievements and one meta-achievement. It's a good time to travel Azeroth, see the sights, and pay your respects to the various Elders. Visiting an Elder will reward reputation with select capital cities, a Coin of Ancestry, some experience and gold, and a Lucky Red Envelope. *Speak with Myrael Lunarbloom in Moonglade to take the quest Lunar Preservation. You'll be tasked with visiting various moonwells around Azeroth to charge her staff. Upon completion of the quest, you'll earn 25 Coins of Ancestry which you can use to purchase one of four floral crowns (only wearable during Lunar Festival) from Valadar Starsong. Once you've purchased a crown, a new quest will become available, allowing you to earn a new version of the crown. This new crown is then added to your transmog appearances once the quest is complete allowing you to wear this crown year-round.

Scorelines can be so deceiving as Blackrock College were given a severe test by St Mary’s in the Leinster Schools Senior Cup first round at Energia Park on Tuesday. The holders were rocked back on their heels from the start as St Mary’s flowed forward to establish a lineout. Joseph Christle burst through the first tackle to go close and Eoghan Brady was on hand to complete the mission. Paul Neary converted in the fourth minute to make it 7-0 to the Rathmines school. Blackrock spurned all chances to kick at goal, preferring to use the maul to cause chaos, not before Brady bundled James Browne into touch at the corner flag. It came as no surprise to see hooker Harry O’Neill rise to claim a try from a powerful drive in the 15th minute. A simple, clever throw to the front of another Blackrock lineout put Conal Power through one-on-one, but O’Neill couldn’t take the pass. It was a thing of beauty to see frontrowers Patrick Tuite and Christle handling like backs in the lead-up to a penalty for offside. Neary knocked it over to put St Mary’s 10-5 ahead in the 25th minute. Another penalty led to a lineout and after Power plucked the throw from the air, O’Neill was in the van to deliver the try for to level the scores at 10-10 in the 28th minute. But Blackrock would take a 15-10 advantage into half-time after Bernard White bolted into the clear to score. There was an extended stalemate brokered before a case of obstruction allowed Mary’s outhalf Neary to split the posts from distance to make it 15-13 in the 50th minute. It would be their last score as soon after Paddy Clancy grubbered and gathered to find Johnny O’Sullivan on his inside shoulder for a stunning try, converted by Clancy to put Rock 22-13 up in the 59th minute. It was appropriate Michael O’Sullivan should have the decisive say with the fifth try, converted by Clancy, before Browne cut loose from inside his half to give the scoreboard a very flattering complexion.

Title: $1.9 B flows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in Trump’s first week – Details
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/1-9-b-flows-into-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs-in-trumps-first-week-details/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T17:00:07Z

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw $1.9 billion in weekly inflows as Trump’s pro-market stance fueled investor enthusiasm and momentum. In the first week of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, the U.S. witnessed an extraordinary surge in investment activity, with approximately $1.9 billion funneled into spot Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This influx reflects the growing momentum behind the so-called “Trump Trade” phenomenon, as investors rally around the administration’s pro-market stance. According to SoSoValue data, BTC ETFs recorded $517.67 million in net inflows by the 24th of January, contributing to $1.76 billion total for the week—extending the $1.96 billion influx observed before Trump’s inauguration. The week closed strongly for Bitcoin ETFs, with Fidelity’s FBTC leading by securing $186.07 million in net inflows on the 24th Jof anuary. This pushed its cumulative inflows to $13.04 billion, elevating its net assets to $22.5 billion. FBTC now stands as the second-best-performing Bitcoin fund. ARK 21Shares’ ARKB followed closely, attracting $168.71 million in net inflows, bringing its total to $2.96 billion, with net assets of $5.41 billion. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT dominated the BTC ETF landscape, amassing $155.69 million in inflows. This drove its cumulative inflows to $39.73 billion, securing $60.62 billion in net assets. Smaller contributions came from the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust, recording $13.01 million, and the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust (BTCW), posting $2.79 million. The only outlier was the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, experiencing $8.6 million in outflows, contrasting the otherwise bullish sentiment. Ethereum ETFs experienced modest gains last week, with $9.18 million in net inflows, bringing the cumulative total for the week to $139.32 million. This followed a more robust pre-inauguration week, which saw $211.97 million in inflows. Interestingly, top performers like BlackRock and Fidelity were notably absent from the day’s results, leaving room for smaller funds to take the spotlight. Leading the charge, Bitwise’s Ethereum ETF (ETHW) secured $6.01 million in inflows, boosting its cumulative total to $351.69 million. Other funds like the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH) and 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH) also saw modest inflows of $1.99 million and $1.17 million, respectively. This subdued performance has raised questions about ETH’s positioning compared to BTC, which appears to be drawing more attention from investors as a safer or more promising bet. Nonetheless, Ethereum ETFs have seen substantial institutional interest, attracting over $5 billion since November 2024. With use cases in DeFi and tokenized assets, Ethereum’s potential continues to offer diverse opportunities, positioning it for long-term growth despite current market fluctuations. As ETH ETFs continue to gain traction, they may exert pressure on Bitcoin’s dominance, especially as institutions explore Ethereum’s broader applications. However, the latest data from Farside Investors shows that both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs faced outflows on the 27th of January. Bitcoin saw $456.7 million in exits, while Ethereum ETF shed $136.2 million. This raises questions about whether the bullish trend triggered by the Trump administration will be sustained or prove short-lived. Therefore, the evolution of these ETFs remains uncertain. Investors will be closely watching to see if the recent momentum continues or stalls.

Title: The World's Most Trustworthy Crypto Exchanges

Christmas came early for bitcoin this year. On the back of record-breaking launches of ETFs backed by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, which have accumulated $112 billion in bitcoin, and president Donald Trump’s reelection in November, the digital asset crossed $100,000. Enthusiasts are expecting 2025 to be more bullish as a pro-crypto congress is coming in power with promises to finally pass regulation that will move the industry out of the proverbial penalty box. Hype cycles like this create unbridled optimism, and a healthy dose of FOMO, but investors should proceed with caution. And this does not mean which tokens one chooses to speculate in. There are hundreds of crypto exchanges in the world - essentially retail brokerage firms - with fancy websites, attractive features, and yield propositions and promises to keep your money safe. But all crypto exchanges and marketplaces are not created equal. There are significant differences between the types and number of licenses they hold and how they safeguard your digital assets. Anyone who was burned by the collapse of FTX in 2022 knows how important that can be. Additionally, not every exchange provides the same trading opportunities or charges the same amount. The top firm on Forbes’ third annual Best Crypto Exchange ranking, which analyzed more than 200 firms, is $85 billion Chicago-based CME Group. While this giant futures exchange, founded in 1898 to trade butter and eggs, is not suitable for most retail investors, we gave it high scores because in the wild and wooly world of crypto, safety is paramount and the CME Group is highly regulated by the CFTC. While crypto is still a tiny part of what is traded at CME, during 2024 it traded $1.4 trillion in futures contracts for digital assets such as bitcoin or ether. CME Group offers such things as Micro Bitcoin and Micro Ether futures and options, with minimums of $300 for the smallest of futures contracts, that customers can gain access to via traditional brokerage firms like Charles Schwab and Fidelity. When it comes to retail oriented exchanges $70 billion (market cap) Coinbase earned the #2 spot in the rankings. Coinbase is the only major publicly-traded cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. and its customers pay more for this perceived safety in fees and transaction costs. Thanks to some 8 million active accounts, it is the largest custodian of bitcoin in the world, holding 2.4 million worth a staggering $245 billion at current price levels. Asset safety is the most important feature exchange customers demand according to our survey of retail crypto trade. UK-based Bitstamp, a global exchange with a significant presence in Europe, came in third, with Binance (the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume) coming in fourth and Menlo Park-headquartered Robinhood, which is predominantly oriented toward stocks and options, taking fifth place. Robinhood, long criticized for gamifying investing to attract a youthful audience, has become something of a meme headquarters holding $15 billion worth of DOGE coin for clients (Shiba Inu inspired token) and added “dogwifhat” to a list that includes Shiba Inu, PEPE, and BONK. Besides meme coins, Robinhood acquired Luxembourg-based cryptoexchange Bitstamp last July for approximately $200 million, with the firms continuing to operate separately pending the necessary board approvals in the coming months. This acquisition may be the start of a consolidation trend for this highly fragmented industry as the most successful firms attempt to break out from their regional focus. Binance, absent during last year’s rankings due to legal wranglings, continues to be a dominant firm. It claims to have 245 million registered users and its average daily spot trading volume of around $14 billion represents almost a quarter of the $62 billion. The next biggest exchange, Dubai-based Bybit, only has $8.2 billion. Coinbase has an average daily crypto trading volume of $5.3 billion. Binance’s new management team promises to focus more on compliance, which would be a boon for the crypto compliance sector. The remaining firms in the ranking include some of the most prominent worldwide. In the U.S., leading firms include Kraken, Gemini, Crypto.com, and Fidelity. In South Korea, the two major firms are Upbit and Bithumb, while in Japan, they are Bitbank, bitFlyer, and Coincheck, and in Europe, we recognize Revolut, bitpanda, and Bitvavo. Together, these firms hold an estimated $1.2 trillion in client assets, and, according to the web analytics firm Similarweb, their websites were frequented by a combined 438 million users in November. Below, please find the 2025 rankings. Many investors prioritize low fees when deciding where to trade crypto. Most exchanges post their prices for sellers or purchasers online, respectively known as “maker” and “taker” fees; but they do not tell the whole story. Traders also need to be aware of a term called spread, which is the difference between a quoted buying and selling prices in an orderbook. The size of the spread varies by exchange and trading pair, but a general rule of thumb is that platforms with high volume have lower spreads. And vice versa. Our research revealed that the weighted cost of execution in the crypto market among ranked firms today, and inclusive of spread, is 80 basis points. To do this analysis we used the cost of trading reported by crypto providers to us or via their website, plus average spread information from CoinGecko. The specific test looked at what it would cost to purchase $25,000 of crypto without any volume discounts or other promotions. While trading fees can be relatively easily controlled, spread is a function of a provider’s overall liquidity. Among ranked firms, the average spread was 64 basis points (bp), with Upbit, Coincheck, and Bitstamp averaging 241bp, 181bp, and 143bp, respectively, as the costliest firms.[ One hundred basis points is the equivalent of one percentage point.] Coinbase’s 19bp spread was among the lowest and slightly bested Binance’s 21bp. There is a lot of variance among firm, if a trader wants to know the cheapest place to buy or sell crypto, it is important to evanluate both the posted fees and spread together. Source: Forbes, CoinGecko, company websites The chart above shows both fees and spreads and demonstrates that the biggest exchanges by market share tend to have the lowest trading cost, with the exception of Coinbase. Robinhood, which caters to retail traders, has a zero-fee trading model but the numbers above fail to incorporate the spreads,which in Robinhood’s case are a core part of their business model since they sell order flow. U.S. exchanges with more than a decade of crypto service such as Coinbase and Kraken continue to enjoy high demand despite higher trading costs. Eventually fee compression from competition from firms like Robinhood could drive fees down. There are several firms that have both expensive and cheap alternatives for heavy users, and Coinbase and Revolut are perfect examples. Coinbase retail clients averaged fees of 126 basis points. But in an effort to retain low-volume but high fee-paying clients the company created a monthly subscription service called Coinbase One that would eliminate fees. Prices range between $30-$300/month depending on volume. A majority of Revolut clients trade using their traditional app and pay 249bp on average, but the firm launched a web platform called Revolut X in select countries late last year that is priced at 10 basis points per trade and is gaining heavy traction. By Forbes measurement, there were no less than half a billion crypto users globally at the end of 2024. We enlisted the help of web analytics firm SimilarWeb, to help us determine where the most crypto traders were. The map below gives an estimation of the geographic dispersion of crypto investors. Forbes with similarweb data The largest concentration of traders is in the Asia-Pacific region, which has 160 million visitors. Europe was next with 134 million. The US and Canada added another 56 million. Latin America and the Caribbean had 40 million traders, and Africa was the lowest at 18 million. Traffic to crypto providers is highly concentrated, with 12 ranked firms and 3 unranked firms each having 10+ million unique visitors. Firms like Binance, Crypto.com, and Bitget prominently display the number of “users” on their website in the tens or hundreds of millions, without defining the term. These firms, along with many others surveyed for this study, did not provide up to date figures on active accounts. However, monthly SimilarWeb data provides a clearer picture and approximate number of users that is consistent across all exchanges. This analysis reveals that Binance, for example, had 75 million unique users (17% of the total) compared to Coinbase’s 56 million (13%). Robinhood was fourth at 37 million. But aside from these major global exchanges, there are some providers that focus on just one or two domiciles. The 49 million traders in South Korea are primarily serviced by two major institutions, Bithumb and Upbit, who received a combined total of 70% of all crypto exchange visitors. Much of the remainder went to larger offshore exchanges like Binance, ByBit, and Bitget. While these exchanges are ranked, none are actually licensed to operate in South Korea. The top three firms servicing Japan's 16 million visitors are Bitflyer, Coincheck, and Bitbank, while Germany’s 15 million go to Austria-based Bitpanda along with Bitget, and Binance. In India, Binance is the biggest exchange, accounting for essentially all of the of the country’s 6 million monthly visitors. The biggest local exchange operating in the south-Asian country is CoinDCX, which received 1.1 million visitors. Turning to Latin America, Brazil’s 14 million visitors primarily went to Binance, Singapore-based Gate.io (which has a sponsorship deal with soccer star Lionel Messi), and Coinbase. Finally, because Russia continues to be under US sanctions, American exchanges like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Kraken do not have a presence in those countries. Given its 18 million monthly users, Russia remains a major crypto trading hub. The biggest destinations are ByBit (6.7 million), HTX (3.5 million), and Binance (2.4 million). Ed Note: This article has been updated to clarify certain facts about Fidelity Crypto, including that it considers itself to be a marketplace rather than an exchange.

Title: UK Circling the Drain – Crisis what Crisis?

Time Published: 2025-01-28T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
EditorEconomy Kit Knightly, OffGuardian It is now almost five years since the start of the COVID event. The public was told there was a deadly disease that would affect the entire population, and everyone was at risk. However, in order to truly understand COVID, that event must be situated within a framework that examines the underlying economic determinants. In fact, many on the “left” are notable for having failed to undertake such an analysis and merely capitulated to the mainstream narrative. The COVID event had little if anything to do with public health. It was a policy mechanism deployed to manage an impending financial crisis. COVID policies served as a pretext for halting economic activity in a controlled manner to address systemic contradictions within neoliberal capitalism. Unprecedented fiscal and monetary interventions were strategic tools to stabilise the economy and prevent a deeper collapse of financial markets. The lockdowns, framed as public health necessities, effectively suspended economic activity in ways that allowed capital to regroup and restructure. This included consolidating corporate power (e.g. through increased reliance on digital platforms), and creating conditions for new rounds of capital investment post-crisis, facilitated by a convenient debt crisis and World Bank loans with pro-neoliberal strings-attached conditionalities. The framing of COVID-19 as a health crisis obscured its role in facilitating economic restructuring under the guise of emergency management. It also helped promote the notion of a benign, well-intentioned state that really cares about the well-being of the population. Neoliberalism has dominated economic thought since the late 20th century, characterised by deregulation, privatisation and a focus on market-driven solutions. This framework led to systemic failures, particularly evident in the lead-up to the COVID event. Financial markets were on the brink of collapse immediately prior to COVID. Quantitative easing (QE) had been put in overdrive following the financial crisis of 2008. QE was used as a tool to prop up a failing system. What we saw following the 2008 crash was ordinary people being pushed further to the edge. We witnessed more than a decade of ‘austerity’ in the UK, a neoliberal assault on the living conditions of ordinary people carried out under the guise of reining in public debt following the bank bail outs. During that period, a leading UN poverty expert compared the Conservative government’s welfare policies to the creation of 19th-century workhouses and warned that, unless austerity is ended, the UK’s poorest people face lives that are “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”. Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, accused ministers of being in a state of denial about the impact of policies. He accused them of the “systematic immiseration of a significant part of the British population”. In a 2019 report, the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank laid the blame for more than 130,000 deaths in the UK since 2012 at the door of government policies. It claimed that these deaths could have been prevented if improvements in public health policy had not stalled as a direct result of austerity cuts. And in a report on poverty in the UK by Professor David Gordon of the University of Bristol, it was found that almost 18 million could not afford adequate housing conditions, 12 million were too poor to engage in common social activities, one in three could not afford to heat their homes adequately in winter and four million children and adults were not properly fed (Britain’s population is estimated at around 66 million). Meanwhile, The Equality Trust in 2018 reported that the ‘austerity years’ were just fine for the richest 1,000 people in the UK. They had increased their wealth by £66 billion in one year alone (2017-2018), by £274 billion in five years (2013-2018) and had increased their total wealth to £724 billion – significantly more than the poorest 40% of households combined (£567 billion). And in early 2020, all this hardship was to be compounded by lockdowns to avert another financial meltdown. After treating millions of ordinary people as described above, we were informed that the elite now wanted to save everyone by locking them up and injecting them! Looking at Europe, investigative journalist Michael Byrant says that €1.5 trillion was needed to deal with the financial crisis in Europe alone in 2020. The financial collapse staring European central bankers in the face came to a head in 2019. Byrant stated that all talk about big finance bankrupting the nation (again) by looting public funds, politicians destroying public services at the behest of large investors and the depredations of the casino economy was conveniently washed away with COVID. He adds that predators who saw their financial empires coming apart resolved to shut down society. To solve the problems they created, they needed a cover story, which appeared in the form of a ‘novel virus’. The European Central Bank agreed to a €1.31 trillion bailout of banks followed by the EU agreeing to a €750 billion recovery fund for European states and corporations. This package of long-term, ultra-cheap credit to hundreds of banks was sold to the public as a necessary programme to cushion the impact of ‘the pandemic’ on businesses and workers. What happened in Europe was part of a strategy to avert the wider systemic collapse of the financial system. And what we have seen since COVID is a massive increase in global debt, inflation and more ‘austerity’ imposed on ordinary people. Since 2020, in the UK, poverty has increased in two-thirds of communities, food banks are now a necessary part of life for millions of people and living standards are plummeting. The poorest families have been enduring a ‘frightening’ collapse in living standards, resulting in life-changing and life-limiting poverty. Lockdowns were not imposed for public health reasons; they were implemented to prevent hyperinflation and manage a crisis of capitalism. Professor Fabio Vighi of Cardiff University argues that by suspending economic activity via lockdowns, governments aimed to mitigate inflationary pressures resulting from excessive liquidity injected into the economy through QE. The lockdowns also facilitated a restructuring of the economy, allowing larger corporations to absorb smaller businesses struggling to survive during this period. Prior to 2020, government reliance on financial markets and monetary policy tools like QE did not address underlying social and economic issues but instead perpetuated the system and existing inequalities. Policies rolled out as part of the COVID event reflected a continuation of neoliberal principles, with governments opting for temporary fixes rather than comprehensive reforms that prioritise public welfare. The extraordinary monetary policies (lockdowns) served to maintain financial stability at the expense of broader societal needs. In the run up to COVID, QE created an illusion of stability within financial markets, allowing governments to avoid confronting deeper structural issues. This policy led to asset bubbles and increased volatility, creating a precarious situation where any attempt to tighten monetary policy could trigger significant market disruptions. So, has anyone challenged this analysis of locating COVID policies within a framework that emphasises underlying economic determinants? In mainstream discourse, it has been ignored. That’s not too surprising because it would put the final nail in the coffin of the dominant COVID narrative. While the Ukraine war and supply chain disruptions are often cited as primary inflation drivers once COVID-related restrictions were lifted, some economists predicted that once lockdowns had ended, inflation could surge dramatically. As Deutsche Bank noted, after 30 years of low inflation, this “benign era could end abruptly once lockdowns are lifted”. Deutsche Bank also stated that the biggest financial bailout in history took place during the COVID era. Meanwhile, most economists would probably dismiss out of hand the arguments stated above rather than engage with them critically. Challenging the prevailing economic orthodoxy never goes down well. Highlighting systemic failures associated with neoliberal frameworks and questioning the efficacy of measures like QE in addressing underlying issues requires open dialogue rather than heavy handed pushback. During COVID, the UK government implemented several financial measures to support workers and businesses, with a significant focus on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), commonly known as the furlough scheme. The CJRS cost the UK government approximately £70 billion. This scheme enabled employers to claim grants covering up to 80% of employees’ wages, with a cap of £2,500 per month per employee. To finance this unprecedented level of support, the UK government increased its borrowing significantly. This borrowing was necessary to cover not only the furlough scheme but also other COVID policy measures. The increase in borrowing led to a substantial rise in public debt, which was exacerbated by the economic downturn caused by lockdowns and restrictions. Much of this debt was financed through mechanisms such as QE by the Bank of England, which involved purchasing government bonds. In the fiscal year 2019/20, prior to the COVID event, the UK government borrowed approximately £62.3 billion. This figure represented about 2.8% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at that time. In stark contrast, during the fiscal year 2020/21, government borrowing surged to around £303 billion. This significant increase in borrowing reflects the unprecedented financial measures taken by the UK government. Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor, recently highlighted a £22 billion “gap” in public finances attributed to the previous administration. Keir Starmer is warning of unprecedented economic challenges — promises of ongoing economic woe (for ordinary people) that echo what economist Huw Pill said a couple of years ago — that people should ‘accept’ being poorer. Of course, COVID lockdowns and restrictions were all about ‘saving granny’. And if you challenged the narrative or did not comply, you were beyond the moral pale. Those who recognise the manipulation of public sentiment by those who control the global economy might be forgiven for viewing the ‘saving granny’ narrative as the height of cynicism, coming from individuals who have demonstrated a lack of moral standards for decades with their wars, destructive economic policies and complete disregard for ordinary working people. And although people like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates were often singled out for criticism by those who challenged the mainstream narrative on COVID, when referring to the ‘controllers of the global economy’, this means those who largely remain in the shadows, the powerful and unscrupulous banking families and their handmaidens discussed by Dean Henderson in a detailed five-part series of articles back in 2011. Meanwhile, in the UK, there continues to be money available (to date almost £13 billion) to send to Ukraine to ensure the killing and dying continues in order to guarantee that those bastions of morality — BlackRock, J P Morgan and all — get their slice of the post-war honey pot.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) is advancing 3% this morning after plunging nearly 17% yesterday. The rebound came after JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on NVDA today. Why JPMorgan Remains Bullish on NVDA Noting that Chinese startup DeepSeek reported that it had trained an AI model for a very low price of about $5.6 million, JPMorgan asserted that this news is actually positive for chip makers. Specifically, according to the bank, when computing products become less costly to manufacture historically, the demand for chips and the consumption of more expensive chips have increased. The latter trend should play out going forward in the AI chip market, JPMorgan asserted. Further, the bank wrote that some information about DeepSeek's model has not been provided. For example, the total cost of all training sessions may not have been included in the $5.6 million total, and the degree to which the start-up used existing open-source models was not disclosed, JPMorgan stated. “We believe it is crucial to validate these costs before drawing conclusions,” the bank wrote. The Recent Price Action of NVDA Stock In the last month heading into today, the shares had dropped 12%, while they had pulled back 16% in the last three months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

These shifts include its demographic advantage, characterised by a young and expanding workforce fuelling sustained growth; supercharged digitisation that is reshaping financial transactions; and its resilience in navigating a fragmented geopolitical landscape. These forces bolster India’s long-term growth prospects, underpinning our case for above-benchmark allocations to Indian equities in strategic portfolios with horizons of five years and more,” the institute said in a note, outlining its outlook for 2025. It argues that Indian equities are not materially expensive. MSCI India trades at about 22.5 times forward earnings, above historical averages, according to LSEG data. The perception of expensiveness often hinges on traditional valuation metrics like the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and India’s relatively-strong growth outlook could help explain a P/E ratio above historical averages, it said. “Our preferred valuation metric — the equity risk premium (ERP) — incorporates earnings growth expectations and interest rate projections. Taking both into account, we find our estimate of India’s ERP – around 4.9 – to be broadly in line with historical average, suggesting valuations aren’t as stretched as they may appear on traditional metrics,” BlackRock said in its note. The institute expects corporate earnings to remain strong over the long run, supported by a robust growth backdrop, with policy interest rates likely settling around 5 per cent, down from the current 6.5 per cent. It sees high yields and global index inclusion driving strong demand for government bonds. “India’s inclusion in global emerging market bond indices marks a key step in addressing a longstanding challenge: Securing private capital at competitive costs,” it said. BlackRock favours consumption-related sectors, IT services, real estate and select industrials benefiting from government incentives to boost onshore manufacturing. Infrastructure will be in focus, given that the Indian government has earmarked infrastructure spending of 3.4 per cent of GDP in the fiscal ending March 2025 and has doubled such spending over the past three years. Historically, large-scale initiatives, particularly infrastructure and green projects, have relied heavily on domestic public sector funding, leading to higher borrowing costs. A second Trump administration is expected to seek increased tariffs to encourage manufacturing to return to the US and achieve other policy goals, while remaining open to negotiated deals. "We believe that multi-aligned and “connector” countries – like India – could gain from the rewiring of global supply chains and US-China competition, even with uncertainty around how US policy shapes up,” the institute observed. India stands out as one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies, with GDP growth projected to reach 6.5 per cent in 2025, according to the International Monetary Fund, well above global and emerging market averages. India’s working-age population (ages 25-64) continues to expand, in stark contrast to aging populations in many major economies. As of April 2023, United Nations data show that 65 per cent of the country’s population is under 35, with half under 25. “This demographic edge underpins India’s long-term growth prospects, setting the stage for sustained economic outperformance relative to peers such as China, Japan and the US over the next two decades, even as growth moderates from current levels,” the BlackRock note said.

Ondo Finance, a leading tokenized real-world asset (RWA) issuer, is bringing tokenized U.S. Treasuries to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), expanding the breadth of institutional-grade products onchain. 0 28 January 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Through this collaboration, institutional investors will gain access to Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries (OUSG), backed by the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which can be instantaneously minted and redeemed 24/7 using Ripple USD (RLUSD), an enterprise-grade, USD-denominated stablecoin.Ripple and Ondo have secured commitments to seed OUSG liquidity upon initial deployment, driving further adoption of tokenized RWAs on the XRPL. This is an expansion of Ripple’s investments in tokenized U.S. Treasuries, building on its initial investment in OpenEden’s TBILL.Tokenized U.S. Treasuries like OUSG have seen exponential growth, driven by institutional demand for liquidity, efficiency, and transparency in capital markets. The tokenized asset market is set for explosive growth, with forecasts predicting it will reach $16 trillion by 2030. The XRPL is uniquely positioned to enable institutions to bring traditional financial assets onchain, offering enhanced security, verifiable trust, and new revenue-generating opportunities.By bringing OUSG to the XRPL, Ondo Finance is addressing this demand with an onchain solution that offers: Institutional-grade security: OUSG is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries managed with stringent KYC and AML compliance. Additionally, the XRPL is built with native compliance features such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and onchain credential management to enable regulatory adherence. Accessible liquidity: OUSG and RLUSD provide institutional investors with high-quality, low-risk liquidity solutions, enabling efficient portfolio management and greater accessibility to tokenized U.S. Treasuries. Scalable decentralized blockchain technology: The XRPL’s high throughput, low fees, and reliability enable seamless tokenization and trading of RWAs. “The 24/7 intraday settlement enabled by tokenized assets like OUSG marks a transformative shift in capital flow management, breaking free from traditional trading hours and slow settlements," said Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President, RippleX. "These low-risk, high-quality liquidity options not only provide better accessibility for investors but also introduce greater stability to blockchain-based markets. By addressing key barriers with Ondo Finance, this innovation supports the broader adoption of DeFi and positions the XRPL as a cornerstone for institutional-grade financial solutions.” “Ondo Finance is proud to bring OUSG, our institutional-grade tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, to the XRP Ledger, a blockchain that institutions already know and trust,” said Katie Wheeler, Vice President of Partnerships at Ondo Finance. “This integration is the natural convergence of a compliance-first, yield-bearing product with a network purpose-built for institutional adoption, setting the groundwork for forward-thinking institutions to lead a new era of capital markets onchain.”Ondo Finance is the first tokenized US Treasuries platform to surpass the $600m total value locked (TVL) milestone. OUSG marked a milestone as the first tokenized US Treasuries fund and offers qualified investors instant 24/7 subscriptions and redemptions, daily interest accruals, low fees, and multi-chain availability.The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is tailored to meet the requirements of traditional financial institutions, offering native features like tokenization, trading, escrow, compliance and seamless asset movement—foundational for RWA tokenization and institutional DeFi. Ripple has leveraged the XRPL for over a decade to power cross-border payments, digital asset custody, and stablecoin issuance. Leveraging its comprehensive set of features—including the first native decentralized exchange (DEX), Automated Market Maker (AMM), Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Price Oracles, and forthcoming advancements like Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs), Permissioned Domains, and a Lending Protocol—the XRPL continues to expand its capabilities, solidifying its position as a trusted blockchain for institutional-grade DeFi.

Title: Solaxy Presale Reaches $15M as New ETFs to Cause a Bull Run?

Fund manager Tuttle Capital filed applications for ten altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Among them are Chainlink ($LINK), Cardano ($ADA), and even meme coins like Bonk ($BONK) and Official Trump ($TRUMP). These filings come on the back of recent changes in the SEC’s leadership, as pro-crypto Mark Uyeda replaced crypto critic Gary Gensler as the agency’s chair. Tuttle Capital already offers several leveraged $BTC and $ETH ETFs. Now, the firm seeks approval for ten 2x ETFs, including $XRP, $SOL, and $MELANIA. Essentially, these are ETFs that would provide twice the daily gains or losses of their underlying tokens. Speculations about $SOL and $XRP ETFs have been spreading for a while, but meme coin ETFs are an entirely new, experimental concept. Last week, REX Shares also filed for a $DOGE ETF – perhaps viewing it as a more predictable and sustainable investment than $TRUMP or $MELANIA. Bloomberg Intelligence suggests issuers are testing the waters to see what the new SEC administration would allow. The question is – where will regulators draw the line? If the SEC approves Tuttle Capital’s ETFs, they could be available on the market by April. However, utility-backed meme coins have higher odds of getting the green light. One such project is Solaxy ($SOLX), a Solana Layer-2 solution with a Pepe mascot. Solaxy aims to prevent network congestion, reduce fees, and speed up transfers by offloading part of transactions to its side chain. There are currently no Layer-2 networks for Solana, so Solaxy pioneers the niche. This unique utility helped Solaxy gain momentum and raise over $15.6M on presale. One $SOLX now costs $0.001618, which is the lowest possible entry point into the project. It’s true that exchange listings typically boost token value, and Solaxy already has them planned. But if (or when) $SOLX ETF rolls out, we might see a truly meteoric rise. Take $BTC, for example. The first spot $BTC ETF application was filed in 2013, but only in 2021 was the first $BTC ETF launched in Canada. Within one month after the news, $BTC rose from $33K to $57K and within two to $60K. When BlackRock filed for the first US $BTC ETF in June 2023, $BTC was trading at $27K. Since $BTC ETFs began trading on the US spot market in January 2024, it hit $100K. It appears that Solaxy launches just in time for a new wave of institutional adoption, which could bring its early supporters amplified returns. The effects of the new pro-crypto administration are already evident. While the SEC hasn’t yet approved Tuttle Capital’s applications, it hasn’t turned them down either, so the odds are high. The crypto market may be entering a new bull cycle where institutional investors finally judge projects like Solaxy for their technology rather than meme facade. However, we remind you that the crypto market is extremely volatile, and no gains are guaranteed. DYOR and keep a cool head at all times. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock Buys Another $1,000,000,000 Worth of Bitcoin in a Week To Control 2.7% of BTC Supply

New data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham reveals that asset management titan BlackRock piled up another $1 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) last week. Arkham says that BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under management – now controls 2.7% of all Bitcoin supply with its latest 10-figure BTC purchase. At time of writing, BlackRock owns 572,616 BTC worth $58.43 billion. Other notable digital assets in BlackRock’s portfolio include $3.75 billion worth of top altcoin Ethereum (ETH) and $72.02 million worth of the stablecoin USDC. Amid the asset management firm’s buying spree last week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Bitcoin could soar to as high as $700,000 per BTC during the World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland. According to Fink, Bitcoin could see drastically higher prices if sovereign wealth funds begin accumulating the flagship digital asset as a hedge against “local fears” such as inflation and political or economic uncertainty. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument, and so if that becomes true and you see that it could be a proper hedge against hope securities or equities, the question is, could you see it be a 2% or 5% allocation? I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that was the conversation. Should we have a 2% allocation? Should we have a 5% allocation? If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: [EU] Honor Your Elders with Celebration During Lunar Festival
URL: https://www.bluetracker.gg/wow/topic/eu-en/24174173-honor-your-elders-with-celebration-during-lunar-festival/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T09:00:00Z

Every year, the druids of Moonglade celebrate their city’s great triumph over an ancient evil. During the Lunar Festival, citizens of Azeroth have the opportunity to honor their elders by celebrating their sage wisdom, sharing in magnificent feasts…and, of course, lighting fireworks. The celebration has begun in Moonglade, and your Lunar Festival Invitation is waiting. Join in the fun by dressing up in your Lunar Festival finery, launching fireworks, and paying homage to the Elders throughout Azeroth. When: 28 January–11 February Where: Moonglade, with camps in Ironforge, Stormwind, Darnassus, Thunder Bluff, Orgrimmar, Dragon Isles zones, Khaz Algar zones, and the Undercity Currency: Coin of Ancestry Khaz Algar is joining in Lunar New Year festivities as eight new Elders (two per zone) make their way to the island, bringing with them a new Achievement, "Elders of Khaz Algar," and a new reward for trading in Coins of Ancestry, the Lunar Launcher. "It's always a festival when you are on the Lunar Launcher." The Lunar Festival is a time of celebration for the peoples of Azeroth. At the beginning of each year, elders of generations past manifest around the world to impart their wisdom upon all who listen. Should you encounter these venerable spirits in your travels and take the time to heed their words, they may even pass along tokens of their gratitude—Coins of Ancestry, the lessons of a past age in physical form. Gather enough Coins of Ancestry and the Cenarion Circle will open their stores of celebratory garb, fireworks, trinkets, and recipes! The Cenarion Circle has good cause to celebrate, for the Lunar Festival marks the return of many Ancients that fell in battles past: Goldrinn, Malorne, Aviana, and Cenarius himself. But this celebration is darkened by the eternal torment of one of their own—Omen, a wolf Ancient blessed by the moon goddess Elune, has risen from the depths of Moonglade’s lake. Though Omen was once as noble and proud as any Ancient, he was driven mad by the Burning Legion’s tainted magics during the War of the Ancients. Omen’s immortality means that he is forever cursed to return in his maddened state at the advent of each new year—and this year, he has grown further in power. Heroes level 20 and above must make haste to ease this tormented Ancient’s suffering, in the hopes that perhaps next year he will return with a clearer mind. The great wolf Omen was once a hero of this world. An embodiment of strength and fortune, Omen fought beside the heroes of the War of the Ancients until he succumbed to demonic magics. Turning against his allies, he raged across Azeroth, leaving death and terror in his wake. Omen was finally defeated in Moonglade, and he now sleeps among the silt of Lake Elune'ara. But each year, at the beginning of the festival, he stirs... The celebration begins with an introductory quest, The Lunar Festival. The Cenarion Circle has invited all denizens of Azeroth to take part in the celebration of the Lunar Festival. You can learn more about the event by meeting with the Lunar Festival Harbinger. It wouldn’t be a celebration without fireworks. You’ll be asked to buy some Lunar Fireworks and Cluster Fireworks to launch and complete the quest Lunar Fireworks. Once you’ve proven your pyrotechnic prowess, you’ll receive your Lunar Festival Invitation to travel to Moonglade and speak with Valadar Starsong in Nighthaven. With your invitation in hand, you’ll be able to travel quickly to Moonglade by standing within Greater Moonlight throughout the holiday. The Lunar Festival features 18 achievements and one meta-achievement. It's a good time to travel Azeroth, see the sights, and pay your respects to the various Elders. Visiting an Elder will reward reputation with select capital cities, a Coin of Ancestry, some experience and gold, and a Lucky Red Envelope. *Speak with Myrael Lunarbloom in Moonglade to take the quest Lunar Preservation. You'll be tasked with visiting various moonwells around Azeroth to charge her staff. Upon completion of the quest, you'll earn 25 Coins of Ancestry which you can use to purchase one of four floral crowns (only wearable during Lunar Festival) from Valadar Starsong. Once you've purchased a crown, a new quest will become available, allowing you to earn a new version of the crown. This new crown is then added to your transmog appearances once the quest is complete allowing you to wear this crown year-round. Once all of the crowns are purchased, the associated quests become available to all characters on your account. A WoW Classic version of the Lunar Festival is also available for those seeking to honor their Elders throughout Azeroth. Look for the Lunar Festival Emissary in any capital city to kick off the celebration. When: 28 January–18 February Where: Any capital city. Fashionable Lunar Festival Emissaries are eager to help direct you to Lunar Festival Harbingers found in each capital city. Complete the Lunar Festival World Quests to earn the "To Honor One's Elders" meta-achievement as part of the "What A Long, Strange Trip It's Been" achievement. Learn more about the Lunar Festival in Wowhead's holiday guide and WoW Classic holiday guide.

Title: The bicycle industry's dirty secret

Punitive labour conditions tied to cycling’s big-name brands Cycling may be green but Taiwan, the global centre of bicycle manufacturing, has built an industry on migrant labour and dodgy employment practices. We all know that cycling is healthy and virtuous; millions of Europeans burn calories instead of petrol when they hit the road on their daily trips to school and work. Globally, the bicycle market is big business, valued at $66bn in 2024. But for the workers who make our bikes in Taiwanese factories, conditions are often dirty, dangerous and demeaning. For years, debt bondage, passport retention, abusive living conditions, withheld wages, threats and intimidation have been common practice – all indicators of forced labour according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO). And for years, many of the world’s biggest brands – including Bianchi, Canyon, Centurion, Giant, Merida, Pinarello, REI, Scott, Specialized and Trek – have had bikes or components made in Taiwan. Taiwan is the biggest exporter of bikes to Europe – around 40% of all bicycles imported into Europe with the Netherlands, Germany and the UK as major destinations. And many more bikes sold in Europe contain Taiwan-made components though they may be marketed under a local brand with assembly in Europe. Taiwan’s bicycle industry is clustered around Taichung, in the centre of the island, with the world’s biggest manufacturer, Giant, to its north and the second biggest, Merida, to the south. In between, there are hundreds of factories employing thousands of migrants from poorer neighbouring countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, who make components (frames, brakes, chains, gears, lights, saddles, tyres etc). The world’s largest manufacturer of bike tyres, Maxxis, has factories here too. Bikes and parts are exported worldwide from Taichung’s factories. Specialized and Centurion buy from Merida; Giant supplies Trek, Scott, and until recently REI; Bianchi, Canyon and Pinarello source from Fritz Jou among others; Cannondale and Cervélo from Kenstone Metal.

Title: How Communism Is Outcompeting Capitalism

Time Published: 2025-01-28T06:05:20Z
Full Content:
I asked DeepSeek for a rec on Chinese art and it suggested Along the River During the Qingming Festival. This is a 1736 version by Chen Mei, Sun Hu. Jin Kun, Dai Hong, and Cheng Zhidao. Set to Jasmine Flower. Isn't it ironic? Don't ya think? A hundred EV companies have bloomed under communism, while capitalism subsidizes one blowhard making four vehicles and one paperweight. A startup has trained an AI for $5.5 million under communism, while capitalist AI requires $500 billion in government support. Everything capitalists told you about capitalism was just some bullshit to sell you more capitalism. Communism is actually far more innovative than capitalism. They do more with less, and for better purpose. The great technical power of communism was actually known from the jump. Russia and China industrialized within one generation. No nations ever developed faster or more, an economic miracle pointedly ignored by most western economists because communism bad, STFU. The productive capacity of communism was discredited because the whole thing seemed to fall with the end of the Soviet Union, but that wasn't all. As Xi Jinping said in 2018, Luckily for the world, China was decoupling its model from the Soviet model before the Soviets fell and evolved something quite different (and more robust). As Xue Muqiao said at a World Bank conference in 1982 (all of this via How China Escaped Shock Therapy, Isabella M. Weber, read it, it's excellent), The chief Chinese insight was that the problem required Chinese insight. Chinese communism was branded socialism with Chinese characteristics and with this highly experimental and adaptive economic system, Deng Xiaoping took China to market (without selling off the whole hog). Uncle Deng predicted the trajectory quite presciently in 1987 (in People's Daily): If anything, Uncle Deng was being conservative. We're only a quarter through the new century and China already has higher life expectancy and living standards than capitalist America. The only thing America leads on is GDP, which measures its corruption, debt, healthfraud, and constant self-stimulation as positives (which they are not). In real economic terms like PPP, China already tops America, and it doesn't prioritize such blunt (dick) measures itself, preferring to look for ‘high quality’ growth than just making abstract numbers go up. As you can see, Chinese socialism is pragmatic more than programmatic. As Deng said in a 1962 speech (which pissed Mao off), China, of course, had to lay a Maoist foundation to industrialize in the first place, but what to do with that industrial base was the problem in the 1990s. Many post-communist countries threw themselves on the tender mercies of capitalism (feeding socialism to the market) and saw the steepest declines in quality of life outside of wartime. China had a different idea which was markets within socialism. Why not? As Uncle Deng said in 1984, Indeed, people have had markets under every type of economic system, The Market™ is not something unique to capitalism, that's just marketing. As Jiang Zemin described socialism with Chinese characteristics in 1992, This is all the historical background that leads to the situation we see now, where Chinese socialism clearly outcompetes western capitalism, as Uncle Deng foresaw. So we're at the point where the modern General Secretary can look back and take a bit of a victory lap. China's success proves that socialism is not dead. It is thriving. Just look. Take cars, for example, the most obvious vehicle for conveying national power. The Tesla was an innovation when it started, but now they're just releasing four models and some toy-trucks that brick if you wash them. It's honestly dystopian if you want to buy a pure EV from a pure EV company in America. You can buy an S, X, or Y, or barely usable Cybertruck. Meanwhile in China, BYD alone sells over 40 models, and there are hundreds of what they call NEV companies, engaged in ruthless competition. China, the communist country, preserves the rational spirit of capitalism while America, the capitalist country, subsidizes one clown car. WTF is going on? It's almost as if the propaganda were bullshit and communism actually works. The core difference between communism and capitalism is not what (there are markets under communism and state-intervention under capitalism) but for whom. Cui bono? The names communism and capitalism tell you all you need to know. Under communism the community is most important whereas under capitalism it's capital. The difference between communism and capitalism is not that hard to understand, etymology is enough. Democracy™ and Human Rights© are just marketing taglines capitalism uses to obscure the obvious, that it's rule by capital above all. The problem is that capital is not actually very good at allocating capital. As Biggie said, one should never get high on one's own supply, which American capitalism has been doing since the massive deregulation of the 1980s, which is now uniparty policy (Congress is just an insider trading club now). Stock buybacks, bullshit valuations, pump and dumps so big the government bails you out. The core question, as always is for whom? Communism allocates resources for some common purpose (socialism for the social purpose) or Islam for God (who is surely the best planner); many economic systems are possible depending on ‘for whom’. Capitalism is marketed as some all-purpose solution for general good, but it's not, it's just for increasing capital, as it says on the tin. Capitalism is not a system for governance so much as a system for dismantling governance for its own metabolic needs. In short, a cancer. Communism (or any -ism that isn't centered around money) is capable of allocating capital for a different purpose beyond just reproducing capital. Like reproducing humans and (theoretically) reproducing nature and not killing us all. There are many different directions possible if you direct your economy towards something rather than just ‘growing your economy’. That is circular logic which divides by zero at some point. You cannot have infinite growth on a finite planet. Communist industrialization, of course, leads to the heat death of life on earth as much as capitalist industrialization, but there is at least the concept of a shared community which might include all living beings, rather than share capital above all things (I'm musing purely theoretically here). If communist liberation movements (there has never been a Capitalist Liberation Front) had not been brutally suppressed across the world last century, we might have had a fighting chance to stop climate collapse and resource exhaustion by the 1970s, when it was possible. There is at least the theoretical concept of a brake within communism, whereas under capitalism it's all accelerator. This is the core reason communism makes better cars and artificial incarnations today. China produces cheap, functional EVs and not luxury virtue signalling devices. China produces cheap, efficient AI and not luxury investment vehicles. Communism has a reason behind production while capitalism is just irrational growth for growth's sake (ie, cancer). None of this will save the world (it's too late) but we can at least say ‘I knew it’ to machines that don't care while we're tooling along the highway (to hell). Now take AI, another vehicle for conveying national power (which also destroys the natural world). Conversational AI was last place where western capitalism could be said to work. AI was like the quarterback of the tech industry, the last place a white man could lead. But now that lead has been obliterated by DeepSeek. At the same time the US government was announcing a $500 billion oligarchy investment in OpenAI, DeepSeek released a comparable model that had been trained on $5.5 million. Under communism a private entrepreneur came up with DeepSeek out of pocket, while under capitalism the President had to stand next to Sam Altman, holding his hand. What's going on here? The problem again is that capital is not very good at allocating capital. It will just give the money to itself. This is another digression, but at a very high level, Jamie Merchant describes how, “Traditionally, some form of planned economy is taken to be the alternative to market institutions, but there is not much planning happening here. Rather, this is something new: the abolition of the market without planning.” What Merchant means by the ‘abolition of the market’ is important. America effectively arrived on central planning without planning. A cartel of banks just moves interest rates around, and the government gives them free money to do it. It's all centrally controlled, but without a brainwave among them. As Merchant continues, What Merchant is describing is the fact that America in 2008 bailed out the big banks without taking equity stakes (ie nationalizing them). It did the same thing to the big car companies. The market said these companies were dead but the US government just said no and kept them going. The ‘creative destruction’ of the market was abolished, ie the market was abolished without planning. The US government was just reacting to crises, but ended up creating a conundrum that they can't get out of. Their whole economy is a giant Ponzi scheme and there is no reverse Ponzi. In this oligarchic system, the only purpose is make line go up, to keep the high going as long as possible. In that sense, having a product that works well and cheaply is actually a terrible comedown. It lowers profits (which are increasingly irrelevant) and worst of all lowers spending. As Merchant continues, “The asset management firms Blackrock, Vanguard, and State Street Advisors are the largest single shareholders in 9 out of 10 companies on the S&P 500, on average owning more than 20 percent of the shares of every company on the index, so it is naturally in their interest to discourage any competition that could lower profits.” In this capitalist context, what is the purpose of a $5.5 million AI system? What is its value to those for whom the opening bell tolls? Why would any capitalist want such a thing when we've got this $500 billion hustle going on? Offering cheaper, more efficient anything to bankers is like offering them a hand towel in the nightclub bathroom. That's not what they're in there for. At work or play, they're trying to make that line go up as fast and furiously as possible. As Matthew McConaughey says in Wolf Of Wall Street: AI was the golden goose that VR was supposed to be, it made NVIDIA's line go up and the ‘magnificent seven’ crowded into the bathroom stall to get high AF. The more GPUs (and energy and water) these products consumed the better. AI was a magical product with frankly mythical benefits that had people lining up to throw money at it. That was the value of AI in the capitalist system, not AI itself. Again, remember that capitalism perceives no human need but greed. It doesn't care what the product does, how much energy and water it burns, as long as it makes line go up, be it in the nose or news. But now in China they're facing a ‘competitor’ (everyone besides America is happy to work together) that upends their main hustle with a side project. DeepSeek was a side-project of some financial quants (algorithmic traders) with a dream and some spare GPU capacity. Conversational AI is a side-side-project in China which has a real economy building real things, and where AI is primarily used for boring business cases, not idle chatting. And so DeepSeek is released open-weight (effectively open-source) because they don't give a shit. As DeepSeek's CEO said, OpenAI is just a branding term, but DeepSeek is actually doing it. Nobody's trying (or able) to become some rentier oligarch in China, they already collectively own the means of production through the Communist Party. People can certainly get rich, but China's target is ‘moderate prosperity’ and ‘high-quality growth,’ not fuck-off money and growth at all costs. This leads to very different products. It's actually a completely different culture. As Alanis Morissette said, isn't it ironic, don't you think? Capitalism was supposed to be this great engine of ingenuity, but it's congealed into monopolization, corruption, massive waste, and pump and dumps. Communism was tarred as the death of individual initiative, but they've got hedge fund guys doing game-changing AI as side projects. Note that I don't mean conversational AI itself is game-changing, I mean that DeepSeek exposes the shell game American AI companies (and chip-makers) were playing. I haven't even gotten into how China outcompeted America on social media and basically every domain they care about, and the domains they don't care about, like, health, housing, education, and actual human needs. If you read even thinly into the history of these economic systems, it's not that hard to explain. Communism has a purpose beyond profit and the economy can be directed for some human (or ideally natural) purpose. Capitalism has no purpose beyond profit, and just degenerates into fraud. These systems are not the same. Capitalism is worse.

Without public input, Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass went and appointed a “Chief Recovery Officer” to oversee the post-fire rebuilding process—Steve Soboroff has been largely absent, but no doubt collecting a nice little salary. Now, again without public input, Bass intends to hire an “outside consultant” to rebuild the Palisades. Here’s the story, from an article at the Los Angeles Times: The city of Los Angeles is planning to hire an outside consultant to handle a significant rebuilding contract for areas devastated by this month’s Palisades fire, Mayor Karen Bass said Monday. The firm will represent the city’s interests in the wildfire recovery process, including performing damage assessments, monitoring air and water quality, interacting with various federal agencies and ensuring that the city gets as much federal reimbursement as possible, according to chief recovery officer Steve Soboroff. My prediction? Larry Fink and BlackRock. Why? Well, Ukraine. In December of 2022, I wrote a blog on a story that had been kept relatively quiet: Volodomyr Zelensky had taken “pro bono” advice from Fink to establish a “patronage program” in Ukraine, which would give foreign investors (both public and private) the chance to “adopt” areas of Ukraine that had suffered destruction during the war with Russia, and rebuild them to essentially “own” them—Zelensky was selling out what originally belonged to the people to the highest governmental and commercial bidders. Here’s what Zelensky said at the time: Even now, we create a special patronage system. The system will enable leading countries and companies to take patronage over the reconstruction of Ukrainian regions, cities, industries, and enterprises. It smelled like money laundering to me—which is coincidentally, one of the things Ukraine is best known for—and reminds me of the Clinton Foundation’s (nonexistent) “work” in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010, which saw who knows how much money flood into the Clinton Foundation (Tens of millions? Hundreds of millions? Billions?), a “special patron” if you will, and essentially none to the people of Haiti. Now, details about Bass’s plan “remain scant” (shocker!), but I write this so we remember to keep an eye on it and know exactly what to look out for. Image generated by AI. Without public input, Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass went and appointed a “Chief Recovery Officer” to oversee the post-fire rebuilding process—Steve Soboroff has been largely absent, but no doubt collecting a nice little salary. Now, again without public input, Bass intends to hire an “outside consultant” to rebuild the Palisades.

Title: Dutch Pension Fund Seeks Divestment from BlackRock

A Dutch pension fund is considering cutting ties with BlackRock because of the manager’s departure from the Net-Zero Asset Managers Initiative. PME Pensioenfonds, a pension fund for the metals and technology industry which has more than 620,000 participants, said it was reconsidering the future of its 5 billion euros invested with the manager, according to a memo seen by CIO. The pension fund is among the largest in the Netherlands, with more than 280 billion euros ($294.17 billion) in assets under management. The fund’s investments with BlackRock include money market funds and several index portfolios. PME reportedly controls the composition of, and proxy voting policy of, the investments. The pension fund has said it seeks partners that abide by net-zero plans, and stated concern in the memo with what it called BlackRock’s diminishing ambitions and efforts to support sustainable investing. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  BlackRock departed the initiative, which has sought a transition to net-zero emission portfolios by 2050 and counted 325 signatories who collectively managed $57.5 trillion in assets, earlier this month. The initiative had seen numerous members leave over the past year, including Northern Trust this month. Similar initiatives, such as the Climate Action 100+, which BlackRock also left, and the Net Zero Banking Alliance have seen scores of departures; by the middle of January, all major U.S. banks had withdrawn from the later. BlackRock’s departure from NZAM was significant; the firm has $11.5 billion in assets under management. NZAM suspended its activities shortly after BlackRock’s departure. Despite a pullback from environmental, social, and governance and net-zero initiatives by U.S.-based investors, European ones appear to be continuing their commitments to these values. BlackRock, in the U.S., has been a target of political opponents of ESG and net-zero investing over the manager’s membership in initiatives like the NZAM.

Title: Is Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN) The Best Alternative Meat Stock to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 9 Best Alternative Meat Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) stands against the other alternative meat stocks. The alternative meat industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by environmental concerns, health consciousness, and technological advancements. As of 2025, the market continues to expand, with notable developments in both plant-based and cultivated meat sectors. According to a report by research firm Mordor Intelligence, at the end of 2024, the global meat substitutes market was valued at around $10.36 billion, with projections to reach over $18 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 11.76% during the forecast period. Similarly, Business Research Company, another market intelligence firm, estimates that the market size for cultivated meat is expected to grow from $9.31 billion in 2024 to close to $11 billion in 2025, at an annual growth rate of 18%. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Several factors are contributing to the burgeoning alternative meat industry. The most important of these is environmental sustainability. Alternative meats, particularly plant-based options, are recognized for their lower environmental impact compared to traditional meat. A study by the Food Foundation, quoted by prominent British newspaper The Guardian, found that plant-based meat alternatives result in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and require less water. Another factor contributing to alternative meat popularity is health considerations. The same study noted that plant-based alternatives often contain fewer calories, less saturated fat, and more fiber than conventional meat products. However, it also highlighted that some alternatives may have higher salt content and lack certain nutrients like iron and vitamin B12. Innovations in food technology have led to the development of lab-grown meats, offering solutions to ethical and environmental issues associated with traditional meat production. The cultivated meat industry is projected to be valued at $25 billion globally by 2030. Despite the positive trajectory, the alternative meat industry faces several challenges. These include production costs, consumer acceptance, and nutritional fortification, among others. With increasing investments, technological innovations, and a growing consumer base seeking sustainable and healthy food options, the industry is set to play a significant role in the future of food production. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected food stocks that offer alternative meat products. Companies that mainly produce beef are also included in the list for comparison purposes. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A farmer in a field, bringing in the harvest of live fed cattle for the company. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37 Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE:TSN) operates as a food company worldwide. Tyson Foods has expanded into the alternative meat market over the past few years, offering various plant-based and blended products. There are several compelling factors that make this company a strong investment. As per the report for the fourth quarter of 2024, the sales were $13,565 million, increasing 1.6% from the prior year, and the GAAP operating income was $525 million, increasing $988 million from the prior year. This demonstrates the company's efficient core business operations, driven by better cost management and improved pricing, leading to higher profitability. Moreover, the company has introduced the Jimmy Dean Plant-Based Breakfast Sausage Patty, which aims to deliver the signature taste of the traditional Jimmy Dean sausage in a plant-based format. This would appeal to consumers seeking healthier meat alternatives. Lastly, the company has also launched the Raised & Rooted brand, which includes various plant-based products such as burger patties, bratwurst, Italian sausages, and ground meat alternatives. Overall TSN ranks 4th on our list of the best alternative meat stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of TSN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than TSN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

By Rita Nazareth, Bloomberg NewsWall Street had a rough start to the week on concern that a cheap artificial intelligence-model from Chinese startup DeepSeek could make valuations of the technology that has powered the bull market tough to justify.From New York to London and Tokyo, equities got hammered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.9% and the Nasdaq 100 slipped 3.7%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers plunged 10% — the most since March 2020. Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the AI frenzy, sank 18% in the biggest market-cap loss for a single stock in market history. With big tech getting crushed, U.S. stocks were set for their worst day since the last Federal Reserve decision that roiled trading.In a rush for safety, defensive industries like consumer staples and health care were bid. Treasuries rallied, driving yields to the lowest levels this year. Haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc climbed. The crypto world got hit, with Bitcoin below $100,000.“What was shaping up to be a big week in the markets got even bigger with the disruption in the AI space,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “That could make this week’s megacap tech earnings even more critical to market sentiment.”Monday’s plunge drove new fissures into a market narrative that prevailed since the re-election of Donald Trump in November, the America-first, tech-fueled uber bullishness that saw a clear upward path for risky assets spurred by deregulation, tax cuts and even government sponsorship of AI investment. Treasury yields slid sharply as haven-seeking investors laid aside concern – for today, anyway – that the new president’s policies will stoke inflation.The severity of the selloff in U.S. assets was proportionate to the weightings of AI-enabled firms in the biggest stock indexes. Even after a recent paring to curb their influence the cohort of Nvidia, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. account for 45% of the Nasdaq 100. It’s more than 30% in the S&P 500, leaving both gauges significantly exposed to concerted drops in those names.“The sudden, adverse market reaction to DeepSeek indicates that some of the key assumptions that have been driving the AI trade, and hence major indices, are getting reassessed today,” said Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers. “I believe that part of the today’s sudden adverse market reaction was a direct result of a wave of complacency that overtook the equity market The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps slid 3.7%. The Russell 2000 slipped 1.4%. Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — the VIX — soared the most since mid-December to almost 20.The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%. Bitcoin sank 4.9% to $99,401.98.“I’m hoping this moment encourages everyone to look beyond tech stocks,” said Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “Not because the AI story is doomed, but because there are so many opportunities in unloved sectors that have been ignored for so long. The guts of the market’s foundation are still good, so it’s likely that the dip will be bought here.”At G Squared Private Wealth, Victoria Greene says that while she’s “not convinced the bubble has burst,” one would be “silly” not to evaluate the potential risks.“We are looking carefully at how the market progresses from here and if action needs to be taken to protect and shift portfolio allocations,” she noted. “We are not panickers, so tend to be buyers of big dislocations that are happening in tech, energy, and infrastructure today.”Paul Marino at Themes ETFs, says he likes the fact that people are skeptical.“Anything that goes straight up to the sky parabolic, that’s when I get worried as a long-term investor,” he said.The next leg lower for the biggest U.S. tech stocks may come from the retail crowd, according to Tony Pasquariello at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.“Tactically speaking, I suspect the next few days bring a hurried reduction of length by the retail community,” Pasquariello wrote in a note to clients Monday, adding that hedge funds have been aggressively reducing exposure for months, so this is really about the response of households.However, he’s a true believer in the structural supremacy of U.S. tech companies, which “arguably have only more incentive to spend.”“We don’t know whether this is the ‘Sputnik Moment’ for stocks, but this is certainly a wake up call that we are not the only game in town,” said Paul Nolte at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. “To put these very high valuations in the stocks thinking they have cornered the market is a huge mistake and that is being re-rated.”To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., the idea that DeepSeek’s latest AI model is much more cost effective, and runs on much less-advanced chips, is raising some serious questions about what kind of earnings can be drawn from the AI phenomenon.“If these companies look like they’re going to have a tough time maintaining their earnings growth (chip stocks) or a tough time reaching their earnings growth goals (the “picks and shovels” companies), it’s going to create some serious headwinds for today’s expensive stock market, he noted.In fact, the slide in tech came at a time when the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 times estimated forward earnings, which is significantly above its 10-year average of 22. Nvidia, which has led the way on AI technology, has a valuation multiple of 32.All focus will be on earnings announcements from the likes of Microsoft and Apple this week to restore confidence in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies.Investors are heading into yet another pivotal Big Tech earnings cycle with the companies’ shares near record highs and valuations stretched. A key distinction this time: The group’s profit growth is projected to come in at the slowest pace in almost two years.“This should be a fairly good earnings season, but the bar has been raised and they may not be able to live up to high expectations,” said Dan Taylor, chief investment officer at Man Numeric. “It will be very difficult for the group to perform the way it did last year, especially as valuations have increased.”“We think big tech can keep delivering on earnings, but misses could revive concerns that big capital spending on AI won’t pay off – one of three triggers to dial down our pro-risk view,” BlackRock Investment Institute strategists including Jean Boivin and Wei Li.Metrics like capex-to-sales ratios and free cash flows suggest that, for now, megacap tech firms are not overextended, they said. Overinvestment should be assessed in aggregate, in our view, given AI’s potential to unlock new revenue streams across the economy, they concluded.What exactly is DeepSeek?DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops AI models that are open-source, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of the iPhone download charts in the U.S. after its release in early January.The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its R1 release offers performance on par with OpenAI’s latest and has granted license for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it.Corporate Highlights:—UBS Group AG has begun a wave of job cuts in its home market Switzerland, with hundreds of employees receiving notice in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter.—AT&T Inc. posted fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street projections, including better-than expected increases in mobile-phone customers and fiber-based internet subscribers, driven by seasonal promotions and bundled product offerings.—Activist investor Ancora Holdings Group has nominated nine candidates for United States Steel Corp.’s board and is pushing for the company to abandon a takeover by Nippon Steel Corp.—SoFi Technologies Inc. published a forecast for profit that missed analysts’ estimates.—MicroStrategy Inc. bought $1.1 billion of Bitcoin, after announcing plans for the early redemption of convertible notes and approving an increase to amount of authorized common shares.Key events this week:—U.S. consumer confidence, durable goods, Tuesday—Fed rate decision followed by news conference by Chair Jerome Powell, Wednesday—Canada rate decision, Wednesday—Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, ASML earnings, Wednesday—Eurozone ECB rate decision, consumer confidence, unemployment, GDP, Thursday—U.S. GDP, jobless claims, Thursday—Apple, Deutsche Bank, Thursday—ECB rate decision followed by news conference by President Christine Lagarde, Thursday—U.S. personal income & spending, PCE inflation, employment cost index, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:Stocks—The S&P 500 fell 1.9% as of 2:51 p.m. New York time—The Nasdaq 100 fell 3.7%—The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%—The MSCI World Index fell 1.5%—Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index fell 3.7%—Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index fell 10%—The Russell 2000 Index fell 1.4%Currencies—The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%—The euro was little changed at $1.0492—The British pound was little changed at $1.2487—The Japanese yen rose 1% to 154.47 per dollarCryptocurrencies—Bitcoin fell 4.9% to $99,401.98—Ether fell 6.7% to $3,075.6Bonds—The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53%—Germany’s 10-year yield declined four basis points to 2.53%—Britain’s 10-year yield declined four basis points to 4.59%Commodities—West Texas Intermediate crude fell 2.2% to $73.04 a barrel—Spot gold fell 1.2% to $2,738.57 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.(With assistance from Margaryta Kirakosian, Allegra Catelli and Catherine Bosley.)©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined nine basis points to 4.53%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.1%. Bitcoin sank 4.9% to $99,401.98. “I’m hoping this moment encourages everyone to look beyond tech stocks,” said Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “Not because the AI story is doomed, but because there are so many opportunities in unloved sectors that have been ignored for so long. The guts of the market’s foundation are still good, so it’s likely that the dip will be bought here.” At G Squared Private Wealth, Victoria Greene says that while she’s “not convinced the bubble has burst,” one would be “silly” not to evaluate the potential risks. “We are looking carefully at how the market progresses from here and if action needs to be taken to protect and shift portfolio allocations,” she noted. “We are not panickers, so tend to be buyers of big dislocations that are happening in tech, energy, and infrastructure today.” Paul Marino at Themes ETFs, says he likes the fact that people are skeptical. “Anything that goes straight up to the sky parabolic, that’s when I get worried as a long-term investor,” he said. The next leg lower for the biggest U.S. tech stocks may come from the retail crowd, according to Tony Pasquariello at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “Tactically speaking, I suspect the next few days bring a hurried reduction of length by the retail community,” Pasquariello wrote in a note to clients Monday, adding that hedge funds have been aggressively reducing exposure for months, so this is really about the response of households. However, he’s a true believer in the structural supremacy of U.S. tech companies, which “arguably have only more incentive to spend.” “We don’t know whether this is the ‘Sputnik Moment’ for stocks, but this is certainly a wake up call that we are not the only game in town,” said Paul Nolte at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management. “To put these very high valuations in the stocks thinking they have cornered the market is a huge mistake and that is being re-rated.” To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., the idea that DeepSeek’s latest AI model is much more cost effective, and runs on much less-advanced chips, is raising some serious questions about what kind of earnings can be drawn from the AI phenomenon. “If these companies look like they’re going to have a tough time maintaining their earnings growth (chip stocks) or a tough time reaching their earnings growth goals (the “picks and shovels” companies), it’s going to create some serious headwinds for today’s expensive stock market, he noted. In fact, the slide in tech came at a time when the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 27 times estimated forward earnings, which is significantly above its 10-year average of 22. Nvidia, which has led the way on AI technology, has a valuation multiple of 32. All focus will be on earnings announcements from the likes of Microsoft and Apple this week to restore confidence in the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies. Investors are heading into yet another pivotal Big Tech earnings cycle with the companies’ shares near record highs and valuations stretched. A key distinction this time: The group’s profit growth is projected to come in at the slowest pace in almost two years. “This should be a fairly good earnings season, but the bar has been raised and they may not be able to live up to high expectations,” said Dan Taylor, chief investment officer at Man Numeric. “It will be very difficult for the group to perform the way it did last year, especially as valuations have increased.” “We think big tech can keep delivering on earnings, but misses could revive concerns that big capital spending on AI won’t pay off – one of three triggers to dial down our pro-risk view,” BlackRock Investment Institute strategists including Jean Boivin and Wei Li.

By Rita Nazareth, Bloomberg NewsWall Street had a rough start to the week on concern that a cheap artificial intelligence-model from Chinese startup DeepSeek could make valuations of the technology that has powered the bull market tough to justify.From New York to London and Tokyo, equities got hammered. The S&P 500 dropped 1.9% and the Nasdaq 100 slipped 3.7%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers plunged 10% — the most since March 2020. Nvidia Corp., the poster child of the AI frenzy, sank 18% in the biggest market-cap loss for a single stock in market history. With big tech getting crushed, U.S. stocks were set for their worst day since the last Federal Reserve decision that roiled trading.In a rush for safety, defensive industries like consumer staples and health care were bid. Treasuries rallied, driving yields to the lowest levels this year. Haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc climbed. The crypto world got hit, with Bitcoin below $100,000.“What was shaping up to be a big week in the markets got even bigger with the disruption in the AI space,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “That could make this week’s megacap tech earnings even more critical to market sentiment.”Monday’s plunge drove new fissures into a market narrative that prevailed since the re-election of Donald Trump in November, the America-first, tech-fueled uber bullishness that saw a clear upward path for risky assets spurred by deregulation, tax cuts and even government sponsorship of AI investment. Treasury yields slid sharply as haven-seeking investors laid aside concern – for today, anyway – that the new president’s policies will stoke inflation.The severity of the selloff in U.S. assets was proportionate to the weightings of AI-enabled firms in the biggest stock indexes. Even after a recent paring to curb their influence the cohort of Nvidia, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. account for 45% of the Nasdaq 100.

Title: Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG): AI-Optimized Clean Energy and Strategic Partnerships Drive Growth

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) stands against the other AI stocks. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. AI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank JPMorgan. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

As a leading provider of clean energy, Constellation leverages AI to optimize its renewable energy assets, streamline grid operations, and improve energy efficiency for customers. AI-driven predictive analytics play a critical role in maximizing the output of its wind, solar, and nuclear energy plants. By using machine learning models, Constellation can predict maintenance needs, reduce downtime, and enhance energy production efficiency, directly impacting profitability and investor confidence. Furthermore, the company's AI initiatives to manage energy demand and provide real-time data for smart grids appeal to environmentally conscious investors seeking growth in sustainable technologies.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands against the other AI stocks. Investors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. AI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank JPMorgan. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT professionals working on a digital platform, indicating the company's agile digital services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a California-based real estate trust that operates data centers and other technology assets. In February 2024, Equinix partnered with NVIDIA to launch a private cloud service, enabling organizations to manage NVIDIA DGX supercomputing infrastructure for developing custom generative AI models. In November 2024, Equinix announced the construction of a sixth International Business Exchange data center in Singapore, named SG6. With an initial investment of $260 million, SG6 will operate on renewable energy and feature liquid cooling capabilities to support compute-intensive AI workloads. These AI-focused developments have positively impacted the financial performance of the firm. In the first half of 2024, the company experienced increased demand for data center services, driven by an artificial intelligence land grab among tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta. This surge in demand allowed Equinix to raise rents, with prices for hyperscale tech tenants increasing by 19% during this period. Overall EQIX ranks 26th on our list of the important AI stocks for 2025 according to JP Morgan. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than EQIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Private Credit’s Big Squeeze: How the Arms Race for Scale Is Reshaping the Market
URL: https://observer.com/2025/01/private-credit-consolidation-market-impact/
Time Published: 2025-01-27T17:17:48Z
Full Content:
Private credit is in the midst of an arms race as mega-managers scramble to dominate this booming segment of the asset management industry. BlackRock (BLK)’s announced acquisition of HPS Investment Partners in December—its second manager acquisition of the year—highlights an accelerating consolidation trend that promises both opportunities for the largest funds and potential challenges for the market. In addition, Goldman Sachs (GS)’ recent creation of its Capital Solutions Group, a business unit focused on private credit advisory and investing, and JPMorgan Chase’s partnerships with several private credit firms underscore Wall Street’s largest banks’ determination to capitalize on the growth of private credit. Could this rush of capital to industry giants leave middle-market lenders—and the vital swath of American businesses they serve—starved for capital at a time when traditional bank lending remains constrained?

You can opt out anytime. The advantages of economies of scale in asset management are compelling and well-documented. Asset manager revenue is directly tied to the amount of assets under management (AUM). As firms increase AUM, their fixed costs for technology, research and infrastructure can be spread across a larger base, effectively reducing the per-dollar cost of managing client funds. Large asset managers can also negotiate better terms with service providers and counterparties, enabling these firms to develop more sophisticated investment capabilities and risk management systems, which, in theory, can lead to better returns. In addition to scaling AUM, BlackRock’s acquisition of Preqin, a leading private market data vendor, last year highlights its intent to not only grow managed assets but also differentiate its platform by building infrastructure and capabilities that it can vertically integrate into its core investing functions. The benefits of scale, however, may have diminishing returns beyond certain thresholds. As funds grow in size, deploying capital effectively becomes more challenging—fewer deals are large enough for these firms to allocate capital efficiently. This dynamic creates a consolidation paradox: as private credit managers achieve greater scale, they necessarily focus on mega deals, creating potential market inefficiencies that could undermine the industry’s original purpose. The unprecedented inflow of capital to private credit has spurred the industry’s growth, but with a majority of capital flowing to the largest managers, it’s dramatically widening the gap between the large funds and smaller players. For smaller funds, this shift has been stark. Preqin data shows the 10 largest private credit funds claimed 51 percent of capital raised through the third quarter of 2023, compared to 35 percent for all of 2022. For funds outside of the top 50, the share of capital raised plummeted from 22 percent to 9 percent over the same period. As the largest private credit managers scale, it threatens to create a void in middle-market lending. While a $50 million direct lending deal might fit with a $1 billion AUM fund, it’s inefficient for a fund with several hundred billion dollars in AUM to deploy resources to small deals that would account for a de minimis percent of overall returns. With fewer funds willing to deploy capital to middle-market deals, what happens to these businesses that find themselves with less access to capital? With nearly 200,000 such companies accounting for over one-third of U.S. GDP and employing 48 million people, the potential credit vacuum for these borrowers represents more than just a market inefficiency; it’s a structural challenge that could stifle economic growth and innovation. This consolidation pattern mirrors developments in private equity, where mid-sized firms increasingly find themselves in an existential crisis. As Goldman Sachs’ Mike Brandmeyer recently observed, many PE firms “stuck in the middle” face a stark choice between making significant investments to scale up or selling to larger platforms that already have the necessary infrastructure. With institutional investors showing a clear preference for either the largest or newest managers, this “barbelling” effect is forcing consolidation across alternative assets. This pattern reveals a stark irony in the industry’s evolution. The private credit industry was primarily borne out as a response to post-financial crisis regulations that made it costly for banks to serve smaller, riskier borrowers. Yet, as private credit managers consolidate and scale, they appear to follow a similar path to the banks they initially sought to replace, prioritizing larger, more profitable clients at the expense of smaller businesses. For small and mid-sized managers, the changing landscape demands strategic adaptation. Some are finding success through sector specialization or by building stronger regional relationships. Others are exploring partnerships or technological solutions as alternatives to traditional scale advantages. The non-sponsored deal market, or direct lending, where competition tends to be less intense, offers another avenue for differentiation. Specifically, according to the IMF, about 70 percent of private credit deals go to sponsor-backed companies, leaving a significant opportunity for managers to capitalize on direct lending transactions. While requiring more intensive origination efforts, these direct-to-company relationships can offer attractive economics and deeper borrower relationships compared to sponsor-backed deals, as lenders aren’t competing with multiple sponsors’ existing lending relationships. While private credit operating outside the traditional banking system limits the systemic risk imposed on the overall financial system, their interconnectedness and substantial market share naturally raise questions about market stability and contagion risk during periods of stress. For example, stress at any single major private credit player could have outsized effects on market stability and credit availability to both large and mid-sized businesses The future of private credit will be defined by those who can balance scale with efficiency. Mega-managers must find ways to serve smaller borrowers without sacrificing efficiency, while mid-sized players need to lean into specialization and innovation to stay relevant. Ultimately, the winners will be those who can adapt without losing sight of the industry’s original mission—filling the credit gaps that banks left behind. Banks are increasingly partnering with private credit funds to provide their commercial clients with alternative financing options when traditional bank loans aren’t feasible—a sign of how the market is adapting to serve borrower needs. The private credit market’s continued evolution will test whether these innovations can effectively balance the advantages of scale with the necessity of serving a diverse borrower base.

Title: Trump Can Win Again—Advancing Carbon Capture For 2025

WA Parish plant infrastructure at Fort Bend County. NGR Energy and JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration ... [+] Corporation built the Petra Nova Carbon Capture Project. The project is a commercial-scale carbon capture system that captures carbon dioxide in the processed flue gas from an existing unit at the WA Parish power plant. Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2016, in Houston. ( Marie D. De Jesus / Houston Chronicle ) (Photo by Marie D. De Jesus/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) The first Trump administration had a better record in carbon capture by allowing states to approve permits for carbon dioxide injection wells. There is no reason not to give consumers what they want to buy. The second Trump administration should reverse Biden’s EPA carbon capture policy to guarantee U.S. energy dominance. Polls show that a majority of Americans, including Texans, want a lower emissions future. Carbon capture is a primary tool in the emissions reduction portfolio, and the major oil companies are leading the way by investing billions of dollars in capital and jobs to offset not only their own emissions but their customers’ emissions. The Biden administration did not pursue a forward thinking policy with carbon capture and left office not only with dozens of Class VI carbon dioxide injection well applications still pending but the applications by oil producing states to take over the well permitting task from the federal government. The Biden administration’s attitude was that approving carbon capture projects by oil companies only facilitated further use of fossil fuels. This hostility towards the oil industry was counterproductive and set back efforts to lower emissions by four years. Carbon capture projects are underway in a dozen states. The earliest began in Terrell, Texas, in 1972 with the captured carbon dioxide injected being used for EOR, enhanced oil recovery, and most operating carbon capture projects today are paired with EOR projects. More recent projects reclaim the waste carbon dioxide to produce ethanol for applications in fuels, vodka, hand sanitizers, and perfume. The world is decades away from eliminating fossil fuels. Oil and gas production in Africa is driving economic development there and with it, the reduced mortality rates that will be the largest contributor to an expected global population growth of 2 billion people over the next 30 years. While it is obvious that they will not all drive SUVs, they will have electricity, communications, healthcare, and mass transit. The question now becomes, will the U.S. continue its energy dominance with solutions to the emissions problem? Occidental Petroleum and BlackRock have combined forces to build the world’s largest Direct Air Capture project in Ector County, Texas. The STRATOS project will begin operation later this year. Shell is pursuing carbon capture projects in the U.K., Canada, and in Deer Park, Texas. Chevron is operating carbon sequestration facilities in Australia and California. BP is researching sequestration in Indiana, where Archer Daniels Midlands already operates a Class VI injection well. ExxonMobil operates a 1,500 mile network of CO2 pipelines for EOR, industrial use, and storage—currently 9 million metric tons per year—with a completed well in East Texas and an offshore lease of 270,000 acres in Texas for storage. States are leading the energy transition. In Texas, the installed capacity of wind farms and solar farms is greater than that of natural gas power plants because the state’s elected leaders accommodated the growth. The Texas pipeline of wind and solar projects under construction means that renewable electricity will become the dominant supply in a matter of months. And if the Trump EPA grants primacy to the states for approvals of Class VI carbon injection wells, the states will be able to accommodate the pent-up demand for carbon capture. The Trump administration is a fan of market solutions, and these long-term carbon capture investments are led by domestic and foreign private capital. State and federal support via subsidies and tax breaks are helpful but certainly not the primary catalyst. Complaining about these supports invites comparisons to the oil industry’s tax subsidies and does not contribute to the discussion of advancing a proven solution. It is counter-productive to stand in the way of a demonstrated market with willing buyers and willing sellers already in place. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Shiba Inu Community Highlights 10 Reasons Why SHIB ETF Approval Is Inevitable

As the Trump administration’s crypto executive order takes effect, expectations are rising for more Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approvals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2025. Among these anticipations, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community remains hopeful that a SHIB ETF could soon gain approval. In a tweet on Monday, “Shibizens” a Shiba Inu-focused news platform, outlined ten reasons why major financial institutions like BlackRock and Grayscale should list a SHIB ETF. Notably, the platform highlighted SHIB’s “massive market opportunity,” driven by its global base of over 1.3 million holders. It also pointed to Shibarium’s operational Layer 2 blockchain, which supports diverse use cases in gaming, DeFi, and utility tokens such as BONE and TREAT. The platform further emphasized SHIB’s affordability, which appeals to retail investors and expands the potential client base for institutional players. Its high liquidity and trading volume add to its stability, while the broad range of assets within the Shiba Inu ecosystem offers strong diversification prospects. Additionally, Shibizens argued that the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs sets a powerful precedent, demonstrating robust demand for crypto-based investment products. “Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have shown strong demand. SHIB, as a next-generation blockchain project, is a logical step to capture the growing appetite for diversified crypto products.” It wrote. As per the platform, SHIB’s commitment to social causes, exemplified by the Shib Karma Foundation, also resonates with ESG-conscious investors. Additionally, with its global reach and innovative blockchain approach, SHIB positions itself as a forward-thinking investment. In conclusion, the platform argued that introducing a SHIB ETF would play a key role in driving the next wave of crypto innovation while strengthening the position of issuers as forward-thinking leaders in wealth management. “By launching a SHIB ETF, companies like BlackRock can capitalize on emerging crypto trends, meet growing investor demand, and establish themselves as leaders in digital asset management,” It added. This surge in optimism follows the SEC’s approval of similar products for Bitcoin and Ethereum last year. Notably, after the spot ETH ETF approval last May, Shiba Inu’s pseudonymous lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, sent a congratulatory message to Ethereum, cryptically hinting that SHIB could be next in line. Lucie, a leading spokesperson for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has also consistently advocated for the potential of a SHIB ETF. Last July, she expressed strong confidence, stating, “Do I think a SHIB ETF will happen? Most definitely,” citing growing institutional interest in SHIB’s decentralized framework. Last week, Bloomberg ETF strategist Eric Balchunas suggested that more cryptocurrency ETFs, including those for TRUMP and DOGE, are likely to be approved before April, a move that could open doors for others like SHIB. That said, despite the SEC’s lack of indication regarding meme coin ETFs, the SHIB community remains resolute. Campaigns continue to apply pressure on asset managers to front such products to the SEC, with a Change.org petition led by the SHIB army aimed at Grayscale already attracting over 11,000 signatures.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 6:01:30 AM PST by MtnClimber "Sustainability" investments became popular a few years back. So-called experts said companies shouldn't just focus on profit. They should put more effort into being "nice." Funds pushing ESG (environmental, social and governance) were all the rage. Giant investment firms like BlackRock pressured companies to hire more women and minorities. CEO Larry Fink announced, "All investments are going to be looked through sustainability." But "sustainability" is a mostly meaningless word. Parnassus claimed it helped meet UN sustainability goals of "nutrition" and "sanitation" by investing in U.S. Foods and Clorox. Starbucks phased out plastic straws while adding lids that used more plastic. BP rebranded itself as "Beyond Petroleum." Wisely, it mostly invested in petroleum. Former Vice President Al Gore made money peddling climate change hysteria. He created "sustainability investment funds," claiming "sustainability factors ... actually enhance returns!" His funds did enhance Gore's own returns; he made millions. But over the past three years, his "sustainable" fund underperformed the stock market. Recently the fund managers admitted they "made investment mistakes." Most funds promoting "sustainable investment" did worse than the market. So, why did trillions of dollars pour into such funds? "Because of pressures," says Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Investments, in my new video. "Their largest clients are blue states' pension (funds) like CalPERS and the New York pension (fund) who put pressure on them: 'Adopt these agendas or you're going to lose us as your largest customer!'" CalPERS still brags about "mitigating climate risk" and adding "climate-conscious board members" to Exxon's board. Presidential Climate Envoy John Kerry pompously bullied banks: "They will invest into climate-related efforts," he intoned. Today, banks and even Blackrock are running from sustainability nonsense. "What you're seeing," says Cole, "is ESG funds shuttering at record speed ... and they're not apologizing." Progressives never do. This fad didn't just hurt investors; it hurt companies that America needs. America needs high-performance computer chips. Intel was once the leading manufacturer of such chips. But now, even as Congress gives Intel billions in taxpayer handouts, the company is cutting thousands of jobs. Why? While Intel's competitors innovated, Intel obsessed about "sustainability." Intel's website lists endless ESG goals like "environmental, health, wellness, and safety programs to care for people and the planet." It even brags about "green software" ... whatever that is. That's a lot of energy spent not making the best chip. When companies spend time sucking up to politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. Intel's stock fell 60% last year...SNIP TOPICS: Business/Economy; Society KEYWORDS: wokeism 1 posted on 01/27/2025 6:01:30 AM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber When companies spend time sucking up to LEFTIST politicians rather than innovating, they often decline. 2 posted on 01/27/2025 6:02:11 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

Title: Pro-Crypto Policies Surge As Banks Lag—Here’s How They Can Catch Up

Go ahead and continuously improvement concept, silhouette man jump on a cliff from past to future ... [+] with cloud sky background. The landscape of digital assets is undergoing a significant shift as pro crypto regulatory clarity begins to take shape. Policymakers are moving faster than the price of Bitcoin. In recent weeks, significant developments, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) withdrawal of the contentious Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) via SAB 122 and President Trump’s January 23, 2025 Digital Assets Executive Order, signal a bullish trajectory for crypto policies. Meanwhile, traditional banks, burdened by outdated frameworks and resistance to the emerging digital asset industry, risk establishing their foothold in this rapidly evolving sector. SAB 121, introduced during former SEC Chair Gary Gensler's tenure, required financial institutions to account for customer-held crypto assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. While purportedly intended to protect investors from insolvency risks, critics lambasted the guidance as overly punitive and impractical for innovation. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce quickly celebrated the SEC’s decision to revoke SAB 121in an X/Twitter post, and bid SAB 121 “a not-so-fond farewell”. SAB 122 directs firms to follow FASB and international accounting standards, which better suit the evolving crypto landscape. Peirce highlighted that this change removes a regulatory barrier, fostering innovation and collaboration between crypto firms and financial institutions. This rollback reduces operational burdens and encourages institutional participation, paving the way for broader crypto adoption. On the heels of the SEC announcement came President Trump's much-anticipated Digital Assets Executive Order. This policy framework overhaul addresses longstanding issues, including the legal categorization of digital assets, taxation, and cross-border applications​. The EO outlines key pillars aimed at fostering innovation while ensuring consumer protection: These measures signal the administration’s recognition of blockchain technology's potential to revolutionize finance and other industries. In stark contrast to the policy momentum, traditional banks remain ensnared in skepticism and operational inertia, much of which can be attributed to prudential regulators’ admonitions. Documents obtained by Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request initiated by Coinbase revealed that U.S. regulators informally discouraged banks from expanding crypto services, despite officially denying a policy of "debanking"​​, also referred to within the crypto industry as Chokepoint 2.0. While crypto adoption surged globally, most banks have failed to innovate their offerings. Their hesitancy contrasts starkly with the likes of Fidelity and Morgan Stanley, which are actively expanding crypto-based investment products​​. As regulatory clarity improves, banks must pivot quickly to avoid irrelevance. Opportunities include: Collaborating with fintech and blockchain startups: Banks can integrate blockchain to enhance cross-border payments and real-time settlement systems. Investing in crypto infrastructure: Developing secure custodial services and compliance solutions will attract institutional clients exploring crypto markets. Educating stakeholders: From brokers to customers, knowledge-building is critical to bridge the gap between traditional finance and emerging technologies​​. Failure to adapt will likely result in a widening gap between innovators and incumbents, where fintech players dominate while banks struggle to maintain relevance. The SEC's revised stance and the administration's pro-crypto policies underscore the urgency for financial institutions to adapt. While regulators open the door for innovation, banks are at a crossroads: evolve or be left behind. As the digital asset revolution accelerates, the institutions that embrace this paradigm shift will shape the future of finance, while those clinging to legacy models risk extinction. While many banks have hesitated to embrace the digital assets revolution, others have positioned themselves as trailblazers, leveraging crypto innovations to secure a foothold in the industry. However, the stark contrast between public rhetoric and private actions among certain institutions reveals a hypocrisy that cannot be ignored. Some financial institutions have embraced the crypto wave, proactively adapting their models to stay ahead of the curve. Fidelity Investments stands out as a pioneer in institutional crypto adoption. Since launching Fidelity Digital Assets in 2018, the company has offered secure custodial services and direct access to bitcoin for institutional investors. Fidelity was also among the first to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Canada and played a key role in the U.S. debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, when nine new spot Bitcoin ETFs and two conversions hit the market, collectively drawing $1.9 billion in inflows during their first three days of trading, according to Reuters. Similarly, Goldman Sachs, once a crypto skeptic, has now emerged as a player in legitimizing digital assets within traditional finance. The bank operates a robust digital asset desk, offering clients access to cash-settled derivatives, options, and futures tied to Bitcoin. According to Mathew McDermott, Goldman’s Global Head of Digital Assets, the firm has developed a comprehensive suite of crypto products to meet growing institutional demand. In the second quarter of 2024, Goldman made its debut in the spot Bitcoin ETF market, purchasing $418 million worth of bitcoin funds, including a $238 million stake in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust. The bank also disclosed positions in ETFs from Grayscale, Fidelity, and Invesco, as detailed in CNBC’s coverage of its Q2 filings. In stark contrast, Bank of America (BoA) has been a notorious laggard. While quietly filing for blockchain-related patents for years, the bank has publicly downplayed the potential of cryptocurrencies. BoA’s leadership has repeatedly warned clients of crypto's volatility, characterizing it as a “speculative bubble.” Despite these claims, the bank's internal research division acknowledged in a 2021 report that blockchain technology could fundamentally reshape finance. BoA’s inconsistency underscores its struggle to reconcile crypto's potential with its conservative stance​​. In a recent Squawk Box interview during Davos 2025, BoA CEO Brian Moynihan hedged his bets regarding institutional adoption of crypto, acknowledging BofA and other banking incumbents may have to adopt crypto payments given the regulatory shift. Wells Fargo has similarly been slow to act. Although offering limited crypto-related investment products to wealthy clients in 2021, years behind competitors, the bank has focused primarily on cautionary narratives about crypto fraud and environmental concerns rather than embracing innovation. The bank’s approach began to pivot in 2024, permitting bitcoin ETF investments for clients who specifically requested access. Additionally, according to DeCrypt.co, paperwork filed with the SEC shows that the bank had purchased shares of Grayscale's GBTC spot Bitcoin ETF, and that it also has exposure to Bitcoin Depot Inc., a Bitcoin ATM provider. Perhaps the most striking example of hypocrisy lies with JPMorgan Chase. For years, CEO Jamie Dimon has been one of bitcoin’s most vocal critics, famously calling it a “fraud” in 2017 and warning that it would “blow up.” Publicly, Dimon continues to maintain a stance of disdain for cryptocurrencies, repeatedly labeling them as speculative assets with no inherent value. However, JPMorgan has been integrating blockchain and digital asset into its operations for years. The bank developed JPM Coin (now rebranded Kinexys Digital Payments), a digital token designed to facilitate instant cross-border payments for institutional clients, showcasing its faith in blockchain technology for real-world applications. Moreover, JPMorgan has become a key player in the Bitcoin ETF space, serving as an authorized participant for the Blackrock bitcoin ETF (IBIT). JPMorgan's dual approach—public skepticism paired with internal adoption—highlights a troubling trend among some legacy institutions. These banks publicly criticize cryptocurrencies, discouraging retail clients from participating with brash headlines, while leveraging the same technology to bolster their institutional offerings and operational efficiencies. This pattern of public disdain and private opportunism is more than a marketing inconsistency; it undermines trust. As retail investors increasingly notice this duplicity, they may shift loyalty to forward-thinking incumbents, fintech startups, crypto-native institutions that offer transparency and alignment with the industry's ethos. Banks that remain insincere about their crypto involvement risk alienating a growing segment of clients who view blockchain technology as the future of finance. Transparency and trust are paramount in the new digital asset economy. As digital assets evolve, banking professionals face a clear choice: adapt or risk irrelevance. While some institutions have embraced blockchain technology, many still lag in understanding and integrating crypto into their services. Here’s how banking professionals can stay competitive: Crypto and blockchain are no longer fringe concepts. Banking professionals must understand blockchain’s foundational concepts, including cryptocurrencies, DeFi (decentralized finance), and NFTs. Staying informed about regulatory updates from the SEC, CFTC, IRS and prudential regulators is also critical. Internal continuing education and client education is key. Blockchain’s value extends far beyond cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Key applications include: To meet evolving client needs, banks must innovate. Priority areas include: Rather than reinventing the wheel, banks should collaborate with fintech startups and blockchain companies to accelerate adoption. Partnerships can fast-track blockchain implementation in clearing, settlements, and lending. With increasing regulatory clarity, compliance can be a competitive advantage. By proactively addressing anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC), and taxation requirements, banks can position themselves as trusted leaders in the crypto space. Internal inertia is often a bank’s biggest obstacle. Leadership must prioritize innovation by recruiting blockchain experts, upskilling staff, and piloting crypto-related projects. The digital assets landscape in the United States and beyond is evolving rapidly, creating both opportunities and challenges for financial professionals. With regulatory clarity improving, including the Digital Assets Executive Order and the withdrawal of SAB 121, the path is clear for broader institutional adoption. Traditional banks can no longer justify a head-in-sand approach and now face an urgent and unavoidable crossroads: embrace innovation to lead in this new financial era or cling to outdated models and risk obsolescence. Financial professionals must act now to build the expertise, infrastructure, and partnerships needed to thrive. Those who hesitate may find themselves sidelined in this new digital asset economy.

Looking back, 2024 was a spectacular year for the crypto world, marking a transformative milestone in technology, markets, and ecosystems. It will be remembered as a landmark chapter in the crypto history, with surging institutional interest in crypto assets, technology innovations, regulatory advancements and Bitcoin (BTC) reaching new heights fuelled by the crypto friendly Trump administration. We just entered the new year 2025. For me it is a tradition to deliver a blog in which I present the main trends for the new year on blockchain and crypto. This blog that will be somewhat longer than normal, dives into the core trends that will further shape the crypto market in 2025 and beyond. thereby increasingly transforming traditional finance. I Existing blockchain services will gain more massive adoption A first trend we will see is that in 2025 existing blockchain services will gain more massive adoption. Most important are tokenised real world Assets (RWA), DeFi, crypto ETFs as well as the introduction of more stablecoins. Tokenised RWAs reshaping finance One of the most significant trends in 2024 reshaping finance is the tokenisation of real-world assets, like property, commodities, real estate and securities, attracting both investors and companies from of a range of industries. This is transforming traditional finance, enhancing liquidity, transparency, and accessibility in the financial markets to various assets classes. By converting real world assets into digital tokens on a blockchain, tokenisation is unlocking new investment opportunities and making traditionally illiquid assets, such as real estate, more accessible.to a wider range of investors. Tokenization enables fractional ownership, making them tradable even in small fractions, allowing investors to buy and sell portions of assets, thereby unlocking liquidity for traditionally nonliquid assets The trend of tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) is expected to take off in an accelerated way in 2025 hitting critical mass, revolutionizing how traditional finance interacts with blockchain technology. 2025 will push the boundaries of what can be tokenized. From medical data to personal biometrics, tokenizing assets once deemed untouchable will unlock new markets and create unprecedented opportunities for digital value. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): reaching all-time highs Decentralized finance (DeFi) that refers to financial services built on blockchain networks that operate without traditional intermediaries like banks, has exploded over the past few years. They provide decentralized alternatives to banking, lending, and trading. But this is just the beginning. DeFi is projected to expand significantly in 2025 and beyond, remaining a dominant force in the crypto space. Tokenized securities and high-value assets will thereby catalyse DeFi’s growth, attracting both retail and institutional investors, adding new liquidity and utility. The DeFi sector could benefit from further integration with traditional financial systems, allowing for seamless transactions between fiat and cryptocurrencies. As the DeFi ecosystem matures, and DeFi platforms such as automated market makers (AMM's) and decentralised exchanges (DEX's) become more mature and more user-friendly, it is likely that a growing number of investors will turn to these services for flexible lending and borrowing solutions. This year the DeFi market could reach a $100 billion valuation as more platforms solidify their roles within the ecosystem, more than double compared to 2024.. Increased Market Share of Crypto ETFs Crypto ETFs have seen significant developments, particularly with the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs by the SEC in January 2024. This marked a transformative moment for the cryptocurrency market, paving the way for traditional financial players to include these products in their portfolios without the need for navigating crypto exchanges and wallets. This approval already provided a massive inflow of institutional capital, with Bitcoin’s price seeing a notable boost above $100.000, following the announcement of Trump’s presidential victory. The emergence and growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs could continue through 2025, significantly accelerating institutional adoption. Bitcoin ETFs would get more inflows than ever before and maybe reach $40–50 billion this year. The popularity of these ETFs might greatly improve the situation of Bitcoin on the market. Building on the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and the more crypto friendly Trump administration, this year could mark a turning point for other cryptocurrency ETFs. There are currently over 10 ETF applications, including Solana (SOL) and XRP, pending review by the SEC for assets signalling the potential for expanded institutional interest in a broader range of digital assets. Such ETFs and other ETPs may continue to increase liquidity and stability in the blockchain and digital asset market. Stablecoins for Enterprise Adoption Last year the stablecoin market showed firm growth, triggered by the rising demand for digital assets that offer the stability of traditional fiat currencies. The stablecoin market could double in size by the end of 2025 reaching $ 400 billion, reflecting increased adoption and integration into various traditional financial systems. The stablecoin market's significant growth in 2024 and projected expansion in 2025 highlight its integral role in the digital transformation of the financial landscape. This is based on broader acceptance of digital payments, advancements in blockchain technology, and increased regulatory clarity. Stablecoins facilitating seamless transactions and acting as a hedge against the volatility commonly associated with cryptocurrencies. They also provide access to financial services for individuals in regions with limited banking infrastructure, promoting greater economic participation. More institutional interest in the crypto world This year is gearing up to be a pivotal year, especially when it comes to institutional blockchain and crypto adoption. In 2024 we already have seen a growing institutional interest in tokenised real-world assets (RWAs) and ETFs, thereby recognising cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. Major companies have already made Bitcoin and other important cryptocurrencies as part of their balance sheets, while institutional investors are starting to see digital currencies as a viable store of value Major payment networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, are incorporating blockchain technology into their operations, while major players in the financial world like Fidelity, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are entering the RWA space, signalling growing confidence in the potential of blockchain technology to transform traditional asset markets. The trend of traditional institutions entering the crypto space is expected to continue during 2025 in an accelerated way. Asset managers, hedge funds, and large corporations will likely increase their exposure to crypto assets as part of diversified portfolios. Institutional adoption is expected to reach new heights.T he volume of institutional crypto investments could surpass the $500 billion mark, driven by demand for regulated investment vehicles, including ETFs and structured products. As institutional investors continue to show interest, we may see further innovations in cryptocurrency-related products, such as bitcoin loans. These types of loans allow institutions and individuals to leverage their crypto holdings without selling them, offering a more efficient way to access liquidity. II Arrival of new blockchain services Other interesting trends to expect in 2025 is the growing adoption of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) and the arrival of new blockchain related services such as Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Growing Adoption of Blockchain-as-a-Service (Baas) Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud based platform with which companies may implement and use blockchain solutions. In 2024, BaaS matured significantly, becoming a key component for businesses looking to leverage blockchain technology without the complexity of developing and the need of managing their own complex infrastructure. By simplifying the acceptance of blockchain BaaS trends in the technology. Accessibility and accessibility will be stimulated. BaaS will become an important trend in 2025, where big technology companies such as Microsoft and Amazon offer blockchain services (infrastructure and maintenance). With BaaS companies may chose the most suitable blockchain protocol for their needs. Going forward, more companies might adopt BaaS platforms, which could lead to increased application in supply chain management, finance and health care. Launch of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are another significant trend on the horizon. These government-backed digital currencies aim to enhance payment systems, reduce transaction costs and increase financial inclusion. They have become a focal point in the financial world. 2025 is poised to be their breakout year. Central banks worldwide are exploring or piloting CBDCs as a way to digitize their national currencies to enhance monetary control, streamline payments and reduce dependence on cash. This year multiple countries are expected to have launched fully operational CBDCs. They could be available in over 20 countries, including China, India and the EU each utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate secure, efficient transactions. I however just heard that Trump will put an end to all CBDC activities by the Fed in the US. CBDCs are expected to coexist alongside existing decentralised cryptocurrencies, though they will operate within more centralised frameworks, providing a stable digital currency for everyday transactions. The coexistence of CBDCs and decentralized cryptocurrencies will present unique dynamics. While CBDCs offer stability and government backing, decentralized cryptocurrencies provide greater privacy, autonomy, and resistance to censorship. Balancing these features will likely define the financial landscape of 2025 and further. III Technology innovations: Solving blockchain challenges During 2025 we will also see accelerated technology activities to solve the various blockchain challenges that restrict blockchain adoption including interoperability, scalability, security, privacy and sustainability. solutions .These challenges are increasingly being addressed for the blockchain technology to reach its full potential Layer 2 solutions are revolutionizing DeFi This year we will see is the accelerated emergence of Layer 2 solutions. These solutions address the scaling and interoperability issues of blockchain networks, enhancing scalability and facilitate integration between blockchains, which hold immense potential to transform the crypto ecosystem. A persistent obstacle has been the siloed nature of blockchains. Interoperability solutions may break through these barriers by building bridges between different blockchain eco-systems, enabling seamless interactions across different networks. Several platforms and developers are working on solving this challenge by building interoperable solutions to connect multiple blockchains. This reduces the complexity for users who wish to interact with multiple cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications (dApps). This process will be accelerated in 2025. Projects like Polkadot and Cosmos use Relais chains and hubs to let communicate blockchains with each other, bridging previously isolated ecosystems. This approach makes it easier for developers to create secure, interoperable smart contracts that operate seamlessly across multiple chains. We will also see increased use of the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable decentralized applications to interact across chains with minimal friction, improving both usability and composability. As blockchain continues to be onboarded and integrated within corporations across various sectors network multiple Layer-2 scaling applications have more recently come to market, enabling lower latency and higher transaction throughput. This lets data and assets move easily between different blockchains. By 2025, advancements in layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Ethereum’s rollups and Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, are expected to significantly enhance transaction speeds and reduce costs. With Layer 2 integration, transaction fees are expected to decrease, making the network more accessible for users, attracting more DeFi and NFT projects. L2 solutions may also introduce smart contract functionality, facilitating the adoption of decentralized applications, making DeFi accessible to a wider audience. This is driving a new wave of DeFi growth paving the way for a robust DeFi ecosystem built around cryptocurrencies. Improved Security and Privacy Features As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, security and privacy concerns will continue to be a focal point. More severe data privacy regulation worldwide would lead to stronger integration of privacy improving technologies making blockchain a trustful and more conform solution in various segments including finance, healthcare and identity verification. In 2025 we may expect to see increased innovation in security protocols, such as more robust encryption methods, decentralized identity solutions, and multi-signature authentication. Advancements in quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) will introduce new layers of security, privacy and functionality to blockchain systems. Privacy protocols will play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem by providing secure, non-custodial trading options. Privacy related technologies are likely to become more widely used, enabling users to transact with greater privacy, which is an important consideration for both individual and institutional users. Green Crypto Projects and Regenerative Finance (ReFi) Environmental sustainability has become a critical concern in the crypto industry. The environmental impact of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) mining, has led to growing interest in green crypto solutions. As governments and environmental groups push for more sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency space is exploring eco-friendly solutions. Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) has set a trend for sustainable crypto practices, and other networks are promoting eco-friendly approaches. In 2025 the market is expected to witness a significant shift towards eco-friendly solutions, with more blockchains change over to POS while other energy-efficient consensus mechanisms are gaining traction. Additionally, projects that promote renewable energy for mining operations are becoming more common. The way the cryptocurrency business tackles environmental issues is being transformed by Regenerative Finance (ReFi). In addition to promoting sustainability, these programs are actively working to restore the environment. ReFi aims to address this by funding ecological restoration projects through blockchain. With public and private partnerships focusing on green technology, ReFi projects may become a cornerstone of crypto’s future. Leading the change are projects utilizing carbon-negative mechanisms and renewable energy-powered mining operations. This year we may see a significant shift toward green(er) cryptocurrencies, that could also lead to the development of crypto loan products that focus on supporting environmentally sustainable projects, opening new opportunities for eco-conscious investors. IV Blockchain integration with other technologies Other fundamental trends we may see in 2025 is the increasing merger of blockchain with other technologies of which Artificial Intelligence (AI) and WEB3 are the most prominent ones. Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain: A new tech narrative One of the most exciting trends in cryptocurrency is the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. They are converging in unprecedented ways, shaping the future of decentralised systems. This merger is poised to accelerate in 2025. AI-driven crypto projects are expected to experience significant growth in various sectors, demonstrating the potential of AI in driving crypto innovation, thereby introducing new opportunities for investors and creating novel solutions for industries across the globe. More sophisticated AI applications will likely emerge, potentially disrupting established systems, such as decentralised AI platforms, On-chain AI agent activity, ID checks and DePIN.. Decentralized AI platforms, which facilitate machine learning models powered by blockchain, are gaining attention. These platforms incentivize data sharing and model training in a decentralized, transparent way. Machine learning algorithms are being deployed to enhance smart contracts, secure networks, and optimise consensus mechanisms. Decentralized artificial intelligence (deAI) is set to reshape how AI operates by leveraging blockchain to distribute computation and data storage across a decentralized network. DeAI leverages blockchain to address data privacy concerns and enable distributed computing, creating a novel economic model. DeAI enhances transparency, security and privacy. This year we are likely to see more decentralized platforms that utilize AI-powered tokens to improve everything from supply chain management to security protocols. One of the most compelling narratives that will gain massive traction in 2025 is the integration of AI agents into the crypto ecosystem, extending beyond decentralized finance (DeFi) into diverse sectors. These specialized AI bots are designed to understand user intent and execute complex operations in dApps, streamlining processes transactions across various applications, thereby optimizing results by autonomously adapting their strategies. Several protocols have been working on ways to provide ID verification on chain over the past few years. One of the advancements in this field is undoubtedly the emergence of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, a technology that allows a human to prove themselves without revealing any personal information. One of the most promising applications of AI in cryptocurrencies to capture investor and user interest will be the development of DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), built on physical devices such as sensors and cameras. DePIN projects integrate blockchain technology with physical infrastructure, such as telecommunications, transportation, and energy. These projects aim to decentralize traditional industries by rewarding participants via digital tokens for providing resources and real services Web3 and DeFi: The New Financial Frontier Another technology trend we will see in 2025 is Web3, the decentralized version of the internet, further integrate blockchain technology into everyday applications. Increased demand for decentralized solutions underscores the need for a transparent, secure internet ecosystem. This integration is expected to reshape digital experiences by promoting user control and data privacy. Web3 and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) are set to change global finance by 2025. As DeFi expands, institutional adoption rises, and Web3 matures, the cryptocurrency landscape will likely undergo significant changes. With decentralized applications (dApps) gaining popularity, Web3 promises a new internet model where users interact on peer-to-peer networks. Everyone will have more options for managing money, getting loans, and making international deals. This shift could lead to more innovation and challenge old banking ways. V Regulatory Clarity: A Catalyst for Crypto Growth Regulation remains a key challenge and opportunity for the cryptocurrency market. As the crypto market expands and firms are increasingly embracing and invest in crypto, there is increasing need of regulatory clarity. Governments around the world, recognizing the growing role of crypto assets in the economy, are actively working on crypto regulation. They are creating frameworks and rules that will allow for safer, more secure crypto transactions. Various jurisdictions thereby are still taking different approaches. By 2025, global regulatory frameworks however are expected to be more cohesive, addressing issues such as anti-money laundering (AML), consumer protection, and environmental sustainability. The future of crypto regulation will likely focus on balancing innovation with consumer protection, making trading safer and more transparent. Investors are betting that the Trump presidency will be much more crypto-friendly than the Biden administration. Clear regulatory rules and guidelines for crypto assets and platforms, could bring increased institutional investment into the crypto space, accelerating its integration into global financial systems. VI Integration of Blockchain Technology in Traditional Finance All these developments are a signal that the bridging of traditional finance and digital assets is inevitable. Tokenized RWAs and stablecoins are poised to gain mainstream acceptance and become a cornerstone of modern finance. This mix of traditional finance and decentralised finance is changing the financial and banking world. Blockchain technology will increasingly be integrated into traditional financial systems. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are changing how banks work. We are likely to see banks offering crypto loan products, allowing customers to borrow against their digital assets while maintaining access to traditional banking services. This integration of blockchain into traditional finance could also result in hybrid financial products that combine the best aspects of both worlds—decentralization and regulatory oversight. With major players in FinTech, like PayPal and Visa, already integrating cryptocurrencies into their platforms and experimenting with stablecoins, real-world use cases could soon become a common mode of transaction. Forward thinking: redefining the traditional financial landscape Looking ahead the world of cryptocurrency is set for big changes, undergoing profound transformations. It holds significant potential for the expansive growth and further development of the cryptocurrency industry. Trends like mainstream crypto adoption, growing institutional interest and the integration of blockchain in traditional finance will redefine the financial landscape. But also continued advancements and innovations in blockchain technology and increasing regulatory clarity all are set to become key drivers for crypto to reshape traditional finance and create a more integrated financial world of both decentralised finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi).

Additionally, projects that promote renewable energy for mining operations are becoming more common. The way the cryptocurrency business tackles environmental issues is being transformed by Regenerative Finance (ReFi). In addition to promoting sustainability, these programs are actively working to restore the environment. ReFi aims to address this by funding ecological restoration projects through blockchain. With public and private partnerships focusing on green technology, ReFi projects may become a cornerstone of crypto’s future. Leading the change are projects utilizing carbon-negative mechanisms and renewable energy-powered mining operations. This year we may see a significant shift toward green(er) cryptocurrencies, that could also lead to the development of crypto loan products that focus on supporting environmentally sustainable projects, opening new opportunities for eco-conscious investors. IV Blockchain integration with other technologies Other fundamental trends we may see in 2025 is the increasing merger of blockchain with other technologies of which Artificial Intelligence (AI) and WEB3 are the most prominent ones. Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain: A new tech narrative One of the most exciting trends in cryptocurrency is the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. They are converging in unprecedented ways, shaping the future of decentralised systems. This merger is poised to accelerate in 2025. AI-driven crypto projects are expected to experience significant growth in various sectors, demonstrating the potential of AI in driving crypto innovation, thereby introducing new opportunities for investors and creating novel solutions for industries across the globe. More sophisticated AI applications will likely emerge, potentially disrupting established systems, such as decentralised AI platforms, On-chain AI agent activity, ID checks and DePIN.. Decentralized AI platforms, which facilitate machine learning models powered by blockchain, are gaining attention. These platforms incentivize data sharing and model training in a decentralized, transparent way. Machine learning algorithms are being deployed to enhance smart contracts, secure networks, and optimise consensus mechanisms. Decentralized artificial intelligence (deAI) is set to reshape how AI operates by leveraging blockchain to distribute computation and data storage across a decentralized network. DeAI leverages blockchain to address data privacy concerns and enable distributed computing, creating a novel economic model. DeAI enhances transparency, security and privacy. This year we are likely to see more decentralized platforms that utilize AI-powered tokens to improve everything from supply chain management to security protocols. One of the most compelling narratives that will gain massive traction in 2025 is the integration of AI agents into the crypto ecosystem, extending beyond decentralized finance (DeFi) into diverse sectors. These specialized AI bots are designed to understand user intent and execute complex operations in dApps, streamlining processes transactions across various applications, thereby optimizing results by autonomously adapting their strategies. Several protocols have been working on ways to provide ID verification on chain over the past few years. One of the advancements in this field is undoubtedly the emergence of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, a technology that allows a human to prove themselves without revealing any personal information. One of the most promising applications of AI in cryptocurrencies to capture investor and user interest will be the development of DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), built on physical devices such as sensors and cameras. DePIN projects integrate blockchain technology with physical infrastructure, such as telecommunications, transportation, and energy. These projects aim to decentralize traditional industries by rewarding participants via digital tokens for providing resources and real services Web3 and DeFi: The New Financial Frontier Another technology trend we will see in 2025 is Web3, the decentralized version of the internet, further integrate blockchain technology into everyday applications. Increased demand for decentralized solutions underscores the need for a transparent, secure internet ecosystem. This integration is expected to reshape digital experiences by promoting user control and data privacy. Web3 and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) are set to change global finance by 2025. As DeFi expands, institutional adoption rises, and Web3 matures, the cryptocurrency landscape will likely undergo significant changes. With decentralized applications (dApps) gaining popularity, Web3 promises a new internet model where users interact on peer-to-peer networks. Everyone will have more options for managing money, getting loans, and making international deals. This shift could lead to more innovation and challenge old banking ways. V Regulatory Clarity: A Catalyst for Crypto Growth Regulation remains a key challenge and opportunity for the cryptocurrency market. As the crypto market expands and firms are increasingly embracing and invest in crypto, there is increasing need of regulatory clarity. Governments around the world, recognizing the growing role of crypto assets in the economy, are actively working on crypto regulation. They are creating frameworks and rules that will allow for safer, more secure crypto transactions. Various jurisdictions thereby are still taking different approaches. By 2025, global regulatory frameworks however are expected to be more cohesive, addressing issues such as anti-money laundering (AML), consumer protection, and environmental sustainability. The future of crypto regulation will likely focus on balancing innovation with consumer protection, making trading safer and more transparent. Investors are betting that the Trump presidency will be much more crypto-friendly than the Biden administration. Clear regulatory rules and guidelines for crypto assets and platforms, could bring increased institutional investment into the crypto space, accelerating its integration into global financial systems. VI Integration of Blockchain Technology in Traditional Finance All these developments are a signal that the bridging of traditional finance and digital assets is inevitable. Tokenized RWAs and stablecoins are poised to gain mainstream acceptance and become a cornerstone of modern finance. This mix of traditional finance and decentralised finance is changing the financial and banking world. Blockchain technology will increasingly be integrated into traditional financial systems. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies are changing how banks work. We are likely to see banks offering crypto loan products, allowing customers to borrow against their digital assets while maintaining access to traditional banking services. This integration of blockchain into traditional finance could also result in hybrid financial products that combine the best aspects of both worlds—decentralization and regulatory oversight. With major players in FinTech, like PayPal and Visa, already integrating cryptocurrencies into their platforms and experimenting with stablecoins, real-world use cases could soon become a common mode of transaction. Forward thinking: redefining the traditional financial landscape Looking ahead the world of cryptocurrency is set for big changes, undergoing profound transformations. It holds significant potential for the expansive growth and further development of the cryptocurrency industry. Trends like mainstream crypto adoption, growing institutional interest and the integration of blockchain in traditional finance will redefine the financial landscape. But also continued advancements and innovations in blockchain technology and increasing regulatory clarity all are set to become key drivers for crypto to reshape traditional finance and create a more integrated financial world of both decentralised finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi).

Some analysts maintain that altcoins could still outperform Bitcoin despite a delayed start of the rally. Per the Ethereum [ETH] MVRV Pricing Bands, each bullish cycle saw ETH surpass the 3.2 MVRV Pricing Band, indicating strong investor optimism and market momentum during these periods. At press time, ETH’s price was at $3,330, which was significantly below the 3.2 MVRV band priced at $6,770. This discrepancy suggested that while ETH was valued reasonably in terms of its historical realized price, it hasn’t reached the euphoric valuation peaks as in past bullish cycles. The bands at lower MVRV ratios, like 0.8, 1.0, and 2.4, sit at $1,693.33, $2,116.66, and $5,080.00 respectively, serving as potential support levels during market retractions. Source: Ali Charts/X Considering this, ETH could see significant upside potential if it approaches and surpasses the 3.2 band in future bullish conditions. This would not only reflect growing market confidence but also suggest a possible continuation of ETH’s uptrend in coming cycles. Additionally, ETH’s resistance indicated critical turning points where ETH either faced a pullback or a breakthrough. Breaking past this, then followed by a substantial uptrend, could suggest a bullish continuation. Ethereum appeared to be approaching this level once again, which could trigger a rally towards $6770. This move could be in line with historical cycles where Ethereum gathered significant momentum after crossing the MVRV threshold. Source: TradingView A successful break past the resistance could lead to a surge in buying activity. This is supported by the fact that BlackRock now holds over 1.2M ETH through its Spot ETF, while Fidelity’s FETH holds 432K ETH and Bitwise’s ETHW holds 105K ETH. The inflows suggest rising institutional demand. Finally, analysts are having different views on ETH, probably because of the delayed altseason. Michael van de Poppe called it the “most hated rally” suggesting a surprising bullish run, one that market sentiment did not initially favor. Also, Joao Wedson noted that altcoins have already dropped significantly, so it’s likely that many will recover and outperform Bitcoin. This predicted rally could coincide with a growing interest in “real utility coins,” or cryptos that offer functional, real-world applications. Read Ethereum’s [ETH] Price Prediction 2025–2026 As institutional interest in utility-focused tokens increases, their adoption could boost demand for Ethereum, given its key role in the blockchain ecosystem. As ETH approaches the MVRV value again in 2025, sustaining institutional embracement could lead to a strong uptrend, defying initial market skepticism and solidifying its position in both market valuation and utility.
