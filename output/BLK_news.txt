The multibillionaire tech mogul and philanthropist owns a large portion of a key service provider for immigration flights. And now, with new funding from Congress and an aggressive push from the White House, more and more immigration flights are taking off, transporting immigration detainees both within the United States and to their home countries — or, in some cases, to places they’ve never been before. Gates’ connection to the U.S. detention and deportation machine is a company called Signature Aviation. Signature calls itself “the world’s largest network of private aviation terminals,” and it’s a linchpin in the day-to-day machinery of Trump’s immigration enforcement apparatus. For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. Support our mission to keep us around for the next 20 — we can’t do this without you. Private charter carriers subcontracted for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to transport immigration detainees — part of a network known as “ICE Air,” a reference to the Department of Homeland Security’s ICE Air Operations — use Signature’s services daily. As a fixed-base operator, or FBO, Signature supplies ground crews, aviation fuel, boarding stairs, and airplane hangar space at hundreds of airports around the world, mostly in the United States. The private firm that holds Gates’ and the Gates Foundation Trust’s assets, Cascade Investment, increased its stake in the company to 30% in 2021, when it and two partners bought Signature outright for $4.7 billion. Human rights advocates — plane trackers and activists who keep tabs on deportation flights, as well as the aviation and logistics companies profiting from them — say Gates’ stake in Signature is at odds with his humanitarian work, including the Gates Foundation’s support of a plethora of immigration-focused nonprofits. Without FBOs like Signature, they say, Trump’s mass deportation agenda would be stuck on the ground. Gates himself has not publicly commented on Signature Aviation’s crucial role in servicing ICE Air flights. Neither the Gates Foundation nor Cascade Asset Management Company, which oversees Cascade Investment, responded to multiple requests for comment. At one airport, Signature appears to have worked to make its branding less visibly associated with immigration flights. Last month, a set of Signature boarding stairs in Seattle — where the county government set up cameras in 2023 to keep an eye on immigration flights — got a new accessory: two sheets of cardboard, taped over the company’s logos. FBOs “are critical, obviously, because they provide fuel and other services while the plane makes its stops,” said Tom Cartwright, a retired financial executive who has tracked ICE flights for nearly six years. Cartwright estimated that through the end of June, 95% of the ICE Air flights he’d tracked were operated by charter companies, with military and Coast Guard planes being used for the remainder. That doesn’t include a tally of commercial flights used to deport people, he said — but in fiscal year 2017, ICE Air used charter flights to remove or transfer 181,317 people, compared with just 8,288 who were removed on commercial flights, according to a 2019 DHS inspector general report. “In this case, when they’re doing 1,100 flights a month, that’s a pretty significant piece of the operation — so they’re absolutely critical,” he said of the planes carrying immigration detainees. “Without a fixed-base operator, I’m not sure this system really operates.” In a recent report covering local connections to alleged human rights violations stemming from the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement agenda, the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR), which has studied ICE Air flights for years, called out Gates’ Signature Aviation investment specifically. “In Washington, our most famous philanthropist grows his investments in part by supporting a company complicit in gross human rights abuses, potentially ascending to the level of crimes against humanity,” the report alleged. To report this story, HuffPost scoured government records and plane location data, collected plane-spotting reports from activists on the ground, and matched aviation photographs to planes known to ferry ICE detainees. Still, ICE Air operates largely in the shadows, and many key players, including Signature Aviation, did not answer detailed questions about their operations. So we wanted to see the process for ourselves. On Aug. 31, HuffPost witnessed Signature Aviation in action. On the tarmac of Newark Liberty International Airport, a couple hundred yards from Signature’s private terminal, a Signature-branded set of boarding stairs and fuel tanker met a Boeing 737 belonging to Avelo Airlines, the low-cost carrier that has faced protests and a boycott from potential passengers over its work with ICE Air. Like other Avelo planes working ICE Air flights, this plane, with the tail number N801XT, was recently painted completely white, erasing any prominent Avelo branding. One by one, 16 people dressed in white and gray, and shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, hobbled off the plane and onto Signature Aviation’s boarding stairs, unable to reach the handrail on the stairs. On the tarmac, the second man in line shuffled his feet slightly, taking uneven steps as his head drooped, making him look older than the rest. The plane had just finished a two-and-a-half-hour flight from Alexandria, Louisiana, a central hub for ICE Air flights, meaning the men had likely been shackled for several hours straight. The detainees waited on the tarmac as they were processed into sprinter vans with flashing police lights. A Signature-branded fuel tanker sidled up to the plane, and personnel on the ground hauled plastic mesh bags known to be used for detainees’ personal belongings. Eventually, accompanied by Port Authority police vehicles, the caravan left the tarmac, likely heading to nearby ICE detention facilities. Two weeks prior, HuffPost saw a similar scene play out, when a plane operated by Eastern Air Express — the same aircraft CNN recently spotted ferrying people in ICE custody — was met with similar fanfare at Newark. Law enforcement vehicles with flashing lights approached that plane as well, including one that looked similar to a shuttle bus previously filmed transporting detainees out of Delaney Hall, the infamous immigration jail. In both cases, after about an hour on the ground, the planes continued on their way around the country, ferrying people in ICE custody to other detention facilities, and for some, onto their ultimate deportation, according to one activist plane spotter who goes by the moniker “JJ in DC” on Bluesky and who helped HuffPost track the aircraft. “In Washington, our most famous philanthropist grows his investments in part by supporting a company complicit in gross human rights abuses, potentially ascending to the level of crimes against humanity.” Such scenes are now commonplace throughout the country. But they are not new. For over a decade, private aviation contractors have handled tens of thousands of ICE Air flights, according to Cartwright’s count, which can collectively transfer or remove hundreds of thousands of people annually. Recent video from King County’s cameras at Boeing Field-King County International Airport in Seattle shows a grim parade of detainees. One climbs a set of boarding stairs while shackled and holding a cane. Another, also shackled — detainees generally are, including during flights — is manhandled by several guards who run him onto the plane; a few feet before Signature’s staircase, the group stumbles and the man falls onto the tarmac. “The use of restraints on detainees during deportation flights is a standard ICE protocol and an essential measure to ensure the safety and well-being of both detainees and the officers/agents accompanying them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement. “Our practices align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.” “ICE takes its commitment to promoting safe, secure, humane environments for those in our custody very seriously,” the statement added. “ICE Air Operations flights are law enforcement sensitive. ICE conducts flights throughout the U.S. on a daily basis. For operational security purposes, ICE does not discuss ongoing or future operations.” Activists working to end ICE Air’s presence in Seattle have zeroed in on Signature’s work as a service provider for charter flights. “The presence of Signature is essential for ICE to be within the airport, because without having a fixed-base operator to service the planes, they can’t land there, and no one else is doing this type of work,” said Guadalupe Gonzalez, flight monitoring coordinator for La Resistencia, an immigrant-led activist group in Washington state that seeks to end immigrant detention and deportation. “Signature Aviation specifically are the ones responsible for servicing ICE at Boeing Field.” Gonzalez said La Resistencia volunteers, who observe ICE Air transfers in person at Boeing Field, have in recent years reported seeing detainees bound in the “WRAP” restraint system, a type of full-body restraint device that has come under scrutiny in the past. More commonly, Gonzalez said, people with mobility issues were made to walk up Signature’s stairs to a waiting ICE Air flight. Not having a presence at Boeing Field, Gonzalez said, “would impair [ICE’s] efforts to deport as many people as possible — or, at the very minimum, make it more costly.” Signature Aviation did not answer a lengthy list of questions about its practices, including its involvement with ICE Air. Instead, the company sent a one-sentence statement. “Our FBOs must accept flight operations that comply with the law, FAA regulations and contract requirements at federally funded airports,” said Rosanna Fiske, the company’s global head of corporate affairs. Fiske did not respond to follow-up questions about the nature of Signature’s obligations, including the terms of contracts it may have signed with ICE Air charter operators. Gates is a significant shareholder in Signature Aviation. Cascade Investment LLC, the holding company for Gates’ and the Gates Foundation’s assets, first bought a piece of the company’s predecessor, BBA Aviation, in 2009. In 2021, a bidding war broke out over the company, and Gates’ Cascade — then Signature’s largest individual shareholder, with a 19% stake — joined forces with Blackstone Group and Global Infrastructure Partners to buy it outright. (Global Infrastructure Partners was acquired by BlackRock in 2024.) Working together, the three firms bought Signature for $4.7 billion, with Cascade winding up with 30% of the company. Cascade Investment LLC is overseen by Cascade Asset Management Company. That firm’s chief investment officer is Michael Larson, who has Gates’ “complete trust and faith,” Gates said in 2014, at a party he threw celebrating the 20th anniversary of Larson managing his assets. The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that their arrangement was “simple: Mr. Larson makes money, and Mr. Gates gives it away.” Cascade Investment is located in the same Kirkland, Washington, office park as Gates’ personal office, The New York Times noted in a 2021 story. Cascade’s mandate, one unnamed former employee told the Times for the same story, was: “We don’t want Bill’s name in the headlines.” Cascade’s work on Gates’ behalf has come up in the news before. For example, when The Land Report revealed in 2021 that Gates was “America’s largest private farmland owner,” what they were really talking about, as NBC News later described it, was farmland “purchased through a constellation of companies that all link back to [Bill and Melinda Gates’] investment group, Cascade Investments, based in Kirkland, Washington.” When Gates was asked about his farmland purchases, which made national news, he said, “My investment group chose to do this” and “all these decisions are made by a professional investment team.” The same might apply to Signature Aviation. It’s unclear how much Gates knows about his stake in the company, or whether he knows that Signature plays such a crucial role in Trump’s mass deportation operation. Still, “it would be surprising if Gates couldn’t influence a decision to disinvest of this particular investment,” said Cartwright, who before his retirement spent decades at J.P. Morgan, including as chief financial officer of one division that covered 5,000 bank branches. The foundation has previously addressed concerns about its money being invested in Signature Aviation. One complaint recently filed through EthicsPoint, a public-facing portal to submit ethical concerns to the foundation, and later shared with HuffPost, accused the foundation of “providing material support for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement” through its investment in Signature. In response, the foundation said it did not “control or participate in the activities of the Gates Foundation Trust.” Instead, the foundation said, the trust’s assets were “independently managed by Cascade Asset Management Company.” Look closely and you’ll see Signature Aviation popping up across Trump’s mass deportation pipeline. In fact, the company is part of perhaps the most infamous footage of Trump’s second term so far: an “ASMR” video that glorifies shackling and transporting immigration detainees. The video was filmed at Boeing Field, where the number of contracted ICE flights, all serviced by Signature Aviation, has shot up this year. It also happens to be a 20-minute drive from the Gates Foundation’s offices. Signature’s distinct logo is visible at the top of a set of boarding stairs about five seconds into the clip: ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight 🔊 pic.twitter.com/O6L1iYt9b4 Signature did not answer HuffPost’s inquiry about where it serviced ICE Air flights, but the company has had a significant footprint in servicing aviation contractors hired by ICE. In 2019, one internal ICE document listed Signature as the designated FBO for contracted ICE flights at 12 major domestic airports: Atlanta, Dallas, Newark, Houston, Laredo, Kansas City, Memphis, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Chicago, San Diego, San Antonio, and Denver, where HuffPost recently spotted a set of Signature boarding stairs pulled up to another all-white Avelo Air plane. And while it’s not clear whether ICE Air still uses every airport on the 2019 list, the list also doesn’t include airports where Signature has recently been spotted servicing ICE Air flights. For example, the 2019 document doesn’t include Seattle’s Boeing Field. Signature now frequently services ICE flights there, and detainees picked up at the airport have ended up in El Salvador’s CECOT prison, Guantánamo Bay, and South Sudan, according to the recent report from UWCHR. The human rights center previously obtained the 2019 list of airports that listed FBOs servicing the ICE flights pursuant to a public records request to ICE. Signature also appears to be servicing immigration flights out of Jacksonville, Florida. One March email with the subject line “ICE Schedule This Week” notes several charter flights landing at Jacksonville International Airport. The activist group Ground ICE — which aims to “limit the rate at which I.C.E. can transport and remove its detainees” — obtained the document through a public records request and shared it with HuffPost. Recipients of the email included Signature Aviation’s Jacksonville manager as well as several email accounts associated with GEO Group, a private prison contractor. In July, Fox 13 News Utah captured video of apparent immigration detainees climbing a set of Signature boarding stairs at Salt Lake City International Airport. And Rolling Stone recently spotted a Coast Guard plane refueling and boarding ICE detainees at Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Independent journalist Gillian Brockell, who wrote the Rolling Stone story, told HuffPost that Signature Aviation refueled the plane. Signature is also the only FBO at Buffalo Niagara International Airport, Ground ICE has noted. Planes carrying immigration detainees pass through that airport once or twice a week, according to Cartwright, who is currently transitioning his work over to the group Human Rights First. Various entities involved with Gates’ ICE Air investment proclaim their commitment to human rights. Signature Aviation itself says it is committed to “refraining from coercion and never deliberately causing harm to anyone” and that it takes steps “to confirm that our businesses and supply chains are free from modern slavery and human trafficking.” Another company policy requires that suppliers “never use, support, or engage in forced or indentured labor, or practices involving coercion, deception, or abuse of power — including human trafficking, slavery and child labor.” As part of its efforts to combat human trafficking, it says it works with the Department of Homeland Security. (ICE falls under the purview of DHS.) Cascade says it takes “a value-oriented approach” to investing money for Gates and the Gates Foundation Trust, and that one of its objectives is to “protect Bill and the Trust by acting lawfully, honestly, ethically, and with integrity, safeguarding their assets and information.” It notes that “neither Cascade nor the Trust play a role in the grantmaking or operations of the foundation” and that the foundation “does not control or participate in the Trust’s investment activities.” The Gates Foundation says its mission is to “create a world where every person has the opportunity to live a healthy, productive life,” and the foundation has awarded grants to multiple prominent immigration-focused nonprofits. The experiences of immigration detainees traveling on ICE Air — particularly ICE’s use of shackles, which bind their wrists and ankles — seemingly stand in contrast to those commitments. The shackles “felt very disrespectful, dehumanizing to a lot of degrees,” Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian activist jailed and threatened with deportation for his beliefs, recalled to Zeteo after his release from ICE custody in June. After more than a day of travel, “by the time I arrived in Jena, [Louisiana, home to an infamous ICE jail,] I couldn’t walk because my leg was swollen from the shackles,” Khalil added. Deportation flight passengers have alleged “the use of racist epithets and insults, and rough physical treatment upon boarding,” as well as, in more isolated cases, “beatings, the use of straitjackets, verbal abuse and threats, and the denial of access to restrooms,” according to a UWCHR summary of public records it received detailing the complaints. In one case, a Somalia-bound deportation flight sat on a tarmac in Senegal for a full day due to technical issues, while detainees remained shackled inside and the plane’s toilets “overfilled with human waste,” according to a subsequent lawsuit. The plane eventually returned all of the detainees to the United States. (The suit was ultimately dismissed for jurisdictional reasons, and many of the people on the ill-fated flight continued to face deportation proceedings.) Relying on private contractors at every stage of the deportation process creates major vulnerabilities for ICE — which may be why the Trump administration is reportedly considering purchasing its own fleet of deportation planes. While giant private prison companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group are dependent on federal contracts to survive, FBOs work in different economic conditions. Most rely on business from corporate and private jet travel, and they’re often subject to local political pressure. For example, Ground ICE has encouraged pilots to write to Signature Aviation and “let them know you will not be buying fuel from them” due to their work for ICE. More than anywhere else, Seattle’s Boeing Field represents how local anti-deportation sentiment can affect FBOs and seriously slow down ICE’s work. In 2019, amid pressure from local activist groups and an impactful report from UWCHR concerning “King County Collaboration with ICE Air Deportation Flights at Boeing Field,” then-King County executive Dow Constantine ordered, among other things, that future leases at Boeing Field contain a prohibition against the private transport of immigration detainees. The FBO for those flights at the time, Modern Aviation, stopped servicing them soon after that executive order, even though the order was ultimately blocked in court. Two other FBOs at the airport, including Signature, also said they “will not take over from Modern in servicing ICE flights,” The Seattle Times reported at the time, citing the airport’s director. (Matt Dill, general manager at Modern Aviation’s location at Boeing Field, declined to comment.) “Without the help of such companies,” the paper reported, “flights cannot operate at the airport. Though they can technically take off and land, [airport director John] Parrott said, flights need a company to open gates, to provide stairs to get passengers on and off planes, and to offer fuel.” Without an FBO in Seattle, ICE was forced to route planes through Yakima — where the airport was smaller, more remote, and hours inland. In a court filing, the Trump administration said it only landed on the remote airport after approaching three others “without success.” The Trump administration also acknowledged at the time that this shift jammed the gears of its deportation machinery, particularly when it came to people detained at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. “Transporting detainees from Tacoma to Yakima, as compared to Tacoma to Boeing Field, adds, at a minimum, six hours of travel time to the process of executing an ICE Air flight,” the filing read. “Additionally,” it continued, “the transport to Yakima and back frequently requires the use of an additional bus and two additional officers, as well as additional meal and fuel costs. This takes resources away from federal law enforcement tasks that would otherwise be performed if the ICE Air flights were flying out of Boeing Field. Relocation of the ICE Air flights to Yakima also impacts ICE operations in Yakima, requiring ICE to utilize staffing of at least two officers from its Yakima sub-office to facilitate the flight processing in Yakima. Additionally, travel over the mountain passes in winter is hazardous, and frequently either slowed significantly by road conditions or suspended altogether, as was the case on January 14, 2020, when an ICE Air flight had to be cancelled due to road conditions prohibiting transport.” On March 30, 2023, a federal judge ruled against the county’s executive order requiring future FBO leases to prohibit work on deportation flights. “At that time, Signature Aviation said, ‘OK, we’ll do that business,’” recalled Angelina Snodgrass Godoy, the director of UWCHR. “Ever since then, the ICE flights have resumed at Boeing Field, and they’re being served by Signature Aviation.” Local public radio station KNKX described Signature at the time as “the fixed-base operator that agreed to service ICE flights at Boeing Field.” By May 2, four years after ICE Air flights stopped at Boeing Field, they resumed again, according to records of the flights kept by the county. Signature has been their sole service provider ever since, according to the same records. “Without a fixed-base operator, I’m not sure this system really operates.” For Godoy, the years-long absence of deportation flights running through Seattle shows just how important FBOs like Signature Aviation are. “Here in Seattle, what we saw in 2019 and to this date, was that when there was enough local concern, and people expressing local outrage about it, that the other FBOs also didn’t want to do it,” she said. “There are businesses who will say, ‘No, we don’t want this, we don’t want to be associated with this.’” Local pressure also may have recently disrupted ICE Air operations on the other side of the country. Last month, after media attention and local protest over the spike in immigration flights from Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts — including specific attention on Signature Aviation for servicing the flights — the ICE Air flights to that airport stopped, instead going through Portsmouth International Airport at Pease in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Signature does not have a presence. “It was because the activists were so annoying, basically, to that airfield, and they were so focused on Signature, that they decided to shift to [Portsmouth International Airport] as the hub for New England,” JJ in DC posited to HuffPost, referring to the shift from Massachusetts to New Hampshire. Godoy also speculated that the shift came in response to protest. “My impression is that, for Signature, the ICE flights are only a portion of their business, and not the majority of their business — and when the ICE flights become sufficiently notorious, that threatens Signature’s overall business, and then they say ‘no thanks,’” she said. “And it looks to me — this is speculation, because I’m not privy to the discussions between ICE and Signature — like that’s what happened at Hanscom Field,” Godoy added. “So now, ICE is going to be using a more far-away airport, which is more inconvenient for them. And they haven’t said why.” Still, even apparent route changes may not last: Two flights from Avelo Airlines planes landed at Hanscom Field on Friday and Saturday, flight records show. The airline, ICE, and Signature Aviation did not respond to questions about the purpose of the flights. The financial backing behind Signature Aviation doesn’t stop with Bill Gates and the Gates Foundation. Annual financial reports reviewed by HuffPost show several large public pension funds are also stakeholders in Signature. Institutional investors Blackstone and BlackRock (via Global Infrastructure Partners) own the remainder of the company that Gates does not. And those massive asset management firms often invest money in various funds on behalf of public pensions, nonprofits and university endowments. One such fund, a BlackRock product called Global Infrastructure Partners Fund IV, has 68 such limited partners, according to data from PitchBook, a private-equity market database. That includes the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, a public pension that in 2023 held more than $350 million of the fund; the New York State Common Retirement Fund; the Utah State University endowment; the Oregon Public Employees Retirement System; the Washington State Investment Board; and more than 60 others. BlackRock and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System declined to comment. The New York State Common Retirement Fund, Oregon Investment Council (which manages OPERS’ investments) and the Utah State University endowment didn’t respond. A spokesperson for WSIB told HuffPost that, as a policy, it does not comment on individual holdings. Washington’s stake was flagged by UWCHR, which warned in its recent report that “public workers’ retirements are being financed in part through investments in organizations that profit from the detention and deportation of our neighbors.” A handful of public pension funds are also invested in a similar offering from Blackstone, called Blackstone Infrastructure Partners. They include the New Mexico State Investment Council, the Orange County Employees’ Retirement System, Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement System, and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, according to the PitchBook data. Blackstone didn’t respond to a request for comment, nor did the New Mexico State Investment Council. A spokesperson for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas declined to comment, citing a Texas law that prohibits discussing specific investments. The Orange County Employees’ Retirement System and Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System similarly declined to comment. Azani Creeks, a senior campaign and research coordinator at PESP, a nonprofit watchdog organization focused on the private equity industry, told HuffPost that people whose pensions rely on these investments are entitled to have a say in their composition. “You can contact pension fund staff and trustees by email to schedule a meeting, and often, pension funds have regular meetings with public comment periods in which you can communicate your concerns,” Creeks said. “A handful of private equity firms, drawing on capital from pension funds, foundations, endowments, insurance companies, and other institutional investors, exert major influence through investments in companies providing services to immigrant detention facilities and migrant shelters around the United States.” JJ in DC noted that in his work tracking immigration flights, he’s been struck by just how opaque the process is. The Department of Homeland Security contracts with its main broker, CSI Aviation, which works with a network of subcontractors including GlobalX, Avelo and Eastern Air Express. Those firms in turn work with FBOs like Signature Aviation. Along the way, airplanes have been made harder to spot — with some losing all of their external branding or being taken off public flight trackers, though their information is still available on crowdsourced networks like ADS-B Exchange. (Anyone with the correct receiver can contribute to the site, which presents location information broadcast by individual aircraft over radio waves as an interactive and real-time, though not always complete, map of global aviation traffic.) The result, in the end, are taxpayer dollars quietly contributing to the portfolios of people like Gates and the Gates Foundation Trust. “This is a big pressure point,” JJ in DC told HuffPost. “And if more people apply pressure, it’s going to hurt their operations, and they’re going to have to adjust.” Matt Shuham reported from New York. Ryan Grenoble reported from Denver.

The exchange, which lists Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, and other tech giants, would give customers the option of trading securities via traditional digital representation of ownership with or without blockchain backing. "A participant that wishes for its order to clear and settle in tokenized form shall notate its preference upon entry of the order in the system by selecting a flag that the exchange designates for this purpose, in accordance with the exchange’s procedures," Nasdaq said in its filing. "When a participant enters an order with the tokenization flag selected, the exchange will communicate the participant’s clearance and settlement instruction to The Depository Trust Company." Nasdaq's proposal adds to the fervor for tokenization among both traditional finance and digital asset-focused firms. In June, Robinhood rolled out trading for European users of U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds as tokens on Arbitrum, the Ethereum layer-2 scaling network. In May, crypto exchange Kraken announced its own tokenization plans through a partnership with Backed, using the Solana blockchain. The offering would cover more than 50 U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds. "Over time, U.S. equity markets have thrived while absorbing successive waves of technological innovations," Nasdaq said in its filing, adding: "The existing regulatory structure mandated by Congress applies to tokenized securities, regardless of whether such securities have certain unique properties (like the ability to be settled on a blockchain), much like it did when the SEC allowed securities to be decimalized and electronified and when exchange traded funds and other novel securities were approved decades ago." "The exchange believes the markets can use tokenization while continuing to provide the benefits and protections of the national market system," it added. Crypto exchanges Binance and now-defunct FTX dabbled in tokenized stock trading during the pandemic-era crypto boom, but the umbrella term faded into obscurity amid regulatory heat until BlackRock CEO Larry Fink touted tokenization as “the next generation for markets” in 2022. In its second quarter conference call in July, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev referenced tokenization nearly a dozen times. Tenev described tokenization as “the biggest innovation in capital markets in over a decade,” during the call.

Title: Meet the bidders vying to build Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/paxos-frax-agora-and-native-markets-compete-to-build-usdh-stablecoin/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T15:28:05Z

About us Copy link Bidders vying to build Hyperliquid’s stablecoin are swarming the protocol. So far, six organisations have posted proposals on the protocol’s Discord server after Hyperliquid announced it will launch a stablecoin on Friday, a move that will reduce its dependency on external issuers. The plan is to let the validators who run the network decide who will get the privilege of purchasing the right to launch the stablecoin, which will trade under the ticker USDH. Hyperliquid is the biggest perpetual futures exchange in DeFi. It handled a whopping $378 billion in trading volume over the past month, per DefiLlama data. However, it currently denotes its spot markets using Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT stablecoins, the two biggest stablecoins on the market. Hyperliquid’s USDH will compete with USDC and USDT on the protocol, reducing its dependency on third-party stablecoins, and potentially capturing additional revenue. Validators will be able to vote on their preferred proposal after Hyperliquid’s next network upgrade, a date for which has yet to be announced. Here are the four proposals gaining the most traction among the Hyperliquid community. The biggest firm to submit a proposal so far is Paxos, the New York-based fintech behind several stablecoins, including PayPal USD and Global Dollar. It proposes using 95% of the interest earned on USDH’s reserve assets, like short-dated treasury bonds, to fund buybacks of the HYPE token. The firm plans to back USDH with US Treasury Bills, repurchase agreements, and its Global Dollar stablecoin. Paxos has a track record of contributing to multiple Hyperliquid ecosystem projects, including LHYPE, a tokenised leveraged loop trade, and WHLP, a tokenised representation of Hyperliquid’s HLP vault. Community feedback to Paxos’ proposal has been largely positive. Frax Finance, the issuer of the Frax Dollar stablecoin, is the biggest DeFi protocol to join the fray. It wants to issue USDH natively on Hyperliquid against its frxUSD stablecoin, giving holders the ability to mint and redeem the tokens across frxUSD, USDC, USDT, and US dollars. Frax hasn’t given any concrete plans on what it would do with the interest earned on reserve assets, but said it could be used to boost HYPE staking yield, conduct buybacks of the HYPE token, or used for rebates to active traders or rewards for USDH holders. Community feedback has been mostly positive, however some have questioned whether Frax is as aligned with Hyperliquid as the other organisations submitting proposals. Agora styles itself as a white-label stablecoin issuer, using its AUSD stablecoin to back other dollar-pegged assets. The firm said it plans to share 100% of net revenue from USDH’s reserve assets to fund buybacks of the HYPE token. Reserves for an Agora-issued USDH will be administered by State Street and VanEck, the same firms that Agora uses for its AUSD reserves. Agora also said it could potentially bring USDH to new users by working with consumer-facing apps like EtherFi. Feedback has been positive, but some have questioned what Agora’s incentive to issue and manage a USDH is if it plans to send all revenue minus custodian fees to Hyperliquid. Native Markets is a new organisation put together specifically to compete for the right to issue USDH. It is led by Max Fiege, a Hyperliquid ecosystem investor and advisor. Native Markets said it will back USDH with offchain reserves initially managed by BlackRock and onchain reserves managed by Superstate through stablecoin platform Bridge, which is owned by Stripe. The group proposes using 50% of the interest earned on reserve assets to buy back the HYPE token, with the other 50% set aside to fund USDH growth. Several governance participants have warned that Native Markets relying on Bridge for stablecoin issuance could present a single point of failure.

Title: Nasdaq files for regulatory nod to introduce tokenized stocks and ETFs

Nasdaq aims to integrate tokenized stocks, focusing on improving efficiency without compromising investor protection. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Nasdaq is seeking regulatory approval to introduce tokenized versions of stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto its existing trading platform. On Sept. 8, Tal Cohen, Nasdaq’s president, outlined the vision in a LinkedIn statement, explaining that the plan is designed to capture the efficiency gains of tokenization while preserving investor rights and market safeguards built over decades. This initiative reflects a wider shift across traditional finance where asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity are experimenting with tokenized offerings. Due to this growing adoption, Galaxy Research has estimated that tokenized equities could represent a $190 trillion market within two decades. Nasdaq, one of the largest traditional stock exchanges with a daily trading volume of more than $400 billion, stressed that US equities already rank as the world’s most liquid and transparent markets, supported by rigorous oversight and advanced technology. Cohen explained that the proposal would extend those strengths into the digital era rather than replace them. According to him: Join The Crypto Investor Blueprint — 5 days of pro-level strategies to turbocharge your portfolio. Please add [email protected] to your email whitelist. Stay connected via “The approach will ensure tokenized securities trade as regular securities, safeguarding both investors’ rights and the systemic stability of our markets through tested, resilient infrastructure. It seeks to capture the benefits of the technology while ensuring it matures in a way that best serves investors, issuers, and other stakeholders across global capital markets.” He pointed out that the Nasdaq’s filing highlighted how tokenization could streamline long-standing market processes. According to him, the technology could introduce faster settlement cycles, lower transaction friction, and programmable corporate actions into the system. Still, Cohen cautioned that such changes must not come at the expense of resilience or security. He highlighted decentralized finance as a lesson in both potential and risk of integrating blockchain technology into the space. According to him, DeFi platforms have demonstrated new ways of handling trading and clearing, but have also exposed vulnerabilities when growth outpaces governance. Considering this, Cohen stressed that investor protection and operational stability must remain at the core as new technologies are introduced. As a result, the exchange said it is ready to collaborate with infrastructure providers to explore applications such as modernized proxy voting and automated post-trade services.

City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Monday 8 September 2025 17:48, UK The boss of Nvidia, the chipmaker which has become the world's most valuable public company, is among the corporate chiefs lining up to accompany US President Donald Trump on next week's state visit to the UK. Sky News has learnt that Jensen Huang, the Nvidia chief executive who has presided over the stratospheric rise in its valuation to more than $4trn, is expected to attend a state banquet at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles during the trip. Sources said on Monday that Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI; Larry Fink, chairman and chief executive of asset management behemoth BlackRock; and Stephen Schwarzman, the boss of private equity giant Blackstone, were also expected to be among the attendees. Money blog: One thing you should never have on your CV Tim Cook, the Apple chief executive, has also been invited and may attend the state banquet, the sources added, while Jamie Dimon, the JP Morgan chief, is understood to be unable to make the trip to Britain because of existing diary commitments.

Share this article CoinShares, Europe’s leading digital asset manager with approximately $10 billion in assets under management, announced today it will go public on the Nasdaq Stock Market through a $1.2 billion business combination with Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp. The company is the world’s fourth-largest digital asset ETP manager after BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, and leads Europe with 34% market share. CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti said the Nasdaq listing reflects the company’s push for international growth and leadership.

CoinShares has more than tripled its assets under management over the past two years through new investor inflows, supportive digital asset pricing, and product launches. “CoinShares exemplifies everything we look for in a high-value investment: market leadership, a proven, scalable business model, a massive and expanding addressable market, and a team with the proven ability to execute,” said Nicholas Petruska, CEO of Vine Hill. The transaction includes a $50 million equity investment commitment from an institutional investor. The deal is slated to wrap up by year-end, pending regulatory and shareholder approval.

CoinShares, one of Europe’s largest digital asset managers, is heading to Wall Street. The company announced Monday that it will go public in the United States through a $1.2 billion merger with Vine Hill Capital Investment Corp (VCIC)., a Nasdaq-listed SPAC. The deal shifts CoinShares’ listing from Stockholm to New York, opening access to U.S. capital markets and investors. The firm manages about $10 billion in assets, including a suite of 32 crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) covering bitcoin, ether, solana and other tokens. CoinShares ranks as the fourth-largest global provider of digital asset ETPs, behind BlackRock, Grayscale and Fidelity, and holds a 34% share of the European, Middle Eastern and African market. Chief Executive Jean-Marie Mognetti said the move reflects a turning point for digital assets as U.S. regulation provides more clarity. “The case for digital assets as an investment class has reached a decisive inflection point,” he said. “A U.S. listing will reinforce our credibility and expand our reach.” For U.S. investors, the transaction could mean greater access to crypto-linked products from a manager that has grown assets more than 200% over the last two years. CoinShares reported a 76% adjusted EBITDA margin in the first half of 2025, signaling strong profitability compared with peers. The deal, approved by both companies’ boards, is expected to close by the end of 2025 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. If completed, CoinShares will trade on Nasdaq under a new parent company, Odysseus Holdings Limited.

Title: Fidelity Launches New Tokenized Fund as Market Nears $300B: Why Are Traders Joining Best Wallet Token?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/tokenization-market-300b-fidelity-launch-best-wallet-token/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Fidelity introduced the Fidelity Digital Interest Token (FDIT), an Ethereum-based tokenized share of the U.S. Treasury securities and cash equivalents, on August 4, 2025. This marks Fidelity’s official entry into the landscape of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Earlier this month, the funds have spiraled to over $200M in assets. However, there has been minimal investor participation so far. Records show that only two holders have been identified so far — one holds almost $1M in tokens, and the other manages the rest. While Fidelity hasn’t made any official announcement yet, the Institution’s earlier SEC filing may have laid the groundwork for this launch. Nonetheless, this step signals its growing interest in real-world asset (RWAs) tokenization. And it certainly paves the way for more crypto adoption from institutions and retail users alike. As the past has shown, this often translates to positive chart action from altcoins, and one in particular, Best Wallet Token ($BEST), is making waves now. FDIT is an ERC-20 token that offers 24/7 transferability and several other exclusive features tailored for institutional investors. It invests in short-duration U.S. Treasury securities via the underlying OUSG token. Since its launch in August 2025, the Bank of New York Mellon has held the FDIT’s assets, ensuring traditional financial oversight. FDIT charges an annual management fee of 0.20% with no performance fees and is currently available exclusively to institutional investors. Fidelity’s token launch also marks the integration of blockchain technology into the traditional finance sector—a trend that improves liquidity, transparency, and increases operational efficiency. According to recent trends from Token Terminal, tokenized real-world assets have surpassed $300B, a milestone expected to be reached by 2030. Another report by RedStone states that RWAs on-chain could reach up to $30T by 2034. Furthermore, the recent FDIT launch signals the growing trust in Ethereum-based financial products. These trends, along with FDIT’s choice of Ethereum, reassure investors that it can handle serious, institutional-grade assets while also acting on the strong crypto vision many others (like Strategy) are sharing. Ultimately, this highlights that traditional finance is embracing blockchain technology. This union lays a strong bullish landscape for Ethereum-based projects. Building on this momentum, the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale gives investors the best entryway to a growing Ethereum ecosystem. Let’s see why. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the utility token of Best Wallet, a non-custodial crypto wallet. The software-based wallet lets you buy, hold, and sell tokens on six major chains: Staking is coming soon, according to the roadmap, alongside market intel analytics, 60+ chain support, and even a Best Card for fiat transactions. Most importantly, Best Wallet is the only crypto wallet that lets you buy the best crypto presales from your mobile. No need to visit external sites! Joining the presale gives you access to premium features, like reduced transaction fees, higher staking rewards, and community governance in a DAO ecosystem. The presale has raised over $15.6M so far, with a $70K whale buy on September 2 that indicates growing retail interest. The token is currently $0.025605 but our Best Wallet Token price prediction forecasts a price of $0.05106175 by the end of 2026, almost a 2x purely by holding the token. The presale concludes by December 31, 2025, or once all the tokens are sold. So, there’s still time to buy one of the best altcoins of 2025. To buy Best Wallet Token, visit the official presale page or read our ‘How to Buy $BEST’ guide! Fidelity’s FDIT launch reflects the growing institutional confidence in Ethereum-based financial products, emphasizing the potential of tokenized assets and their ability to transform traditional finance. As blockchain adoption gains momentum, investors are exploring early-stage investment opportunities like Best Wallet Token ($BEST), which capitalizes on the nascent stage of blockchain adoption.

The transaction is expected to fuel CoinShares’ strategic international expansion and enable U.S. investors to participate more directly in its global growth, including expected growth in the United States. The transaction values CoinShares at US$1.2 billion pre-money on a pro-forma basis, positioning it as one of the largest publicly traded pure-play digital asset managers globally. Transaction Highlights Jean-Marie Mognetti, CEO & Co-Founder of CoinShares said: “This transaction represents far more than a change of listing venue from Sweden to the United States. It signals a strategic transition for CoinShares, accelerating our ambition for global leadership, supported by favorable regulatory tailwinds. The case for digital assets as an investment class and blockchain as a transformative technology has reached a decisive inflection point and can no longer be ignored. There is no going back. The U.S. is now serving as the crucible of the digital asset space. By listing in the United States, CoinShares is positioning itself to meet growing investor demand and to participate more fully in the evolution of this new industry. Our European playbook, built and refined over a decade, is proven and effective. We are now deploying this experience to bring a new suite of products to American investors. A U.S. listing will reinforce our credibility, expand our reach, and position us to capture the opportunity in the world’s largest asset management market, home to over half of global assets under management.2” Nicholas Petruska, CEO of Vine Hill said, “CoinShares exemplifies everything we look for in a high-value investment: market leadership, a proven, scalable business model, a massive and expanding addressable market and a team with the proven ability to execute.

Title: Circle’s Revenue At Risk As Hyperliquid Opens Auction For USDH
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomerniv/2025/09/08/circles-revenue-at-risk-as-hyperliquid-opens-auction-for-usdh/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T11:25:11Z
Full Content:
ByTomer Niv, Contributor. Hyperliquid, the lightning-fast decentralized exchange that has captured more than 75% of the DeFi perpetuals market, is making its boldest move yet. Powered by its custom HyperCore chain, the platform can settle trades in under a quarter of a second and process hundreds of thousands of orders per second - performance that fueled $400 billion in trading volume in August 2025 alone. But Hyperliquid now wants more than just speed and liquidity - it wants control of the stablecoin layer at the heart of its ecosystem. That ambition takes shape with USDH, a proposed dollar-pegged stablecoin designed to redirect yield from the nearly $5 billion in deposits that currently enrich Circle’s USDC back into Hyperliquid’s own community. Instead of issuing the coin itself, Hyperliquid has turned the process into a public on-chain auction: issuers must openly compete, disclosing how much of the yield they will share, their compliance strategy, and the infrastructure they bring. Validators, acting as the decision-makers, will deliberate in public and then cast binding votes on-chain. This is more than a cost-saving move - it’s a DeFi governance experiment. Hyperliquid is effectively importing procurement practices from traditional finance into DeFi, forcing would-be issuers to compete on transparency, economics, and trust. The signal is unmistakable: USDH is being built to serve Hyperliquid’s community first, not an outside issuer’s bottom line. Until now, Hyperliquid’s rise has been fueled by USDC, Circle’s widely adopted dollar-backed stablecoin. Roughly 95% of the assets sitting on Hyperliquid are denominated in USDC, making the exchange one of Circle’s largest institutional “clients.” That amounts to nearly 7–8% of all USDC in circulation, a share so large it rivals major centralized exchanges. The revenue implications are enormous. Circle earns virtually all of its income by investing USDC reserves in short-term treasuries and money-market funds. According to public filings, more than 99% of Circle’s $1.68 billion in 2024 revenue came from this interest spread. If those reserves migrate into USDH, Circle faces a sudden loss of $150–200 million per year - roughly 10% of its business. That risk is amplified by timing. Circle has been working to launch native USDC and its cross-chain transfer protocol (CCTP) on Hyperliquid, but delays left a window for USDH to seize the spotlight. The result: Circle, once the indispensable backbone of on-chain finance, now finds itself on the defensive. The USDH initiative isn’t just about reclaiming yield - it’s about rethinking how a decentralized protocol negotiates with its partners. By opening a public auction, Hyperliquid is treating the role of stablecoin issuer like a high-stakes procurement contract. Every bidder must explain how reserves will be managed, how much of the interest will flow back to the community, and what extra services they bring. The process mirrors corporate RFQs and government bond auctions, except that here it all plays out transparently on-chain. Validators, who stake HYPE tokens to secure the network, are the hiring committee. Their vote will determine not only who mints USDH but also how billions in yield are redistributed. For Hyperliquid, the motivation is straightforward. Why let Circle capture the spoils when those same billions could fund HYPE buybacks, validator rewards, and liquidity incentives? For DeFi at large, it is a glimpse of how governance can evolve from token votes on fee switches to community-controlled negotiations over billion-dollar contracts. Several issuers have thrown their hats into the ring, but three frontrunners stand out - each offering validators a different trade-off between trust, ethos, and firepower. Paxos: The Compliance Titan Frax Finance: The DeFi Native Agora: The Institutional Heavyweight Smaller entrants such as Native Markets and Konelia also submitted designs, but they have drawn limited validator support. The real decision lies between Paxos’ compliance clout, Frax’s community-first ethos, and Agora’s institutional scale. For Circle, the outcome could be devastating. Losing Hyperliquid’s billions would erase up to 10% of its revenue overnight, exposing its dependence on interest income and underscoring its vulnerability to client defection. CEO Jeremy Allaire has argued that USDC’s liquidity and interoperability will preserve its dominance, but the market isn’t convinced. Hyperliquid has demonstrated that if a protocol can align stablecoin incentives with its users, loyalty to USDC is far from guaranteed. For DeFi, the process is arguably more significant than the outcome. Hyperliquid has created a model where protocols can force vendors to compete in the open - on yield, compliance, liquidity, and governance. Instead of relying on closed-door deals, decentralized communities can now decide for themselves who manages their reserves. The USDH saga is a turning point in how decentralized platforms negotiate with centralized issuers. Hyperliquid has leveraged its balance sheet to flip the script, making issuers fight for access to its ecosystem and share their profits with the community. For Circle, it’s a wake-up call: the days of capturing billions in risk-free yield without sharing are numbered. For Hyperliquid, it’s a chance to transform USDC dependence into a self-reinforcing growth engine. And for the broader crypto industry, it’s a blueprint for how governance can evolve from symbolic token votes to billion-dollar procurement battles fought transparently on-chain. On September 14, Hyperliquid’s validators will decide which bidder mints USDH. Whichever way the vote goes, the precedent has been set: in the new era of DeFi, power flows to the protocols that control the capital - and they’re no longer willing to give it away for free.

Title: Ethereum Treasury shift: Fidelity gains, BlackRock’s outflows, and more

Ethereum’s RWA crown tested as Fidelity steps into BlackRock’s Treasury turf. Ethereum holds 70% of the tokenized Treasury market. FDIT entered the top 10 with $203 million inflows, while BlackRock’s BUIDL shed $150 million. Ethereum [ETH] dominated 70% of the tokenized U.S. Treasury market. In numbers, $5.3 billion in tokenized Treasuries, bonds, and cash equivalents are flowing on Ethereum, accounting for over 70% of the total $7.46 billion tokenized Treasury market. Now, Fidelity has joined this sector of nearly 50 different tokenized U.S. Treasury offerings with the Fidelity Digital Interest Token (FDIT). The question is whether FDIT will pump more utility and liquidity into ETH’s DeFi stack. Sure, Fidelity’s making waves, but it’s not the first mover in the RWA game. The real heavyweight? BlackRock’s BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which still runs the show, with a solid $2.2 billion market cap in the tokenized Treasury space across multiple networks. Fidelity’s FDIT, by contrast, dropped solo on Ethereum. Within a short period, it grew to $203.7 million in assets and entered the top 10 Treasury products. Source: Rwa.xyz/treasuries Peep the 7-day flows: BUIDL was bleeding about $150 million, while FDIT was pulling in fresh liquidity left and right. That kind of on-chain rotation cements FDIT’s positioning, even in a crowded tokenized Treasury pool. In short, FDIT’s drop has seen solid on-chain adoption. Each token represents a share of FYOXX, backed by U.S. Treasuries. The bigger play? Ethereum’s still flexing as the go-to layer for institutional RWAs in DeFi. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries make up nearly 27% of the RWA stack. In other words, over a quarter of all on-chain RWAs are locked in low-risk, yield-bearing Treasury assets. This highlights just how dominant these U.S. gov-backed tokens are in DeFi’s real-world asset play. In this context, FDIT cracking the top 20 RWA assets isn’t a fluke. It’s proof of strong on-chain demand for tokenized Treasury products, with Ethereum devs clearly front-running the institutional RWA wave. Source: Rwa.xyz/networks/ethereum Right now, no chain comes close to Ethereum’s Treasury stack. ETH flexes 70% dominance, while Stellar lags at 6%, underscoring Ethereum’s grip. In fact, even after 95% stablecoin dominance, Treasuries still pull 3.15% of ETH’s market, showing serious on-chain RWA muscle. Fidelity’s move with FDIT just reinforces this. Dropping it on Ethereum taps into the network’s liquidity and dev infrastructure. Consequently, it allows them to stack market share and bolster their DeFi presence.

Title: Is efficiency misunderstood?
URL: https://www.techradar.com/pro/is-efficiency-misunderstood
Time Published: 2025-09-08T08:03:55Z
Full Content:
Energy efficiency drives sustainability, control, and competitive growth When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. When it comes to energy, terms like 'frugal’ or ‘efficiency’ can be perceived as ‘going without' or suggest having to make do with less. The reality is the opposite. Efficiency often improves our experience. In a world where energy demand is rising, becoming more volatile and costly, and climate pressures remain ever-present, efficiency offers more potential than ever. It’s no longer just a matter of operational performance. It’s about speed, comfort but also resilience, competitiveness, sustainability, and, increasingly, it’s about better control. Energy efficiency shouldn’t be viewed as a side benefit, but as the foundation for smarter growth. It should be seen as a powerful industry in its own right, and a crucial thread that runs through the success of other sectors. It’s what enables buildings, industries, and entire cities to function more intelligently and more sustainably for better life quality. Efficiency today is dynamic, digital, and deeply human. And unlocking it is one of the most powerful things we can do to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future while strengthening the systems we rely on every day. Businesses must evolve their mindset and see efficiency not just as a vehicle for cost savings, but as a fundamental driver of operations. EVP Energy Management, Schneider Electric. The traditional definition of efficiency—squeezing more value from fewer resources—remains relevant. But it’s also not enough. It’s about doing better—smarter operations, stronger margins, sharper control. It can also be the fastest and most cost-effective path to decarbonization. In fact, its importance to hitting our net zero goals, has seen the IEA declare energy efficiency the “first fuel” of clean energy transitions. In advanced economies, the bulk of efficiency savings are found through upgrading older infrastructure with new, more efficient solutions—things we’ve all heard of like switching to LEDs. However, more significant changes can and should be made to promote efficiency, from improving building efficiency to replacing HVAC systems. The IEA projected in 2021 that improving energy efficiency could deliver a reduction in annual energy-related emissions of 3.5 Gt CO2-eq (12%) compared with 2017 levels, delivering more than 40% of the abatement required to be in line with the Paris Agreement. The climate impact of efficiency is significant, but the wider impact to your organization is why it should be on your radar. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! As part of our decarbonization journey, efficiency might be the first fuel, but it’s the combination of electrification and digitalization, or what we call Electricity 4.0, that is supercharging its potential. Alone, each makes an impact. When combined, they are transformative, redefining efficiency across industries, cities and households. Electrification replaces fossil-fuel-based systems with electric alternatives—we’re seeing lots of examples of this in our day-to-day lives with things like heat pumps, EVs or even induction hobs. But these changes can also be at an industrial scale with changes to process heating in energy intensive applications. These technologies are inherently more efficient and, when powered by renewables, dramatically reduce emissions. While a powerful part of decarbonization, electrification’s impact is magnified with digital solutions. The digital revolution has transformed the way we understand and manage energy. Smart sensors, connected devices, and advanced analytics provide unprecedented visibility into how, when, and where energy is used. This data-driven approach enables organizations to identify inefficiencies and remedy them. But beyond this, digital tools can manage electricity demand and balance loads dynamically. This allows energy users to be more in control and actively manage demand to when renewable generation is highest – which is something traditional systems just cannot manage. Take your home for example. If you install energy management, such as smart thermostats, you save energy (and reduce energy bills) by applying energy exactly where you need it. As a result, not only do you save costs and carbon, you also get precise control and comfort, having rooms the exact temperature you want (vs just cold, warm or hot). These systems can even be enhanced with AI, incorporating weather forecasting to know that tomorrow will be warmer than today, so the boiler can start a bit later to reach your desired temperatures (saving even more energy and cost). What was once viewed purely as a cost-saving tactic is now becoming a steppingstone for organizations striving to become more competitive, and we’ve shown some of the ways you can increase efficiency and move to a more electric and digital approach. Energy efficiency no longer deserves to be relegated to an afterthought or a box ticking exercise. It belongs in boardroom strategies—driving profitability, resilience and brand strength. Businesses that use less energy are less exposed to price volatility and fossil fuel supply chain disruptions. And with smart, electrified systems, they can even participate in new energy markets—and even move into the prosumer space, becoming both consumers and producers of energy. This shift helps to future proof key elements of an organization’s cash flow and operations. However, the value of energy efficiency transcends the bottom line. Energy efficient operations are increasingly a signal of innovation and responsibility, resonating with customers, investors and regulators. It’s no surprise, then, that in their 2024 Investor Letter, BlackRock said companies that show a clear commitment to sustainability and efficiency are more likely to attract long-term capital. It bears reiterating that investing in efficiency is investing in a long-term saving. For many it’s also investing in more modern equipment which can offer a myriad of side benefits that weren’t previously considered within the move. But the long-term saving on energy bills can see knock on reductions in maintenance costs. Whether you’re counting savings in MWhs or dollars, you’re not counting the right thing with energy efficiency today. Instead, you should be looking at additional available spend for training, R&D or global expansion. You should be counting additional hours saved through better maintenance schedules or increased productivity due to a happier, healthier workforce. What you once knew to be true of efficiency isn’t wrong, it’s just too narrow for the value it can deliver today We've listed the best green web hosting.

Title: How Rich Is Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Really? Arkham’s 2025 Report
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/how-rich-ethereum-co-founder-vitalik-buterin-2025/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T07:30:00Z
Full Content:
Arkham Intelligence’s new deep-dive, shared via X on September 6, pegs Vitalik Buterin’s wealth at “at least $1.05 billion”—a lower-bound tally built from identified on-chain assets and known private holdings. The report situates the estimate as of August 2025 and emphasizes that it fluctuates intraday with Ether’s price. The backbone is Ether itself. Arkham attributes ~240,042 ETH to Buterin’s known wallets and notes that over 99% of his crypto portfolio value is in ETH. At the time of writing in the report, ETH was $4,321, implying roughly $1.04 billion of ETH exposure alone and explaining the tight co-movement between his net worth and ETH’s market cycle. Historically, Arkham reconstructs a precise balance-history curve. On December 31, 2015, Buterin’s known crypto wealth stood at $596,760; by December 31, 2016 it was $4.23 million, then $278.37 million a year later—his largest year-over-year jump in the 2017 bull run. He first crossed the on-chain billionaire mark at age 27 during 2021 as ETH traded above $3,000, and briefly peaked at $2.09 billion on November 18, 2021 with ETH near its cycle high. The subsequent bear market slashed the mark-to-market value by roughly 75%, from $1.2 billion (Dec 31, 2021) to $300.58 million (Dec 31, 2022), before recovering to $1.05 billion in the 2024–2025 rebound. “The peak of Vitalik’s crypto net worth was in May 2021, when 50% of the supply of the memecoin SHIB was sent to him and was briefly worth $20 Billion. Vitalik donated those tokens to charity and did not profit off of this memecoin,” Arkham writes. On ownership concentration, Arkham compares Buterin to other top-tier ETH holders. The ETH2 (Beacon) deposit contract leads with 66,887,347.41 ETH, followed by exchange and ETF-custody clusters (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Robinhood, Grayscale, BlackRock). Arkham concludes Buterin is the largest identifiable individual with access to his coins, while Estonian banker Rain Lõhmus sits on ~250,000 ETH that are believed to be inaccessible due to lost keys. The Ethereum co-founder’s own disclosures anchor the percentages. In October 2018 he wrote: “I never had 900k ETH. When I had 0.9% of all ETH, the supply was ~75 million.” That statement frames Arkham’s finding that his share never materially exceeded ~0.9% and has trended down over time as he sold or donated and as supply evolved. Non-ETH positions are small in dollar terms but spelled out with exact counts. As of publication, Arkham shows 10,000,000,000 WHITE (~$3.72 million), 30,000,000,000 MOODENG (~$690,000), and 869,509 KNC (~$327,000) among his larger non-ETH tokens. The long tail includes $12,400 of TORN linked to Tornado Cash usage and 218,413,000 SHIB (~$2,720) remaining on known addresses. Buterin has publicly explained some of the flows that complicate “sales” tallies. In August 2022 he stated, “I’ll out myself as someone who has used [Tornado Cash] to donate to this exact cause,” referring to donations to Ukraine; he has also said that exchange-bound transfers from his wallets since 2018 have been for donations, not personal profit-taking. Off-chain, Arkham highlights early equity in zero-knowledge firm StarkWare, which reached an $8 billion valuation in its 2022 Series D—an illiquid but potentially meaningful additive to the on-chain floor. Precise sizing of these stakes is not disclosed, so Arkham treats the $1.05 billion as a conservative baseline rather than a cap. At press time, Ethereum traded at $4,298.

Title: Forbes Asia 20th Anniversary Retrospective

ByForbes Asia Team, Forbes Staff. When Forbes Asia launched in September 2005, it marked the start of a dedicated focus on, as we then described it, the world’s most economically dynamic region. Over the past two decades our network of reporters and editors has documented the titans and companies forming the backbone of Asia’s economies and creating the wealth that has underpinned regional growth. We’ve journeyed with our readers through China’s prosperity boom and slowdown, India’s transformation under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ASEAN’s trade and economic expansion, the fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis, and, most recently, the aftermath of the Covid-19 epidemic. As the trusted chronicler of wealth, we’ve tracked the explosion in the number of billionaires in this region. There were 115 Asians worth a collective $364 billion on our World’s Billionaires list of 2006. This tally has since soared. In the 2025 rankings, there were a total of 1,046 billionaires from the Asia-Pacific, collectively worth $4.2 trillion. China (including Hong Kong) and India had the second- and third-largest number of billionaires in the world after the U.S., with 516 and 205, respectively. Our dozen country rich lists, where the typical minimum net worth requirement of $1 billion does not apply, cast a wider net, though in China and India that sum is no longer enough to earn a berth among their 100 richest. We drilled deeper to uncover top-performing businesses (and future billionaires) through our annual Best Under A Billion list, which highlights 200 publicly listed small and midsized companies with sales below $1 billion. In 2012 we kicked off an annual roster to celebrate the growing presence of Asia’s power businesswomen. And 2016 saw the debut of a regional 30 Under 30 list to foreground young achievers, including entrepreneurs, artists and athletes. Our 100 to Watch list of small companies and startups on the rise was launched five years ago. The accompanying pages showcase many of the moguls featured on our covers over the past 20 years whose achievements have contributed to planting Asia firmly on the global economic map. Edited by Mary E. Scott We shadowed India-born, U.S.-based venture capitalist Promod Haque of Norwest Venture Partners as he crisscrossed his homeland searching for high-tech gold. In his 35-year career, Haque rolled the dice on some 70 companies, roughly 10% in India, with a combined exit value of $40 billion. That put him on the Forbes Midas List of top VCs more than a dozen times. Now in a part-time role at Norwest, the 77-year-old still believes India provides ample “opportunity for great investment success.” This compendium of Asia-Pacific’s 200 top-performing small and midsized companies with annual revenue under $1 billion often has titans in the making. Notable alumni of the Best Under A Billion list over the years range from China’s Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent to Malaysia’s AirAsia and the Philippines’ Jollibee to India’s Infosys and Biocon. We highlighted Singapore Airlines in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, when it posted profits amid high fuel prices and a threat from Dubai-based Emirates. It has since won accolades as one of the world’s best carriers. In 2024, we revisited the airline after it had scooped up a 25% stake in the privatized Air India, partnering with the Tata conglomerate. Net profit hit a record $2.8 billion in the year to March 31, though the Air India bet has yet to pay off. U.S.-educated brothers Victor and William Fung were named our 2006 businessmen of the year for converting their family company, Li & Fung, into a world-class enterprise connecting American and European consumers to factories in 40 countries. While they still retain significant stakes, Victor’s son Spencer is now group executive chairman. In 2020, the family partnered with Singapore logistics firm GLP to take Li & Fung private, delisting it from the Hong Kong stock exchange after a 28-year run. Korean skincare and cosmetics maker Amorepacific drew our attention long before the K-beauty phenomenon exploded, with products now routinely flogged by influencers on social media. In 2015, we named its billionaire chairman and CEO, Suh Kyung-bae, grandson of the founder, as businessman of the year. Today, as Americans panic buy their favorite K-beauty brands before the Trump tariffs hit, the company’s $3 billion in annual revenue looks set to get a lift. Nandan Nilekani was facing a problem at Infosys, the software company he cofounded: hiring 28,500 people in one year. In today’s AI world, the Indian IT behemoth has reportedly slowed recruitment. More than 80% of the 324,000 people it employs—up fivefold since 2006—are tagged “AI aware.” Nilekani left Infosys in 2009 to work with the government to build Aadhaar, India’s mammoth identity card scheme. A boardroom shake-up eight years later brought him back to Infosys as chairman. We profiled Li Ka-shing, nicknamed Superman, who at the time was the richest man in Asia and running his telecom-to-ports empire with an eye on China expansion. Today the 97-year-old’s CK Hutchison, from which he retired as chairman but remains as senior advisor, is in the throes of a complex $23 billion deal to sell its port assets, including two at the Panama Canal, which is strategically important to both the Americans and Chinese. The possible buyer is a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock and, potentially, state-owned China Cosco Shipping. Li, who got his start making plastic flowers, is now among Asia’s richest with a $40 billion fortune. Vaccine billionaire Cyrus Poonawalla, founder of privately held Serum Institute of India, was the face of our 2007 list of 50 richest Indians. By 2014, the roster had expanded to 100 and each had to be worth at least $1 billion to qualify. In 2020, when the pandemic shut down the world, Poonawalla’s son Adar stepped up to produce a Covid-19 vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca. Last year was a record breaker for the list: the combined wealth of India’s 100 richest surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. When we met with Edwin Soeryadjaya, he was dead set on restoring the family fortune, wiped out when his father sold a stake in automotive group Astra to bail out a bank that was run by another son. Soeryadjaya rebuilt the clan’s wealth largely through a stake in coal miner Adaro. Lately he’s been greening his portfolio with solar and carbon-offset investments. Nvidia was named company of the year when the California-based chipmaker’s graphics processors were revolutionizing how we watched TV, gamed and used the internet. Today, the company is making a bigger killing as the supplier of the world’s most powerful AI chips, propelling its market cap to over $4 trillion. Founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s wealth has ballooned to $157 billion, making him the world’s seventh-richest person. In 2020, Hong Kong billionaire Francis Choi put his money behind biodegradable plastics to make environmentally friendly toys. This was a break from 2007, when Choi’s Early Light Industrial’s China-made toys for Mattel were found to contain lead paint. The “King of Toys” now has broader interests, from property to luxury watch retailing. Unfazed by the global financial crisis, brandy billionaire Andrew Tan teamed up with Malaysian gaming tycoon Lim Kok Thay’s Genting to invest $1.6 billion in building two casino resorts to make Manila the next Monte Carlo. While the partnership ended in 2023, it was a smart bet for Tan. Last year, the Philippines hit a record $7 billion in gross gaming revenue, higher than Singapore’s estimated $6 billion but dwarfed by the $27 billion for Macau, still the world’s top gambling city. Just months after featuring on our cover, William Amelio stepped down as CEO of Lenovo after a four-year stint; Yang Yuanqing—who in 2004 transformed Lenovo into a global tech player by buying IBM’s PC business for over $1 billion—was reinstated in his place, and founder Liu Chuanzi returned as chairman. The leadership overhaul came after sales plunged and the company slid into the red. Today, Lenovo is the world’s No. 1 PC maker in unit terms, up from No. 4 in 2008. Yang is CEO, chairman, and a billionaire. Liu is honorary chairman. Tadashi Yanai’s goal was to have more people wear his threads than those made by rivals Gap, H&M and Zara owner Inditex. He has since nearly tripled Uniqlo’s store network to some 2,500 outlets worldwide. Based on its $21 billion revenue for fiscal 2024, Yanai’s Fast Retailing has trounced Gap, is closing in on H&M, but has still to catch up with Inditex. Yanai, who became Japan’s richest person in 2009 and is now worth $45 billion, has said that he spends the bulk of his time mentoring potential successors. Our World’s Billionaires List saw a wealth meltdown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and India’s Gautam Adani was no exception. We met the commodities-and-infrastructure tycoon three months after he’d narrowly survived a terror attack by gunmen in a Mumbai hotel. Atop a shipping container at his Mundra port, Adani posed gamely for our photographer. He went on to greater heights, briefly surpassing the likes of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and fellow Indian Mukesh Ambani in 2022 to become the world’s second-richest person, worth $143 billion. Months later, that went into freefall when U.S. firm Hindenburg Research accused Adani and his companies of financial fraud and stock market manipulation, allegations the businessman denied. His wealth has climbed again since, though not to the same stratospheric level. One year after we profiled Baidu cofounder and CEO Robin Li, Google quit China amid a cyberattack and concerns about censorship, clearing the way for Baidu to become the mainland’s top search engine. The homegrown internet giant has waded into cloud computing and is investing heavily in AI with a ChatGPT-like service called Ernie. Australian trucking billionaire Lindsay Fox declared that the global economic downturn had delivered a record year for his privately owned Linfox, a mover of goods across Asia-Pacific: “Everyone’s eating more at home, everyone’s drinking, and everybody who’s a miner is digging.” A decade later, Covid-19 was a mixed bag. Linfox snagged a government contract to transport tens of millions of vaccines but profits were hit by higher supply chain costs. Fox, 88, has handed running of the business to son and executive chairman Peter. Quitting his career as a banker, Singapore’s Simon Cheong plunged into property development, founding SC Global in 1996 to build ultra-luxury properties, well before the influx of the wealthy from overseas turned into a flood. Known for his meticulous attention to detail, Cheong set a then-record with the Marq, where a four-bedroom unit fetched $16 million in 2011. Tony Fernandes single-handedly made air travel affordable for millions of people when he relaunched AirAsia as a no-frills carrier in 2001. The journey’s been bumpy at times, but the former music industry executive is still flying high as CEO of Capital A, the holding company for the Malaysia-based airline. Charles Chao, CEO of news and entertainment portal Sina, launched microblog Weibo just as Twitter (now X) and Facebook (now Meta) were banned in China. Weibo took off, becoming a forum for popular opinion since surging to 600 million active monthly users. But its Nasdaq-listed shares are down about 90% from a high of $142 in 2018, battered by a massive data breach in 2020 and a weak advertising market. Our reporter tagged along with Jackie Chan as he raced around Asia combining his job as an action movie celebrity with charitable works, which put him on our annual Heroes of Philanthropy list. His Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation, launched in 1988, offers scholarships to students as well as medical services and aid during natural disasters. In 2004, he kicked off his Dragon’s Heart Foundation to build schools and help the elderly in remote parts of mainland China. Chan has said he plans to give his estimated $400 million fortune to charity when he dies. Thailand’s richest person, Dhanin Chearavanont, was then busy hatching a plan for his Charoen Pokphand group, an early mover in China, to build megafarms to feed the country’s growing middle class. In 2024, the group’s Bangkok-listed CP Foods unit drew two-thirds of its $18 billion revenue from overseas. Dhanin stepped back from running his agribusiness-to-telecoms conglomerate in 2017, handing charge to his two sons, though he remains senior chairman. Teresita Sy-Coson was the cover star for our inaugural Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. More than a decade later she remains at the top of the Sy family’s SM Investments holding company, building on the vision of her father, founder Henry Sy, who died in 2019. In the 20 years since listing on the Philippine Stock Exchange, the retail, banking and property conglomerate has seen its shares soar almost sevenfold. Vincent Tan brought McDonald’s to Malaysia, laying the foundation for Berjaya, a retail, property and financial services group that made him one of the country’s richest people. But in 2012, on turning 60, Tan took a back seat to embark on a new mission, helping ordinary Malaysians speak better English. Tan returned as Berjaya’s executive chairman five years later, moving into an advisory role in 2023. He reportedly plans to donate half his estimated $800 million fortune to charity. At the time, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), founded by Morris Chang in 1987, was growing fast, driven by surging demand for its chips for smartphones and tablets. Today, the AI boom is fueling sales at one of the world’s largest chipmakers, with Apple and Nvidia among its biggest customers. With substantial investments in the U.S., TSMC is likely to be exempted from Trump’s tariffs. Chang, 94, who has long since retired, was named by Forbes in 2017 as one of the 100 Greatest Living Business Minds. Peter Woo, one of Hong Kong’s ten richest people, spoke to us at a time when Hong Kongers were complaining about the influx of mainland Chinese visitors. The owner of two flagship shopping malls, whose wealth had doubled in a year to $8 billion thanks to the shopping frenzy, was more welcoming. Two years later, Woo handed charge of his holding company, Wheelock, to son Douglas. We outed Pham Nhat Vuong, founder and chairman of Vingroup, one of Vietnam’s largest conglomerates, as the country’s first billionaire. The self-made Vuong, now worth around $13 billion and the country’s richest person, has been on an expansion binge since, muscling into everything from EVs to renewable energy and hotels. In June, Vingroup revealed plans to build a $14 billion port-and-logistics hub outside Hanoi, where it is based. The founder and executive chairperson of Biocon, which made her the richest self-made woman in India when it went public in 2004, has poured her energy and resources into making a range of low-cost drugs, including for chronic diseases. After losing a friend to cancer, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw set up a cancer center in Bangalore as well as centers for advanced therapeutics and research. Shaw, now 72, whose late husband, John, was also a cancer patient, has pledged to leave 75% of her $3.3 billion wealth to charity. Chew Gek Khim wrested control of Singapore’s Straits Trading in 2008 after a high-profile bidding war with OCBC’s Lee family. Then she got busy revamping the staid colonial-era tin smelter into a sleek 21st-century holding company, broadening its activities to include property, hospitality and asset management. Known for her signature cheongsams, Chew still runs the show as executive chairman. Neil Shen cofounded Sequoia Capital China in 2005, at a time when Chinese internet companies were way behind their American counterparts, and turned it into an investment juggernaut. The key, disclosed the China-born, Yale-educated Shen, was to understand Chinese culture and business practices. Sequoia Capital China was split from its Silicon Valley parent in 2024 and renamed HongShan Capital Group, or HSG, where Shen is founder and managing partner. The billionaire investor has been on our Midas list more than a dozen times. Piyush Gupta retired as CEO of Singapore’s DBS in March, more than a decade after he shared with us his plan to turn the stodgy local bank into a nimble regional player by digitalizing its services. The bank has been named the world’s best digital bank several times and continues to harness cutting-edge technology such as blockchain and AI. Gupta handed charge to DBS veteran Tan Su Shan, who earned a place on our Asia’s Power Businesswomen list in 2024. Lei Jun, founder, chairman and CEO of China’s Xiaomi, which made smartphones affordable for hundreds of millions of people, was a shoo-in for our businessman of the year. Xiaomi, which means “small rice” in Mandarin, was founded in 2010. Since our sit-down with Lei, it has expanded its portfolio to include wearables, IoT devices and more recently, EVs. Lei’s $42 billion fortune makes him China’s sixth-richest person today. This issue was largely dedicated to Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who died March 23, 2015. Remembered by Steve Forbes and others as one of the great statesmen of the post-WWII era, LKY was a clear-eyed pragmatist with superb political skills who built Singapore into the economic powerhouse it is today. LKY also shared his views with our readers as a Forbes columnist for 15 years, starting in 2001. The then-34-year-old Frank Wang was the world’s first drone billionaire, having amassed a fortune with DJI, the company he founded in 2006 and ran out of his dorm room at a Hong Kong university. Today, Shenzhen-based DJI continues to dominate the consumer-drone space, giving Wang a net worth of $5.4 billion. Nepal’s first, and only, billionaire, Binod Chaudhary, raced to the rescue when a 7.8 Richter-scale earthquake devastated the country, distributing essentials in the immediate aftermath, including his company’s Wai Wai instant noodles, and helping longer term with rebuilding. His Chaudhary Foundation, the philanthropic arm of his CG Corp Global conglomerate, was set up in 1995 to support education, disaster management and healthcare, particularly for children. The year marked our first 30 Under 30 Asia list of the Millennials making good in this part of the world. Ten editions later, the roster continues to showcase young entrepreneurs, innovators and artists who are disrupting their chosen fields; only now, Gen Z is taking over, with nearly half of the 2025 cohort aged 27 or under. We flagged Nita Ambani, wife of Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, as the first lady of Indian business and an Asian power businesswoman. At the time, she was a Reliance director, overseeing the launch and branding of telecoms arm Jio, which now has almost 500 million subscribers. Though she retired from the board in 2023 as her children stepped up, she remains chairperson of philanthropic arm Reliance Foundation and is even more visible today. Nita shows up at Premier League cricket matches, rooting for Reliance’s Mumbai Indians team. As a member of the International Olympic Committee, she’s lobbying for the Games to be held in India. A prominent cultural and convention center in Mumbai that was her brainchild bears her name. Hary Tanoesoedibjo, founder and executive chairman of Media Nusantara Citra group, is sometimes called Indonesia’s Donald Trump. Hary (as local media call him) built a fortune in real estate and TV broadcasting and likes to post on social media. He also happens to be the U.S. president’s business partner, owning several Trump-branded resorts in Indonesia. Hary attended the 2017 presidential inauguration and was hobnobbing in Washington D.C. when Trump was sworn in for his second term. He had ambitions to become Indonesia’s president but gave control of the political party he founded to daughter Angela last year. Sonia Cheng grew up in hotels owned by New World Development, a property company founded by her grandfather, Cheng Yu-tung. Under her guidance as CEO, its Rosewood Hotels brand, acquired in 2011, was quickly becoming one of the world’s fastest-growing upscale hotel chains. It now manages 33 properties, including The Carlyle in New York and Hotel de Crillon in Paris, with 27 more being developed. In 2022 Cheng also took on the role of co-vice chairman at Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, the Cheng family’s crown jewel. Meanwhile, New World has been weighed down lately by debt. What was only a dream in 2017 is now reality: Wang Chuanfu’s BYD is the largest EV maker in the world in terms of auto sales. The company’s 2024 revenue exceeded $100 billion, blowing past chief rival Tesla. However, BYD’s shares are off the all-time high they hit in May as investors worry about an EV price war. Joseph Tsai, cofounder and then-executive vice chairman of e-commerce giant Alibaba, had a slam-dunk year in 2017. Of note: his high-profile acquisition of 49% of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team for $1 billion. Three years later, the sports fan paid nearly $1.4 billion for the remaining stake. (He has since sold part of his holding but maintains control.) Tsai rose to chairman of Alibaba in 2023 and is now worth $11.5 billion. We were among the first to spot standout executive Jane Jie Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group (formerly Ctrip). She was in the midst of transforming the China-based online travel agency into a global player that today offers the gamut, from flights and hotels to rail travel and rental cars anywhere in the world. Sun still runs the company—and marathons. Referred to by his staff as “big brother Zhang,” the high school dropout became the world’s richest eatery entrepreneur after listing his Sichuan hot pot chain, Haidilao, in 2018. The business, which Zhang Yong cofounded with his wife, Shu Ping, is not quite sizzling these days. A consumer spending slump in mainland China prompted Zhang, now a Singapore citizen and resident, to diversify into other dining options as well as focus on U.S. expansion. In an exclusive interview, Eduardo Saverin, cofounder of Facebook, explained the investment mantra of B Capital Group, the venture capital firm he established with business partner Raj Ganguly. The duo, based in Singapore and Los Angeles, respectively, were out to prove that innovation can happen anywhere, not just in Silicon Valley. It certainly has. B Capital’s assets under management now stand at $8 billion, invested in more than 190 companies in sectors such as healthcare and AI. Once China’s richest person, beverage billionaire Zong Qinghou talked candidly of his efforts to rekindle sales at his privately held Hangzhou Wahaha Group with its portfolio of bottled water and milk drinks. He also spoke about his daughter, Kelly, as a potential successor. A year after Zong’s death in 2024, Kelly, who now leads Wahaha, is embroiled in an inheritance fight with three people who claim to be the late Zong’s offspring. In the year 2000, Forbes Global (the forerunner of Forbes Asia) put Jack Ma, cofounder of China’s Alibaba, on its cover when the e-commerce company had just 150 employees (vs 124,000 today). Almost two decades later, as Ma stepped down as chairman, announcing that he was switching his focus to philanthropy, he graced the cover again. The former teacher’s meteoric rise as one of China's top tech entrepreneurs earned him the Malcolm S. Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019. Martin and Peter Lee, the sons of Lee Shau Kee, then Hong Kong’s richest person, had spent less than a year as co-chairmen at the family’s property flagship, Henderson Land, when they agreed to open up about how they planned to carry the legacy forward. The patriarch’s death in March 2025 makes them co-owners of one of Hong Kong’s largest landlords at a time when the property market is in a prolonged slump. In 2020, Masayoshi Son, founder of Japanese investment giant SoftBank, had hit a wall. Some big-money bets made by his $100 billion Vision Fund had gone spectacularly south, forcing Son to divest assets to pay down debt. Today, the entrepreneur has a new vision, one focused on AI, with investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and chip giants Nvidia, TSMC and Intel. The result: Softbank returned to profit in fiscal 2025 after four years in the red, and a surge in its stock has made Son once again Japan’s richest person with a $54 billion fortune. When most businesses were reeling under Covid-19 lockdowns, Singapore-based Sea, an online provider of shopping, games and payment services, led by cofounder Forrest Li, was on a high. It had become Singapore’s most valuable company with a market cap of $69 billion. Today, New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea’s market cap exceeds $110 billion amid buoyant revenue from its gaming (Garena), e-commerce (Shopee) and payments (Monee) arms. Li was first covered by us as an entrepreneur to watch in 2010. Roshni Nadar Malhotra became chairperson of HCL Technologies in 2020, taking over from her billionaire father, Shiv Nadar, who cofounded the company as a garage startup in 1976. That made the former TV news producer one of the first women to lead a listed IT outfit in India and earned her a spot on our annual Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. With the successful takeover of Indonesia’s Bank Permata in 2020, third-generation president Chartsiri Sophonpanich set the stage for a significant expansion of Bangkok Bank’s regional presence. The $2.7 billion deal was the biggest in the bank’s history and marked a departure from its past strategy of growing organically. It also gave Chartsiri, who agreed to a rare interview, a way to cement his legacy at the institution cofounded by his grandfather in 1944. Grab’s group CEO, Anthony Tan, gave us the lowdown on how he planned to take his Singapore-headquartered superapp company, best known for its ride-hailing and delivery services, to the next level. His blueprint included transforming Grab, which he cofounded in 2012, into a listed entity and boosting its presence in fintech. A month later, Grab went public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC merger that valued the company at $40 billion, making it the biggest-ever listing of a Southeast Asian business. Its market cap has since halved to $21 billion. Data centers are multiplying around the world, and one person who saw the coming wave and rode it to become a multibillionaire is Otto Toto Sugiri, cofounder of DCI, Indonesia’s biggest data center operator by capacity. The serial tech entrepreneur launched the country’s first internet service provider in 1994 and is sometimes referred to as Indonesia’s Bill Gates. We sat down with GGV Capital’s Jenny Lee, the first woman to break into the top ten of the Midas ranking in 2012 and who had just completed an unbroken, 11-year run on that list. Now as senior managing partner at Granite Asia, which was split off from GGV in 2024, Singapore-based Lee’s winning streak continues. She was at No. 75 on this year’s Midas List and successfully launched Granite’s first private credit fund in May, securing more than half the targeted $500 million from anchor investors. In the Philippines, billionaire Enrique Razon, known for his twin successes in ports and casinos, was systematically building a third source of wealth: infrastructure. With interests in water utilities, hydropower, gas fields and solar farms, Razon stressed he wasn’t fazed by bureaucratic hurdles. “We’re very persistent, very aggressive. We don’t make crazy proposals. We study things very carefully.” Skyrocketing coal prices resulted in a fivefold jump in the wealth of Low Tuck Kwong, the founder of coal miner Bayan Resources, pushing him to No. 2 on our Indonesia rich list from No. 18 the year before, with a $12.1 billion fortune that has since more than doubled. Despite the global shift toward renewables, Low said he was confident the so-called black gold had a profitable future and of Bayan’s industry prospects, thanks to its low-cost base and low-emissions coal. Hong Kong developer Vincent Lo gambled big on mainland China after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, ploughing money into his Xintiandi lifestyle and entertainment district in Shanghai. The bet paid off, turning his listed Shui On Land into his empire’s crown jewel. A meticulous planner, Lo chose daughter Stephanie as his successor. He continues to bet on China, despite its property distress, agreeing in June to invest in a premium Shanghai project. The wealthy Aboitiz family of the Philippines has a track record of reinventing its portfolio to keep pace with the times. We dug deep into Sabin Aboitiz’s $7 billion blueprint to expand century-old Aboitiz Equity Ventures, the country’s second-biggest electricity producer, into a banking, infrastructure and F&B powerhouse. “We’re transforming from a 100-year-old man to a 25-year-old athlete,” the fourth-generation president and CEO said. Malaysian billionaire brothers Lee Yeow Chor and Lee Yeow Seng, who inherited palm oil business IOI from their late father, Lee Shin Cheng, caught our eye for their bet on property in neighboring Singapore. Up next: a REIT listing that could hold as much as $6.2 billion in assets. The repositioning of Philippine F&B giant San Miguel as a nation builder by chairman Ramon Ang was a compelling story of a self-driven tycoon seeking to cement his legacy while preparing his son John Paul Ang to carry it forward. Third-generation scion Miwako Date’s strategy to double down on Mori Trust’s hotels and resorts business now looks savvy: visitors to Japan, led by the Chinese, surged 21% in the first half of 2025 to 22 million, putting the country on track to draw 45 million visitors this year, as estimated by Mori. Kuok Meng Wei, whose legendary grandfather Robert Kuok was described by Forbes as the world’s shrewdest businessman in a 1997 cover story, revealed his strategy of driving the storied Kuok Group into what he believes is the hottest industry in decades. Backed by his family, the 42-year-old’s K2 Strategic has become one of the leading builders of data centers in the region, notably in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Not long after she brokered a deal with Sam Altman of OpenAI, Shina Chung, the first woman CEO of Kakao, outlined to us her plan to tap its next-gen technology for AI virtual assistants to jumpstart growth at the Korean internet giant. Nikhil Sawhney, fourth-generation successor of a Delhi clan that got its start in the sugar business, gave us the lowdown on how he transformed Triveni Turbine, a company appearing on our Best Under A Billion list for the second year, from a small domestic outfit into the world’s second-largest maker of turbines of up to 100MW capacity. His strategy: a laser focus on R&D and staying “paranoid” about competition.

Title: Tokenized assets are already nearing $300 billion led by stablecoins

Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are breaking records, nearing $300 billion in 2025, with some projections placing the market at $30 trillion by 2034. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. According to recent data by Token Terminal, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are already nearing $300 billion, a milestone that was projected to be reached in 2030. An additional report by RedStone Finance found that RWAs on-chain could hit as much as $30 trillion by 2034. While most of the momentum is made up of stablecoins like USDT and USDC, with Ethereum and Tron emerging as the big winners in asset tokenization, don’t blink and miss the broader trend: stablecoins lead, but funds are rising. On-chain funds, treasuries, and bonds are all rapidly carving out a bigger slice of the pie, moving capital markets from sleepy bank vaults onto global, blockchain rails that trade around the clock. Tokenized RWAs include much more than dollars in disguise. Earlier this week, Coinbase announced that it would launch Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures to create the first US-listed futures product that combines traditional equities and crypto exposure. Government bonds like Ondo USDY and BlackRock’s BUIDL, tokenized money-market funds, gold tokens such as PAXG, and even fractionalized real estate shares are now also a reality. Commodities aren’t left behind either. There’s over $2.5 billion in digital gold, $500 million in tokenized oil, and millions in tokenized silver, agricultural goods, and even carbon credits. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, calls tokenization a “revolution” in investing, envisioning a future where “every asset can be tokenized” and traded with global reach and instant settlement.

Stay connected via This isn’t just fintech hype. According to McKinsey and Token Terminal, institutional adoption is ramping up; tokenized RWAs alone are set to double in size as funds and treasuries jump ship to the blockchain. The move beyond stablecoins highlights a new era for capital markets, and the implications are far-reaching. Imagine having 24/7 access to traditional financial (TradFi) assets, democratized by fractional shares, with no more waiting days for trades to settle. Rather than relying on a centralized provider or a shadowy broker, every transaction is traceable and programmable, with assets directly managed on decentralized platforms, fast-tracking liquidity and efficiency. As funds and institutional assets sprint on-chain, the $300 billion milestone that was expected to be hit in 2030 marks not just growth but a sea change: the financial system is stepping off Wall Street and into global, programmable networks, changing where (and how) finance happens. Stablecoins were the start. Now, the tokenization wave is carrying funds, bonds, commodities, and even art. The next chapters? Real estate, private credit, and markets yet to be imagined, all open, frictionless, and unstoppable.

Title: Pro-XRP Lawyer Says Claims Of Coinbase Manipulating XRP Price Are ‘Highly Unlikely’
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/pro-xrp-lawyer-says-claims-of-coinbase-manipulating-xrp-price-are-highly-unlikely/
Time Published: 2025-09-07T17:00:06Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Data from multiple blockchain trackers shows that Coinbase has drastically cut its XRP holdings, a move that has taken many crypto investors by surprise. Analysts say such a huge reduction points to large outflows from institutional investors, but others have gone further by alleging manipulation. However, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has poured cold water on these claims. US-based exchange Coinbase recently reduced its stash from more than 780 million XRP to just under 200 million in a matter of weeks. This translates to a 69% reduction in the exchange’s holdings since the second quarter of 2025, including a 57% plunge over the last month alone. The scale of the drawdown has also shifted Coinbase’s ranking among exchange holders of XRP, sliding it from the fifth largest to barely in the top 10. An account on the social media platform X, known as Stern Drew, suggested that Coinbase’s sell-offs go with a deliberate strategy to suppress XRP’s price. In a detailed thread, the commentator claimed that nearly 40% of the outflows were routed through OTC desks tied to New York institutions and that the timing of the sales coincided with XRP price dips in August. According to the thread, more than 70% of the volume was unloaded during low-liquidity trading hours, while fragmented routing across wallets masked the scale of the sales. The thread even suggested that some of the XRP ended up with BlackRock-linked custodial wallets, a move that further points to theories about institutional involvement. Bill Morgan was quick to reject the idea that Coinbase is actively manipulating XRP’s price. In his view, the theory overlooks the fact that XRP has exhibited the same behavior throughout its history, including during the long stretch when Coinbase delisted the asset and had no apparent influence on its market activity. Coinbase suspended XRP trading in January 2021, but it wasn’t until July 2023 that the cryptocurrency started trading again on the US-based exchange. “One heck of a theory about Coinbase being against XRP,” he said, before noting that the token’s movements today are consistent with its established trends. The suggestion of manipulation by Coinbase fails to hold up, as XRP’s price action appears more reflective of broader crypto market movement than any deliberate suppression by the exchange. XRP has been trading within a well-defined range between $2.8 and $2.9 in the past seven days. Although it lost the $3 support level as August came to a close, XRP has managed to hold above $2.8 since then, and this level has so far cushioned it from deeper losses. On the upside, the $3.10 level is the critical resistance to watch. A decisive break above that barrier could shift momentum back in favor of the bulls. Until then, XRP’s price is likely to continue consolidating between $3.10 and $2.8. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.82.

Title: 6 Small Cap Dividends With Super-Sized Yields Of Up To 19%

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Small companies are sneaky AI-friendly plays because they are implementing these tools faster than their larger competitors. Expect to see these smaller firms become more efficient in the quarters ahead. Sales will continue to increase while headcounts will remain relatively flat as robots take up the slack—a boon to future profits. Ironically, small caps are currently the cheapest sector on the board: So, we turn our attention to a six pack of small but mighty dividend payers. Let’s start with a lender that yields “only” 15.7% per year and work our way up from there. We discussed BlackRock TCP Capital (TCPC, 15.7% yield) recently as part of our “unloved stocks” focus. This business development company (BDC) invests in more than 150 companies across 20 industries, with a penchant for first-lien debt. It really began underperforming with gusto in 2023; it’s currently restructuring deals amid portfolio credit issues, so things don’t look much better now. But TCPC’s woes have opened up a wide 18% discount to its net asset value (NAV)—that and a 14% regular yield (with an additional 1.7% from specials) might tempt some distressed-asset buyers. That said, the vast majority of BDCs trade for less than their NAV right now, and most of them sit in the small-cap space, so perhaps there’s more fertile ground elsewhere. For instance, New Mountain Finance (NMFC, 12.1% yield) offers a double-digit yield and a double-digit discount to NAV (14%). NMFC deals in U.S. upper-middle-market businesses backed by private equity sponsors. First-lien debt is its most common deal type, at 65% of the portfolio currently, but it has positions in second lien and subordinated debt, preferred stock, common stock and net lease deals. Its portfolio is 124 companies wide right now, and it uses a “defensive growth” strategy, with a focus on investing in strong businesses in acyclical sectors. New Mountain bounced off the COVID bear-market bottom much like other BDCs. But when the industry caught a second wind in 2024, NMFC was largely left behind. Shares are down about 3% even after accounting for its massive yield, which helps to explain its wide discount to NAV. The problem is that NAV is declining too, including a big quarter-over-quarter dip of nearly 2% between the first and second quarters. NMFC suffered from markdowns on healthcare, consumer products, and ed-tech firm Edmentum. On the bright side, non-accruals (loans that are delinquent for a prolonged period, usually 90 days) were stable, and its credit quality remains in decent shape. Moreover, the company has fee waivers and a dividend protection program to keep the high payout in place. But for that discount to NAV to be a bona fide deal, we’ll need to see better business performance. Kayne Anderson BDC (KBDC, 12.6% yield) is another BDC operating in the middle-market with a penchant for private equity-backed, first-lien loans. KBDC targets companies with between $10 million and $75 million in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and its 114 portfolio companies are largely concentrated in defensive, stable industries. This is an extremely fresh-faced BDC: It began operations in 2021 and went public in 2024. And while it has hardly come roaring out of the gate—its lifetime total return is 1 percentage point removed from the VanEck BDC Income ETF (BIZD)—there are signs of a decent business here. Are there weaknesses? Yes. One small loan was added to the non-accrual list during Q2, bringing non-accruals to 2.2% of the total portfolio on a cost basis (up from 1.9% in Q1). And NAV declined by just less than 1%. But the company’s investments have been picking up in Q3, including a strategic $80 million investment into lower-middle-market credit manager SG Credit at an 11% cash fixed yield. It’s running a $100 million buyback program through May 2026. And part of the aforementioned NAV decline was a 10-cent special dividend—its third in as many quarters. (KBDC yields 10% based on its 40-cent-per-share regular quarterly dividend; specials bring that up to 12.6%.) Mach Natural Resources LP (MNR, 16.0% distribution) is in another big-income niche: master limited partnerships (MLPs). While they can be a pain come tax time because of their additional K-1 form, double-digit distributions can make them worth our time. MNR is a young MLP that formed in November 2017 and went public in late 2023. Its primary operations are in the Anadarko Basin, and it has additional assets in the Green River basin. More recently, it has expanded its reach to the San Juan and Permian basins. While many of its peers are oil-heavy, it has a higher natural-gas mix that in the most recent quarter represented just over half its production. It’s also an efficient operator and has a good track record of buying assets at low valuations. MLP valuations get far into the weeds, but a common-enough one is EV (enterprise value)/EBITDAX (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration expense). On that front, MNR trades at roughly 3.5 times this year’s EBITDAX estimates, which is a little more than half of the average among comparable MLPs. Just understand that while the distribution is sky-high, it’s also all over the place. That’s because MNR pays out variable distributions, which are based on cash available after its 50% reinvestment rate. MFA Financial (MFA, 14.4% yield) invests in residential mortgage loans, residential mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), and other real estate assets. It also originates and services business purpose loans (BPLs) through its Lima One Capital subsidiary. MFA has massively outperformed the mREIT industry throughout its publicly traded life, though shareholders are best advised to wear their seatbelts—it speed-runs peaks and valleys alike. Lima One, which MFA acquired in 2021, is heading in the right direction; Q2 origination, servicing and other fees were up 13% QoQ, and the subsidiary added 15 loan officers during the quarter. Delinquency trends aren’t nearly so clean-cut: In Q2, they declined on the residential whole loan portfolio and single-family rental loans, but increased in the single-family BPL portfolio. Distributable earnings (DE, a non-GAAP measure of profitability that MFA favors) are expected to drop significantly this year before rebounding in 2026. Until then, the dividend is expected to outpace DE—that’s hardly a comfortable position. On the flip side? The market doesn’t appear to be pricing in a cut, and in fact, MFA actually raised its dividend by about 3% earlier this year—its first hike since a 20% cut in 2022. But MFA is value-priced, at about 7 times 2026 earnings estimates and 73% of book. We can get a downright jaw-dropping dividend from Armour Residential REIT (ARR, 19.0% yield), which primarily invests in fixed-rate “agency” residential MBSs, which are those issued or guaranteed by government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae. The value picture is a bit different from MFA, but it’s still cheap—ARR trades at about 90% of book, but also at just more than 4 times 2026 core EPS estimates. The question is: How deep must the discount be to ignore Armour’s past? Consider this: In December 2024, I wrote that “any prospective investors will have to overcome a significant mental hurdle: namely, Armour’s horrific dividend track record.” Armour has cut its payout seven times since 2015, and that reflects serious underperformance compared to the mREIT industry. It has continued to underperform since then, but it really detached from the mREIT group in August following a second-quarter miss on distributable EPS and net interest income. Book value per share dropped by 9%. If there’s any solace, it’s that the nearly 20% dividend remains well-covered. But even with that mammoth dividend, ARR has been historically incapable of delivering consistent positive total returns. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Take the nuclear option: Let Mamdani win the mayoral race so NYC can start over from scratch
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/09/06/business/let-zohran-mamdani-win-the-mayoral-race-so-nyc-can-start-over-from-scratch/
Time Published: 2025-09-07T01:33:08Z
Full Content:
As alarm bells ring over the New York City mayoral race, an odd sentiment is starting to gain traction across the business community: Just give up. Just sit tight and let the ill-equipped Maoist Zohran Mamdani win in November. Let him unleash his creepy, dogmatic socialist policies on the masses to teach them valuable lessons — both economic and cultural — about wokeness and progressivism, and more broadly its stranglehold on the Democratic Party. I’m starting to agree. Let the city sink into the abyss. Let Mamdani’s policies force out business and prod more upper- and middle-class residents to flee. Let the city declare bankruptcy — which will happen if Mamdani gets his way. We can then start from scratch. Detroit did it and the last time I was there, its downtown was pristine. Plus, we’re headed there anyway, right? Why not expedite the process and teach people who think leftism works that it doesn’t — particularly when you chase out all the non-leftists who pay the bills. To be clear, New York City isn’t Detroit. Sure, there’s diversification, businesses moving operations to Texas and Florida, but for all the work-from-home doom-and-gloom talk about New York City real estate, Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan is still headquartered in Midtown. Goldman Sachs remains on the West Side. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, is in Hudson Yards. NYU Langone is here, built through the grit of legendary financier Ken Langone, with world prestige and a quality of care to match. (I can personally attest to the latter.) The best restaurants are here: Try getting a table at ­Elio’s, Sistina or Rao’s. It’s still a cultural mecca, the home of Broadway, The Met and some great museums. For all our issues, New York City with a GDP of around $1.3 trillion has an economy bigger than many countries. We are also saddled, of course, with an insane political class. Zohran Mamdani might be honest in his Marxism, maybe boyishly naive in explaining the benefits of government-run grocery stores that have failed everywhere they were tried. (See most recently Kansas City.) But in this state, he is no outlier. He is emblematic of one-party rule, a fellow traveler in New York’s leftist Democratic Party that has brainwashed voters into believing we need massive regulation that impedes business formation. Ditto for rent control that creates housing shortages, lax policing (do you really feel safe on the streets of Manhattan, particularly at night?), high taxes (the reason so many people are leaving) and a fracking ban that continues to deprive economically depressed upstate regions. Dems have ditched New York’s melting pot in favor of woke and hostile tribalism. The largest concentration of Jews outside Israel, right here in New York City, must now accept daily harassment over leftists’ warped interpretation of history. And we must embrace ­unions, like the clown car that runs the school system. Consider: Sleepy Joe Biden’s immigration policies opened the floodgates for millions of migrants to come to this country.

Never miss a story. Many settled here in New York City, were housed in fancy hotels, and yet since 2020 NYC has witnessed a net out-migration of around 400,000 people. Put another way, a city’s worth of taxpayers left and was replaced by the world’s poor who are tapping into the city’s generous welfare state. Operationally, Andrew Cuomo could be a good mayor. He knows how to run things on both the state and national level. Yet consider his ill-fated last years as governor: He was forced to cave to the left on every issue, banned fracking, raised taxes and couldn’t tame the size of government. Could Eric Adams stand up to those clowns if he were to win — and not drop out as people now believe he will? He hasn’t so far. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa, the crime-fighting activist founder of the Guardian Angels, is tough as nails and, when you sit with him, very coherent on policy. Yet if through a stroke of divine intervention he were to be elected, he would be outnumbered 1,000 to 1. He needs the state Legislature to create reform on taxes and other issues, and that’s where the mini-Mamdanis reside. There and the New York City Council, which is a mini-politburo. That’s why I am now leaning ­toward the nuclear option. Let Mamdani win — and prove to New Yorkers and Americans once and for all that there’s a reason communism failed in the Soviet Union, and that the apparatchiks in China have embraced the free market to survive.

What was once met with skepticism and doubt is now universally accepted at the highest level. Despite the resistance, eventually everyone understands Bitcoin. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. It may take a minute to get to grips with magic internet money, but once you see the scarcity, durability, and predictability, it somehow all falls into place. From Jamie Dimon to Donald Trump, eventually everyone understands Bitcoin. Anthony Pompliano summed it up best, against an image of some high-profile personalities, including Donald Trump, Jamie Dimon, and Jerome Powell, who have changed their tune on the number-one coin. He said: “Eventually everyone understands bitcoin.” In the beginning, the idea of a decentralized digital currency was met with skepticism, derision, and sometimes outright hostility. Yet, as the years have passed, some of the world’s most influential voices from Wall Street to Washington have changed their tunes, making Bitcoin’s journey from a fringe obsession to a mainstream asset nothing short of historic. Take Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase. In 2017, he called Bitcoin a “fraud,” threatened to fire employees who traded it, and warned of government crackdowns. Fast-forward to the present, JPMorgan offers Bitcoin exposure to clients and Dimon regularly attends crypto panels. He’s critical of specifics, but his institution is deeply entrenched in blockchain finance. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink went from calling Bitcoin “an index of money laundering” to overseeing the world’s largest asset manager issuing a Bitcoin ETF and publicly referring to it as “digital gold.” Fink’s pivot stunned markets and signaled a shift in how legacy finance regards the new digital economy. Jerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, was also skeptical about crypto for years. Yet under his watch, the Fed now closely monitors Bitcoin, citing its relevance to global markets and even a “competitor to gold.” Donald Trump once dismissed Bitcoin as being highly volatile and based on thin air. But by 2024, Trump was reportedly courting crypto donors and acknowledging Bitcoin’s increasing significance, reflecting the asset’s growing political clout.

Stay connected via Michael Saylor, now synonymous with Bitcoin advocacy, wasn’t always a maximalist. Before 2020, Saylor publicly doubted Bitcoin’s longevity, calling its days “numbered” as far back as 2013. Now, his company MicroStrategy holds more BTC than any other publicly traded firm (over 636,000 coins) and Saylor has personally become its most famous evangelist. And Mark Cuban spent years calling Bitcoin no different from bananas and raising doubts about its utility. Today, he’s an active participant in the crypto and NFT ecosystems, holding Bitcoin and advising blockchain companies. In other words? Eventually, everyone understands Bitcoin. If the world’s biggest names can change their minds, so can entire governments. According to the Visual Capitalist, the United States is now the largest holder of Bitcoin, with China following closely. These holdings are often the result of law enforcement seizures or strategic mining, but the fact remains: global governments hold thousands (sometimes hundreds of thousands) of bitcoins, quietly shifting from outright bans to accumulation and research. Bitcoin’s path to mainstream acceptance has been paved with resistance and then recognition. Whether driven by economic imperatives, technological curiosity, or simply the fear of missing out, figures like Jamie Dimon and Donald Trump have finally come to the same realization: Bitcoin is here, and it is inevitable; even governments now hold Bitcoin as part of their strategic reserves. What was once met with skepticism and doubt is now universally accepted at the highest level, proving Pompliano right that, despite the resistance, eventually everyone understands Bitcoin.

Title: The Banks and the Unbanked: Blockchain’s Biggest Beneficiaries Sit at Both Ends of the Financial Spectrum

Capital markets are in flux. As evolving monetary policy casts a spotlight on a fragmented global economy, the stability of infrastructure for borderless transactions with digital assets stands out as a superior alternative to the traditional system. Blockchain is a viable solution to many of today’s financial challenges. Uniquely, its clearest beneficiaries are two distinctly different groups: financial institutions and the 1.4 billion people who are unbanked. The former gains next-generation speed and scalability while the latter benefits from newfound accessibility and equity. Our charge as builders of this industry, if we want to actualize blockchain’s full potential, is to account for the needs of both. While the financially marginalized have long sought solutions in bleeding-edge tech, the legacy world is just beginning to get the appeal. "We have to be thinking about how we leverage [blockchain] in our environment," said Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson recently, discussing how costs in asset management are up 80% in the last decade, while revenues are down 15%. Franklin Templeton's breakthrough illustrates this institutional awakening. Their first-ever tokenized money market fund reduces transaction costs from $1 to less than a penny – for an institution managing $1.7 trillion, the efficiency gains are transformative. But this institutional adoption does more than cut costs; it validates the infrastructure that can serve both boardrooms and the billions still excluded from traditional finance. The same blockchain rails enabling Franklin Templeton's efficiency gains can deliver $50 remittances from Dubai to the Philippines in seconds rather than several business days. The technology removes friction, whether you're settling $100 million in tokenized assets or sending $100 to family abroad. Major institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity and JPMorgan are proving blockchain's institutional viability at unprecedented scale. Aid organizations, such as the United Nations Refugee Agency, are simultaneously demonstrating its humanitarian potential, distributing assistance directly to those in need without traditional intermediaries. These parallel developments reflect blockchain's unique capacity to serve both efficiency and equity. The institutional momentum creates crucial infrastructure benefits for everyone. When major financial players invest in blockchain networks, they strengthen the rails that underbanked populations can also access. When regulatory frameworks emerge to support institutional adoption, they create legal clarity that benefits all users. Consider the numbers that drive both institutional interest and human need. Global transaction banking generates nearly $1.4 trillion in annual revenue, yet operational inefficiencies cost an estimated 8-10% of that revenue. For institutions, blockchain technology offers clear solutions to these challenges. For the unbanked, the stakes are different but equally compelling. Remittances – which exceeded $900 billion globally in 2024 – carry average fees of 6.62% worldwide, with some corridors reaching 10% or more. Working families lose billions annually to these costs. When a domestic worker sends $500 home, losing $50 to fees represents not inefficiency but genuine hardship. The convergence becomes clear: the same technology solving institutional inefficiencies can address human exclusion from the financial system. Blockchain networks processing transactions for fractions of a penny with 3-5 second settlement times serve both institutional treasuries and individual remittances equally well. Real-world stress tests prove blockchain's dual utility. In Argentina, where inflation reached 236.7% by late 2024, both institutions and individuals are embracing digital assets out of necessity. Data shows 61.8% of Argentina's crypto transactions now involve stablecoins — not as speculation, but as economic survival tools preserving purchasing power against peso devaluation. This crisis-driven adoption reveals blockchain's fundamental value proposition: removing dependence on fragile intermediaries and national monetary systems. Whether you're a fund manager hedging institutional exposure or a family protecting savings, the infrastructure provides the same essential service: stable, borderless value transfer. The infrastructure exists. Modern blockchain networks have processed tens of billions of operations, serving millions of accounts worldwide. The technology handles institutional scale while remaining accessible to individual users. But actualizing blockchain's full potential requires intentional design for both audiences. This means building interfaces sophisticated enough for institutional treasury management yet simple enough for first-time users. It means creating compliance frameworks that satisfy regulatory requirements while preserving accessibility for underserved populations. Success requires partnerships spanning both worlds – working with established financial institutions to build robust infrastructure while partnering with mobile money operators, community organizations, and fintech companies serving underbanked populations. The goal isn't choosing between efficiency and equity, but achieving both simultaneously. Blockchain's unique promise lies precisely in its ability to serve these seemingly different constituencies with the same fundamental infrastructure. The networks enabling pension funds to tokenize assets can help farmers access credit. The rails facilitating institutional settlement can deliver humanitarian aid directly to refugees. As builders, our responsibility extends beyond technological capability to purposeful implementation. We must ensure that institutional adoption strengthens rather than supplants financial inclusion efforts. We must design systems that leverage institutional resources to extend access rather than create new barriers. The infrastructure for borderless, frictionless value transfer is ready.

Title: Larry Fink Ascends to WEF Throne: BlackRock’s Puppet Master Takes Command of the Globalist Enslavement Machine

Editor Empire Whatfinger In a chilling development that exposes the deepening tentacles of the globalist elite, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has elevated BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to the position of interim co-chairman of its board, alongside André Hoffmann of Roche. This move, announced on August 15, 2025, comes hot on the heels of an internal investigation that conveniently cleared WEF founder Klaus Schwab of any “material wrongdoing” despite swirling allegations of financial and ethical misconduct. Fink, the architect of BlackRock’s $11 trillion empire that dominates everything from housing markets to corporate boardrooms, now sits at the helm of an organization long accused of plotting humanity’s subjugation under the guise of “sustainable development” and the infamous “Great Reset.” For years, patriots and truth-seekers have warned about the WEF’s sinister agenda: a technocratic dystopia where the masses own nothing, eat bugs, and live as digital serfs in smart cities monitored by AI overlords. Reminder – Larry Fink admits the quiet part out loud: “You have to force behaviors.” BlackRock’s CEO—WEF darling & architect of the ESG regime—spells out the real agenda: Social engineering by corporate coercion. No “incremental change.” No organic diversity. Just top-down mandates, dictating who gets hired, promoted, or funded based on race, gender, & ideological compliance. This isn’t “stakeholder capitalism.” It’s elite-driven control. And if you resist? You’ll “be impacted.” The organization’s ties to depopulation schemes—echoing the eerie Georgia Guidestones’ call for reducing the world’s population to a mere 500 million—have fueled conspiracies that the elite view billions of us as expendable “useless eaters.” Now, with Fink in charge, these fears are no longer fringe theories but a glaring reality. As one X user aptly put it, “The evil of the WEF that wants all of mankind enslaved, and reduced to 500 million people world-wide, guess who is now their leader? BlackRock’s Larry Fink.” Klaus Schwab’s reign at the WEF has been a masterclass in elite manipulation. Founded in 1971, the Davos cabal has masqueraded as a “platform for public-private cooperation” while pushing policies that erode national sovereignty and empower unelected bureaucrats. Schwab’s “stakeholder capitalism”—a euphemism for corporate fascism—has been championed by figures like Fink, who led the U.S. Business Roundtable in 2019 to redefine corporate purpose around this very ideology. But beneath the polished speeches lies a darker truth: allegations of harassment, financial impropriety, and a toxic culture that led to Schwab’s ousting. The WEF’s board, stacked with globalist heavyweights like Al Gore, Christine Lagarde, and now Fink himself, held an emergency meeting to whitewash these claims, declaring only “minor irregularities.” Even Schwab’s wife Hilde was implicated, yet the elite protect their own, ensuring the agenda marches on uninterrupted. Fink’s ascension is no accident; it’s the culmination of BlackRock’s insidious influence. As CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, Fink controls stakes in virtually every major corporation, wielding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria as a weapon to enforce woke policies and climate hysteria. Critics have blasted ESG as a “social credit system for corporations,” forcing companies to prioritize globalist goals over American interests. BlackRock’s push into housing markets, buying up single-family homes en masse, aligns perfectly with the WEF’s “you’ll own nothing and be happy” mantra—renting from corporate overlords while the elite hoard wealth. And let’s not forget Fink’s cozy ties to governments: during the COVID-19 scam, BlackRock advised central banks on bailouts, facilitating the greatest wealth transfer in history from Main Street to Wall Street. The depopulation angle is where the conspiracy turns truly diabolical. Fink has openly mused about “substituting humans for machines” in countries with declining populations, a chilling endorsement of automation that renders billions obsolete.This dovetails with WEF-linked narratives on “decarbonization requiring depopulation,” where climate zealots like Bill Gates and the elite push for fewer people to “save the planet.” The Great Reset, unveiled in 2020, isn’t about recovery—it’s a blueprint for control, leveraging pandemics, climate scares, and economic chaos to impose digital IDs, CBDCs, and universal basic income as chains on the masses. Fink’s BlackRock has funneled billions into “green” initiatives, profiting from the destruction of fossil fuels while ordinary folks face skyrocketing energy costs. Conspiratorial voices have long connected the dots: BlackRock’s infiltration of governments, from advising Zelenskyy on Ukraine’s reconstruction to schmoozing with leftist leaders like UK’s Keir Starmer and Australia’s Anthony Albanese. Starmer, a WEF acolyte, has slashed winter fuel payments for millions while releasing prisoners early—policies that reek of Agenda 2030’s disdain for the working class. In Canada, WEF darling Mark Carney eyes the premiership, promising more climate tyranny and CBDCs. These puppets serve Fink’s vision: a world where BlackRock owns the assets, the WEF sets the rules, and humanity is culled to sustainable levels. Patriots are sounding the alarm. One X post warns, “They are bringing out the big guns…. They don’t think the patriots will try to bring the WEF down with the head of world investments as their leader.” Another declares the WEF a “terrorist organization,” echoing calls to classify it as such. Fink’s critics point to his “forced behavior” tactics, using finance to alter government policies without democratic accountability. Even in the face of backlash—states like Florida ditching BlackRock over ESG extremism—Fink doubles down, complaining that criticism has become “personal and ugly.” The WEF’s “Young Global Leaders” program has churned out compliant tyrants like Justin Trudeau and Emmanuel Macron, all marching to the tune of Fink’s orchestra. With Fink now co-chairing, expect accelerated pushes for bio-engineering humans to be allergic to meat, mandatory vaccines, and surveillance states—all in the name of “climate action.” As one truth-seeker notes, “Billionaire Larry Fink is an extinctionist, an eugenicist and a misanthrope like Bill Gates… They share a desire to reduce the world population from around 8 Billion down to 500 million.” This isn’t just about economics; it’s spiritual warfare against freedom-loving people. The elite’s blueprint—exposed in leaks and admissions—aims to enslave us through debt, dependency, and division. But resistance is growing. From Trump supporters to everyday Americans, the call is clear: dismantle the WEF, audit BlackRock, and reclaim sovereignty. As Fink and his cronies plot in Davos shadows, patriots must unite to expose and defeat this cabal before it’s too late. The fight for humanity’s soul is on—will you own nothing, or own the truth?

Title: Musk holds hostage history’s biggest meme stock delusion
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/06/elon-musk-1-trillion-compensation-pay-package-tesla-shareholders-governance/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. Elon Musk has once again captured media attention. This time, however, it isn’t a rogue X rant or embittered comments about President Trump’s abuse of executive authority. Instead, a proposed $1 trillion pay package crafted by Tesla’s board and Musk has grabbed headlines. The proposed scheme is ludicrous not only in terms of the highly aspirational 12 milestones that would unlock the benefits, but also in terms of good governance practice. Even needing to support 14 children with four different mothers, how much capital does Musk need? The argument that Musk needs additional incentive to lead Tesla to new heights runs entirely counter to the fact that he owns nearly 20% of the company’s outstanding shares and will already be well rewarded from any upside in the company’s performance. If Tesla were to achieve an $8.5 trillion market cap, as outlined by one of the pay package milestones, Musk would be worth over $1.6 trillion, based on that current ownership stake. Musk is the richest person in the world (or second if you believe that number one is Vladimir Putin), and nearly twice as wealthy as the individuals ranked third and fourth, Larry Ellison and Mark Zuckerberg, respectively. Estimated to be worth over $437 billion, none of Musk’s lifestyle, resources, or influence will meaningfully change from any material increase in wealth. After threatening to walk away from Tesla earlier this year, Musk received a $30 billion pay package after a federal judge denied him a $50 billion package. It is shameful for Musk to now be holding shareholders hostage to suit his need for power. Renowned founders such as Bernie Marcus of Home Depot, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Michael Dell of Dell Technologies, Steve Schwarzman of Blackstone, Sam Walton of Walmart, and Larry Fink of BlackRock never fabricated shakedown strategies like this to regain more control of their companies after they went public. Moreover, should Musk act on his threat and leave Tesla, he would be the biggest loser as the largest shareholder of the biggest meme stock in financial market history. Tesla has a P/E ratio of over 200x, compared to the world’s most valuable company, Nvidia, at nearly 50x, so a 50% drop in the existing Tesla market cap of $1.1 trillion would result in a $110 billion loss in paper wealth, a quarter of Musk’s estimated worth. The performance milestones in the proposed pay package are both illusional and delusional. According to the proposal, Tesla is required to deliver 20 million vehicles, a significant increase from the 1.8 million delivered in 2024. The company must also distribute one million robots. They have not even developed a fully functional humanoid robot. Additional benchmarks require one million robotaxis to be placed into commercial operation, versus 30 on the roads today, and 10 million subscribers for its Full Self Driving service, compared to approximately 1 million in 2024. Most jarring are the mandates for the company to more than double the $4 trillion market cap of Nvidia and to notch $400 billion of adjusted EBITDA, versus $16.65 billion in 2024. Despite the absurdity of the performance package, the federal government does not need to intervene, as it has been so inclined to do lately. If stockholders do not like the proposed pay package, then they will vote against the proposal or sell their stock holdings. Of course, shareholders, not the government, should be asking important questions—of which there are many—about the necessity for such a rich payout and high ownership stake. One of those burning questions: If Musk preferred maintaining so much control, then why did he take Tesla public? The centrality of the chief executive to the success of the company is far more symbolic in the eyes of tech bros than it is substantive in the eyes of the average customer. In fact, as of late, he has been the most detrimental factor to the Tesla sales pipeline, which is on track to fall for the second year in a row. Sales in Europe have notably fallen by 40% year-over-year, ceding its dominant market position to Chinese EV automaker BYD for the first time. The Chinese market has been just as challenging for Tesla, which has experienced repeated sales declines over several months this year and has yielded more than half its market share to competitors since 2021. Many Tesla enthusiasts would be surprised to know that Musk did not create Tesla, but he squeezed out its first CEO, co-founder Martin Eberhard, along with Tesla’s other co-founder Marc Tarpenning. They were the ones who named the company for the brilliant, penniless inventor of alternating currents, wireless remote controls, and X-rays in 2003. The plunging sales of Telsa have been directly linked to a global consumer backlash after Musk’s endorsement of the German AFD party — considered a Nazi apologist group — and a U.S. consumer backlash against his DOGE initiative, a tornado of cruel, dangerous, self-interested destruction of vital federal agencies, in partisan service to President Trump. While Musk may be the greatest inventor of our time, his magic wand is overhyped. Most of his private companies, such as Neuralink, The Boring Company, X/Twitter, and SolarCity, have been a bust or seen lackluster performance. Solar City was a failure that got jammed down the throats of unrelated Tesla shareholders. It would take a lot of nerve to celebrate the delayed success of Neuralink. X/Twitter’s value collapsed after Musk took control. At least there is truth in advertising for the Boring Company. It lives up to its name by failing to connect the scores of cities with high speed tunnels that were promised years ago. SpaceX has seen success primarily due to a stable flow of government contracts and subsidies, and the steady operating hand of President and Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell. xAI has potential but its Grok chatbot raised many concerns when it began spewing pro-Nazi/Hitler and antisemitic pronouncements soon after Musk tampered with the large language model’s algorithm. The board is suffering from what political scientists and psychologists call “groupthink,” psychiatrists label folie à deux, social workers call “codependence,” and normal people recognize as an infatuation with a charismatic, cultish powerful figure. We have seen this happen before at Viacom with Sumner Redstone and CBS with Bill Paley. We’ve seen it with Ken Olsen at Digital Equipment Corporation, once the world’s second-largest tech company but no longer in business. And we saw it with Juan Trippe at Pan American World Airways, the now-defunct pioneer of transoceanic travel that was once America’s flagship carrier. The original nationwide coffee house pioneer, William Black, ran the Chock full O’Nuts chain that he founded into his mid-80s when he was flat on his back in the hospital while his full-time physician and lifelong friend served as the president. Those boards followed such charismatic CEOs, who lived on the edge, until they ran right off the cliff.

Title: Ether ETFs see $788M in outflows: what’s going on?

US-based spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw four straight days of net outflows during the shortened trading week following Labor Day, reversing some of the momentum that had built up in August. The funds shed a total of $787.6 million between Tuesday and Friday, with the sharpest move on Friday when $446.8 million exited the products, according to data from Farside. Over the same period, Bitcoin ETFs saw $250.3 million in net inflows. The weekly reversal comes after a strong August for Ether ETFs, which attracted $3.87 billion in inflows. Bitcoin ETFs, in contrast, recorded $751 million in outflows during the month. Despite the recent weakness, several market participants remain bullish on Ether’s outlook. On Wednesday, BitMine chairman Tom Lee reiterated his forecast that ETH could eventually reach $60,000. Speaking on the Medici Presents: Level Up podcast, he said Wall Street’s growing interest in the token could become a “1971 moment” for the asset, a reference to the US ending the gold standard and ushering in a new financial era. BitMine is the largest Ether treasury company, holding about $8.04 billion worth of ETH, according to data from StrategicETHReserve. Collectively, Ether treasury companies now control 2.97% of the token’s circulating supply, valued at $15.49 billion at the time of publication. Supporting that outlook, blockchain analytics firm Santiment noted that large Ether holders have steadily increased their positions. Wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH — worth between $4.31 million and $430.63 million — have grown their balances by 14% since April, when ETH touched yearly lows. “In exactly 5 months, they have added 14.0% more coins,” Santiment said in a post on X. The firm suggested that the accumulation trend could provide underlying support for the asset even as ETF flows fluctuate. Ether traded at $4,313 on Saturday, while Bitcoin stood at $110,238. The diverging ETF flows highlight shifting sentiment between the two largest cryptocurrencies as traders weigh the impact of macroeconomic conditions, regulatory clarity, and institutional adoption. While short-term flows have turned negative, Ether’s strong August performance and continued interest from institutional players suggest that investors remain divided on whether the latest moves mark a pause or the start of a broader rotation back into Bitcoin.

Please let us know Topic:Company News Elon Musk has been offered one of the largest CEO payment packages in history. (Reuters: Hamad I Mohammed) Tesla's board has proposed a $US1 trillion ($1.52 trillion) compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk in what would be the largest corporate pay package in history. The move underscores the hold Mr Musk has over the car maker as it attempts to transform into an AI and robotics powerhouse. Here's what we know about the package. Elon Musk will need to increase Tesla's value eightfold. (ABC News: Daniel Mercer) The proposed plan would grant Mr Musk up to 12 per cent of Tesla's stock, worth about $US1.03 trillion if the company hits its target market value of $US8.6 trillion. The plan requires boosting Tesla's valuation nearly eightfold, or about $US7.5 trillion, over the next decade. To get his first package of shares equivalent to 1 per cent of the company, Mr Musk would have to convince investors in the stock market that Tesla is worth $US2 trillion in total, double what they value it today, and also hit several other milestones. To receive all the shares offered and make him the world's first trillion-dollar man would require that market value to then rise to $US8.6 trillion, double that of the world's most valuable company now, chipmaker Nvidia. Among other goals, sales of all Tesla vehicles would eventually also have to reach 20 million, nearly triple its entire sales since it was founded more than two decades ago. To increase Tesla's value the company will need to sell 20 million vehicles. (AP Photo: Julio Cortez) Mr Musk would also have to vastly expand Tesla's robot and robotaxi businesses by selling a million of the bots and a million of the driverless cabs, the latter a business that has only begun to roll out its taxi service and is behind rivals, such as Waymo. Mr Musk would also need to remain with Tesla for at least seven and a half years to cash out on any stock, and 10 years to earn the full amount. If fully earned, the award would materially increase Mr Musk's voting power from his roughly 13 per cent stake, intensifying debate over governance and succession. Tesla emphasised that Mr Musk would receive no salary or cash bonus, with all compensation linked to performance. The package is designed to keep Mr Musk from leaving and is squarely focused on transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence and robotics powerhouse, the board said in a securities filing. It said Mr Musk is the only person on the planet who can unlock Tesla's full potential. Mr Musk has been criticised as being distracted from Tesla. Elon Musk's willingness to challenge Donald Trump has raised concerns at Tesla. His foray into party politics and his willingness to challenge President Donald Trump had heightened concerns among Tesla investors and analysts about potential distractions and had previously fuelled talk about looking for a new chief. In July, Mr Musk announced plans to launch a third political party, the "America Party", following a public clash with Trump over a tax cut and government spending bill. Tesla's board has urged shareholders to vote against a proposal calling for a political neutrality policy, which would have expanded board oversight of Mr Musk's political activities. Yes, and Mr Musk is likely to get it at the company's annual meeting in November. That is because it was crafted with an eye on keeping Mr Musk in place, addressing concerns about the company's technical outlook and giving big company owners just enough reason to back the massive amount, investors and executive pay analysts said. The pay plan is by far the largest ever for any CEO. And while it is likely to face legal challenges, compensation experts see it winning shareholder approval. "Time and time again, Tesla's shareholders have approved these grants over the years," Equilar research director Courtney Yu said. None of Tesla's three largest outside investors, Vanguard Group, BlackRock or State Street, immediately said how they would vote. Among them, Vanguard and BlackRock supported Mr Musk's $56 billion pay package last year, disclosures show, while State Street funds voted against it. Tesla and top funds can still expect pressure over the pay, however, with several union figures and public-sector treasurers voicing concern. Union figures and public-sector treasurers have voiced concerns about the proposed payment. (AP: Jose Luis Magana) "We urge shareholders to reject Musk's money grab, take away the Tesla board's rubber stamp, and restore basic corporate governance standards," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, in a statement. Kristin Hull, founder and chief investment officer of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, called the package irresponsible. "This is investor money that could go into R&D or acquisitions, places that would really benefit Tesla in the long term," she said, adding that she is considering a challenge with other shareholders. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called Mr Musk a visionary but said the pay plan was excessive and could set a bad precedent in corporate governance. He questioned whether Mr Musk was worth that much. "He also presides over a company that has lost its edge, is being overtaken by rivals, and whose brand has been tarnished by Musk's actions outside of Tesla," he said. Last year, Tesla reincorporated in Texas after a judge in its former corporate home, Delaware, ruled a $US56 billion compensation for the CEO was "unfathomable" and unfair to shareholders. Mr Musk urged companies to ditch Delaware and his board worked on a new pay package. A judge has ruled that Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $86.6 billion compensation package even though shareholders of the electric vehicle company had voted to reinstate it earlier this year. Last year, the company's shareholders voted to "ratify" Mr Musk's 2018 pay package in an attempt to essentially undo the court ruling and restore Mr Musk's pay package. Mr Musk will be able to vote about 411 million shares at this year's shareholder meeting, nearly outweighing the 529 million shares that voted against ratification. In the end, the ratification vote did not matter because the Delaware judge ruled it did not override her prior decision. That ruling and her ruling striking Mr Musk's $US56 billion compensation are on appeal. In 2018, the company barred Mr Musk from voting his shares to make it harder for investors to sue under Delaware law. Now Tesla does not need to do that because it has much better protection from legal challenges thanks to laws in Texas.

Title: Virgin Media presenter Katja Mia: ‘I get scared, I worry about the people I care about. These are weird times’

Full Content:
When Dublin TV presenter, influencer and model Katja Mia was doing the Leaving Cert more than a decade ago, she plastered the study area in the Blanchardstown family home with motivational quotes from the likes of Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela. “I was not blessed academically, I was one of those people who had to work really hard to get just above average,” she says. “I had all these quotes posted up everywhere, I’d write down the number of points I wanted to get so I could see them.” She was manifesting before manifesting became a thing? “I suppose I was,” she laughs. “But I also studied for hours and hours. Nothing came easily.” While it’s been an often-derided TikTok trend for a few years now, manifesting – the idea that our thoughts and actions can positively influence what we accomplish – has actually been a thing for a while. There’s a Sanskrit text called Rigveda from 3,500 years ago containing hymns that suggest that by focusing on our hopes and dreams we can influence personal destiny. At any rate, the presenter is something of a poster girl for the trend. From a family of Burundian immigrants a combination of ambition, determination, hard work, luck and – scoff if you like – manifesting eventually landed her her dream job presenting the Six O’Clock Show on Virgin Media. We’re talking in the boardroom of the television station before she goes to studio to record the hour-long live show. She’s wearing black athleisure wear and there’s a large - “lab grown” she qualifies - diamond engagement ring sparkling on her finger. In a couple of weeks, she’ll go to Burundi, in east Africa, for the first time in 15 years to take part in a traditional “dot” engagement ceremony in front of 300 family and friends. It will be a chance for her fiancé and boyfriend of eight years, Daragh Curran, an influencer called The Guinness Guru who specialises in tasting pints of the black stuff all over the world, to meet her extended family. Having grown up in Dublin she’s looking forward to immersing herself in the culture of her parent’s homeland, royal Burundian drummers and traditional costumes included. “I’m embracing all of it,” she smiles. Her mother Carinie is all over the arrangements. The wedding next year will be an Irish one. “We’ll do our own thing for that,” she says. The goal, as she grew up, was financial security, which explains the motivational quotes and commitment to her studies. She was born in Germany, in 1996, after her parents sought refuge there from the civil war in Burundi, a protracted conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups, which killed an estimated 300,000 people from 1993 to 2005. Her uncle had been murdered in a grenade and knife attack in the former Belgian colony and “there was a threat to my dad’s family in particular so he had to flee the country”. [ Festive and funny tales with Thalia Heffernan, Katja Mia, Killian Sundermann and moreOpens in new window ] The family spent a couple of years in a village near Frankfurt but when they went to get their visa renewed it was denied. The family’s difficulties in Germany were compounded by the racism they were subjected to by neo-Nazis. Unable to return to Burundi, the family came to Ireland as undocumented immigrants. She was only 17 months old when they moved to Dublin, first settling in Blackrock. The Department of Justice initially refused their application for asylum on the grounds that they had made their original application in Germany. Threatened with deportation she says her father Joseph was given assistance in his campaign for his family to stay in Ireland by “some excellent people” including former Irish Times journalist Andy Pollak. “My dad saw him talking on a news programme one day and looked up his number in the phone book,” she says. Later, I find an Irish Times news report from 1998 about the family’s experience in Germany and the racist abuse they suffered there. “It was torture,” her mother Carinie told Irish Times reporter Paul Cullen back then. “We had already left one form of atrocious situation, [in Burundi] and now we were in another. We were just looking for somewhere calm, where our children can grow up and be integrated in society.” Eventually, they were given leave to remain in Ireland and got their Irish passports. They instilled positive affirmations in us about being black from a really young age Her parents’ experience as immigrants has had a significant influence on the presenter. “I was always aware of their struggle. They were educated but English is not their first language so they had to start from the bottom and I witnessed that.” Joseph and Carinie, who also speak French, encouraged their four children to speak English at home instead of Kirundi, the official language of Burundi, so that they would have a better chance of integrating. Her mother worked in a supermarket and her father, now a taxi driver, had two jobs at one point. “I would see him come home from one shift and put on his uniform for a second job. I think when I saw that it really instilled a work ethic and made me put my head down. They came here for me to have a better life. They didn’t want me to struggle. When you see people struggle it makes you want to go after security and financial stability”. The family moved from Blackrock to Usher’s Quay in the city centre and then to Lucan where she attended primary and secondary school even after the family eventually settled in Blanchardstown. “Growing up I always felt Irish, I sang Irish songs, did Irish dancing, on Brigid’s Day we celebrated Nano Nagle. When you are migrating to a new country, integrating is everything, especially for kids.” Every Monday afternoon from the age of six she’d go to a stage school in Lucan where she thrived - dancing and singing in shows. It wasn’t until the move to Blanchardstown that the family became victims of racist attacks. “We were the first black family on our council estate. There were a lot of teenagers coming to our house, throwing eggs at our windows, breaking my mum’s car door on a weekly basis. It was a kind of torment, to be honest.” “I remember vividly one day being egged by a group of boys, and I was only 11 or 12, I had my uniform on and I was just drenched in eggs ... you have to reassure yourself that people are ignorant, they’re doing it out of fear and you should not waste your energy trying to defend yourself because you’ve nothing to defend. “And I think it stood to me, because even now, working in media, it’s inevitable that you’re going to get comments, people that don’t like you for whatever reason, whether it’s the dress you’re wearing your make-up or whatever.” This resilience was modelled by her parents who changed the narrative when it came to their four children. “They instilled positive affirmations in us about being black from a really young age. They’d tell me: ‘You have amazing skin, you are a descendant of the Tutsi tribe, you are beautiful, be proud’.” When it came to choosing her career path, despite her love of performing, her need for security led her to pursue finance. The motivational quotes paid off. She got enough points for a finance and economics degree from Maynooth University and went into banking as a depository analyst working in funds. In the pandemic, she began a remote job in Bank of America but she wasn’t happy. “I was lost,” she says of her time in the corporate world. “I had no passion. I didn’t know what I was doing. I even started praying about it.” By now manifesting was everywhere. “I read the books, I listened to podcasts and I started posting on Instagram almost as a tool to throw s**t at the wall and see what stuck”. She began curating her feed “in a fun, aesthetic way” building an audience. When a friend needed a presenter for a music show in Swords, she nervously accepted. “It was a nine or 10-hour day but it felt like about 10 minutes because I was having the time of my life. I just thought, how can I make this a job?” There are people on TikTok saying, ‘Ireland is for the Irish’. People get angry at me, telling me: ‘You’re not Irish’ She had grown up admiring presenters like Kathryn Thomas and Martin King “who I ended up working with”. She’d watch E! News all the time. “I was obsessed with television culture, but I had no idea how to get into it ... then a friend sent me a link to a competition for online presenters and I ended up winning it.” The competition, to be a brand ambassador for Love Island presenter Maya Jama’s skincare range Mij Masks, was open to people across the UK and Ireland. It was the break she was hoping for and led to Virgin Media getting in touch. She began there as a contributor, moving to hosting on Weekend AM with Martin King. At one stage, when Ireland AM presenter Muireann O’Connell was on holiday, she got a call to replace her for three shows. “That was just wild to me. My whole family was jumping on the bed. It’s a three-hour live show. I’ll never forget that moment.” Eventually, she was named as the new permanent host with Brian Dowling of the station’s Six O’Clock Show. That was in November 2023, less than two years after landing her first presenting job. “Ideally, in a dream world, I would have done a degree in media and journalism, naturally I still feel impostor syndrome, but I learn from people, I learn by making mistakes. It worked out the way it worked out and I have so much backing in Virgin Media, I’ve been really supported.” [ We cannot police the streets if online material is not regulatedOpens in new window ] In the meantime she had been spotted by a modelling scout on Instagram, which she calls “the modern day CV for creatives”, and was a “curvy” model for a few years. Last year, when she was one of the celebrities competing in Dancing With the Stars, she received abusive messages about her size. “I got comments about whether my dance partner could lift me, people saying: ‘She’s a disgrace’.” Did the abuse affect Katja? “Absolutely, it did,” she says. “I would find myself on rehearsal days looking at playback, focusing on how big my thighs looked instead of my dance form. I have to say, once I shared the horrible comments there was so much support”. She has spoken of dealing with endometriosis and says her weight has always fluctuated. Of the abuse she says: “I have the tools to deal with it, I just needed to reinforce those positive affirmations. And my family were amazing. They just thought it was cool that I was dancing on TV.” Inevitably, given her backstory, we talk for a while about the rise of anti-immigration sentiment and the “Ireland is full” protests around the country. She is thoughtfulon the subject. “It’s conflicting,” she says. “I am a young person living in Ireland, I know it’s tough.” “I have a friend coming home from Australia with her boyfriend and they are finding it so hard to find somewhere to live. I understand that people are in a difficult position and when things get hard people look for people to blame. And the easiest targets are the newbies, the immigrants, the people who don’t sound like you or look like you.” [ Manifesting is the perfect religion for our times. But does it work?Opens in new window ] She says she hates “it’s come to that” because she immediately thinks of her parents. “They still have accents, when they talk they don’t sound Irish even though they’ve been here for so long. They are easy targets. I am someone with black skin. I know that just walking around without someone hearing my Dublin accent, I will be judged. “Something could happen to me. So I hate that black and brown people, any people of colour in Ireland, are in danger and have to worry about abusive and racist rhetoric and also physical violence.” The “conflict” she feels on the issue is about the challenges many people in this country face. “I’ve lived in Ireland my whole life. I pay taxes in this country, but I know when the time comes around when I get married and I want to look for a house, it’s going to be incredibly difficult, even though I work hard and I know other people are working hard too.” “People just want a better life for themselves. But at the same time, it’s not the fault of immigrants who are just trying to blend and integrate into a country,” she says. “It’s the fault of a Government that needs to do better. The pressure should lie with the Government to create resources for people who are struggling with the socio-economic situation, who can’t get houses. They need to be the ones to create a solution.” I feel like it’s very taboo to say, but I am someone who really wants to create a comfortable life for myself and stability for my family I ask how she feels being asked about this subject. Does it get wearying? “Every time I talk about it, and I’ve talked about it a lot, it always comes with a certain amount of hate. So I’ve become more apprehensive. There are people on TikTok saying, ‘Ireland is for the Irish’. People get angry at me, telling me: ‘You’re not Irish’. They say: ‘You’re a diversity hire’. They say all these crazy things so I’ve drawn back on it a bit”. But does she feel it’s important to speak out? “Yes, especially now seeing the attacks on Indian people, it’s heartbreaking. I grew up with Indian friends in my class and Pakistani friends. They’ve been here for years. And the new people should be welcomed too because at the end of the day we’re citizens of the world. The Irish history of migration in Australia, in Canada and in America is well known and there is never any issue with that. It’s clearly a skin colour issue and that’s what makes me upset.” In 2020, attending a protest against the murder of George Floyd by police in America, she told an Irish Times reporter that watching the footage of Mr Floyd’s death made her think of her father and brother. “My dad has such a gentle soul and to think that someone would look at him and perceive him as violent from the colour of his skin is absolutely outrageous. We’re protesting here for George Floyd but also for every black person who has gone through discrimination.” Now, she says: “My dad is a taxi driver, I get afraid for him when he is out at night because these people seem to have this new-found confidence to be blatantly racist and they think it’s okay to hurt people like that. So I get upset and I get scared, I worry about the people I care about. These are weird times.” On a more positive note, she’s happy to see things moving, however slowly, in terms of increased representation and participation of people of colour in Irish society. “I feel like it is slowly changing in a natural, unforced way. What you are seeing is the second generation of immigrants growing up and choosing careers like presenting or being make-up artists, there are more of us in the creative industries. “I think traditionally there was a lot of pressure to be, like, a doctor or a lawyer. But we also need to have visual representation in creative spaces too. And I think slowly we’re getting that.” In many ways, she is still the industrious Leaving Cert student, pushing herself forward to the next thing. She’s still manifesting, still dreaming. “I’ve had to back myself and be like: this is what you asked for, what you dreamt of, so work hard, open your ears, learn”. She’ll turn 30 next year. There’s a wedding to plan. What are her latest goals? “I feel like it’s very taboo to say, but I am someone who really wants to create a comfortable life for myself and stability for my family. It’s always at the back of my mind, it goes beyond myself. I have dreams of buying a home for my family one day, and of having the life that I always dreamed of in Ireland, especially growing up through struggle,” she says. “It’s made me hyper-ambitious and focused on having security in life. I have a job that really drives me, a job I’m very lucky to say I love.I’ve met amazing people and the dream is just to continue doing something like this. If I can have longevity in this industry, then I’ll be very happy.” Katja Mia presents The Six O’Clock Show with Brian Dowling every weekday on Virgin Media © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: We Are Becoming A Nation Of...: HDFC AMC's Navneet Munot On India's 'Multi-Pronged Growth Model'

The rapid pace of economic reforms by the government, including tax cuts, GST (Goods and Services Tax) reductions and liquidity measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has created a wave of optimism about India’s growth trajectory, according to Navneet Munot, Managing Director and CEO of HDFC Asset Management Company (AMC). He lauded the government's economic strategy, describing it as a combination of "policy prudence, agile execution and effective communication" that sets India apart on the global stage. “India has been a nation of savers for generations. What we are doing now is becoming a nation of investors. If you are astute, you would take a long-term view of India. It is going to be a multi-pronged growth model rather than a very narrow set of growth models most of the other countries have seen,” he said during a conversation with NDTV Profit on Friday. He said that India has become 'Atmanirbhar' (self-reliant) in its capital markets, while acknowledging the importance of the inflow of foreign funds. “I won't say that we don't need foreign savings. I think our investment needs are humongous. We need more foreign flows for sure. And at some stage, it's likely to come both in the form of FDI as well as in the form of FPI.” He contrasted India's approach with that of major economies like the United States, highlighting a fundamental difference in philosophy. “On one side, you are seeing increasing tariffs and putting more burden on the consumers... On the other side, what India is doing is, I want to give more benefit to the larger section of the society," he said. He described this as the 'Bahujan Hitai, Bahujan Sukhai' (for the welfare and happiness of the masses) philosophy, starkly different from policies that favour tax cuts for the wealthy while imposing tariffs that ultimately hurt consumers. Munot cited recent measures like personal income tax relief, GST rate cuts and RBI’s liquidity injections as steps to stimulate consumption and credit growth. “It is not only about cutting rates and paying less taxes. It's also about like Chanakya said that the government should take taxes the way a butterfly gently takes nectar,” the top executive said. Munot was bullish on India’s potential to produce global-scale asset managers akin to Blackstone or BlackRock. “Several of those businesses are managing hundreds of billions in alternatives and trillions in public markets. Over a period of time, as this economy grows from $4 trillion to $40 trillion in our lifetime, you will see asset managers in India talking about that size,” he said. Highlighting India’s importance for the world, he said, “This is where 18% of humanity is. This is where the youngest population in the world is. We will be the biggest supplier of labour force to the world for the next several decades. So, you have to ensure that you take full advantage of that demographic dividend.” Shares of HDFC Asset Management Company closed 0.44% higher at Rs 5,594 apiece on the NSE, while the benchmark Nifty50 ended 0.03% up at 24,741.

Title: Jio BlackRock CEO: Data-driven approach with fund manager insights sets us apart

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Jio BlackRock Asset Management Company is all set to launch its first actively managed fund, a flexicap fund, on 23 September. The AMC is an equal joint venture between Jio Financial Services and global investment giant BlackRock. What sets it apart from other funds? According to Sid Swaminathan, CEO of Jio BlackRock AMC, it has a data-driven approach using BlackRock’s Aladdin software with insights from human fund managers. The fund house also has the benefit of Jio's large distribution ecosystem, which allows it to focus on direct-only plans for now. In this interview, Swaminathan talks about the fund's plans, AI-driven products and more. Edited excerpts:Can you walk us through the overall plan that you have for unfolding Jio BlackRock AMC? With BlackRock bringing its tech platform, Aladdin, to India, asset managers can do everything in a very scalable, operationally safe manner. We also have our partner Jio, which allows us to access customers at scale in the digital ecosystem. Our platform in BlackRock, systematic active equity (SAE), is a quantitative data-driven AI machine learning approach to equity investing. A computer does all the data crunching for you, and then you have the fund managers who can overlay some specific insights on it. You can then input all of this into Aladdin. Next, run a portfolio-level optimisation using the risk model and an India-specific risk model built for the joint venture to generate a portfolio recommendation. If you aim to outperform a flexicap fund using these insights by X percent annually, with Y amount of risk relative to that benchmark, here is a suggested portfolio. What about your products and their rollout? We have launched three institutional-focused cash funds to start with. We are very happy with the kind of start that we got, and also the retail participation…about 67,000 investors in the first three NFOs since July. We have also looked at the index funds. So again, in a way, bread and butter for BlackRock. The third set of funds in phase one will be more leaning towards the active side, with flexicap as the first one. Some fund houses are more tilted towards growth, and some towards value. Is there an overarching philosophy for you? The overarching philosophy is that it's a data-driven approach. It allows us to use and leverage the data in many ways. For example, for this flexicap fund that we are going to launch, the fund managers will typically look to generate the alpha purely through stock selection. Now the same data can be used to build another fund, which will come later. But instead of just having views on stocks, I may have views on factors. So I could have a growth tilted, or a value tilted fund, or I could do factor rotation…so we have all the insights to do that. Or rather than factors, we can have sectors. So, as a fund house, our philosophy is to be data-driven and then deliver that in differentiated ways to our end customers. Do you have an upper and lower limit to the number of stocks you would have in the fund? Not necessarily. You would expect around 125 to 150 stocks, which is, again, a lot more than you would see in a typical flexicap where it’s probably 30 to 40. But you're never going to see 500 stocks because, again, that's an index fund. You've chosen to take the direct route for distribution. What was the thinking behind this, and how will it pan out? People are becoming increasingly comfortable managing their finances digitally on their phones. Our partnership with Jio, which has access to that ecosystem, gives us a clear understanding that this is the direction we want to pursue. We aim to see how direct digital approaches work. We have the capacity to manufacture at scale, and if we can reach customers and offer them value digitally, that would be excellent. We can always consider growing, expanding, and exploring other options in the future. The ₹24 tax filing product enables users to file their returns digitally. Would it accelerate your growth? A lot of new products are coming online from JioFinance. Yes, like new functionality on the Jio Finance app will help accelerate our growth. Our presence will also accelerate Jio Finance’s growth, because people will get excited by things like the NFO periods going online. We currently have 50 to 55 million unique permanent account numbers (PAN) in the mutual fund space. How large do you think the market can grow? Fifty-five million is a very big number, but in the context of India, it's still very small, right? We have just crossed 20% of AUM (assets under management) as a percentage of GDP. By comparison, the UK is at 80% and the US is at 150%. There can be some short-term blips that we have seen even in the last few weeks, but the overall macro is very sound. Demographics are very positive. Tell us a little about your team Our chief investment officer (CIO), Rishi Kohli, has been involved in the systematic quant investing space in India for many decades. In addition, two dedicated fund managers who previously worked at BlackRock have joined the team. There are also two dealers and a couple of researchers for the equity team. On the fixed income side, we have three fund managers, two dealers, and a couple of researchers. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Business Elon Musk, chief executive officer of SpaceX and Tesla, gestures as he attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre in Paris, France, Jun 16, 2023. (Photo: Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes) WILMINGTON, Delaware: Elon Musk's blow-out US$1 trillion pay package from Tesla proves everything is bigger in Texas, especially under its new management-friendly law. Last year, Tesla reincorporated in the Lone Star State after a judge in its former corporate home, Delaware, ruled a US$56 billion compensation for the CEO was "unfathomable" and unfair to shareholders. Musk urged companies to ditch Delaware and his board worked on a new pay package. Freed from the constraints of Delaware's widely used corporate law, Tesla has super-sized the next pay deal for Musk, already the world's richest person. Despite increasing his pay nearly 20-fold, there is a better chance this package will be approved and a lesser risk it will be struck down in the courts, thanks to Texas's corporate law. In addition, it would be harder for shareholders to challenge the independence of the two board members who developed the pay package.

Title: Analysis-Teslas Super Ambitious $1 trillion deal for Musk could still pass shareholder muster

By Ross Kerber, Dawn Kopecki, Simon Jessop and Arsheeya Bajwa NEW YORK -Tesla's $1 trillion, 10-year pay package to retain CEO Elon Musk is likely to be approved by shareholders at the company's annual meeting in November even though the amount is staggering. That is because it was crafted with an eye on keeping Musk in place, addressing concerns about the company's technical outlook and giving big company owners just enough reason to back the massive amount, investors and executive pay analysts said. Earlier on Friday, the automaker's board approved what it called "A Super Ambitious Incentive Package for a Pioneering, Ambitious and Unique CEO" that sets out lofty earnings and valuation targets – awarding Musk millions of shares over the next decade if he hits them. It immediately gives Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock worth more than $31 billion as of intraday trading on Friday that vests over the next two years, as well as more control over the company. His total 2025 compensation package is worth north of $113 billion, executive compensation research firm Equilar has estimated. “The pay package, which makes a big bet on the future of robots, may see shareholder support," said Taufiq Rahim, a SpaceX investor and principal at 2040 Advisory. "But it raises larger social questions about the outsized gains going to relatively few capital holders, which is likely not sustainable and will face public pressures.” The package is designed to keep Musk from leaving and is squarely focused on transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence and robotics powerhouse, the board said in a securities filing. It said Musk is the only person on the planet who can unlock Tesla's full potential. The compensation committee started negotiating Musk's pay package in February, it said, meeting with lawyers 37 times and directly with Musk 10 times over seven months. Certain items were non-negotiable for the idiosyncratic CEO: he wanted 25% of the company, to control Tesla's future direction and to be fully compensated for a 2018 pay package that was hung up in litigation. THREATS TO LEAVE Musk threatened to leave more than once, and the board worried the company's AI talent would follow him out the door, it said in the filing. The $31 billion in restricted shares, which he cannot sell for at least five years, is partial payback for a $56 billion 2018 pay plan that a Delaware court voided last year. If Musk wins in court within a certain time frame, he will not receive the one-time payment "so there can be no 'double dip,'" the board said. "Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue his other interests and leave Tesla if he did not receive such assurance," the board said. SHAREHOLDER PROVAL The pay plan is by far the largest ever for any CEO, Equilar said. And while it is likely to face legal challenges, compensation experts see it winning shareholder approval. "Time and time again, Tesla's shareholders have approved these grants over the years," Equilar Research Director Courtney Yu told Reuters. "While it may seem outlandish now, shareholders will get tremendous value out of it if Elon Musk is successful." None of Tesla's three largest outside investors, Vanguard Group, BlackRock or State Street, immediately said on Friday how they would vote. Among them, Vanguard and BlackRock supported Musk's $56 billion pay package last year, disclosures show, while State Street funds voted against it. Tesla and top funds can still expect pressure over the pay, however, with a number of union figures and public-sector treasurers voicing concern. "We urge shareholders to reject Musk’s money grab, take away the Tesla board’s rubber stamp, and restore basic corporate governance standards," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, in a statement. Musk, who currently controls close to 13% of the company, would own 25% if the plan is approved, so long as he hits his performance targets and sticks around for at least seven more years. Payable over 12 tranches after hitting certain milestones, the ultimate prize could make Tesla the most valuable company in the world with an aspirational market capitalization of $8.5 trillion, making it worth more than Microsoft , Meta Platforms and Alphabet combined, today, the board noted. Kristin Hull, founder and chief investment officer of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, called the package irresponsible. “This is investor money that could go into R&D or acquisitions, places that would really benefit Tesla in the long term," she said, adding that she is considering a challenge with other shareholders. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called Musk a visionary but said the pay plan was excessive and could set a bad precedent in corporate governance. He questioned whether Musk was worth that much. “He also presides over a company that has lost its edge, is being overtaken by rivals, and whose brand has been tarnished by Musk’s actions outside of Tesla," he said. 'PICK A NUMBER' Tesla’s shares closed up 3.6% at $350.84 on Friday. They are down 13% for 2025, although they have recovered from their lows. Investors worry about its deteriorating electric vehicle business and rising foreign competition. “One minute Tesla’s board is wondering if Elon Musk is a liability to the company given his outspoken views and political distractions, the next they’re effectively saying ‘pick a number, any number’ to lock him in for as long as possible," Coatsworth said. "Surely Musk should be fighting for his job, not Tesla’s board fighting to keep him?" This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Title: Stocks wobble as Wall Street wrangles with whether the job market is too weak

U.S. stocks wobbled lower on Friday as Wall Street questioned whether the U.S. job market has slowed by just enough to get the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to help the economy, or by so much that a downturn may be on the way. After rising to an early gain, the S&P 500 erased it and fell 0.3% below the all-time high it set the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 220 points, or 0.5%, after swinging between an early gain of nearly 150 points and a loss of 400. The Nasdaq composite edged down by less than 0.1%. The action was more decisive in the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled after a report from the Labor Department said U.S. employers hired fewer workers in August than economists expected. The government also said that earlier estimates for June and July overstated hiring by 21,000 jobs. The disappointing numbers follow last month’s discouraging jobs update, along with other lackluster reports in intervening weeks, and traders are now betting on a 100% probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting on Sept. 17, according to data from CME Group. Investors love such cuts because they can give a kickstart to the economy, but the Fed has held off on them because they can also give inflation more fuel. So far this year, the Fed has been more worried about the potential of inflation worsening because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs than about the job market. But Friday’s job numbers could push the Fed to consider cutting rates in two weeks by a steeper amount than usual, said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “This week has been a story of a slowing labor market, and today’s data was the exclamation point,” according to Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Strong hiring for health care jobs had been helping to support the overall market, “but with it now showing some tangible signs of decline, the foundation underneath the labor market seems to be cracking,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. While the data on the job market is disappointing, it’s still not so weak that it’s screaming a recession is here, and the U.S. economy is continuing to grow. A big question for investors is whether the job market can remain in a balance where it’s not so strong that it prevents cuts to interest rates but also not so weak that the economy falls off. Uncertainty about that helped lead to Friday’s swings in the stock market. Wall Street needs things to go as hoped because it already sent stock prices to records amid expectations for a Goldilocks scenario where interest rates ease, and the economy keeps chugging along. On Wall Street, Friday’s heaviest weight was Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the face of the artificial-intelligence boom. It’s been contending with criticism that its stock price charged too high, too fast and became too expensive following Wall Street’s rush into AI, and it fell 2.7%. Lululemon dropped 18.6% after the yoga and athletic gear maker’s revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations. CEO Calvin McDonald pointed to disappointing results from its U.S. operation, while Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said Lululemon is facing “industrywide challenges, including higher tariff rates.” Still, more stocks rose on Wall Street than fell. Leading the way was Broadcom, which climbed 9.4% after reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Hock Tan said customers are continuing to invest strongly in AI chips. Tesla rose 3.6% after proposing a payout package that could reach $1 trillion for its CEO, Elon Musk, if the electric vehicle company meets a series of extremely aggressive targets over the next 10 years. Smith & Wesson Brands jumped 6.5% after the gun maker delivered better results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Mark Smith said it saw good demand for new products in what’s traditionally a slow season for sales of firearms. All told, the S&P 500 fell 20.58 points to 6,481.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 220.43 to 45,400.86, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 7.31 to 21,700.39.. In stock markets abroad, indexes in Europe lost early gains to turn lower with Wall Street. That followed strength across much of Asia. The Nikkei 225 rallied 1% in Tokyo after data showed accelerating growth in earnings for Japanese workers. Chinese markets rebounded following three days of decline, with indexes rising more than 1% in both Hong Kong and Shanghai. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.09% from 4.17% late Thursday and from 4.28% on Tuesday. That’s a notable move for the bond market and could mean lower interest rates are coming for mortgages and other loans.
