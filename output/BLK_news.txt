Aside from economic collapse scenarios, many countries are in the process of eliminating physical cash and coins. Instead, everyone has an account that holds their money. You cannot purchase goods or services without access to government-based cryptocurrency. Even if the currency itself is still backed by faith in the government, you have to use this electronic system. The result is multiple problems that could leave you in a situation where you have the money in the bank to pay your bills and purchase goods and services, yet you cannot do so. These threats include: These hacks usually affect the bank or primary clearinghouse rather than a specific person’s account. You may be unable to purchase goods or services for hours or days. While this is inconvenient, it isn’t as bad as a full collapse, where the banks close for good. There’s only so much you can do about this kind of hack other than make sure you can go two weeks without buying anything at any given time. It is also essential to keep a paper-based address book with phone numbers and account information so that you can contact utility companies or others who may be expecting payments from you while the bank or clearinghouse is down. Let’s say you can connect to Wi-Fi independently of the SIM Card. Your phone app may not work with Wi-Fi. This is why I recommend having an app on your phone that doesn’t use the SIM card to dial out on Wi-Fi so that you can make the necessary calls. If the hacker was able to steal money from your accounts, it could take weeks to years before you recover the money. In the short term, you will have to shut down credit cards and so on, then wait for new ones to come in the mail. You may also have to manage restoring devices and regaining access to your accounts. Here again, make sure you can go at least 2 weeks without buying anything so that you can manage your basic necessities. Merchant Category Codes are unique identifiers that put different products into separate categories. For example, food has one set of numeric identifiers, while clothing has other identifiers. Even without looking at your receipt, the bank and transaction clearinghouse may have some ideas about what you bought. The transaction cost can then give some estimates about quantity and item type. One day, data from all banks and clearinghouses may pool into a central government computer. Social credit scores work like your financial-based credit scores. Consider how your financial credit score enables businesses to “reward” you with credit or better interest rates if you pay your bills on time and have an optimal debt-to-income ratio. Your social credit score looks at how you act in society. For example, China has a system that rewards things like donating blood. This same system “punishes” people who drive drunk or engage in other activities that aren’t “beneficial to society.” People with good social credit scores may get tax breaks, an increased chance of getting a promotion, or other benefits. When vaccines became available for COVID-19, governments worldwide were concerned because people hesitated to embrace mRNA vaccines. This led to people not complying with recommendations to get vaccinated. Social credit scores can be paired with cashless systems that will block purchasing from specific merchant category codes. It could become possible to deny people the ability to buy food, gas, and other essentials if they aren’t vaccinated. When you can’t use cash, pressure campaigns like this will be almost 100% effective because you will have to comply or do without the necessities of life. The only way to outlast a pressure campaign like this is to have a stockpile of food and other essentials that will last until the pressure tactics are stopped. At first, you might think merchant credit codes will only come into play when the government seeks to limit, slow down, or prevent purchasing certain goods and services. The problem is that modern networks aren’t safe from hackers, including those who seek to disrupt trade for ethical reasons. For example, the Internet Archive was recently targeted by a hacktivist group, Blackmeta. They claim they attacked this non-profit library site because it is based in the USA and, therefore, is aligned with Israeli activities. Ironically, the Internet Archive has been locked in multiple court battles with publishers that may be far more aligned with Israel. These publishers, in turn, are trying to shut down the Internet Archive because when people don’t buy from the publisher, it cuts into their profits. Now imagine this kind of situation happening with the information stolen from the Heritage Foundation, and then used to target more granular data in banks and merchant clearinghouse systems. You could very easily see transactions declined for what appears to be “government” or other legislative curbs, when in fact, it’s some group attacking you because of a “social credit score” known only to them. If you want to buy something right now, you can just put your credit card away and use cash. This won’t be possible once the only fiat currency available is electronic in nature. No matter how much you want to look at the potential for excess government imposition, the fact remains any group with sufficient skills and interest can cause serious problems. AI can keep track of billions of records and patterns of activity. This includes determining if what you buy is “normal” for your location as well as for you as a consumer within a particular category. Right now, that’s likely beyond the implementation of the cashless centralized government cryptocurrency systems. At some point, though, someone on something like the “no-fly list,” etc., could wind up unable to buy certain items or in certain quantities and not realize there is a curb based on a government-based list. Considering how many lists there are, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to resolve the problem and purchase goods in a timely manner. This includes lists that may be compiled based on estimated political slant. Consider that even now, traffic cameras can match license plates with bumper stickers and yard political signs to determine your likely preferences. When you factor in non-governmental groups, the situation gets even worse. Technologically speaking, it’s within the scope of foreign agents and hacktivists to bring together limits on how you spend your money and non-financial activities. As we are seeing in various hacks, there is certainly a “social credit score” being applied to businesses that can be scaled to target individuals who may want to purchase extra supplies to manage an emergency. Right now you can protect your money while it is still in your control. First, it is very important to keep your money in different banks. Even if one goes down, the others may still be functioning. This applies to credit and debit cards. If you have only Visa cards, ensure you have at least one Mastercard. You can do this with prepaid cards as well as more permanent accounts. This method won’t work if every transaction must go through a centralized clearinghouse that includes every possible bank or other institution. At this point, it’s impossible to say whether that kind of system exists and how various groups would use or misuse it. Second, if you routinely buy from certain stores, you can purchase gift cards and have the money ready and waiting in your account. If you cannot access your bank account, you can still buy from that store. This won’t necessarily prevent you from running into rationing or other limits that may be imposed by the government through the store or at the store level. Preparing for small—and large-scale disasters is essential for your well-being and that of your family. You can still use bartering, provided you have a clear sense of the value of what you will offer and whether or not the other party needs what you have. Make consistent contacts with small or local farmers and others who may be willing to take something in exchange for food. The trade could be anything from assisting with mechanical repairs to making garments. Everything will depend on the relationship you develop and the situation. You can make barter arrangements for just about anything from tangible goods to training in various skills. Look for small businesses and local groups, as they may be more open to these kinds of arrangements. Spending a few dollars extra and supporting these people now may be very useful later on. This is also a good time to form relationships with established flea markets and others with different kinds of products. These people may be very helpful when you find a way to barter for tools or other goods that you can no longer purchase using money. Here again, you have to know what their needs are and how you can meet them. As hacks on banks, hospitals, water purification plants, and the government itself become more common, it should be obvious that a cashless society can pose significant risks if you aren’t prepared. Taking a few simple measures now may help you get through these situations as painlessly as possible. The most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! Video HERE. None of us is really looking forward to the next great depression, even while we’re all expecting it to come. The reality is that rough financial times are worrisome for everyone, including the most prepared preppers amongst us. While you and I might be better off than our neighbors are, there’s still the possibility of losing our jobs, followed by our cars and then our homes. Since one of the marks of depression is high unemployment, there’s no guarantee that any of us will manage to keep our jobs or even find another job if we lose ours. While 75% of people managed to keep their jobs back in the Great Depression of the last century, it is the 25% of them who lost their jobs that we all focus on. This shaky job market, coupled with a potential for high inflation make for a rough financial time for just about everyone. Oh, there are always those who have enough money that it doesn’t really matter; I’m not one of those people and I doubt that you are either. While we don’t know just when that next depression is going to come or what will be the actual trigger, there are plenty of things going on in the current economy to give us concern. More and more economists and financial planners of all stripes are warning people about the collapse that’s coming. Some even going so far as to say that it will be much worse than the Great Depression of the last century. So, what are we going to do when it comes? Or, perhaps even more importantly, what should we avoid doing when it comes? The first thing to realize is that the shape of the economy, including the shape of the stock market, is largely psychological. Stocks rise and fall in value due to people’s perceptions, more than anything tangible that can be pointed to. Once those people realize the mistake they’ve made, things can turn around just as quickly. It’s easy to fall into fear during times of uncertainty. But that fear will cause you to make poor decisions, just like those people trading on the stock market. While there may be plenty to be fearful about, you don’t have to fall for it, even if everyone else does. Rather, think through your situation and make the best possible decisions to protect yourself and your family. Remember, even though 25% of workers lost their jobs during the Great Depression, 75% of the people managed to keep theirs. Work on being part of that 75%. Whatever you do, don’t quit your job, no matter how bad you think it is or how much you feel they don’t appreciate you. At least you have a job and you can pay the bills. If you quit, without already having another job that you’re contracted for, you may not end up being able to get another job for months or even years. If you don’t feel that the job is meeting your financial needs, then the answer isn’t quitting, it’s reevaluating your spending and looking for a way to lower your costs. Chances are that you’re living above your means. That’s not your employer’s fault, so you can’t expect them to pay for it. With so many people losing their jobs, the one thing you want to do is make sure you keep your own. In many companies, that means becoming the indispensable person. The last one they would want to lay off. That won’t work in jobs which are controlled by unions, as all that matters then is seniority, but if that’s not an issue for the job you have, then do whatever you have to, in order to make them think that they can’t live without you. More than anything, this means going above and beyond on a regular basis. I did this in my engineering career, earning myself a number of promotions. I then passed that work ethic on to my children. When my son’s company (he works for a petroleum company) was laying people off left and right, he got a 40% raise, because they couldn’t afford to lose him. The people who have the most trouble dealing with any financial downturn are those who are saddled with a lot of debt. That can be exacerbated even more by losing a job. But even for those who manage to keep their jobs, unnecessary debt becomes a burden that’s hard to bear. It’s not a hard and fast rule, but inflation generally goes hand-in-hand with times of economic downturn. While that doesn’t mean that the cost of those debts will climb in any way, it does mean that the amount of disposable income available will shrink, leading to making some hard decisions, like paying for the new car or eating. For those who lose their jobs, all those debts make it harder to survive, financially speaking. Not only are they likely to lose whatever they bought on credit, but in trying to do everything they can to keep their heads above water, financially speaking, they might end up losing something even more important, like their home, because of that car payment. All Americans Will Lose Their Home, Income And Power By November 27, 2025 Watch the video below! Cosigning on a loan is a risky move at any time. By doing so, you’re promising to make the payment, if the borrower can’t. That puts your finances in captivity to their ability to pay their obligations. If they don’t follow the kind of advice I’m writing in this article and end up losing their job, you’re going to end up being legally forced to pay for whatever you cosigned on. During a time of financial depression, that could be enough to sink your own finances. The “Great Recession” of 2008-2009 was caused by adjustable rate and balloon mortgages. Written in the time of President Clinton’s presidency, these were intended to make it possible for people who couldn’t otherwise afford a home, the ability to buy one. The idea was sold on the basis of some financial projections that didn’t come to pass. When the interest rate or mortgage payment went up, the people who had taken out those loans found themselves unable to make their payments. It was even worse for those whose mortgages included balloon payments, as they hadn’t prepared for that huge payment. The result was that thousands of people lost their homes, pushing the nation and then the world into the recession. There’s nothing wrong with refinancing, if it can be done in such a way as to save you money. But take care when doing so, that you understand exactly what the terms of the loan are. Don’t accept something which will cause your payments to go up sometime in the future. As we’ve all seen, that’s dangerous. The last Great Depression came about largely due to people investing money they didn’t have, in stocks they didn’t understand. They were essentially buying stocks with borrowed money. That still happens today, with people “leveraging” their funds to buy more than they otherwise would be able to. The problem with that investment, like any other investment, is that it can go down, just as easily as it can go up. The “sure thing” your buddy talks you into may not be anywhere near as sure as he thinks it is. While some percentage of those really do pay off; most do not, leaving people with a sizeable loss. My personal philosophy about investing is that I see it as a gamble. As such, I won’t invest any more than I feel I can afford to lose. While I’ve missed a lot of opportunities that way, including a recent one that could have paid me 30 to 1, I haven’t lost any money that way either. Perhaps one of the more foolish things that someone can do during a depression, besides taking on new debt, is to upgrade their lifestyle. Even if you get a promotion at work, with a nice fat raise, there’s no real security that you’ll hang onto that during a time of depression. Rather than spending that money to buy a new car or a boat, use it to pay down your debt, so that later, when the economy is on steadier ground, you can afford to really enjoy it. If anything, a depression is a time to bring down your lifestyle a bit; doing everything you can to lower your expenses. That will give you more flexibility with your finances, especially if things take a turn for the worst. I know this is going to sound like a contradiction to the last item; but don’t keep your money in cash either. Rather, put it into some sort of investment that is secure; while at the same time not requiring any borrowing on your part. Assuming that you are buying at the beginning of the inflationary cycle, probably the most secure investment would be in precious metals. That isn’t the only secure investment though. Bonds, especially federal and municipal bonds are secure investments. So are utility stocks and some of the blue chip stocks. Look to invest in things that will have to exist through the depression because people need them. Those are the places to invest. My favorite investment, for people who don’t have a lot to invest, is to invest in non-perishable food. On the average, food has been going up about 8% per year, even while the general inflation rate has been hovering under 1%. So, if someone buys $1,000 worth of food and holds onto it for five years, it will be worth almost $1,500 at the end of that time. They don’t even have to sell it to cash in either; all they’ve got to do is eat it and use the money they would normally spend on that food for other things. Finally, do everything you can to avoid defrauding your creditors. There are things you can do to protect your relationship with them, even if you can’t make your payments. The last thing that any creditor wants is to have one of their customers default, causing them to repossess property. They’re not in the business of selling that property; they’re in the business of selling loans. While loan forgiveness is rather rare, you might be able to get a forbearance or deferment on that loan. Both are common for student loans and mortgage companies are amiable to working with you in that way as well. Make contact with your lender, telling them what your situation is and asking them what they can do for you. Remember, you won’t be the only one going through hard financial times. They’re probably going to be even more aware of the problems going on than you are, as they are going to have a wider picture to look at. As such, they would rather work with you, than have to go through foreclosure. The Ultra-wealthy are Planning Your Future Right Now The ultra-wealthy are planning your future right now. They’ll call it ‘utopia’ and sell it to you as such, but it’s actually the opposite. Welcome to the first of a two-part series. Utopia is a place of “ideal perfection, especially in laws, government, and social conditions.” At least, that’s the dictionary definition. The thing is, despite humans having tried for thousands of years to attain Eden-esque perfection, it’s impossible. Worse, the irony of such efforts is literally baked into the word ‘utopia:’ From Merriam Webster (emphasis added): In 1516, English humanist Sir Thomas More published a book titled Utopia, which compared social and economic conditions in Europe with those of an ideal society on an imaginary island located off the coast of the Americas. More wanted to imply that the perfect conditions on his fictional island could never really exist, so he called it “Utopia,” a name he created by combining the Greek words ou (“not, no”) and topos (“place”). Still, that doesn’t stop people from trying to create fictional paradise. The latest attempts are — unsurprisingly — conceived of, funded by, and built by our billionaire overlords, who aim to own everything and define how our lives will be lived in the future. At the same time, a paradox is unfolding. While several attempts at billionaire-initiated paradises are currently in the works, some efforts are failing, some are falling apart, and some are simply struggling to get off the ground. What we know about Silicon Valley elites, bitcoin bros, and AI billionaires is that they dream big and have virtually limitless finances. So even failed attempts at utopia — or whatever their version of it is — gets the entire cohort a step closer to decoding a formula that might stick. It’s like unlimited funding to indulge a God complex. In part one of this series, we’re looking at four concepts for creating paradise on earth crafted by the freedom loving, libertarian, optimized-living-through-technology crowd. What exactly do these communities promise? Who’s behind them? And most importantly, could they just be 15-minute dystopian wolves in utopian sheep’s clothing? Let’s dive in. Próspera began as a bold libertarian experiment on the tropical island of Roatán, off the northern coast of Honduras. It’s the brainchild of Erick Brimen, a Venezuelan-born wealth fund manager who imagined a city run not by politicians, but by market forces and blockchain logic. He’s aiming to create a low-tax, deregulated tech haven where businesses can make their own laws, or choose to implement existing national laws from a menu of 36 countries. Residents pay low taxes (payable in Bitcoin), and biotech startups push the limits of radical life extension with experimental, as yet unproven treatments disallowed in other countries. With venture capital backing from Coinbase and Sam Altman–linked projects, plus support from figures like Peter Thiel, Próspera has quickly become a magnet for crypto evangelists, longevity obsessives, and deregulation devotees. It hosts conferences with themes like: “Make death optional.” It’s creating a walled city with private arbitration courts, judges who adjudicate online from Arizona (no idea why Arizona — our research was not explicit), and QR-code entry checkpoints. But like all utopias, this charter city dream has clashed with reality. One critic called it a “libertarian fantasy… that’s not going to turn out well.” The Honduran government that initially supported the project and allowed for the zoning laws making it possible has since collapsed in scandal — with the former president serving time in US prison for conspiring to import and distribute over 400 tons of cocaine. That’s a lot of blow. Locals in the nearby village of Crawfish Rock have not taken kindly to the idea of the gated city and have accused Próspera of land grabs, environmental damage, and trying to push them out. When the current democratic socialist President, Xiomara Castro, declared the former administration’s zoning laws unconstitutional, Próspera fought back in international court, demanding nearly $11 billion USD in damages — about a third of the country’s GDP — an amount that would bankrupt the country if they lose the case. Brimen is doubling down, lobbying American politicians to argue in his favor and launching a spin-off project aimed at Africa. This all plays out as an ironic twist of history: a 21st-century version of the banana republic, complete with foreign investors, private courts, and corporate control over land, law, and labor. The term ‘banana republic’ was coined by author O. Henry to describe Honduras — a place where US fruit companies ran the economy. Now, crypto-capitalists and Silicon Valley VCs are picking up where the plantations left off, except this time, they’re promising immortality instead of bananas. NEOM was supposed to be Saudi Arabia’s leap into the future: a $500 billion high-tech oasis in the desert that would make even Silicon Valley blush. Conceived in 2017 by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as the crown jewel of his Vision 2030 plan, NEOM promised flying taxis, robot dinosaurs, artificial moons, a desert ski resort with fake snow, and a 170-kilometer mirrored city called The Line. This mirrored city was meant to stretch 170 kilometers across the desert with no cars, no roads, and no emissions — just smart infrastructure, biometric surveillance, and those previously mentioned flying taxis. But like many utopias, the fantasy is already buckling under the weight of reality. The goal was for The Line to eventually be home to 9 million people, with 1.5 million residents by 2030. Middle East Eye reports that Saudi officials now predict fewer than 300,000 in that time frame. Only 2.4 kilometers of The Line may actually be completed by 2030. Oil revenues — the main funding source — have declined sharply, and insiders say the kingdom is facing an “environment of limited resources.” Budget reviews are underway, and other NEOM projects (like the year-round ski resort) have been shelved, delayed, or drastically scaled back. Behind the glossy renderings lies a construction project with a dystopian work culture. NEOM’s former CEO, Nadhmi al-Nasr, developed a reputation for abusive management. “I drive everybody like a slave,” he said, celebrating “[w]hen they drop down dead… That’s how I do my projects.” In one case, he told an employee to “walk into the desert and die” so he could urinate on their grave. As a result, there has been a mass exodus of foreign executives, many of whom forfeited six-figure contracts just to escape the toxic environment. Meanwhile, members of the Howeitat tribe, native to the land NEOM occupies, have resisted the development. Many have been forcibly removed, at least one activist was killed, and others have been imprisoned for resisting eviction. Human rights groups have condemned the project, while NEOM’s own consultants warned that the mega-structure could actually change the weather and decimate bird populations due to its massive mirrored walls. None of this matters; Saudi officials press on. Promotional videos still promise a gleaming future where “Neomians” live in harmony with nature, technology, and robot dinosaurs. But those on the ground tell a different story — of constant surveillance, sexual harassment allegations ignored by leadership, and Orwellian control over employee life. Promises of a liberalized social zone — with alcohol, gender mixing, freedom — have quietly been walked back by a government known for its public stonings and other extreme punishment for ‘immorality.’ NEOM may, in fact, never turn out to be the future of urban life. But it may just be the world’s most expensive monument to authoritarian delusion: a dystopian nightmare of a city built on sand, surveillance, and slogans. Telosa is what happens when a billionaire tries to build a utopian city without using the word ‘utopia.’ Marc Lore, former Walmart executive and founder of Jet.com and Diapers.com, envisions a new city rising from scratch somewhere in the American desert (or possibly Appalachia), designed to be sustainable, walkable, tech-forward, and just equitable enough to keep you from asking too many questions. According to Telosa’s website, this categorically, definitely, 100 percent isn’t a utopia. Is the goal to create a utopia? No, we are absolutely not attempting to create a utopia. Utopian projects are focused on creating a perfect, idealistic state — we are not. We are firmly grounded in reality and what is possible. We are focused on the best, most sustainable solutions for infrastructure, urban design, economic vibrancy and city services, but we fully recognize that no solution is perfect and all human systems have flaws. Therefore, we are committed to new ideas, finding the best way to solve difficult problems and constant improvement. And yet the renderings and promo videos suggest otherwise: gleaming towers, shaded plazas, handicap-accessible courtyards, and monorails slicing silently through eco-optimized zones. If it looks like utopia, smells like utopia, and plans to engineer human behavior like utopia — well, you do the math. The project is called “Telosa,” from the Greek word telos — meaning “highest purpose.” Hey — stop calling it utopia! The big idea is for 50,000 people to move to this yet-to-be-determined place by 2030 and have the population eventually grow to 5 million. Everyone lives within a short walk (15 minutes maybe?) of everything they need — a school, a park, a job (lolz!), and probably an AI wellness coach. Cars, of course, are banned. There will be solar-powered towers and vertical farms and an economy based on “equitism,” a remix of a 19th-century idea where the city itself owns the land and uses rising property values to fund social services. But for all its lofty ideas, Telosa has yet to put a single shovel in the ground. There’s no final site, no government approval, and no clear funding beyond Lore’s initial push. It’s still just a shimmering concept, a mirage sketched by a star architect (Bjarke Ingels) and floated in interviews, TED talks, and design expos. Critics argue that if Lore really wanted to help people, he could invest in solving infrastructure problems in existing cities. Others point out that “15-minute cities” — the model Telosa clearly mirrors — have become a global flashpoint, praised by urban planners but derided by skeptics as a way to centralize control, limit movement, and monitor citizens. So far, Telosa’s biggest achievement is that it’s really good at marketing a city that doesn’t exist. If it ever does gets built, we may finally get to ask: does a billionaire-designed city really offer freedom — or just the illusion of choice in a world where the architecture has already made the decisions for you? If you’ve ever dreamed of escaping taxes, regulations, and society itself, there’s a billionaire-funded plan for that: Seasteading — the floating libertarian fantasy that just won’t sink, no matter how many times it fails. First floated (literally and ideologically) by the Seasteading Institute in 2008, the project was originally funded by… wait for it… Peter Thiel. He envisioned self-governing cities bobbing peacefully in international waters until backing away from the idea and stating they were “not quite feasible from an engineering perspective.” The concept was a nation without a nation, where entrepreneurs could escape pesky things like labor laws, zoning, and democracy. In short: Silicon Valley meets Waterworld, minus the humility. An initial prototype near Thailand ended with Thai authorities raiding the floating platform and accusing the residents of endangering national sovereignty, an offense punishable by life imprisonment or death. The couple that lived on the house boat went into hiding and the Thai navy eventually hauled away what was essentially a raft with Wi-Fi. The broader Seasteading movement has since splintered, evolved, and — most recently — mutated into a newer project with fresher branding: Arkpad. “By building a community in the ocean, you’re not just creating a home; you’re crafting a legacy of innovation, freedom, and sustainability,” reads the marketing copy. Arkpad bills itself as a “sovereign lifestyle project” and a “network state” — crypto-native language for the same old dream: private governance, no taxes, total control. Based in the Philippines, Arkpad is aiming to build on ocean-based platforms and create a floating community, complete with decentralized ID systems, underwater real estate, and NFTs for residency. Because, of course. Their YouTube channel mixes crypto sermons with dreamy renderings of sleek structures rising from the sea — modern-day Noah’s Arks, minus the animals or flood, but heavy on Bitcoin and barnacles. Watch the videos carefully and you’ll see the architects’ sleek computer-generated renderings blur into the reality of what an Arkpad really is: a concrete block floating in the middle of absolutely nowhere. No word on whether they supply residents with free Dramamine. Just like Seasteading before it, Arkpad suffers from a chronic case of reality avoidance. Engineering constraints, rising ocean temperatures, maritime law, international sovereignty, and basic logistical challenges all still exist. What’s more, these projects have always been less about freedom for all and more about escape for the few. Not everyone is invited to these floating utopias. They’re luxury lifeboats for a digital elite preparing to sail away from the consequences of the world they helped wreck. Until further notice, Seasteading and Arkpad remain what they’ve always been: libertarian lighthouses in the fog — glowing ideals with no mooring in the real world. Whether real or imagined, all these utopian concepts promise clean slates and high-tech harmony in their own way, plugged into the seductive guarantee of a new way to live. Blockchain ruled and perfect in efficiency, there remains only one slight problem: Reality. History shows that when elites indulge in the fantasy of utopias, reality always gets in the way. Wealthy eccentricity is tolerable for a small group of like-minded disciples, but humans are not robots. Therefore, it’s unlikely that a utopia cooked up by some micro-dosing, immortality-seeking tech bro could ever be scaled up except through heavy reliance on surveillance, coercion, and control — where things eventually devolve into socially engineered, privacy-erasing digital prisons, wrapped in glossy marketing brochures and eco-communal delusion. There’s also the problem of governments — they’re not into the whole competition thing. But hey, that’s not going to stop these billionaires from trying. So in part two of this series, we’ll look at some of the other ways billionaires are planning to control the future of urban living and how it might affect you. At the top of the financial pyramid sits the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Switzerland , the “central bank of central banks.” It acts as a clearinghouse for financial operations between major nations and secretly controls monetary policy for over 60 central banks worldwide.They operate with complete legal immunity from national governments and taxation. Central banks themselves , like the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England, and others , print fiat currency at will, control interest rates, and manipulate economic conditions to serve the interests of the elite, not the public. Names like: These families accumulated obscene amounts of wealth through monopolies on banking, oil, railroads, and shipping during the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries , and much of that wealth was quietly transitioned into trusts, holding companies, and offshore accounts. Estimates of the Rothschild family’s total wealth range from hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars, though it’s nearly impossible to trace because it’s hidden in foundations, trusts, and behind nominal ownership. According to a study by the Tax Justice Network, the global elite hide $21 to $32 trillion in offshore accounts , in places like: This hoarded wealth escapes taxation, public scrutiny, and accountability. The U.S. government alone has been caught “losing track” of trillions: A handful of investment firms, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, now collectively own controlling stakes in: They also control massive real estate portfolios , quietly buying up farmland, housing, and critical infrastructure worldwide. The Vatican Bank holds untold billions in gold, real estate, and art. Documents have shown it profited from wars, colonial plundering, and financial schemes. Rumors persist about secret underground vaults loaded with treasures taken during centuries of conquest and conflict. Because it’s not idle money — it’s used to: And while the average person struggles with inflation, debt, and taxes , these entities hoard enough wealth to end global poverty dozens of times over. The idea of a global elite controlling humanity through debt, manipulation, and hoarded wealth isn’t a theory. It’s a fact that history’s empires have always functioned this way. The names and technology have changed, but the strategy hasn’t. And when the people finally see how it works, it falls apart. Every time. Since the 2008 crisis, four huge shifts take place that define the modern financial industry: Due to the strict regulatory policy adopted after the crisis, the post-2008 banking sector was uncompetitive relative to the pre-2008 banking sector, with the aggravating circumstance that the banks that survived the crash were buried in debt and deeply exposed in regards to their internal control mechanisms. In this context, the industrial sector sought for alternative, non-bank financing methods; namely private equity and alternative credit, with the latter occupying the power vacuum left by old-fashioned moneylenders that had been wounded by the housing market crash and the former constituting a revolutionary way of investing in company stock. Attention: The US is Facing The BIGGEST Threat Of The Century So pay chose attention because this video will change your life forever for the good! The most iconic finance job ever, the stockbroker, pretty much suffered its extinction during the 2008 crash. This opened the door for automated forms of investing in which the role of the intermediary – the broker – became trivial. Instead of investing on specific companies due to shareholder expectations of growth and performance, investors shifted towards large diversified funds listing hundreds of companies and tracking their growth over long periods of time. The vast majority of portfolios rarely list individual company stock anymore; instead you’ll find passive investments on the S&P 500 or similar indexes. The pre-2008 get-rich-quick culture came to an end long ago, with the exception of online quasi-scams and compulsive gamblers stepping out of casinos and into the stock market. Nowadays, equity investments are much more sober, striving for low returns on the short term, but large gains in the long run due to compound interest. This focus on long-term wealth planning is but a consequence of the overall lack of confidence in the solvency public pension plans – a very reasonable public sentiment that has grown especially amongst young generations and that has pushed them to rely on private retirement systems. While fee compression already democratized the access to the stock market, small investors were still excluded from alternative investments such as private equity and venture capital. With the rise of alternative credit (as detailed in point 1) private equity funds did not only lower their minimum capital requirements, but we also witnessed the appearance of “feeder funds” aimed at collecting cash from small investors in order to meet the capital requirements of actual private equity funds. In occasions, markets have even experienced feeder funds of feeder funds, or feeder funds creating ETF-like portfolios combining investments on several private equity funds, such as EQT. The financial sector is arguably a more mature sector due to developments taking place since the 2008 crisis. This is mainly due to automatization of middleman roles and thence a democratization of access to investment opportunities, a soberized portfolio management culture, the rise of non-bank financing methods, and a declining confidence in public pension plans. The Medical Research Scam (The most egregious, diabolical and lucrative scam of modern times) First take a look at one of the most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! –FULL VIDEO HERE In the universe of alternative media, the immense size and influence of the Science/Medicine Industrial Complex (including “Big Pharma”) is well-known and commonly accepted. However, this massive network of organizations might be better understood as Big Research. A recent investigation dealing with UAB football (too embarrassing to cancel) led me to perform further research into the key source of funding for this university, the largest employer in the state of Alabama. The revenue UAB derives from scientific “research grants” awarded by the federal government is of a scale that boggles the mind of this citizen researcher. This examination of UAB funding sources should illustrate the massive amounts of money flowing from Washington D.C. – as well as various other medical foundations and private sources – into the coffers of certain higher education institutions that have leveraged allocations labeled “scientific research” into money-printing factories. In the past seven years, UAB – a public college of 23,000 students and 24,000 (!) employees – generated at least $5 billion in revenue from government grants, most coming from the federal government and most from grants bestowed by the National institutes of Health (NIH). In Fiscal Year 2022, UAB was the recipient of a “record” $774.5 million in federal grants and funding (source: al.com Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist John Archibald). You’ll Understand Everything After Watching This VIDEO! From 2018 through 2022, UAB received $3.178 billion in science research grants. Assuming annual funding levels were similar in 2023, 2024 and 2025, UAB has pocketed more than $5 billion in “research” money. According to an analysis published by the The Urban Institute in 2022, 37 percent of UAB’s operating revenues came from federal funding. Only two colleges in America – MIT (48 percent) and Johns Hopkins (42 percent) – received a larger percentage of their total income from the federal government. For context, every year UAB makes approximately twice the amount of revenue from federal grants as the university does from student tuition and fees. According to the school’s financial report from 2020, the school netted $244.93 million in tuition and fees in Fiscal 2020 and $484 million from “grants and contracts.” (Even tuition is federally subsidized, as nation-wide, 31.6 percent of students receive Pell Grants. I also learned that graduate students who help perform medical research are paid with federal dollars.) In 2022, UAB received $774 million in federal funding, more than double the $332.4 million it received as a legislative approproriation from the State of Alabama. The vast majority of UAB’s federal funding comes from the NIH, the parent agency of the NIAID, the sub-agency headed by Anthony Fauci through 2023. According to various sources, UAB received $413 million from the NIH in 2023 and $407 million in 2022. Indeed, the Alabama college is in the “top 1 percent” of colleges that receive grants from this agency. Also, the NIH is not the only “public health agency” that showers money on UAB. The same year the college received more than $20 million from the CDC and $11.5 million from the National Science Foundation. The college also benefits from “private grants and contracts,” which presumably come from “partners” in Big Pharma like Pfizer, NGOs and various foundations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2019, the University received $81.2 million from “private” grants, according to the 2020 CPA financial report. The school also derives income from patents and royalties on drugs and vaccines its faculty helped create. According to a UAB press release, “other growth areas include industry and clinical trials. Total industry awards, which include grants, funded trials and services, more than doubled (106 percent) since 2018 to exceed $150 million in 2022.” For further context, the amount of revenue UAB derives every year from federal funding and federal grants is at least $550 million more than the entire operating budget of Jacksonville State University, a four-year Alabama college with approximately 9,000 students. According to a Google AI query, 88 percent of the “medical research money” distributed to Alabama’s 34 four-year colleges went to just one university – UAB. The justification for the vast amounts of “research money” flowing into UAB coffers is that these investments “save lives” and improve the health of Alabamians and Americans. Indeed, earlier this year, an RFK, Jr. initiative at the HHS threatened to make “huge cuts to biomedical research grants” distributed to “research colleges” like UAB. According al.com columnist John Archibald, “several (UAB) professors and doctors privately were close to panic … wondering if they should pack their bags.” According to the all-important authorized narrative, possible cuts in medical research would result in horrific spikes in future deaths and unfathomable medical misery. To emphasize the requisite scare-mongering point, Archibald quoted Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin. “…You’re either pro-Alabamian and American health or you’re not,” said Mayor Woodfin. “There’s no in-between here. And when you cut funding, you hurt not just employers, but you hurt the people who voted for you as it relates to the ability for life-saving medicine, period.” In one column, Archibald urged Alabama Republican senator Katie Britt to fight to protect “life-saving research” being conducted at UAB. Not surprisingly, Britt did just this, writing a letter to President Trump to “speed up the release of NIH funds to UAB.” According to Sen. Britt’s spokesperson Grace Evans: “Senator Britt has been a strong advocate for ensuring the NIH remains the gold-standard of research and innovation across the nation and the world. She has continued to express the need for taxpayer dollars … which includes funding life-saving, groundbreaking research at high-achieving institutions like those in Alabama.” According to Sen. Britt’s letter, “withholding or delaying these funds could undermine critical research; risk jobs supported by scientific research and delay Americans’ access to life-saving treatments.” Watch this video below to find out the great secrets hidden by the government. As a jaded, skeptical contrarian, I’m happy to challenge the entire “life-saving research” narrative. For starters, it should be noted for the record that every phD and medical researcher at UAB (like all “research” universities) was spectacularly wrong about Covid and the Covid response, including the necessity for “life-saving” vaccines. I recently published an article about a UAB faculty member who spent 400 words in a guest column telling citizens the novel coronavirus was largely spread from physical surfaces. My long-time readers also know that Anthony Fauci’s successor at the NIAID was Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, who graduated to this job after serving for years as the director of UAB’s highly-acclaimed Infectious Disease Department. While a revered and honored Birmingham resident, Dr. Marrazzo, like 99.9 percent of higher education experts, was wrong about everything Covid. Furthermore, she helped lead the safety trials for remdesivir (nicknamed “Run, Death is Near!”), a formerly FDA-rejected drug which was “researched” and “developed” by UAB and the NIH. According to many contrarians and ignored hospital whistleblowers, this “ground-breaking, life-saving” Covid “treatment” has killed thousands of American citizens. (One of UAB’s grants – for $37.5 million – was awarded to administer safety trials for this life-taking drug.) In researching this story, I found an article about another esteemed UAB faculty expert, Dr. Paul Goepfert, a “UAB vaccine expert.” In November 2020, Yellowhammer News ran a big story on this vaccine expert after Pfizer (a regular benefactor of UAB), reported its vaccine was “90 percent effective.” “That’s tremendous news,’ said Dr. Goepfert. “… The most optimistic of us were thinking about 70% effective, so 90% effectiveness is fantastic.” Goepfert advised … “if the Pfizer vaccine is indeed 90% effective, around 60% of the population would need to take the vaccine to achieve herd immunity.” Applying “follow-up journalism” to Yellow Hammer News’ glowing report, at least 60 percent of the population did get two doses of these “vaccines” and “herd immunity” did not happen. In fact, the vaccinated become much more likely to be infected once, twice or four times than the unvaccinated. When I think about the hundreds of billions of dollars distributed to research colleges like UAB, the conclusion I reach is that most of this money is being spent to develop new pills and new vaccines to treat medical conditions that aren’t getting better. Per my analysis, researchers identify a medical issue that’s allegedly causing a terrible medical condition, followed by Big Pharma rushing in to create and sell a new pill, which patients will have to take the rest of their lives. For example, researchers discovered that “high cholesterol” was the major risk factor for heart attacks and sold billions of Statins. (Also, the numeric definer of “high cholesterol” was steadily lowered). The same thing happened with blood pressure medications and anti-depressants, which half of the country now takes (including large percentages of teenagers, especially female teenagers). The nightmare depression risk is suicide, but the number of suicides have increased, perhaps because anti-depressants increase the risk of suicide. Colonoscopies – like breast cancer screenings – were supposed to be a life saver but all that happened is researchers encouraged citizens to start getting annual colonoscopies and mammograms at earlier points in their lives (when it comes to colonoscopies, “45 is the new 55.”) Like many research universities, UAB features an academic department devoted just to fighting infectious diseases. However, infectious diseases don’t show up on any Top 10 or Top 15 list of “leading causes of death.” Researchers tell us vaccines eliminated deaths from infectious diseases like chicken pox, measles and polio, but those death and illness numbers essentially vanished because of better sanitation. UAB is also famed for its cancer research. While the “war on cancer” has been waged my entire life, cancer deaths and diagnosis are higher than they’ve ever been. *** IMO, it’s entirely possible the vast Medical Research Complex has caused a net increase in deaths due to over-prescriptions and over vaccination. If the “research” is bad or dubious, the public would have been better off with no “ground-breaking, life-saving solutions” …all brought to the public by the army of scientists performing studies and experiments in NIH-funded laboratories. For those who think these comments are medical disinformation or blaspheme, my rejoinder is … try selling these “solutions” to the Amish, who don’t receive any of these shots or take any of these pills … and who are living to a ripe, healthy old age. As a final editorial point on the alleged importance of cutting-edge medical research, the world needs more contrarians who ask questions about all of the medical research that doesn’t take place at these universities. As this article documents, just one university in Alabama has received more than $5 billion in research grants and contracts in a few years. However, not one research dollar has been allocated to research the embalmers’ clots. No “ground-breaking, life-saving” research has told the public what’s causing these white, fibrous clots in tens of millions of people and what might stop them. Nor is UAB investigating or researching the source of the spike in cancer diagnoses or “turbo cancers.” If a prize was awarded for the most egregious, diabolical and lucrative scam of modern times, it might be named in honor of Anthony Fauci, John D. Rockefeller or Bill Gates … and the Medical Research Complex would win this trophy every year. Lessons from the Economic Catastrophe of 1929 (Bank Failures Played a Crucial Role in Deepening the Economic Crisis) The Great Depression of 1929 stands as one of the most significant economic crises in modern history, casting a long shadow over the global financial landscape. Sparked by a catastrophic stock market crash in October, this era of intense economic turmoil led to widespread unemployment, poverty, and social unrest. In the United States, millions lost their jobs, homes, and savings, forcing families to confront an uncertain and often dire future. This article delves into the factors that precipitated the Great Depression, its profound impact on American society, the government responses that shaped economic policy, and the global ramifications of this devastating crisis. By understanding these aspects, we can glean valuable lessons that inform current economic practices and prepare us for future economic challenges. Watch the video below! The Great Depression did not arise in a vacuum; it was the result of a confluence of several factors that had been brewing throughout the 1920s. To fully understand the causes of the Great Depression, it is essential to look at the economic environment of the 1920s, commonly referred to as the “Roaring Twenties.” This period was marked by significant economic growth, technological advances, and an unprecedented rise in consumer culture. However, this prosperity was built on shaky foundations, and cracks were starting to appear. One of the primary catalysts for the Great Depression was the rampant speculation in the stock market. During the late 1920s, an increasing number of Americans began investing in stocks, often borrowing money to purchase shares in hopes of quick profit. This speculative bubble was characterized by inflated stock prices that did not reflect the actual value of the companies. The euphoria surrounding stock investments created an unsustainable market driven by the belief that prices would continue to rise indefinitely. Unfortunately, this led to an inevitable collapse when the bubble burst in October 1929, resulting in a dramatic stock market crash that sent shockwaves throughout the economy. Bank failures also played a crucial role in deepening the economic crisis. With the collapse of the stock market, many banks faced immense financial pressure as their clients rushed to withdraw their savings, fearing for their financial security. The banking system, which had become over-leveraged during the boom years, was unable to withstand the sudden surge of withdrawals. By 1933, approximately 9,000 banks had failed, wiping out billions in savings and further destabilizing the economy. The loss of confidence in the banking system exacerbated the financial crisis, leaving consumers with little access to credit and diminishing their ability to spend, which in turn led to decreased production and even more layoffs. International trade issues also contributed to the economic downturn. In an attempt to protect American industries, the U.S. government enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930, which raised tariffs on hundreds of imported goods. Although the intention was to bolster the domestic economy, the result was a significant decrease in international trade. Other nations retaliated by imposing tariffs on American goods, leading to a cascading effect of reduced trade volumes and increased economic isolationism. The combination of these protective measures further deepened the global economic crisis, proving counterproductive to the very goals they sought to achieve. Additionally, economic disparities and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few created an unstable economic environment. While the upper echelons of society reaped the benefits of the booming economy, a significant portion of the population struggled to make ends meet. This disparity in wealth led to reduced consumer spending, which is a vital component for economic growth. Without a robust consumer base, businesses struggled to maintain production levels, leading to layoffs and further economic contraction. In summary, the causes of the Great Depression were multifaceted and interconnected. The speculative practices of the stock market, bank failures, international trade barriers, and growing economic inequality all played significant roles in leading the world into one of its darkest economic periods. By examining these causes, we can draw lessons not only about financial prudence but also about the importance of a balanced economic system that supports all citizens, rather than a select few. The ramifications of the Great Depression extended far beyond economic collapse; they reshaped the social fabric of the United States. As unemployment soared, many families faced dire financial straits. By 1933, unemployment rates had skyrocketed to approximately 25%, leaving millions of Americans without jobs and many more struggling to survive on meager means. This widespread financial despair led to significant social challenges, including increased rates of homelessness, malnutrition, and mental health issues. The plight of the unemployed was visible in cities and towns across the nation. Shantytowns, often referred to as “Hoovervilles” after President Herbert Hoover, sprang up as displaced families sought shelter in makeshift huts. These communities became symbols of the suffering and hardship endured during this era. Families often found themselves living in extreme poverty, with many children going hungry or forced to drop out of school to support their families. The loss of a stable home environment had long-lasting effects on the health and education of these children, many of whom would experience generational poverty as a result. Furthermore, the Great Depression had a profound effect on the American psyche. The sense of insecurity and hopelessness permeated society, as people grappled with the loss of their dreams and aspirations. The stress of financial instability contributed to a rise in mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. Families were torn apart by financial difficulties, with some individuals resorting to desperate measures, including theft or begging. The collective trauma experienced during this period would leave scars that echoed throughout psychological studies and societal dynamics in subsequent decades. Social movements also began to emerge in response to the crises created by the Great Depression. Workers organized strikes and protests, demanding fair wages and better working conditions. Labor unions became more prominent as workers sought to protect their rights in an increasingly volatile job market. For many, invoking the power of collective bargaining became a means of survival. This surge in labor activism ultimately contributed to significant changes in labor laws and workers’ rights in the years that followed. The Great Depression also prompted shifts in public attitudes toward government intervention in the economy. Prior to this period, many believed in a laissez-faire approach, where the government primarily took a hands-off stance regarding economic affairs. However, the scale of the crisis led many to advocate for a more active role for the government in providing support for those in need. This shift in public opinion laid the groundwork for future social safety nets and government programs that aimed to assist those facing economic hardship. In conclusion, the impact of the Great Depression on society was profound and multifaceted. The economic collapse not only led to widespread unemployment and poverty but also altered the way individuals viewed work, government, and their place within society. The lessons learned during this tumultuous time continue to resonate today, emphasizing the importance of social safety nets, economic equality, and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The video below will shock you because you will be among the first to watching this secret! In the wake of the Great Depression, the U.S. government faced intense pressure to respond to the profound economic crisis that had gripped the nation. Under the leadership of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who took office in March 1933, the government implemented a series of sweeping reforms and policies collectively known as the New Deal. These initiatives aimed to provide immediate relief to the unemployed, to stimulate economic recovery, and to implement lasting reforms to prevent future economic collapses. One of the cornerstone programs of the New Deal was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), established in 1933. This program aimed to provide jobs for young men while simultaneously addressing environmental conservation efforts. Participants in the CCC worked on projects ranging from reforestation to building parks and trails, enabling them to support their families while also contributing to national recovery efforts. By the time the program came to an end, millions of young men had benefited from the CCC, gaining work experience and developing skills that would serve them for a lifetime. Another critical aspect of the New Deal was the creation of the Public Works Administration (PWA), which aimed to stimulate the economy by investing in large-scale public works projects. The PWA funded the construction of infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, and bridges, creating jobs for thousands and laying the groundwork for future economic growth. These projects not only provided immediate employment but also contributed to long-term improvements in public services and infrastructure. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) was also established to provide financial assistance to states for direct relief programs. This initiative allowed states to distribute funds to those most in need, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations received support in a timely manner. FERA marked a significant shift in government policy toward direct intervention in alleviating poverty and provided a model for future entitlement programs. In addition to these relief programs, the New Deal included regulatory reforms aimed at stabilizing the financial system. The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 separated commercial banking from investment banking, creating a barrier to limit risky financial practices that had contributed to the economic collapse. The establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sought to regulate the stock market and protect investors from fraudulent practices, restoring public confidence in the financial system. Furthermore, the New Deal brought about reforms in labor rights with the passage of the National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act) in 1935. This legislation guaranteed the rights of workers to organize, join unions, and engage in collective bargaining. This marked a significant shift in labor relations, as it provided a legal framework for workers to negotiate better wages and working conditions. The act resulted in a surge of union membership and empowered workers in their fight for labor rights. The New Deal also included social welfare programs, such as the Social Security Act of 1935, which established a social safety net for the elderly, unemployed, and disabled. By providing financial support to vulnerable populations, the Social Security Act marked a significant transformation in the government’s role in economic security, providing a foundation for the modern welfare state. While the New Deal faced criticism from various quarters, including conservative politicians and those who argued it expanded government power too far, the overall response to the Great Depression reflected a paradigm shift in how the government perceived its role in the economy. The efforts initiated under the New Deal laid the foundation for a more interventionist government and contributed to the eventual recovery from the Great Depression. In conclusion, the government’s response to the Great Depression through the New Deal was multifaceted and transformative. Through a series of innovative programs and policies, the government sought to address the immediate needs of a struggling population while implementing reforms to safeguard against future economic crises. The legacy of the New Deal continues to shape discussions around economic policy and the role of government intervention, highlighting the importance of adaptable responses in times of crisis. The Great Depression was not confined to the United States; its effects resonated around the globe, reshaping economies, societies, and international relations. As countries struggled with the fallout from the economic crisis, they faced unique challenges that often led to varying responses and policies. In Europe, the Great Depression had a devastating impact on economies already teetering on the brink following the devastation of World War I. Nations like Germany, which were grappling with the reparations imposed by the Treaty of Versailles, experienced severe economic distress. Hyperinflation, massive unemployment, and social unrest became commonplace as economic instability eroded confidence in democratic governments. The dire economic circumstances contributed to the rise of extremist political movements, most notably the ascent of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. Hitler’s regime leveraged the economic despair to promote its agenda, which included aggressive nationalism and expansionist policies. In the United Kingdom, the depression catalyzed significant political and economic changes. While initially, the British government adopted a hands-off approach, the rising levels of unemployment and growing public discontent eventually compelled leaders to take action. The Labour Party, which gained power in the 1929 elections, aimed to address the crisis through public works programs and unemployment relief. However, the severity of the depression led to the eventual formation of a National Government coalition in 1931, prioritizing economic recovery over socialist reforms and implementing austerity measures that included cuts to public spending. Countries in Latin America experienced backlash as well, particularly in relation to global trade patterns. Many nations were heavily reliant on exports of agricultural products, which suffered from the drop in demand during the depression. This economic hardship led to political instability, with some countries experiencing military coups as leaders exploited the social and economic unrest. For example, in Brazil, Getúlio Vargas rose to power in 1930 amid the tumult and initiated sweeping reforms to promote industrialization, which were partially in response to the weaknesses exposed by the Great Depression. In response to the economic calamity, some nations adopted increasingly protectionist policies, including high tariffs and import quotas. This drive for economic self-sufficiency often stifled international cooperation and trade, leading to an era of economic isolationism. Protectionism, exemplified by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in the United States, not only exacerbated domestic economic problems but also fueled tensions between nations as retaliatory measures took hold. While the depression compelled some nations to pursue isolationist policies, it also drove others to collaborate on economic recovery efforts. The establishment of agreements like the London Economic Conference in 1933 reflected the recognition of the need for coordinated international action to combat the crisis. Unfortunately, the conference failed to produce meaningful results as countries prioritized their national interests over global cooperation. The global consequences of the Great Depression also led to significant shifts in economic thought. Many countries began to explore Keynesian economic principles, which advocated for increased government intervention to stimulate demand during economic downturns. John Maynard Keynes, an influential economist, argued that governments should increase spending during periods of recession to boost consumption and promote recovery, contradicting prevailing economic philosophies that emphasized balanced budgets and limited government involvement. In summary, the Great Depression reverberated across the globe, resulting in significant economic, political, and social fallout. While some nations descended into turmoil, others sought to rebuild and adapt in response to the crisis. The diverse responses to the Great Depression underscored the interconnectedness of the world economy and highlighted the importance of international cooperation in addressing complex challenges—a lesson that continues to resonate in current global economic discussions. The Great Depression left an indelible mark on economic policy and societal norms, shaping the way governments and institutions approach economic challenges to this day. Several lessons can be gleaned from this tumultuous period, providing valuable insights for contemporary policymakers and economists. One of the most critical lessons is the importance of timely and effective government intervention in times of economic crisis. The initial laissez-faire approach taken during the early stages of the Great Depression led to a catastrophic decline in economic conditions and widespread suffering. The eventual recognition of the need for government action—exemplified by the New Deal—demonstrated that proactive measures could mitigate the consequences of an economic downturn and support recovery efforts. Today, many governments recognize the necessity of employing fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate the economy during recessions, showing the enduring influence of lessons learned from the Great Depression. Another vital takeaway is the need for strong regulatory frameworks to maintain financial stability. The lack of oversight in the financial sector contributed significantly to the events leading up to the Great Depression, resulting in risky practices and rampant speculation. In the aftermath, reforms such as the Glass-Steagall Act and the establishment of regulatory bodies like the SEC were implemented to stabilize the financial system. Modern economies continue to grapple with the balance between regulation and free-market principles, underscoring the importance of a robust regulatory framework to safeguard against financial crises. The Great Depression also highlighted the dangers of economic inequality. The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals contributed to volatility and limited the purchasing power of the broader population. Economists and policymakers today increasingly recognize that equitable economic growth benefits society as a whole and contributes to overall stability. Ensuring that wealth is distributed more evenly can create a more resilient economy, capable of withstanding fluctuations and crises. Furthermore, the importance of social safety nets became apparent during the Great Depression. As millions suffered from unemployment and poverty, the need for government-supported programs to assist vulnerable populations became clear. Modern social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance and food assistance programs, are grounded in the lessons learned from this historical event. These programs are critical to providing a measure of economic security and stability in times of hardship, ensuring that individuals and families are not left to navigate crises alone. Lastly, the Great Depression emphasized the interconnectedness of global economies. The ripple effects of the economic collapse demonstrated that no nation operates in isolation. Today’s policymakers must consider the impact of global trade, investment, and economic policies, understanding that collaboration and dialogue across nations are necessary to prevent similar crises from arising. Organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have emerged in part to facilitate international cooperation and provide support to countries facing economic challenges. In conclusion, the lasting lessons of the Great Depression continue to shape economic thought and policy today. The undeniable impact of government intervention, the necessity of regulatory frameworks, the importance of addressing economic inequality, the need for social safety nets, and the recognition of global interconnectedness are all crucial insights drawn from this period of crisis. As economies face new challenges in the 21st century, these lessons remain relevant, guiding policymakers to foster resilience and stability in the face of economic uncertainty. The Great Depression of 1929 serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of economic systems and the profound impact of financial crises on society. The confluence of factors that led to this catastrophic event, including stock market speculation, bank failures, and economic inequality, created a perfect storm that devastated millions of lives. The social, economic, and political repercussions of the Great Depression reshaped the American landscape, paving the way for government intervention and regulatory reforms that continue to influence economic policy today. From the establishment of the New Deal programs to the global responses that shape modern economic thought, the lessons learned during the Great Depression are invaluable. The importance of timely governmental intervention, the need for robust regulatory frameworks, the significance of addressing economic inequality, and the necessity of social safety nets cannot be overstated. Furthermore, the crisis highlighted the interconnectedness of the global economy, underscoring the importance of collaboration and communication among nations. As we navigate the complexities of today’s economic landscape, drawing on the experiences of the past can inform our approach to future crises. The resilience of societies in the face of adversity, coupled with the commitment to enacting meaningful reforms, can contribute to a more stable and equitable economic environment. The Great Depression reminds us that while economic challenges may arise, our responses can lay the groundwork for a more sustainable future for generations to come. This Shocking Video Will Completely Change Our World First Major Risks of a Cashless Society (New Update) According to- discoveryalert.com.au: The push for a cashless society represents more than just technological evolution—it’s a coordinated effort occurring at multiple levels of government, financial institutions, and corporations worldwide. This transition is reshaping how we interact with money and raising significant questions about financial freedom and privacy. The cashless society is a necessary step in preparation for the mark of the beast. The mark of the beast, btw, is a concept based on a couple of short passages from The Revelation (end of chapter 13 and start of chapter 14), which say that there will eventually be a one world government just before Jesus returns, and the spiritual leader of that government will cause people everywhere to get a mark put in their right hand or in their forehead, without which they will not be able to buy or sell. What we have used for centuries for buying and selling is cash (or checks). We have also progressed to credit cards. So all of these would need to be replaced with the mark, in order for the prophecy to come true. Is cashless society in World a bad step? Cashless Means Automatic If money is easy to spend, it is also easy to take. Convenience can easily become tyranny. Automatic payments that come directly from your bank account illustrate the point.) The convenience of digital money that allows you to spend your money more easily, also makes it easier for banks, governments and thieves to take it.The message to depositors is clear- when you put money in a bank you are a creditor of the bank and if it goes bust you are at the bottom of the list of creditors. Your money** will be seized as part of any approved plan, perhaps even before the broke bank files for bankruptcy. Your bank account can be raided by government authorities, like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) without notice or reason given. If the IRS believes your bank account deposit and/or withdrawals activity is suspicious and/or may involve a pattern designed to avoid reporting requirements, they may seize your account. Think your money is safe in the bank? Think again. Digital cash a bit of Trap-it can be stolen.Think digital money is safer than cash and can’t be stolen? Some actually believe that in a cashless society that crime will go down and drug dealers will go out of business. Think again. In a cashless society, theft will occur on line and in far larger amounts than cash heists. An online thief never has to confront his victim, commit violence, crack a safe, get past an alarm system, dog or armed guards and carry away his loot. Rather, in a cashless society, the cyber thief merely has to hack the systems where the ‘money” is. The online heist involves no risk of death or threat to the thief’s personal safety and can be done from anywhere in the world. Without cash, the value of currency would have no independent value outside a functioning banking system to which you have access. Your money wouldn ‘work’ without a functioning banking system. If the banking system is down due to a power outage, solar flare, financial crisis, Internet failure, hack or network crash, your money is unavailable and potentially lost. If back up files are lost how do you prove you had $15,000 in your account? Even if the digital banking system was 100% fool proof, you may end up being shut out of the system for wrong doing (actual or alleged), bad credit or failure to pay banking fees. Or you may be the victim of identity theft and as a “precaution” your account may be closed. Without access to the banking system, how will you pay your bills and buy items you need? While going cashless may be convenient when you choose to buy something, but if a purchase is thrust officiously upon you by government order, your money can be removed from your account to pay for it, conveniently of course. This type of forced convenience results in a removal of freedom of choice of how you may wish to spend your money. Property rights are the foundation of a free society. If you don’t have control, ready access or the ability to spend your money when and as you please, you do not really own it.Rather, you are a co-owner with the currency issuer (the bank) who has veto rights over your use of the currency. In a cashless society there is the loss of privacy. Digital money offers the convenience of allowing you to track and budget your money online. Such a system, however, also leaves a permanent digital foot print of where you spent your money, accesible to just about anyone who has access to your account. (crimminal hackers and government agencies). A common objection to this privacy invasion is that “If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about”. Without cash, consumers are no longer market participants that evaluate tangible value based on how much cash they have in their wallets, but mindless spenders without a sense of the value of the items they are purchasing or a sense of understanding of their actual cost after incurring bank and credit card interest fees. (still sky high even after years of zero interest rate policies across the globe). In a society that uses cash, acts like making change and giving tips provide market participants with a tangible sense of economic value. Children that grow up saving money in piggy banks and counting their pennies, nickels and dimes learn the value of money through the tactil experience of handling money. A cashless society turns money and value into digital abstractions as defined and controlled by the banks and central planners. What to Own When the Dollar Collapses When it comes to preparing for an economic collapse, there are a lot of different schools of thought. Some people believe that stockpiling food and supplies is the best way to go, while others think that having a stash of cash on hand is the key to weathering the storm. But what if neither of those options is available to you? What if the only thing left to rely on is your own two hands? In this blog post, we are going to take a look at every possible solution for what to own when the dollar collapses. A part of this article is summarized in the following video: Precious metals like gold and silver have been used as a form of currency and store of value for centuries. In times of economic or political turmoil, precious metals are often seen as a safe haven asset. Investors typically turn to gold when they are worried about inflation eroding the purchasing power of their paper money holdings. Gold is also seen as a hedge against geopolitical risk. Silver, on the other hand, is more industrial in nature and is used in many different industries, from electronics to photography. As such, it can be more sensitive to economic trends. When considering investing in precious metals, it’s important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Each investor’s circumstances are unique and will dictate what type of investment makes sense. But for those looking for an alternative to traditional investments like stocks and bonds, precious metals may be worth considering. A few additional precious metals for your consideration: When it comes to foreign currency, there are a few different options that can be considered. Investing in foreign stocks could be a very wise move. After all, if the value of the dollar plummets, then the value of foreign stocks is likely to go up since they will be priced in stronger currencies. Of course, there are risks involved with investing in foreign stocks. For one thing, you may not be familiar with the company or understand how it operates in its home country. Additionally, political and economic conditions in other countries can impact your investment (think Brexit). That being said, here are a few foreign stocks that could be worth considering: When it comes to protecting your portfolio from a potential dollar collapse, there is an option to invest in foreign bonds. Foreign bonds can offer stability and diversification, as well as the potential for higher returns. There are a number of factors to consider when investing in foreign bonds, including inflation rates, interest rates, and political risk. Inflationary risks are particularly important to consider, as high inflation can erode the value of your investment. It’s also important to be aware of currency risks – if the value of the US dollar falls relative to other currencies, your investment will lose value (in USD terms). One way to mitigate some of these risks is to invest in foreign bonds with shorter durations – that is, bonds that mature sooner rather than later. This way you’re not exposed to as much interest rate or currency risk. Another strategy is to ladder your investments, which means investing in a series of bonds with different maturity dates, so that not all of your money is invested at once. Of course, no investment is without risk – but by diversifying into foreign bonds you can help protect yourself against the potentially devastating effects of a collapsing dollar. As a side note, keep in mind that a direct purchase of foreign bonds can be a highly challenging task. Try going through an exchange-traded fund or a closed-end fund to ensure a successful purchase. The following video from Kingcademy gives a crash course on foreign bonds: While gold, land, and various commodities propose a physical form of investment, you can diversify your assets by investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is often called “digital gold” because like gold, it is scarce (there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence), durable (it can’t be destroyed or corrupted) and portable (you can carry millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin in your pocket). It also has similar properties to gold in that it isn’t controlled by any government or central bank. This makes it an appealing choice for people who are looking to protect their wealth from inflation or a potential collapse of the US Dollar. Other cryptocurrencies also offer similar benefits. Ethereum, for example, has been designed with the intention of being used as a global currency and platform for decentralized applications. This makes it different from Bitcoin, which was primarily designed as a digital store of value. However, both Bitcoin and Ethereum offer investors protection from inflation and the possibility of huge gains if they continue to rise in popularity and value. Collectibles can hold their intrinsic value even when the local currency loses its own value. Here are some things to consider collecting: Real estate is a solid option that shields you against the devaluation of the US dollar. Let’s review the reasons: For these reasons, investing in income-producing real estate should be considered by anyone looking to protect their wealth during an economic downturn. When the dollar collapses, land and agricultural commodities will be some of the best investments you can make. Here’s why: A major economical collapse might require more than just investing in precious metals and foreign currencies. There is a good chance you will need to live off the grid, away from your country’s control and infrastructures. Here are some things you can do to be prepared and survive: There is much more to learn about living off the grid, which is why I invite you to read my complete guide on off grid living. When the dollar collapses, barter items will become increasingly important. Here are some items that will be especially valuable. You will notice some similarities with the previous list, since both lists deal with items essential to your survival and independence. When it comes to investing in the face of an impending dollar collapse, there are a few key things you should keep in mind. First and foremost, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, so to speak. Invest in a variety of assets that will hold their value even if the dollar does tank. Gold and silver are always reliable choices, but, as stated earlier, you can also look into investments like real estate or art. Another important thing to remember is that timing is everything. If you wait until after the dollar has already collapsed, it will be too late to invest. You need to get ahead of the curve and start investing now. The sooner you do, the better position you’ll be in when (or if) the bottom falls out from under the dollar. Finally, don’t panic! It’s easy to let fear take over when thinking about such a potentially catastrophic event as a currency collapse. But try to stay calm and rational; otherwise you could make some very costly mistakes with your investment portfolio. Stay safe and be prepared! First take a look at one of the most shocking videos in the world! This video actually shows us what the secret of the Trump family is related to their expressive health!!! –FULL VIDEO HERE Hiroshima. Chernobyl. Nagasaki. Fukushima. They’re practically household names at this point. As such, most people know that the consequences of the radioactive fallout spread far beyond the borders of these towns and cities. What you may not realize, however, is just how far. In some cases, the consequences might seem trivial. Take, for example, the lack of salad greens throughout France for months following the Chernobyl disaster. Meanwhile, the black rain following the atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, were clearly devastating. In this regard, radioactive fallout can be elusive—taking a ruinous toll on some, while others are left seemingly untouched. Either way, the most important point to remember is that fallout is the inevitable result of practically any major nuclear event. It doesn’t matter whether you’re talking about a meltdown at one of the world’s 450 active nuclear facilities, a terrorist attack with a dirty bomb, or full-scale nuclear war: fallout will be a fact of life for anyone in the surrounding area. The silver lining? Radioactive fallout isn’t nearly as instantaneous, destructive, and unpredictable as a nuclear blast or meltdown. Indeed, it is something that you can prepare for—something you can work around and navigate your way through. Is It Legal To Go Off The Grid In Your State? In this video you will discover the most shocking things hidden by your government! So in this post, we’re going to take a deeper look at the nature of nuclear fallout and delve a bit deep into the chances of surviving a nuclear attack. This means we’re going to look at the science behind it, the basics of how fallout works, the situations that can arise, and the challenges you may face in the event of a nuclear disaster. We will also pay close attention to prevailing wind patterns and geography, allowing us to gauge how much radioactive fallout you would potentially be exposed to during a nuclear attack or disaster. And perhaps most importantly, we’re going to touch on a few basic things that you can easily do in order to prepare for—and ultimately survive—short-term exposure to nuclear fallout as you make your way to safety. For the roughly 100 million Americans living within the fallout zone of an active nuclear reactor, this could be an important read. So let’s get started… What few people appreciate, however, is the true magnitude of nuclear events—or the massive amounts of toxic fallout they can produce. After all, there are a few key things that nuclear bombs and meltdowns both do exceptionally well: Pulverizing matter over a wide area, nuclear events can create a tremendous amount of debris, ash, and particulates. These rapidly increase exposure for those in the immediate area—where the highest concentrations of fallout and radiation can be found. In a subterranean explosion, called a “base surge,” this phenomenon is even more pronounced—with an effect akin to that of an active volcano. Nuclear events irradiate this pulverized material, creating an unintentional but extremely toxic concentration of debris, dust, ash, and fallout—all while local residents are most likely seeking medical attention or escape. Finally, nuclear events propel the radioactive material into the stratosphere. In fact, in some cases, nuclear events can contaminate entire wind patterns with high concentrations of irradiated fallout. That’s how these events have lasting—albeit milder—effects hundreds or thousands of miles away. When it comes to determining the extent and volume of fallout following any particular nuclear event, there are two key factors to consider. First, there’s the location of the explosion. If it’s an airburst, then comparatively little fallout will be produced (but there will be a substantial EMP wave). However, if it’s a surface explosion, material will actually be pulled up into the nuclear cloud and irradiated before it’s carried along the plume into the upper atmosphere. Consequently, you might think an explosion over water would be more favorable—but that’s just not the case. You see, the explosion evaporates water and irradiates the remaining sea salt, producing much finer and smaller radioactive particles that can spread across a much larger area. This fallout can then seed clouds and rain back down on cities hundreds or even thousands of miles away. And it goes without saying that this fallout won’t simply wash off the outside of a building. Indeed, water surface bursts can even pulverize the sea floor. During the infamous Castle Bravo nuclear test, for instance, where a massive chain reaction was accidentally triggered due to the bomb’s peculiar construction, it was reported that calcinated white powder (pulverized coral) rained down on nearby boats. Subsurface bursts, meanwhile, become even more complicated, because the base surge they produce can flood the surrounding areas with lethal doses of radiation before the fallout even arrives. The second key factor is meteorological. Though it’s frightening to think that something as devastating as nuclear fallout is determined by the way the wind blows, that, we’re afraid, is exactly the case. This means that, due to the fine particulates produced by a nuclear blast, fallout can easily be carried over hundreds of miles in a matter of hours and days. Of course, the greatest intensity of the fallout is felt in the immediate area of the nuclear event, but radioactive materials can nevertheless spread far and wide due to its volatile nature. Part of this is accomplished through the animal kingdom. For livestock who graze in fields covered in nuclear fallout, for instance, their radioactive diet might prompt their extermination (as in Chernobyl). In other instances, however, they may spread the fallout further by carrying it in their fur, droppings, and bodies. Vegetation is a concern here, too. After all, crops can be dusted with fallout from an explosion hundreds of miles away, as was the case with the French salad greens mentioned above. These plants typically have to be safely destroyed to contain exposure. But ultimately, the nature of exposure, how it works, and what constitutes a lethal dose of radiation—these things are still widely debated and little understood. But, when it comes to fallout, there are a few things that can be said for certain: Fallout isn’t always predictable, it’s got devastating potential, and knowing what to expect can provide a crucial advantage at a time when most people will still be reeling. Facing the reality of a nuclear detonation (and the fallout that comes with it) might feel overwhelming to think about. With that said, it’s far from being a hopeless scenario. Consider Akiko Takakura, for example, who was just 300 meters from ground zero at the Hiroshima explosion but survived unscathed. Eizo Nomura, meanwhile, was even closer, at just 155 meters from the hypocenter. That means he stood less than two football fields from a nuclear explosion and still lived well into his eighties. This, of course, raises the question: how did they survive a nuclear bomb going off right on top of them while so many others perished? In reality, there are four key factors that will determine whether you’re safe from the fallout of a nuclear detonation or meltdown: As we’ll cover in just a moment, time is crucial after a nuclear blast. You’ll only have about fifteen minutes to seek sufficient cover, but radiation will die down to acceptable levels in most of the blast area after just a few days. Note that fallout is at its absolute worst in the first 72 hours, so it’s crucial to evacuate immediately or stay sheltered. After a few weeks, you’ll be able to make longer trips outside (if you haven’t yet evacuated). While there are a handful of cases like those mentioned above, close proximity to a nuclear blast and the immediate fallout tend to spell certain disaster. So while it makes sense to shelter in place during the worst of the fallout, your ultimate goal will be to put a safe distance between you and the bomb’s lingering radioactive effects. In an instant, the initial fireball and scorching thermal radioactive material of a nuclear detonation gives way to what’s called gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is notoriously powerful, able to penetrate inches of heavy material (even thick lead plating) and rapidly poison the body, so shielding can play a vital role in protecting you from radiation. Notably, both of the Hiroshima survivors mentioned above were underground in a shielded concrete basement, which was the key to their survival. Radioactive materials decay at different rates, which can affect everything from timing and distance to the amount of shielding needed to protect yourself. Here, it’s worth noting that each of these factors interacts with the others. So if you’ve got a robust enough shelter, you won’t have to worry so much about distance. Likewise if you enter an area weeks after the fallout has dissipated. In that spirit, let’s take a look at how you might really survive a modern nuclear event. First things first: if you’re exposed to a nuclear detonation or meltdown, it will be a hard thing to miss. You’ll either see it, hear about it on the news, take note of a special nuclear fallout alarm, or catch on as those around you react to what’s going on. In the first crucial minutes, your very first priority will be finding the best possible shelter nearby. This is because you’ll have about fifteen minutes or less to do so. Remember that cars provide absolutely no protection, and that any (indoor) shelter is better than being outside. Once you’ve found the right place, go to the deepest room inside it. You’re basically trying to put as many walls as possible between you and the outside world, even if that means holing up in a linen closet. Note that you’ll want to make sure you’re away from doors, windows, and anything else that might be exposed to the outside world. It’s even a good idea to tape up the cracks around doors and windows, to prevent particulates from seeping in. PRO TIP While we want to stress the importance and gravity of the information we’re presenting, we also want to establish some reasons as to why you should remain calm. Once you’re confident in your shelter, you’ll want to gather supplies. We’ll talk more later about which supplies are best to keep on hand (ideally you’ve got a bug-out bag), but you’ll want to lay hands on as much food, water, and other essentials as you can find without leaving your shelter. Once the fallout sets in, it won’t be safe to eat anything (even packaged food) from outside your shelter. It’s also a good idea to remove your outer layer of clothing, take a shower, if possible, and change clothes, as this ensures that you’re not wearing fallout in your shelter. The same holds true for any pets that were outside—give them a good wash to minimize radiation exposure. After that, waiting is the name of the game. Note that in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion, radiation levels will typically be extreme, and fallout will be at its worst. This is when you’re most likely to see effects like the black rain that came down on Hiroshima after the nuclear explosion there. Fortunately, the worst of this fallout will dissipate quickly. In some cases, radiation levels can drop from as much as 1,000 roentgens/hour to as little as 10 roentgens/hour in just the first three days. That’s why it’s so crucial to stay inside, away from windows and doors, during the entire first 72 hours. The video below will shock you because you will be among the first to watching this secret! This is where a radio can come in handy, giving you a crucial lifeline to the outside world. After all, for the next 72 hours, you’re going to want to stay buried as deep as possible in your shelter while the intensity of radiation outside plummets to more liveable levels. After that, in many cases it should be safe for short trips outside. Of course, there’s no guarantee, as each nuclear event plays out differently. Regardless, by the 72-hour mark, you can start thinking about making your way to safety or at least assessing your surroundings. Here, it’s important to stress that even if the nuclear event doesn’t happen in your immediate area—even if it’s hundreds of miles away—the fallout could still potentially reach you in a day or less. So, even if you’re just watching the news or monitoring releases from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) about a nuclear event on television, don’t hesitate to start making preparations. To survive nuclear attacks and ensure minimal damage, it will take more than being lucky; you should prepare. When preparing for something like a major nuclear event (and the fallout that comes with it), you run the risk of preparing in a manner that’s either too specific or too broad to be truly helpful. So instead, it’s best to break things down to their components—then focus on doing the best job with each individual component. For example, it’s generally a great idea to stock up on food and water. This is especially useful in the event of nuclear fallout, because the more food and water you have, the longer you’ll be able to stick to your shelter and avoid the radiation outside. Ideally, you’ll want at least a two week supply of food and water on hand. If and when that food is depleted, you’ll need an escape plan to get you to safety. If you’re in a city, that might mean making it to the country. Or if you’re on the coast, it might entail driving to a family cabin in the mountains. Regardless of your exit strategy, it’s important to have one, whilst keeping a few backups in case things don’t go exactly to plan. Since any realistic exit strategy will have you leaving your home after a few days, weeks, or months, it’s prudent to stock up on hazmat gear as well. MIRA Safety’s HAZSUIT, CM-6M mask, and NBC-77 SOF filter all have a long shelf life and can be paired with Kappler chemtape, tough chemical-resistant gloves, and overboots for complete protection. While it might be tempting to save a few dollars on your hazmat gear, it’s important to remember that not all suits are created equal. Ultra-cheap suits, for instance, can easily be punctured, exposing you to dangerous elements. Military suits, meanwhile, feature carbon lining and breathable composition, but they can be prohibitively expensive or hard to find (something we’re working on improving). Our HAZSUIT, on the other hand, strikes a nice compromise between the two, with reliable puncture-resistant performance and an appealing price point. It’s also great to keep an emergency package around for storms, blizzards, hurricanes or tornadoes. That kit should include a crank-style emergency radio, basic first aid kit, matches, flashlights, and other basic utilities. Once again, these are all great tools to have on hand in case of nuclear war—especially the radio. Some folks will even go as far as to prepare a special fallout room/nuclear war shelter, reinforcing walls with wood, concrete, bricks, and sand to thicken barriers and cut down on possible radiation. While this might seem like overkill, a few minor considerations can actually upgrade an existing storm/hurricane shelter to something that would increase your odds of surviving a nuclear event. Plus, even just a few inches of barrier could provide much needed protection from the gamma radiation mentioned above. In the end, there’s a wealth of knowledge to consult online, and there are plenty of contractors who would be willing to work with you on a custom setup. Perhaps the most specific preparation for nuclear fallout should be in your bug-out bag. After all, you may be at work, school, or otherwise away from home when a nuclear event occurs—in which case a bug-out bag is a crucial lifeline to get you to safety. That’s why there are a few must-have items we recommend for everyone’s bug-out bag: Thyrosafe tablets are a cheap and easy purchase—and one of the items most likely to save your life. But how do they work? Well, these powerful pills flood your thyroid with safe iodine, enough to keep your system from absorbing any for the next 24 hours. This is crucial, because radioactive iodine (I-131) is a major factor in nuclear fallout, accumulating in your thyroid and rapidly poisoning the rest your body with radiation. One little pill, however, has the power to stop that process dead in its tracks. A reliable gas mask, like the MIRA Safety CM-6M or military-grade CM-7M full-face gas mask, is a bug-out bag must-have. Although dangerous radiation can pierce concrete with ease, radioactive particles can still be extremely dangerous, especially in the immediate aftermath of a nuclear explosion. There might also be fires and chemical or biological elements in the environment. While a gas mask is only part of a larger system of personal protective equipment (PPE), it remains a staple, as it’s highly mobile, easy to carry, and can save your life in the right circumstances. To filter out that radioactive iodine, you’ll need a gas mask filter that’s reactor-rated. In this regard, the MIRA Safety NBC-77 SOF filter is a great choice, because it also provides protection against a number of other chemical, biological, and radiological threats while having a twenty-year shelf life and lightweight construction. Even if you’ve already got one at home, an emergency radio is well-worth the investment. After all, when hunkering down in a shelter, there’s a good chance that cell phones and standard phone lines will go down, but emergency radio broadcasts will let you know whether it’s safe to go outside. Note that these things cost just a few bucks, they’re compact, and they can be just as much of a lifesaver as the Thyrosafe tablets. Lastly, pack whatever else fits, including a hazmat suit and chemtape for sealing things up. Granted, these inclusions won’t necessarily be practical in most bug-out bags—indeed, it might be a better idea to just double down on your food supplies. Nonetheless, a hazmat suit and chemtape can be helpful for navigating the environment after you survive the first 72 hours. A gas mask, however, is a definite must-have, because it can be carried with ease and donned in a matter of seconds, while a hazmat suit can take substantially longer to deploy. Of course, this is all in addition to what you might already have in your standard bug-out bag—but it shouldn’t add too much weight. Note that MIRA Safety even offers a special package that includes a gas mask, filter, Thyrosafe tablets, and a drop-leg pouch to store it all. Regardless, these key preparations are easy to make—and potentially extremely useful in other situations as well (particularly in relation to the gas mask). We understand that the prospect of surviving the aftermath of a nuclear event is rather daunting. Hopefully, however, it seems a bit less overwhelming than it did just a few minutes ago. Make no mistake—it would still almost certainly be the single most challenging day of your life. And a variety of factors will inevitably remain well outside of your control. However, with a bit of careful preparation and consideration, you can vastly increase your own odds of surviving the nightmare of a nuclear explosion and attendant fallout. Remember: it’s all about those crucial first 72 hours. From the first fifteen minutes to those first three days, simple decisions could have massive consequences for your survival. So find the safest possible shelter, hunker down, and wait out the worst of the radiation. Granted, even after everything we’ve covered, even after preparation and planning, you’ve still got to be ready in case things go awry. So, what will you do if your primary shelter is suddenly out of the question? What if you don’t have a bug-out bag handy? Preparing for multiple contingencies with layered plans can further improve your chances of survival and help you adapt to challenges on the fly. Therefore, be sure to identify good shelter locations near the places you spend most of your time, and stock up on backups wherever possible.

Title: Ethereum’s $200B tokenized asset base backs analysts’ calls for higher ETH price
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-s-dollar200b-tokenized-asset-base-backs-analysts-calls-for-higher-eth-price
Time Published: 2025-11-11T17:47:11Z
Full Content:
Ethereum’s $200 billion tokenized economy, falling exchange supply and traditional finance footprint are fundamental factors that suggest ETH is undervalued. Key takeaways: Ethereum currently hosts $201 billion in tokenized assets, which is nearly two-thirds of the global total of $314 billion. Institutional growth led by BlackRock and Fidelity has driven a 2,000% surge in onchain fund AUM since 2024. ETH exchange supply hit a yearly low, hinting at investor accumulation and a stronger market floor. Ethereum's growing dominance in the tokenized asset landscape is reshaping how investors value its network fundamentals and its native token, Ether (ETH). As of Tuesday, tokenized assets across all blockchains amount to roughly $314 billion, with Ethereum accounting for $201 billion, nearly two-thirds of the market. This underscored its leading role as the most utilized settlement layer in crypto in 2025. Stablecoins continue to form the backbone of Ethereum’s network economy, representing the vast majority of transaction activity. Combined USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) issuance on Ethereum has sustained deep liquidity pools across DeFi, cross-border payments and exchanges, helping the network maintain one of the highest transaction throughputs in the industry. The expansion extends beyond stablecoins. Tokenized fund assets under management (AUM) on Ethereum has surged by nearly 2,000% since January 2024, driven by institutional entrants like BlackRock and Fidelity bringing traditional investment products onchain. Fidelity Digital Assets noted that, “beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, some of the most noteworthy developments in digital assets are happening in stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs).” The company highlighted that stablecoins have become a global medium of exchange, processing $18 trillion in volume over the past 12 months, even surpassing Visa’s annual throughput of $15.4 trillion. Meanwhile, RWAs have emerged as Ethereum’s fastest-growing category. Tokenized treasuries, funds and credit instruments on Ethereum now total $12 billion, representing 34% of the $35.6 billion global RWA market. Protocols such as Ondo, Centrifuge and Maple are fueling the surge by offering yields of 4%–6% on tokenized US Treasury exposure and secured lending products. Analytics platform Token Terminal noted that this expansion effectively anchors Ethereum’s $430 billion market capitalization to tangible onchain utility, noting that, “the market cap of tokenized assets on Ethereum has set the floor for ETH’s market cap.” Related: BitMine snapped up 34% more ETH last week as prices dipped Data from CryptoQuant pointed out that Binance, the largest Ether trading venue by volume, indicated that ETH exchange supply has declined sharply since mid-2025, hitting its lowest level since May 2024. After peaking in early summer, supply fell continuously through November, reaching about the 0.0327 level. This persistent outflow signals coins moving into cold storage or long-term wallets, a behavior typically associated with accumulation phases. Interestingly, this decline in exchange balances coincided with Ether’s price peaking near $4,500 to $5,000 in August and September before retracing to about $3,500 currently. Analysts noted that a reduced supply on exchanges tends to alleviate sell pressure, potentially setting the stage for price stabilization or renewed upside if investor risk appetite improves.

Title: Analyst Says Don’t Get Left Behind As Massive Liquidity Wave Is Coming For XRP

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A crypto analyst known as Pumpius has issued a bold warning on social media platform X, declaring that a massive liquidity wave is about to sweep through global markets, and XRP could be the key asset positioned to capture it. His post, shared alongside a chart of the US national debt now above $38 trillion, argues that a combination of government stimulus, monetary easing, and corporate spending is about to unleash a surge of capital unlike anything seen since the 2020 pandemic. In his analysis, Pumpius highlighted that the United States government is preparing to inject over $400 billion in new stimulus payments, and this is going to be the first direct round of such spending since 2021. This comes at a time when the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates despite inflation still sitting above 3% and labor market data showing signs of cooling. A similar setup in 2020 and 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic led to an enormous wave of liquidity that lifted both traditional and crypto markets to record highs. Now, President Donald Trump has vowed to provide each American a $2,000 dividend to be distributed from what he said was tariff revenue. The chart shown below illustrates a notable connection vividly: each major stimulus injection, from the $270 billion to $410 billion rounds, coincided with sharp jumps in the national debt and subsequent market expansions. With total US debt now projected to exceed $38 trillion, Pumpius believes another round of liquidity growth is close. The analyst went on to point out that this time, the liquidity wave is not just based on government spending but also on private-sector investment on an extraordinary scale. The so-called Magnificent 7 technology companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) are collectively pouring over $100 billion every quarter into artificial intelligence infrastructure. According to Pumpius, all this incoming liquidity needs a bridge, an asset capable of settling large-value transactions instantly across borders. He described XRP as the only digital asset designed precisely for this purpose, built for institutional-grade, real-time settlement and capable of handling global capital flows efficiently. Ripple’s technology already provides the financial infrastructure necessary to connect banks, fintechs, and payment systems that will need to move funds quickly as liquidity expands. “The math is simple,” he said. “The liquidity is coming. The rails are ready. Own XRP or be left behind,” he concluded. XRP is one of the top-traded digital assets by volume, and market participants are watching closely to see how the cryptocurrency’s price action plays out. Ripple, its parent technology company, has been making different partnership moves and company acquisitions to expand its reach. This is expected to hopefully boost XRP’s adoption on a global scale and, in turn, its price growth. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.45, down by 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

Title: U.S. Treasury greenlights staking for crypto ETFs
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/u-s-treasury-greenlights-staking-for-crypto-etfs/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T22:10:44Z
Full Content:
The U.S. Treasury has approved staking for crypto ETFs. The decision provides long-awaited clarity for asset managers, paving the way for yield-bearing ETFs by mid-2026. It officially allows U.S.-listed crypto ETFs to stake proof-of-stake assets like Ethereum and Solana and distribute staking rewards to investors. It levels the playing field between ETFs and direct crypto holders, enabling investors to earn passive yields within regulated products. The U.S. Treasury and IRS issued landmark guidance on 10 November, allowing crypto exchange-traded products [ETP] to stake digital assets and share rewards with retail investors. The safe harbor rules published in Revenue Procedure 2025-31 end months of regulatory uncertainty for major asset managers waiting to add yield-generating features to their Ethereum and Solana ETFs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the guidance would “increase investor benefits, boost innovation, and keep America the global leader in digital asset and blockchain technology.” Source: X Staking enables proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum and Solana, to validate network transactions. Validators earn rewards for securing the blockchain. Until today, U.S. crypto ETFs have been unable to participate in staking, despite direct crypto holders earning these yields. The new guidance changes that completely. ETFs can now stake their holdings through qualified custodians like Coinbase Custody, BitGo, or Gemini, who work with validator operators to earn rewards. The ETFs must distribute these rewards to investors at least quarterly. This gives regulated products a major advantage. Ethereum ETF holders can now earn staking yields through traditional brokerage accounts without managing validators or private keys themselves. Major issuers have been anticipating this moment since February. The SEC repeatedly delayed decisions, pushing deadlines from April to June, then to October. Asset managers waited anxiously while their non-staking ETFs underperformed direct Ethereum holdings by the foregone staking yield. Grayscale shareholders approved staking amendments in September, demonstrating investor demand for yield-bearing crypto products. BlackRock held closed-door meetings with the SEC earlier this year, adding to speculation that approval would eventually come. The safe harbor includes strict requirements. ETFs must trade on national securities exchanges, maintain 85% liquidity for redemptions, and stake only through unrelated third-party providers at arm’s length terms. The guidance protects trusts from slashing penalties where validators lose staked assets for misconduct. Existing ETFs have a nine-month window starting today to amend their trust agreements. This means Ethereum ETFs could begin staking by mid-2026. Solana ETFs is the latest, launched on 28 October. However, these funds launched without staking capabilities due to regulatory uncertainty. Today’s guidance provides the clear framework these issuers need. The Solana ETFs can now amend their trust agreements within the nine-month window to add staking, offering investors exposure to SOL’s higher yields of approximately 5-7% annually alongside the existing Ethereum funds. The guidance marks a significant shift in U.S. crypto regulation. Asset managers can finally compete with direct crypto ownership by offering institutional-grade staking through traditional investment vehicles.

November 10, 2025 16:59 ET | Source: Willis Towers Watson US LLC Willis Towers Watson US LLC NEW YORK, Nov. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Total assets under management (AUM) at the world’s 500 largest asset managers reached USD 139.9 trillion at the end of 2024, a 9.4% increase from the previous year, according to new research from leading global advisory, broking and solutions company, WTW’s (NASDAQ: WTW) Thinking Ahead Institute. This marks a continued recovery for the asset management industry with total assets now back above the record that was last set in 2021. This recovery was driven largely by managers in North America who registered the fastest growth, up 13% year-on-year and accounting for USD 88.2 trillion, or 63% of total AUM among the top 500 firms. Japan registered a decline from its asset managers, with AUM falling by 9.5% in 2024, highlighting regional disparities in economic and investment performance. On current growth rates, the UK, which was the second largest asset management market in 2019, now looks likely to fall to fourth position in the next five years, with France and Canada set to overtake it. Strategically, the industry is continuing to undergo a significant shift to passive investment strategies, which now account for 39.0% of total AUM, a 6.1% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, actively managed assets declined to 61%, down 3.6% year-on-year. The top 20 asset managers further consolidated their influence, now controlling 47% of total AUM, up from 45.5% in 2023. Their combined assets rose to USD 65.8 trillion, with 15 US-based firms representing 83.9% of this segment. Among these, BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity Investments retained their positions as the top three global managers, with BlackRock holding the top spot since 2009. This study also highlights the rapid rise of private-market specialists, whose AUM growth has outpaced traditional managers. For example, Brookfield’s AUM grew from USD 240 billion in 2017 to USD 1,061 billion in 2024 - an impressive 20% annualized increase over eight years and a rise of 46 places in the rankings, driven by investor demand for private credit, infrastructure, and real estate strategies. Across the regions, the Middle East has gained prominence as a strategic hub for asset managers, as regulatory reforms in the UAE, including updates to digital assets rules and the Qualifying Investment Funds regime, are attracting global firms to financial centres like the Dubai International Financial Centre and Abu Dhabi. Moreover, thematic opportunities in Shariah-compliant investing, ESG, and digital assets are aligning with national transformation agendas, making the region increasingly competitive. Elsewhere, Artificial Intelligence continues to become an enabler across the industry, with the study finding that 47% of firms are investing in AI for strategic, operational customer improvement purposes. However, adoption remains in its early stages, with 78% of firms allocating less than 10% of their tech budgets to AI. Despite this, the study did find 61% expect AI spending to grow over the next five years, whilst a similar number (64%) expressed concern about AI-related cyber risks. “This study paints a vivid picture of an industry in transition,” said Jessica Gao, Director of The Thinking Ahead Institute. We’re seeing a convergence of forces, from the rise of passive strategies and private markets to the growing influence of Artificial Intelligence. These trends are reshaping the very foundations of asset management. The scale of growth, particularly in North America, and the increasing concentration among the top 20 managers, signals both opportunity and responsibility. As stewards of nearly $140 trillion in assets, the industry must now balance performance with purpose, agility with accountability. This is a pivotal moment to redefine what long-term value means, not just for investors, but for society at large.” The world’s largest money managers Ranked by total AUM, in U.S. millions.

Easton, Maryland-based TeraWulf attributed the gain to Bitcoin's rising price, expanded mining capacity, and the start of high performance performance computing lease revenue. “The third quarter into the fourth has been remarkably busy for TeraWulf,” Paul Prager, TeraWulf chief executive officer, said in a statement, highlighting the a growing partnership with Fluidstack and Google. "These transactions demonstrate the strength of our platform and the trust that world-class technology partners place in our ability to execute." He added: “We are squarely focused on execution while advancing the next phase of growth for 2027 and beyond." Terawulf, which trades on the Nasdaq under the WULF ticker, was down 2.5% in after-hours trading Monday. WULF closed at $14.30, a 3.8% gain for the day. Over the past month, the company’s share price has climbed 7.6%. Preliminary guidance from Terawulf issued in late October said the company expected to report between $48 million and $52 million in revenue for Q3, representing an approximate 84% increase compared to the $27 million reported in the third quarter of 2024. TeraWulf went public through a merger with IKONICS in December 2021. At the time, it was more of a straightforward Bitcoin mining play. By late 2024, the company had started positioning itself to building "high-performance AI compute infrastructure." In August, Terawulf announced that it had struck a 10-year AI hosting deal with Fluidstack. The deal represents $3.7 billion in contract revenues, but could more than double to $8.7 billion through lease extensions. As part of the deal, Google signed on to backstop $1.8 billion worth of the AI firm’s lease obligations. In return, the Silicon Valley giant received 41 million shares worth of TeraWulf common stock, representing approximately an 8% pro forma equity ownership stake. "This is exactly the evolution we outlined: converting advantaged infrastructure positions into contracted megawatts with investment-grade counterparties and doing so at strategic scale," Prager said about the deal at the time. The deal gives Google a corporate stake that’s second only to Prager himself, who controls 10.7% of shares. The firm’s other institutional investors include Stammtisch Investments, Bayshore Capital, and Revolve Capital. Vanguard Group and BlackRock hold large positions too, but as passive index fund managers. The firms hold positions in nearly every U.S. publicly traded company.

Title: XRP Flashes Strongest Macro Bull Trend in Its History: Chartist

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP is printing its most constructive long-term structure on record, according to independent chartist “The Great Mattsby” (@matthughes13), who points to the three-month Ichimoku system and a year-long base forming above its key quarterly averages. On the latest 3-month XRP/USD chart from Bitstamp, the in-progress candle shows price around $2.31, with the Ichimoku conversion line and baseline tracking just beneath spot. The analyst highlights that XRP “has never built a base above the 3 month conversion or baseline in its history and it’s doing it now for the past year” (posted Nov. 8, 2025). That observation is notable because, in prior cycles, quarterly closes consistently failed to hold above those Ichimoku reference lines after rallies, whereas the current cycle has seen price stabilize on top of them for multiple quarters in a row. The present quarterly candle remains open, but the configuration—price above both the 3-month conversion and baseline—visually underscores the claim of an ongoing macro bull trend. And there’s a more bullish structure for XRP. XRP has been oscillating between the 0.886 Fibonacci retracement at $2.25877 and its 2018 cycle all-time high at $3.31700. Since early December last year, price repeatedly defended the $2.25877 band as support while failing to secure acceptance above the $3.31700 ceiling on the weekly chart, creating a horizontal range capped by the former peak. “To put things in perspective, XRP has been consolidating between the 0.886 Fibonacci level and its 2018 all-time high (2.25877–3.317). It’s building a strong base above the 0.886 Fib,” Mattsby wrote on Oct. 12, adding that this structure keeps XRP in what he calls a “#Palantiring candidate” posture. Although that remark is four weeks old, the argument remains intact on the posted chart: the 0.886 area continues to function as the pivotal shelf. Beyond the prior-cycle high, the same weekly framework maps out upside extension levels that would logically come into play only if $3.31700 is reclaimed and held. Those include the 1.272 extension around $8.29661, the 1.414 near $13.38940, and the 1.618 up at $26.63038. Closer to price, the stacked retracement supports below $2.25877 are clearly demarcated at $1.61246 (0.786), $1.12487 (0.702), $0.91531 (0.618), $0.61495 (0.500), $0.41315 (0.382), and $0.25257 (0.236), delineating the ladder of demand zones that governed XRP’s multi-year range prior to the latest advance. Taken together, the two timeframes tell a coherent story. On the high-timeframe Ichimoku view, XRP is maintaining altitude above its 3-month conversion and baseline for the first sustained period in its history—an objective sign of trend strength. On the weekly, price action has compressed into a well-defined band between $2.26 and $3.32, with repeated mean-reversions indicating accumulation rather than distribution while the market tests overhead supply at the 2018 high. As long as the 0.886 retracement at $2.25877 continues to hold on closing bases, the consolidation thesis laid out by The Great Mattsby—and the characterization of this as XRP’s strongest macro bull trend to date on Ichimoku terms—remains technically valid. At press time, XRP traded at $2.56. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Pachama laid off around 20 employees this summer as voluntary carbon markets softened. The company had attracted investments from a range of prominent names, including Amazon’s Climate Pledge, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and several celebrity angel investors, including Ellen DeGeneres, Laura Dern, and Serena Williams. “The current uncertain and volatile financial, economic, and geopolitical climate, added to the anti-ESG agenda in the U.S., is indeed having an effect on corporate sustainability budgets,” Diego Saez Gil, CEO of Pachama, told Trellis when the layoffs happened. “The impact is especially acute in the voluntary carbon market, which was already in a moment of correction.” Pachama had raised $88 million, while Carbon Direct had raised $60.8 million, according to PitchBook. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Pachama was focused on nature-based carbon credits, which typically result when forests are either restored or preserved. Carbon Direct, on the other hand, is more of a carbon market advisory and accounting firm, helping companies track and report their carbon footprints and then vet carbon credits to offset them. The carbon markets have been roiled by uncertainty in the last few years, and not all of it has been the result of political whiplash in the U.S. and elsewhere. Voluntary carbon markets have come under fire for falling short of their promises. For example, a major investigation by The Guardian found that more than 90% of one verifier’s credits did not actually result in any carbon reductions. One of the biggest challenges facing nature-based carbon credits is the question of whether forests protected by the purchases were threatened with destruction in the first place. And while large companies have been dialing back their publicity around ESG measures, many are still interested in sticking to their net-zero promises. Carbon Direct customers include Microsoft, Shopify, American Express, JP Morgan, Alaska Airlines, and BlackRock.

Title: McCarthy confident golden U20 generation will thrive

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Since the last Rugby World Cup, the age profile of this Ireland squad has come in for scrutiny. Even with the recent retirements of Conor Murray, Peter O'Mahony and Cian Healy, Andy Farrell’s side are leaning on an experienced core, which he appears to be banking on to get them to the next tournament in Australia in 2027. By the time that rolls around, many of tried-and-trusted frontliners in this Irish team will be well into their 30s. Bundee Aki will be 37 by the next World Cup, while Tadhg Beirne, Jack Conan, Jamison Gibson-Park, James Lowe and Stuart McCloskey will be 35. Tadhg Furlong, Josh van der Flier and Robbie Henshaw will all be 34. Some of those players may not make the next World Cup, while others might even last beyond it, but the reality is that within the next four years, each season will likely see a couple of hundred international appearances leave this Irish squad, one retirement after another. Farrell may be leaning on those players now, but the head coach knows he has to prepare for a changing of the guard, and the amount of Emerging Ireland, Ireland A and Ireland XV games that have been popping up in recent seasons illustrates that. Time will tell if that transition is a success or not, but for now, Farrell is content to slowly drip-feed experience to the next generation. It’s just over two years since arguably Ireland's best ever Under-20s side reached the World Cup final in Cape Town, capping off a remarkable 18 months under former head coach Richie Murphy, which saw back-to-back Six Nations Grand Slams, and just a second ever run to the world final. Of that 2023 World Cup side, three were involved for the Ireland senior team in Saturday's 41-10 win against Japan, with hooker Gus McCarthy (above), prop Paddy McCarthy and out-half Sam Prendergast all featuring off the bench. "It's really, really positive, and it brings such joy seeing lads you've played with come up around you," Gus McCarthy says. "I'm sure there'll be more in the years to come, plenty of lads in our age group, a lot of the lads playing later on today [for Ireland XV against Spain] and even some lads that aren't, that are really, really good players that I'd say we'll see, hopefully soon." Others from that group have had a taste of international rugby; from the 2022 Grand Slam winners, Jack Boyle has established himself as an international in the last 12 months, while tighthead Scott Wilson had a summer call-up. A star of the 2023 side, Hugh Gavin, was capped on the summer tour in Portugal, while Diarmuid Mangan, James McNabney, Fintan Gunne and Hugh Cooney have all been involved in extended Ireland squads. Brian Gleeson had been due to be with the squad in Chicago a fortnight ago, only for injury to rule him out. Leinster hooker Gus McCarthy – captain of the 2023 U20s - found his way into the Ireland squad through a series of injuries this time 12 months ago, and grabbed the opportunity with both hands. On Saturday he came off the bench to score his third Irish try on his eight appearance, although he isn't taking too much credit for the score. Gus McCarthy with Ireland's latest try as the home side move 17 points clear. 📺 RTÉ2 🖥️ https://t.co/b2OI4OoWVJ ✍️ https://t.co/x26q4bjNM0 pic.twitter.com/4cga8K3e6R "The lads that were on the pitch for the first 60, 50 minutes, putting in all the groundwork, they tired them down. "I was delighted to get a try. I can't say I did anything, it was the back of the maul. "I was obviously a bit nervous coming on, still very inexperienced, so just wanted to get into the game, you just want to get your first impact, kind of get you into the game. "It was in the balance, so I was very nervous but I wanted to just come on and try and make as much of an impact as I could and just play my own game. "I still feel like I'm still relatively inexperienced and kind of want to prove myself, but the lads are so accommodating to new lads coming into the group. "We saw there today with Tom Farrell, new lads coming into the camp fit in so seamlessly because the squad of lads we have are such an excellent squad. "All the leaders and all the older lads are so accommodating and kind of make you feel welcome and help you as much as they can when you come into the squad." His fellow McCarthy – Paddy – also got on the scoresheet, his first for Ireland in his second appearance, having made his debut against New Zealand last week. And having packed down alongside Paddy for several years dating back to their school days at Blackrock College, Gus isn't one bit surprised about how well his team-mate has settled into the Ireland squad. "You see, he's such an explosive talent, he's a big, big man, like his brother [Joe], I don't know what they have in them. "They just have some crazy strength in them and he's a very, very exciting player. I've played with him since we were about 11 so I know exactly what he can do. "It's really, really special to be out there together. We've played as a front row together for a very, very long time, so it's great just having him there now, I can trust him. "You can't just have players who play on paper. The two of them bring incredible amounts of individuality, and you need that in rugby. "As you saw today, he just picked up, went himself and scored. You need lads like that, so it's really, really good to have," Gus added. Watch Ireland v Australia in the Quilter Nations Series on Saturday from 7pm on RTÉ2 and the RTÉ Player.

Share this article BlackRock, a major asset manager actively managing institutional cryptocurrency holdings through spot Bitcoin ETFs, deposited 1,271 Bitcoin worth nearly $135 million into Coinbase today. The transfer to Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform facilitating large-scale institutional deposits, comes amid broader market uncertainty. BlackRock has been executing repeated transfers of Bitcoin and Ethereum to Coinbase Prime as part of deliberate portfolio management strategies. These deposits came amid growing optimism following reports of a possible end to the 40-day US government shutdown. On Sunday, the Senate approved a bipartisan funding deal that could allow federal agencies to fully reopen as soon as the measure is passed by the House of Representatives and signed into law by President Donald Trump.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin and Ethereum funds accounted for $876 million worth of withdrawals last week, more than any other issuer. The Fidelity Wise Original Bitcoin Fund accounted for another $438 million worth of outflows. The outflow from BTC and ETH funds was due to "negative sentiment that pervaded the markets due to ongoing gyrations in the crypto markets" thanks to the Oct. 10 flash crash and growing uncertainty about a December rate cut from the Federal Open Markets Committee. As of Monday morning, futures trading suggests there's a 64.6% chance that the FOMC will lower rates by 25 basis points during its December meeting, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. A month ago, traders thought there was a 91.7% chance that there would be another cut. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned last month that a further rate cut in December is not a foregone decision and acknowledged voices calling for the Fed to “at least wait a cycle” before reducing rates further. That's a bearish signal for crypto traders because, historically, Federal Reserve rate cuts boost the flow of capital into riskier assets like equities and digital assets. The CoinShares report also noted there is still a stark difference in activity for ETP shares on U.S. and European exchanges. U.S. exchanges had $1.2 billion worth of selling, accounting for the bulk of negative sentiment. But Germany and Switzerland inflows totaled $41.3 million and $49.7 million, respectively. "EPT trading volumes remained elevated at $43 billion for the week as flows on an intraday basis briefly recovered on Thursday as optimism grew that progress was being made towards resolving the U.S. government shutdown, but this prove short-lived, with renewed outflows emerging on Friday as those hopes faded," wrote CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill. Meanwhile, flow to Solana and other altcoin funds have been consistently trending positively. "Altcoins remained buoyant, with Solana seeing $118 million last week and $2.1 billion over the last 9 weeks," Butterfill said. "Other notable inflows were seen in HBAR ($26.8 million) and Hyperliquid ($4.2 million)." The Bitwise Solana ETF has had steady demand since it debuted Oct. 28. Canary Capital introduced its HBAR ETF, which trades on the Nasdaq under the HBR ticker, on Oct. 27 and has already attracted nearly $69 million worth of assets. And although there's currently no spot ETF that offers exposure to HYPE, the native token for the Hyperliquid Layer 1 blockchain, there is a 21Shares exchange-traded product trading on the SIX Swiss Exchange since August.

Title: Best Altcoins Like SUBBD Token Amp Up as BlackRock Stays Bitcoin-Bullish

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Bitcoin’s cooled off after ripping to six figures, and macro noise from Washington’s prolonged shutdown hasn’t helped risk appetite. Yet the world’s largest asset manager (BlackRock) isn’t blinking. Instead, it frames Bitcoin as a long-duration, structural bet anchored by network adoption, deeper liquidity, and the slow erosion of legacy money systems. And flows back it up. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) became the fastest U.S. ETF to surpass roughly $80B in assets and has since solidified its position at the top of the spot $BTC ETF stack. Translation: despite choppier price action, institutions are still dollar-cost-averaging Bitcoin via regulated rails. And with the U.S. shutdown now trudging toward a resolution, the policy overhang looks more like a speed bump than a trend shift. And over a week ago, BlackRock’s IBIT surpassed Coinbase’s Deribit platform and became the largest Bitcoin options venue in the world. For traders watching risk rotations, that matters. When majors grind sideways but the strategic case remains intact, capital looks at early-stage projects with promising utility. We’re talking about a bid on the best altcoins, and that’s where SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is trying to earn attention: a content-and-AI play that leans into content tokenization and the creator commerce industry, with fan engagement mechanics. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) isn’t just another presale pitch; it’s a creator toolkit built to do real work. The platform integrates AI assistants, voice cloning, and automated livestreaming into a single workflow, allowing you to script, produce, and publish with fewer tabs and fewer late nights. Fans receive clean, token-gated access to premium drops and livestreams, while you set flexible pricing, bundles, and perks that align with how your audience engages. Engagement feeds XP multipliers slot into raffles and simple games, turning passive viewers into committed members. You spend less time juggling calendars and more time shipping content: the AI helpers handle repetitive admin, so a larger share of each subscriber dollar lands where it should. The payoff is practical: faster production cycles, smoother paywalls, and stickier communities that come back for access, not hype. In a market tired of promises, a platform that saves time and deepens fan relationships is the utility that travels in any cycle. Plus, there’s a lot to look forward to, like strategic partnerships for marketing, enhanced AI image generation, the HoneyHive, and the release of the Creators mobile app. In a market that’s increasingly allergic to vapor, this is the kind of utility-first framing that can still resonate even when $BTC cools off. Visit the $SUBBD presale page to join. Presales live or die on incentives and clarity. In $SUBBD’s case, transparency is evident – over $1.3M has been raised so far, with the current stage pricing at $0.0569. Staking is another hook: tokens staked during the sale earn a fixed 20% APY for the first year per the whitepaper, shifting to platform-benefit staking thereafter. That’s high, but as always, view it as an early-stage incentive to bootstrap participation rather than a permanent yield regime. To join the presale, follow our $SUBBD buying guide. The presale accepts $USDT, $BNB, $ETH, $USDC, and fiat via a debit card. If BlackRock’s steady-hand view maintains a constructive backdrop while $BTC fluctuates, presales with immediate product hooks, such as $SUBBD, have a cleaner path to narrative alignment. ➡️ Grab your $SUBBD now.

Title: George Will Says Migrants -- Not Generation Z -- Will Revive America
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/11/10/george-will-says-migrants-not-young-americans-rejuvenate-america/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T08:58:31Z
Full Content:
Op-ed writer George Will, a pillar of the old-guard GOP establishment, is disgusted with Congress’s refusal to enforce more migration and used the Washington Post to air his grievances. Migrants “could improve the nation’s dynamism, and its understanding of itself. … [but] neither political party will seize the moment for immigration reform,” wrote Will, who was born in 1941, five years before the first Baby Boomers arrived in 1946, and 24 years before Congress restarted mass immigration in 1965 after a fifty-year shutdown. Will’s endorsement of more migration comes amid the growing public recognition of the economic damage caused by President Joe Biden’s inflow of illegal migrants and visa workers, including H-1Bs from India. The damage has exacerbated the widening optimism gap between older Americans and the younger Generation Z, of adults younger than forty. “Went to an event tonight, talked to three different people with zoomer kids,” said a Nov. 9 tweet from Rasmussen Reports pollster Mark Pitchell. “They’re demoralized.” “My friend group from high school, all graduated, great degrees from great schools,” recent graduate Nalin Haley told UnHerd, adding: It’s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job — not one. So I’m angry at that, because I’m having to try and help my friends get jobs when their parents got jobs immediately — not just after graduating college, but out of high school. “I see Boomers are trying to make their counter-argument” towards younger Americans, said Rich Baris, director at Big Data Poll, and the chairman of the National Association of Independent Pollsters. He continued: It’s pretty damned insulting to listen to people in older generations act as if these younger generations have all the options and opportunities they did. They do not. Boomers made sure of it. It’s even more insulting to see fools quote “Locke” in some ridiculous attempt to threaten them for not submitting to their way of thinking. “In 10 years, there won’t even be an argument, and the younger generations will make sure history remembers you as the generation who inherited it all, and left nothing to be inherited,” Baris wrote. Older Americans gained housing values and stock-market wealth from the huge technological advances since the 1940s, and from the vast economic stimulus provided by Congress’s policy of stimulating the economy with vast waves of legal and illegal migrants. But young Americans have seen their wages flatline, their debts grow, and their housing costs spike amid the Boomers’ imported population of roughly 50 million legalized, quasi-legal, or illegal migrants. RELATED: Sean Duffy — Gavin Newsom’s California Is Ignoring the Law on Illegal Alien Truck Drivers Yet columnist Will, aged 84, is all-in for more migration, saying migrants can rejuvenate the economy by forcing Americans out of low-wage jobs: Immigrants who fill jobs as domestic helpers, cleaners, waiters, car-wash attendants, meatpackers and other low-skill jobs drive productivity and social dynamism by allowing, even compelling, other workers to advance to more-skilled work. Migrants can also act as servants to free up better-educated Americans for commerce and possible childbirth, says Will, who was 29 when migrants were just 5 percent of the population in 1970 Regarding America’s sagging birth rate, research finds that low-skill immigrants (nannies, housekeepers, meal-preparers) “substantially” reduce hesitation about having children. The flood of migrants — presumably including clan migrants from Somalia, casteist migrants from India, and Jew-hating Muslims from Syria — can replace complacent Americans because it will “improve the nation’s dynamism, and its understanding of itself,” said Will, who has an estimated net worth of $4 million and who voted for Vice President Kalama harris in 2024. The main danger, Will argues, is that economic growth might be somewhat curbed by reduced migration: Three economists writing for the American Enterprise Institute have estimated that net U.S. migration might be negative this year — for the first time in history — by more than 200,000. Most economists think the question is not whether but how much this will subtract from economic growth. Will was referring to a report from a business-backed advocacy center, which concluded that “We find that the large drop in net migration in 2025 compared with 2024 will result in significantly slower labor force growth, slower employment growth, and a decrease in GDP growth of around 0.3–0.4 percentage points.” Mass migration is good for the stock market, but less migration is better for per-capita wealth, according to an investor-funded study described by Breitbart News in October. “At medium and low immigration levels, labor-based [skilled professional] immigration, characterized by fewer but more skilled population, produces higher GDP [Gross Domestic Product] per capita [emphasis added] growth,” compared to mass inflow of migrants and their extended families, says the September study published by Springer, titled “Demographic and Economic Implications of Alternative U.S. Immigration Policies.” “That should be a no-brainer because we know we could annex Mexico and our GDP would be enormously higher, but our per capita income would drop,” Rosemary Jenks, cofounder of the Immigration Accountability Project, told Breitbart News. “That’s just ‘Duh!’” The study is useful because “you have the advocates [for mass migration] themselves saying immigration is not a good deal for the average American,” Stephen Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, told Breitbart News. “It may be good for Wall Street, it’s not good for Main Street, ” he added. The study matches reality in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, where the estimated quality of life is declining and productivity is stalling because elites are importing consumers, renters, and workers to grow the nation’s real-estate prices and stock values. In contrast, President Trump and his deputies are pushing for greater productivity and automation instead of the mass migration favored by Will, progressives, and investors. We’re going to need robots … to make our economy run because we do not have enough people,” Trump told Breitbart News in August, adding: We don’t have enough people to do it. So we have to get efficient … we’ll probably add to [the existing workforce] through robotically—it’s going to be robotically. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told an audience of Silicon Valley investors in May. He added: And whether we’re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies, or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I’d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you’ve seen productivity stagnate. That’s not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” Fink added.

Changing Times Brewery, which was founded by the families behind some of Dublin’s best known pubs, is expecting sales to double next year with total keg sales of about 10,000, the group has said. The €2 million brewery, based in Glasnevin along the banks of the Royal Canal, is celebrating one year in operation this week. The brewery said it expects to see further growth in demand for its products, and that the increased sales will be driven by rising customer demand for its beers, expansion of the number of venues stocking their products and a further widening of their product range. A new product, called Bleedin Red Ale, becomes the fourth draft product offered by the brewery. Changing Times believes it will sell 3,000 kegs of Bleedin Red Ale by the end of 2027. A fifth beer is expected to be introduced in the first half of 2026. Changing Times products are now available in 33 venues across the country, up from the initial 15 pubs which stocked its products. The new venues include The Storyteller Pub on Grand Canal Street, Bill Ahernes on Aston Quay, The Oval on Abbey Street, Lock 13 in Sallins, Thomas Connollys in Sligo as well as Paul Flannerys, Jerry Flannerys, Patsy Flannerys and Phil Flannerys all in Limerick. The brewery’s backers include Dublin publicans Willie Aherne and Paul Sheehan of The Palace Bar on Fleet Street and Sheehans Pub on Chatham Street respectively, as well as Benny McCabe, who owns a number of bars in Cork, and brewer Shane Long. [ Changing Times Brewery beers to be stocked in nine new premises as it moves outside DublinOpens in new window ] Other backers include the publican families behind venues such as Arthur Mayne’s in Donnybrook, The Bank on College Green, The Blackrock, The Bridge 1859, Devitt’s, Doheny and Nesbitt, The Ferryman, The Long Hall, McSorley’s and The Swan. Pat Rigney, owner of The Shed Distillery, which is home of Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin, is another backer of Changing Times Brewery and also the group’s chairman. David Chawke, chief executive of Changing Times and owner of The Bank Bar and Restaurant on College Green, said: “We expect to see the number of keg sales double next year. “Practically since the day we launched we have had requests from customers for a red ale and thankfully we now are able to offer them a product we believe is as good as any other red ale on the market. “We see this product launch as another key marker for us. Adding a fourth product tap also further highlights the growing strength of our range on pub counters, creating more brand visibility for our brewery and for our existing strong line-up of beers. “It has been a really positive first year of operation for Changing Times and we are very happy with how everything has progressed. Launching a new brewery in this market was always going to be a risk, but we are very pleased with how our brewery has been received.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Bringing in a new generation of hardware wallets: An interview with Adam Budínský
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bringing-in-a-new-generation-of-hardware-wallets-an-interview-with-adam-budinsky/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T05:55:34Z
Full Content:
Most people don’t realize how deeply hardware wallets have influenced traditional industries. These devices proved a critical point: protecting digital identity, whether it’s a private key, a certificate of origin, or machine credentials, demands uncompromising hardware-based security. No shortcuts. No partial fixes. That idea of no compromise is key. For years, industries like industrial IoT, critical infrastructure, and manufacturing treated security as a checkbox. Think of PLCs controlling factory lines, smart meters on utility grids, or remote maintenance modules in power plants, threats seemed distant. Systems stayed offline. Security was someone else’s problem. But the landscape has shifted. Today, attacks are accelerating not just in volume, but in sophistication. And while attackers level up, the cost of launching an attack drops. This isn’t theory. It’s exactly what Trezor experienced when dealing with closed secure elements, and why Tropic Square was founded: to expose and address the hidden risks in hardware. The core issue is trust, or the lack of it. Can you trust the devices you operate? The machines that manufacture your products? In many cases, the answer is no. Most embedded systems weren’t built with serious security in mind. And that’s a problem, because low-assurance hardware is easy to hijack and repurpose by attackers. Now we’re seeing a shift: the same principles that drove the evolution of hardware wallets are being applied to industrial systems. Devices that look like wallets are appearing in factories and field deployments, anchoring machine identity, securing communication, and enforcing hardware-level trust. In an interview with Adam Budínský, Head of Hardware Product at Trezor, we discussed the technical challenges the team aimed to solve, and how the device reflects broader shifts in usability, transparency, and long-term crypto security. The crypto market is clearly maturing. We’re witnessing a major shift toward institutional adoption — from the launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to large asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity adding significant crypto exposure to their portfolios. Global Bitcoin ETF assets under management have already surpassed $170 billion in 2025, which shows how mainstream digital assets are becoming. At the same time, retail participation hasn’t returned to the levels we saw in previous bull markets. Institutional flows are now shaping the market more than retail sentiment, and that’s one reason why we haven’t experienced the same kind of retail-driven frenzy this cycle. Many newcomers prefer the simpler path of owning crypto through ETFs or custodial platforms instead of holding it themselves. But that convenience comes at a cost. The fundamental truth still applies — “Not your keys, not your coins.” True ownership means self-custody, and hardware wallets remain the only secure and transparent way to actually control your digital assets. At Trezor, our mission is to make that level of security accessible and intuitive for everyone, so users can enjoy the same confidence and independence as institutions — without relying on third parties. Trezor Safe 7 was shaped by a clear signal from our users: they wanted a hardware wallet that delivers not just security, but also modern convenience and premium quality. As our lives have become increasingly wireless and intuitive, people have begun to expect the same from their self-custody tools. This device brings those expectations to life — with secure Bluetooth connectivity, wireless charging, a seamless aluminum unibody, and a larger high-res display. At the same time, it introduces the world’s first transparent secure element, TROPIC01, built specifically to bring verifiability into the heart of hardware security. Each decision was guided by user feedback — and by our belief that the safest wallet should also be the easiest to use. Everything in our digital lives has become seamless and wireless — and we believe self-custody should be no exception. For too long, hardware wallets have lagged behind the level of convenience, durability, and premium design we expect from modern devices. With Trezor Safe 7, we set out to close that gap. From its aluminum unibody to encrypted Bluetooth connectivity and wireless charging, every detail was designed to make secure self-custody feel intuitive and sophisticated. But that seamless experience rests on a rock-solid foundation. We pioneered a new security model: the world’s first transparent secure element working in tandem with a trusted industry-grade chip — offering users both verifiability and resilience. That commitment to innovation is reflected across the hardware, from the safer, long-lasting LiFePO₄ battery to the fully auditable Trezor Host Protocol. This is what the new standard for hardware wallets should look and feel like — not someday, but today. We focused on solving two key issues: convenience and the trade-off between usability and verifiable security. Many users felt that hardware wallets lacked modern ease of use. We addressed that by introducing Bluetooth connectivity, Qi2 wireless charging, a larger color touchscreen with haptic feedback, and a durable aluminum unibody. We also designed a long-lasting LiFePO4 battery — built to endure years of use and deep discharge — so users can trust their wallet to stay ready whenever they need it. These improvements make self-custody feel intuitive, reliable, and accessible for everyday use. At the same time, we tackled long-standing concerns around secure element transparency. Trezor Safe 7 is the first wallet to pair a fully auditable secure element (TROPIC01) with an industry-trusted chip. This dual architecture offers both physical resilience and cryptographic transparency — giving users security they can verify, not just trust.” Trezor Safe 7 reinforces what Trezor has always stood for: open-source, user-first security. But with this release, we’ve taken that commitment to a new level. By giving users a device that’s both transparent and elegant — built with verifiable components like the TROPIC01 chip and backed by years of trusted engineering — we’re showing that we listen, we evolve, and we lead. This device isn’t just an upgrade in specs; it’s a statement of our long-term promise to the community. Every design choice, from the secure Bluetooth protocol to the unibody aluminum shell, was made to deepen user confidence. We want people to feel proud to use Trezor — and to trust that we’ll always put their needs and safety first. The goal was to create a device that feels reassuring from the first moment — precise, robust, and thoughtfully engineered. Trezor Safe 7 is milled from a single block of aluminum, giving it a clean and durable form. The Gorilla Glass 3 screen adds both clarity and protection, supporting long-term daily use. It’s compact and lightweight, but built to handle the responsibility of securing your crypto. We wanted the physical design to reflect the same principles as our software: security, transparency, and simplicity. The future of wallets will be defined by a convergence of strong security principles with the usability standards of modern consumer technology. As digital assets become more embedded in daily life, users will expect wallets to offer the same level of simplicity, portability, and design sophistication as other smart devices — without sacrificing transparency or control. This means moving beyond purely utilitarian designs toward tools that are both secure and accessible to a broader audience. At Trezor, we believe that true security starts with open-source — especially at the hardware level. You can’t prepare for the future if your most critical component, the secure element, is closed and unverifiable. That’s why Tropic Square committed to developing open-source secure elements like TROPIC01. It allows independent experts to inspect and verify how the hardware protects private keys, ensuring real trust rather than blind faith. Equally important, every true hardware wallet must have a screen. It’s the only way for users to independently verify what they are signing. Any product that claims to be a hardware wallet without a display is simply giving users a false sense of security. The ability to see and confirm transaction details directly on the device — not on a potentially compromised computer or phone — is the foundation of secure self-custody. Ultimately, the wallets of the future won’t just protect coins — they’ll embody a philosophy of verifiable trust and transparency. Open hardware, open firmware, and open cryptography are the only sustainable path toward long-term, quantum-resistant security. Disclaimer: This article may be in collaboration with a valued partner.

The network is fast becoming the home of real-world finance. PayPal’s PYUSD hit $18.6B in transfer volume and tokenized fund AUM jumped 2,000%. ETH remains range-bound below $3,500, with weak momentum and neutral derivatives data. Ethereum’s [ETH] on-chain economy is entering a new phase. PayPal’s stablecoin volume keeps climbing, and major financial institutions are now moving real funds on-chain. Tokenization isn’t just an idea anymore. It’s quickly becoming one of Ethereum’s strongest growth engines. PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD, hit its strongest quarter yet: $18.6 billion in transfer volume on Ethereum. This is a massive 260% jump year-over-year. The chart showed a steady climb across every quarter since early 2024, showing growing usage among both retail and institutional users. Source: X What’s driving this surge is simple: PayPal’s integration with onchain payments is turning PYUSD into one of Ethereum’s most active stablecoins. Tokenized funds on Ethereum have exploded, up nearly 2,000% since January 2024. The chart showed a clear inflection point earlier this year, driven by traditional giants like BlackRock and Fidelity launching on-chain versions of their funds. Source: X What started as a niche experiment in tokenized treasuries has turned into a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem. Simply put, the world’s biggest asset managers are validating Ethereum as the base layer for real-world finance. Ethereum was struggling to regain strength above the $3,500 mark at press time. The chart showed price action consolidating below the 9-day EMA, so short-term momentum was muted. RSI was at 37.7, indicating weak buying pressure, while the CMF at -0.10 indicates capital outflows from the market. Source: TradingView Trading volumes were subdued, which proves a lack of conviction among bulls. Source: Coinalyze Derivatives data support this caution. ETH’s Open Interest (OI) has slipped to around $17.6 billion, while Funding Rates remain near neutral at 0.0098%. ETH is seeing low leveraged activity. With volumes thinning and sentiment cooling, ETH remains range-bound unless a decisive breakout above $3,500 restores bullish conviction.

Title: Why BlackRock remains bullish on Bitcoin despite recent price slowdown

BlackRock frames Bitcoin's adoption, liquidity depth, and legacy system decline as drivers of long-term strategic value. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s recent struggle to hold the $100,000 level has revived familiar doubts about whether institutional demand is durable. However, in a new filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, BlackRock signals the opposite conclusion, saying its conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term relevance remains intact despite short-term market weakness. The firm frames Bitcoin as a decades-long structural theme shaped by adoption curves, liquidity depth, and the declining credibility of legacy monetary systems. While this view acknowledges volatility, it argues that Bitcoin’s strategic value is accelerating faster than its price suggests. That tone contrasts with a market where each pullback often renews questions about institutional endurance. A central pillar of BlackRock’s argument is Bitcoin’s network-growth profile, which it describes as one of the fastest seen in any modern technology cycle. The filing cites adoption estimates showing that Bitcoin surpassed 300 million global users roughly 12 years after launch, outpacing both mobile phones and the early internet, which each took significantly longer to reach similar thresholds. For BlackRock, this curve is more than a data point. It reframes Bitcoin as a long-duration asset whose value reflects cumulative network participation rather than month-to-month price moves. The firm also includes a decade-long performance matrix showing that, despite wild swings in individual years, which often place Bitcoin at either the top or bottom of annual return tables, its cumulative and annualized performance still exceeds that of equities, gold, commodities, and bonds. That framing positions volatility as a built-in cost of exposure rather than a structural flaw. For an asset manager whose products are designed for multi-decade allocations rather than short-cycle momentum trades, temporary stagnation appears less like a warning and more like a familiar feature of Bitcoin’s cyclical rhythm. The filing also emphasizes that the asset’s current slowdown has not dented institutional participation. If anything, BlackRock argues, Bitcoin’s underlying fundamentals of digital adoption, macroeconomic uncertainty, and the expansion of regulated market infrastructure continue to strengthen even as spot prices cool. A second theme in the filing is the argument that BlackRock’s own product, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has reshaped access to the asset in ways that support deeper institutional involvement. The firm highlights three areas, including simplified exposure, enhanced liquidity, and the integration of regulated custody and pricing rails. BlackRock stated that IBIT reduces operational frictions by allowing institutions to hold Bitcoin through a structure they already understand. According to the firm, custody risks, key-management issues, and technical onboarding, which have historically been barriers for institutions, are abstracted away in favor of traditional settlement channels. At the same time, BlackRock also highlighted liquidity as one of the most significant impacts IBIT has had on the market. Since its launch, the product has become the most actively traded Bitcoin ETF, contributing to tighter spreads and deeper order books. For large allocators, execution quality acts as a form of validation: the more liquid the product, the more institutionally acceptable the underlying asset becomes. Moreover, BlackRock also highlighted its multi-year infrastructure work with Coinbase Prime, regulated price benchmarks, and strict audit frameworks as evidence that Bitcoin exposure can now be delivered with standards comparable to equities or fixed income. Because of that design, the firm has processed more than $3 billion in in-kind transfers — a sign, it says, of institutional and whale confidence in its custody architecture. Notably, IBIT flows reinforce all of the points above. Since its launch, IBIT has emerged as the dominant Bitcoin ETF product in the market, with cumulative net inflows of $64.45 billion and over $80 billion in assets under management. In fact, IBIT’s inflows for this year have outpaced all of the combined flows recorded by the other 10 Bitcoin products in the market, according to K33 Research data. The most assertive section of the filing is labeled “global monetary alternative.” BlackRock describes Bitcoin as a scarce, decentralized asset positioned to benefit from persistent geopolitical disorder, rising debt burdens, and long-term erosion in fiat credibility. The firm does not frame Bitcoin as a direct replacement for sovereign currencies, but the implication is clear: the asset’s relevance increases as traditional monetary systems face stress. BlackRock also situates Bitcoin within a broader technological transition. As the most widely adopted cryptocurrency, Bitcoin functions as a proxy bet on the mainstreaming of digital-asset infrastructure, including blockchain-based payments, settlement systems, and financial market rails. In this context, Bitcoin has two intertwined identities as a monetary hedge and a technological exposure. This dual narrative helps explain BlackRock’s sustained bullishness. One pillar of the thesis is macroeconomic, tied to inflation dynamics, fiscal trajectory, and geopolitical fragmentation. The other is structural, tied to the ongoing global expansion of blockchain networks. Considering this, the recent slow price action does not meaningfully disrupt either thesis.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. (Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Paul Sperry / @paulsperry_ Paul Sperry is an investigative reporter for RealClearInvestigations. When Sen. Elizabeth A. Warren recently traveled to the Big Apple to endorse New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, she was asked if overt socialism is really the best model for Democrats to adopt. “You bet,” she replied in her signature folksy style. The Boston lawmaker wasn’t just jumping on the sudden trendiness of socialism three-and-a-half decades after its near-extinction. With Senate fellow traveler Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Warren has been a catalyst for moving her party to the left since her first campaign in 2012. She and Sanders are, in many ways, the godparents of the self-avowed democratic socialists such as Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who are providing the youthful energy for the Democrats in the Trump era. As Warren’s attacks on Wall Street and the wealthy are gaining even wider traction among liberals—a recent Gallup poll found 66% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism—the apparent contradictions between her public economic positions and private financial decisions are receiving new scrutiny, particularly as the onetime presidential candidate appears to be testing those waters again. Financial records examined by RealClearInvestigations show that Warren has hardly followed the path of socialism in her personal finances. Start with the redistribution of wealth. Warren tirelessly bashes the “selfish” and “greedy” rich for not paying their “fair share,” and demands the government step in and redistribute their income to the poor. But charity does not always begin in the Warren home. While Warren hauls in nearly $1 million a year, she donated less than 3% of her household income to charity in 2024, according to her tax returns. This is much less than the charity of the Obamas, for instance, who typically donate more than 20% of their earnings to the needy and philanthropic causes, and low for the average American in her income bracket, studies show. The average millionaire donates more than twice her share. It also appears that Warren opens her pocketbook wider when she’s running for national office and under a bigger media microscope. The $26,669 in charitable deductions Warren reported on her tax returns last year pales in comparison to the $81,858, or 9% of income, she reported as she launched her campaign for the White House in 2020. And the outspoken Democratic leader keeps her own tax burden down while calling for higher taxes on “millionaires and billionaires.” Records show Warren is not averse to taking maximum advantage of provisions in a tax code she denounces as unfair. She has, for example, written off used articles of clothing on her taxes and has had to correct past returns for inflating the value of those items. She’s also written off thousands of dollars in used books—and even in-flight Wi-Fi—to expense down business income. And she would exempt herself from her proposed “Ultra-Millionaire Tax,” which levies a surtax on those with a net worth above $50 million. With a net worth of at least $8 million (with estimates as high as $12 million), Warren has benefited handsomely from free market capitalism—even as she has spent most of her career in the public and educational sectors. Despite her frequent complaints that “the wealthiest 10% of U.S. households own 84% of American-held shares” of stock, she has invested the bulk of her money in stocks and bonds managed by Wall Street investment funds. These accounts are valued at between $1.9 million and $6.8 million, according to her most recent Senate financial disclosures, filed in April. (Values are given as ranges in the disclosure reports that members of Congress are required to file each year.) Although Warren has rarely traded individual stocks, records show the mutual funds where she has parked her millions—Vanguard and TIAA-CREF—hold a number of companies in industries that Warren has demonized, including Big Oil, Big Tech, and Big Pharma. Through these funds, for example, Warren has invested in Apple, Amazon, and NVIDIA; Exxon and Shell; Wells Fargo; Goldman Sachs; Monsanto; Johnson & Johnson; and even NewsCorp.—the owner of conservative Fox News and the New York Post. Nevertheless, Warren has ripped “fat cat bankers” at Wells Fargo for preying on minority homebuyers and customers with “predatory” rates and “junk” fees, and also for “screwing” their own employees. She even demanded the Federal Reserve revoke Wells Fargo’s status as a financial holding company over “abusive and unlawful” practices. Warren has called for regulators to break up tech giants Amazon and Apple, which she claims are running monopolies. “I’m sick of freeloading [tech] billionaires” who “roll over everyone,” she said recently. Warren has described Exxon as a “bad actor” that contributes to global warming. She’s even accused the energy giant of “corporate perjury” by publicly denying its alleged role in warming and producing “fake research” to “mislead the American people about climate change.” The senator has also slammed Exxon for “imposing massive price increases on Americans [sic] families,” arguing “this corporate greed is inexcusable.” Environmental activist groups have called on her chosen retirement fund, TIAA, to divest from Exxon, along with the rest of its more than $78 billion in oil, gas, and coal assets, according to a recent estimate by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. They argue the fund is using contributions from investors like Warren to “destroy communities and the environment.” Last year, Warren bashed Donald Trump for capitulating to the oil industry. “Donald Trump has a deal for Big Oil: if they raise $1 billion and send him back to the White House, he’ll gut environmental protections and roll back Joe Biden’s progress in fighting climate change,” she asserted on the social media platform X. “It’s corruption, pure and simple. And it would be a disaster for our planet.” Slamming the president’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill” earlier this year, Warren complained, “Trump’s tax cuts stand to benefit [the] highest-income earners.” She would know: She’s one of them. The $919,583 in household income Warren reported on her 2024 tax return she filed jointly with her husband puts her in the top 1% of highest-earning Americans. The year before she entered the Senate, Warren reported earning $616,181. The lawmaker’s base Senate salary of $174,000 accounts for just one-fifth of the total income she reported to the IRS. The rest comes from book royalties, dividends, capital gains, earned interest, retirement income, and husband Bruce Mann’s salary as a tenured Harvard professor. The Senate is often described as a Millionaire’s Club, and she fits right in: Her $8 million net worth would rank her as the 18th wealthiest member of the Senate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Warren’s net worth has risen each year since she was first elected to the Senate in 2012, while the median wealth of senators overall has declined, according to the think tank. Although Warren is just one of many millionaires in Congress, government watchdogs note her wealth is at odds with the stridency of her class-warfare rhetoric. “Elizabeth Warren poses as the champion of the underdog, but her policies strip middle- and lower-income Americans of opportunities to advance their lot and build wealth,” said John Berlau, director of finance policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, referring to her calls for more taxes and financial red tape. “By pursuing policies that keep others from moving up, Sen. Warren has emerged as an unlikely champion of the existing 1%.” Warren did not reply to requests for comment. Critics note that several of Warren’s former staff members have moved on to positions in the sectors she decries. In 2023, she declared, “The abuse of the revolving door is appalling,” particularly in the financial sector, which she claims is “rigged to help the wealthy and well-connected.” But records show her own office has served as a revolving door for the banks. For example, Wally Adeyemo, who served as her chief of staff when she was standing up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, went on to work as a senior adviser at investment giant BlackRock. At least six other Warren staffers who worked in her Senate office have worked as lobbyists, records show. In addition, several of her senior campaign aides have worked on K Street. “There is a history of a revolving door of Warren staffers and protégés at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau taking jobs at big Wall Street firms, such as BlackRock,” Berlau said. Homeownership is also key to wealth-building, but zoning restrictions often price the working class out of homes. Warren has fought against so-called NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) rules and has fiercely advocated for building more affordable housing in cities. She even backs Mamdani’s “social housing” proposal to let the New York state government seize private properties and convert them into public housing. However, Warren has chosen to live in affluent neighborhoods in Boston and in Washington, D.C., that are heavily zoned to exclude the construction of new housing units and price out the average homebuyer. Public financial statements do not disclose the 76-year-old legislator’s real estate holdings, but other records show she owns at least two homes valued at more than $5 million. Her primary residence is located in the leafy Avon Hill section of Cambridge, Mass., which has enforced a century-old zoning system of minimum lot sizes, minimum parking requirements, floor area ratios, limits on units per building, and height restrictions. The restrictions have yielded a housing shortage in the city that has driven up the value of existing homes—including Warren’s 1876 Victorian mansion, which has risen eightfold to an estimated $4 million since she bought it in 1995. Records show she and her husband owe no mortgage on their nearly 4,000-square-foot home, which features three stories, high ceilings, marble mantels, hardwood floors, and a four-car garage. The median price for a home in Cambridge now tops $2.2 million. “The astronomical increase in the value of Warren’s home, and home prices in Cambridge more generally, has not happened in a vacuum,” said Scott Van Voorhis, a Boston real estate analyst. “The city’s special blend of upscale NIMBYism and restrictive zoning laws and regulations kept new house, condo, and apartment construction to a trickle at best, even as demand for living in the city increased leaps and bounds.” Though the Cambridge City Council earlier this year loosened its zoning ordinances to permit more housing across the city, Warren’s neighborhood remains largely exempt from reforms. That’s because Avon Hill is a conservation district further regulated by the Cambridge Historical Commission. Records show Warren’s street and home are located within the historic district, which protects old Victorians from being torn down for multifamily housing. That makes her neighborhood the ultimate safe NIMBY zone. “Nothing has been built [in her neighborhood] for decades beyond the occasional mansion upgrade,” Van Voorhis noted. Warren clearly understands there is a housing supply problem in Boston. In July, she helped shepherd the ROAD to Housing Act through the Senate, which, among other things, would provide grants to communities that change their land-use rules to make it easier to build new housing units. “We have a real problem here in Massachusetts that we simply don’t have enough housing,” Warren explained to The Boston Globe, noting the state is about 200,000 units short of what is needed. “If we don’t start building more housing here, the housing crisis will continue to intensify.” But when it comes to her own neighborhood—one of the least affordable in the state—she remains silent. Cambridge City Council members noted they didn’t hear “a peep” from Warren when they were recently debating zoning reforms to deal with the city’s growing housing affordability crisis. In 2013, when Warren bought her home in Washington, D.C., she also happened to select an area of the capital city where zoning restrictions have entrenched the status quo. Valued at more than $1 million, her condo is in the trendy Penn Quarter section of the District of Columbia, which is a historic area protected by land-use rules. Most famously, Warren’s personal decisions seem at odds with the Left’s leavening of traditional socialist positions with identity politics. Before moving to the Senate, Warren was a tenured professor at Harvard with a lucrative salary. Although the school denies that her claims to Native American ancestry influenced their decision to hire her, she and the administration trumpeted her diverse background. Warren also listed herself as a racial minority in a legal directory distributed by the Association of American Law Schools and was listed as a Native American in federal forms filed by Harvard Law School. When she launched her political career in 2012 and released a memoir, “A Fighting Chance,” Warren described her alleged “Native American roots” as a Cherokee. Henry Holt & Company paid her a $525,000 advance for the book, which became a national bestseller that still earns her royalties. She also helped publish a cookbook, “Pow Wow Chow,” exploiting the myth of her Native American lineage. Warren took in $430,000 a year as a tenured Harvard Law professor by claiming a Native American heritage—even as she has railed against whites appropriating minority culture or pretending to understand minority experiences. But, as she ramped up her run for the White House, Warren responded to persistent challenges of this claim by taking a DNA test. In late 2018, her campaign maintained it showed “strong evidence” of Native American ancestry dating back generations. When that failed to quiet her critics, Warren basically had to acknowledge that the test revealed that she is as little as 1/1,024th Native American, making her less of that ancestry than the average white American. She also eventually apologized to the Cherokee Nation in 2019. The year before that admission, however, she lectured others during her Senate campaign about stolen valor: “It is wrong and cowardly for people to make fraudulent statements in order to receive distinctions that they have not earned. We need to ensure that no one can benefit from making false claims and steal the true valor of the courageous.” “If there ever were a genuine case of cultural appropriation, Sen. Warren is guilty of it,” said Gad Saad, a business professor at Concordia University, adding: She literally appropriated Native American culture as her own by constructing a false narrative about her ancestry. “And yet,” he added, “she benefited for several decades from this false narrative, both in her academic and political career.” Saad and others who have closely followed her career suggest the progressive senator appears to have a “good for me, but not for thee” ethic when it comes to her own personal ambitions. Though she’s carefully groomed a reputation as a fighter for the “have-nots” against the “haves,” the record shows that, outside the spotlight, she has often pursued her own interests and followed the path of the haves.

Title: Home debut a 'pretty special' experience for O'Brien

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist After his short international career to date had taken him through Tbilisi, Lisbon and Chicago, Tommy O'Brien was finally able to enjoy the real deal at home. The 27-year-old Dubliner won his fourth Irish cap in Saturday's 41-10 win against Japan, but his first in front of an Aviva audience. Friends and family in the crowd, Amhrán na bhFiann, and a different kind of nervous excitement. "That was pretty special," he said of the experience. "I had some family out. My grandparents came out; they haven’t been to a game since I was probably 18. They’re proper glory supporters, they came out for the Irish game. No, I’m only messing. "I was having a look during the anthems to see if I could spot anyone but I didn’t, which was probably a good thing. It might have sent me over the edge. But it was good, really special." The Leinster wing (below) was the standout player in an otherwise forgettable game of rugby, earning the man of the match award for a performance that saw him run for 143 metres off 12 carries, while making four clean breaks and winning two turnovers. He capped the day off with a try right at the end, but it was a score that capped off an excellent individual display rather than one which defined it. Drifting inside Sam Prendergast off a turnover, O’Brien steamed onto a delicate offload from the out-half before stepping on the gas to score his fifth international try, and first at Lansdowne Road. "Me and Sammy were on the same page, I could see he was going across but he didn’t have the wheels to take it the whole way so I dropped under him and he knew what I was going to do. It was nice to be on the same page like that. "I gave a nice little fist pump into the crowd afterwards, which was cool, but I was blowing hard getting back. "Sammy gave me a nice 50-metre run-in so I had to give it my all. I couldn’t get caught there!" The Blackrock man has taken to international rugby excellently after injuries forced his career to stutter during his mid-20s. He dipped his toe into the Test game during the summer versus Georgia and Portugal, scoring two tries in each of those games, and with Mack Hansen out injured, he was retained in the 14 shirt for the first two matches of this Quilter Nations Series block. "Obviously the summer tour was great to get in and get a taste of it, and then the last few weeks were a step up in terms of the level," he said. "The All Blacks game was very physical but I felt like I belonged at that level. I didn’t feel like I was shocked or anything like that but it’s just the margins are very small and you’ve got to nail every little small moment." FT: Ireland 41-10 Japan Much better from Ireland in the second half with Tommy O'Brien with their final try in their win over Japan at the Aviva Stadium. 📺 RTÉ2 🖥️ https://t.co/b2OI4OoWVJ ✍️ https://t.co/x26q4bjNM0 pic.twitter.com/B3s3dgkVmz It has taken O'Brien longer than he would have liked to become an Ireland international, but that isn't necessarily a negative as he reflects on the player he is today. "I'm also probably a lot more mature than I would have been, maybe if I was 22 or 23 or whatever. "So that probably helps me in terms of not being as nervous coming into the games. "I feel like I've worked very hard. I've had so many downs, so I just enjoy these kind of experiences, in these days. "I guess when you’re in [the game] it’s another rugby game, you’ve been doing it your whole life. I’ve been playing it since I was four years old. It’s kind of what I’ve been telling myself before I go out, 'it’s just another game of rugby’. "Obviously, you want to be able to feed off the crowd and the magnitude of everything and allow yourself to go to another level in terms of finding stuff within you physically that you didn’t realise you had, and using the crowd in that capacity. "But in terms of weighing on you and nervousness, I’ve actually been okay thankfully. Yeah really enjoying myself so far." © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Liberal Elites Kicked the Door Wide Open for Trump’s Flagrant Corruption

© THE INTERCEPT ALL RIGHTS RESERVED The president’s corruption is audaciously out in the open, but decades of letting the wealthy play by their own rules enabled him. Dylan is a senior researcher at the Revolving Door Project, where she leads RDP’s Economic Media Project. In his first term, Donald Trump appeared to be gunning for the title of most corrupt president in U.S. history. But after taking advantage of four years on the sidelines to ruminate about how to do better, he’s blown all competition completely out of the water in the nine months since retaking the Oval Office. Trump set off a media firestorm in 2017 by breaking from tradition and not placing his assets in a blind trust, instead choosing to entrust them to his children. The conflicts of interest invited by this farce were met with lawsuits, and #Resistance activists spoke about the emoluments clause of the Constitution as though they were constitutional law professors. Some reporting called this a “halfway blind” trust, which is sort of like a halfway-cooked chicken in that, for practical purposes, it’s a nonstarter. But after Trump left office in 2021, the Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuits, and Merrick Garland, Biden’s spineless attorney general, slow-rolled any investigations into the former president. Faced with few consequences for this first round of graft, Trump and company have flouted even the appearance of adhering to ethical guidelines since his reelection in November. The presidential transition process was delayed by the Trump campaign not filing internal ethics guidance for the transition team, and the inauguration fund’s coffers were filled with many millions of dollars from donors eager to get on the president’s good side. That panhandling set the tone for the administration. In October, a Trump benefactor gave $130 million to stave off what would have been a major political liability and cover the paychecks for service members during the government shutdown. The office space Eleanor Roosevelt once occupied has been unceremoniously bulldozed to make way for a gargantuan ballroom, also being funded by corporate “donations” from the likes of BlackRock, Booz Allen Hamilton, and tech giants like Apple and Amazon. The sticker price of the project has soared from $200 million to $350 million. To add insult to injury, the donors will likely write off their bribes to the latest Trump event venue as charitable contributions, as economist Dean Baker laid out. The president is working to intervene in negotiations around the sale of Warner Brothers–Discovery to ensure that his longtime supporters, the Ellisons, are able to add on to their growing media empire. And that’s just the past couple of weeks! It’s not for nothing that my colleagues at the Revolving Door Project have had more than enough material for a biweekly rundown in our Corruption Calendar. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington also recently published a timeline tracking national and state corruption since January 20. While Trumpian corruption is striking in frequency, scale, and just how routine it is starting to feel, this administration was the logical endpoint of the long-standing tradition of elite impunity. The second Trump administration is a striking monument to governmental misconduct, but the ground was broken long ago, with both parties laying the foundation. For the past half century, corporate and white-collar crime have gone largely unenforced. This was the result of both a widespread shift in views of governance (à la the Reagan Revolution) and a coordinated plan orchestrated to enable private wealth to hijack our democracy, as David Sirota and Jared Jacang Maher documented in their new book “Master Plan,” building on a podcast of the same name. Trump himself is a byproduct of the wealthy being empowered to violate the law. Seemingly his entire pre-government career was predicated on getting away with gaming bankruptcy law, committing widespread financial fraud, and racial discrimination. Now, in government, he is employing the “blitzscaling” model pioneered by firms like Uber to break the law faster than anyone can keep up with. The relentlessness of the Trump administration’s criminality is the point; it becomes borderline impossible to tackle any single instance of corruption if two more spring up by the time you finish reading up on it. This “flood the zone” strategy has been the hallmark of Trump 2.0. Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

Calls for Democrats to find their way back from the wilderness by forcefully rebuking corporate influence and corruption, something we at the Revolving Door Project have been urging as the cornerstone of progressive politics for years, are multiplying. Politicians, notably Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, both Democrats, are emerging as anti-corruption champions. To mount a real anti-corruption agenda, though, Democrats must go farther than just condemning the sundry glad-handing of Trump world. There is no appetite for going back to the halcyon days when everyone knew the legal code was merely a suggestion for corporate titans and the ultra-rich, even as they masqueraded as law-abiding citizens. “ Since 2008, it has only become more apparent that the wealthy play by an entirely different set of rules.” The Great Recession was a turning point; the extent of corporate lawbreaking in the financial sector was laid bare. And, famously, hardly anyone ever went to jail. Obama-era regulators, in many ways the acme of our last half-century of the hands-off approach to ruling-class misconduct, earned rebuke and scorn as “the chickenshit club,” afraid to square up against the powerful, if not overtly committed to serve elite interests. Since 2008, it has only become more apparent that the wealthy play by an entirely different set of rules. Trump’s first election was, in part, built on the argument that he knew “how to play the game.” In this telling, his ability to break the rules was actually an asset because he would break them for you rather than just for the powerful. It was always a dubious pitch, but it’s understandable why — faced with the choice between someone trying to convince you the game that’s obviously been fixed is actually not rigged, and someone who tells you how they cheat and promise to help you get ahead a little bit — people would gravitate toward the latter. Part of the early MAGA mythos was built on resignation to the fact that our rule of law is fundamentally perverted to create two parallel tracks of justice: an unforgiving, punitive, carceral system for most people, and a cushy, consequence-free dinner party circuit for the ruling class. The answer isn’t simply to go back to electing more reasonable politicians. As long as the two tracks of our justice system diverge, the game stays rigged. Dethroning Trump will not be enough to restore real rule of law; the Biden administration is proof enough of that. Donald Trump was excised from the White House with historically bad public sentiment in the immediate aftermath of a failed coup. Under Biden, the Garland Justice Department tried to wind the clock back to 2016 and resume operating the way establishment politicians did in the 1990s and 2000s. It failed spectacularly, allowing bad actors like Elon Musk to grow ever more powerful while continuing to flout the law with impunity. The result was an embittered Trump who faced no real repercussions for his corruption — the worst-case scenario. If and when Democrats control the executive branch again, they will have an even more daunting task after the second Trump term than they did the first, and their existing body of work does not inspire confidence. Business-as-usual enforcement did not fail to rein in corruption over the last four years because of strategic missteps. It failed because it is incapable of rooting out undue elite influence that’s baked into the very essence of the way we became accustomed to enforcing the law. Trump is an extreme example, but he is the logical extreme. As Trump pardons business associates, sets up meetings for his children’s business interests with foreign leaders, and grows his personal wealth, the consequences of failing to hold the powerful to account are more obvious than ever. The answer isn’t simply to go back to electing more reasonable politicians. As long as the two tracks of our justice system diverge, the game stays rigged and the Trumpian appeal to America’s id will stay firmly entrenched. To dislodge the hold that corruption has on our government and restore the rule of law, Democrats will need to decide who they really are — and who they’ll fight for. IT’S EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT. What we’re seeing right now from Donald Trump is a full-on authoritarian takeover of the U.S. government. This is not hyperbole. Court orders are being ignored. MAGA loyalists have been put in charge of the military and federal law enforcement agencies. The Department of Government Efficiency has stripped Congress of its power of the purse. News outlets that challenge Trump have been banished or put under investigation. Yet far too many are still covering Trump’s assault on democracy like politics as usual, with flattering headlines describing Trump as “unconventional,” “testing the boundaries,” and “aggressively flexing power.” The Intercept has long covered authoritarian governments, billionaire oligarchs, and backsliding democracies around the world. We understand the challenge we face in Trump and the vital importance of press freedom in defending democracy.

Title: JPMorgan Discloses 64% Increase In BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Holdings In 2025 Q3 — Details
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/jpmorgan-discloses-increase-bitcoin-etf-holdings/
Time Published: 2025-11-09T06:00:13Z
Full Content:
Global banking behemoth JPMorgan Chase has disclosed its increased exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency through BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). In the latest 13-F filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), JPMorgan disclosed its holding of 5,284,190 IBIT shares, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, as of September 30. This third-quarter figure represents a sharp 64% increase in the firm’s exposure to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. JPMorgan’s IBIT holdings, which were worth about $333 million as of September 30, are now valued at around $312 million. While the bank’s expanded position places it amongst one of the major institutional holders of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, it still sits behind other firms, like Goldman Sachs, with significantly larger holdings. Goldman Sachs disclosed that it held 30.8 million shares of IBIT in the first quarter of 2025. Furthermore, the filing with the SEC shows that JPMorgan held IBIT call options worth $68 million and put options worth $133 million as of September 30. The increased investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs is consistent with the bank’s price expectations for the flagship cryptocurrency. In a recent report, strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team shared that deleveraging in the crypto derivatives market, especially Bitcoin perpetual futures, appears to be mostly over. The JPMorgan analysts revealed that the recent rise in gold volatility has made BTC a more attractive investment option on a risk-adjusted basis. Using this gold-based model, the pundits argued that Bitcoin is fairly undervalued compared to gold and could see a significant upward movement to around $170,00 over the next 6 to 12 months. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands around $102,900, reflecting an over 1% jump in the past 24 hours. However, the premier cryptocurrency is still deep in the red on medium-term timeframes. According to data from CoinGecko, the BTC price is down by more than 6% in the last seven days. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has somewhat struggled over the past few weeks, registering significant withdrawals in the last two. According to data from SoSoValue, the exchange-traded fund posted a weekly net outflow of over $403 million in the previous week. Excluding its performance on Friday, November 7, BlackRock’s IBIT looks set to record a weekly net outflow of roughly $450 million. Nevertheless, the iShares Bitcoin Trust still ranks as the largest spot BTC exchange-traded fund with a net asset of $80.58 billion under management.

Rian Farrell was likely caught unawares this week when carving his name into the long annals of Irish athletics history. In registering with North Sligo AC, Farrell helped grow the Athletics Ireland club membership to 75,000 and it’s already tipped beyond that. November registration – when annual membership is counted – has now peaked at 75,078. It may have been a small gesture to name Farrell as their 75,000th member, but this is a big deal for Athletics Ireland, the governing body of the sport which has existed under various guises going back to the Irish Champions Athletic Club (ICAC) founded in 1873. It marks a 7 per cent increase on last November’s registration figure of 70,320 (the first to surpass the 70,000-mark), which in turn was a 9 per cent increase on the peak 2023 registration. All indications are the only way is up. Athletics, like many sports, also suffered a significant drop off in club membership during Covid-19. Registration more than halved in the first 12-month period during the pandemic, from 45,306 at the end of February 2020 to 19,702 at the end of February 2021. Growing that number above 75,000 is certainly impressive, and can be attributed to a variety of factors – not least in seeing Irish athletes enjoy their most successful ever year on the international stage. From the World Championships down to the European Youth Olympics, 21 medals were won, seven more than the previous best of 14 in 2019. In 2016, the international medal tally was three. [ Sonia O’Sullivan: With awards season upon us, Kate O’Connor should pick and chooseOpens in new window ] Role models and inspirations like this will help boost any sport and membership numbers are soaring across all ages and competitive levels. There is also a return of the running boom, the global phenomenon witnessed again last Sunday when there were 59,266 finishers in the New York City Marathon – breaking the previous record of 56,640 which finished the London Marathon last April. Athletics Ireland also pointed to the increased engagement at schools and community level and the rise in the number of athletics coaches trained through its education programmes. Until recent decades, Athletics Ireland and its many predecessors – including the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) and Bord Lúthchleas na hÉireann (BLE) - were only concerned with the competitive end of the sport. As, in turn, were most of the athletics clubs. Not anymore. It’s not the winning that matters, it’s the taking part, and that goes for the roughly 360 clubs throughout all 32 counties. [ Ireland’s Fionnuala McCormack finishes 10th in New York City MarathonOpens in new window ] Yet, behind these numbers, many clubs are struggling to meet the demand for new membership. Particularly at juvenile level, with significant waiting lists now being the norm, especially among the biggest clubs in the country. That’s not good news, not if any young aspiring athletes are ultimately lost to other sports. Dundrum South-Dublin AC, better known as DSD, is a case in point. It’s far from the oldest club in Dublin – and positively modern compared to the likes of Clonliffe Harriers, founded in 1886, and Donore Harriers, founded in 1893. With 1,200 members, DSD is now the biggest athletics club in Ireland, but not alone in turning away younger members because there simply isn’t enough room. The club was founded 40 years ago, with the merging of Dundrum AC and South Dublin AC, and for lifelong DSD member Gerry McGrath, the first decade or two was about maintaining club membership at around 150. Enough to keep everyone happy, even if there was a struggle sometimes to find that critical fourth man on the club cross-country team. The 1,200 members are now perfectly split between a 50:50 gender balance, all the way up from under-8s to over-70s, and an even half of which, around 600, are juveniles (under-18). There is also that waiting list, which averages about 200. [ ‘Setting big dreams’: Where Ava Crean, Ireland’s newest marathon sensation, might go nextOpens in new window ] “It’s a pity we can’t take everyone,” says McGrath, “but that primary school age is quite intensive, in that you need one coach for every 10 kids. A kid at that age could also be on the waiting list for a few different athletics clubs. Because most of the Dublin clubs do have a waiting list at those ages. “We did have a strategic plan, a few years ago, to grow the club to 2,500 members. But we’re not actively recruiting in any area at the moment, we stalled all that last year, until we could get more of a grip on it. That might change, but we still have physical limitations. Even though we’re one of the best served clubs in terms of our own track and our own running trails.” It’s just three years since DSD opened its own home track and trails off Tibradden Road, just up the hill from its former natural training ground at Marlay Park. That project continues to expand with the addition of new indoor running straight and club hall, set to open next year. As well as the surge in demand for juvenile membership, McGrath also points to the growth in DSD’s training group – now rebranded as the Meet, Train & Race. “That started 15 years ago, with maybe three or four guys, maybe in their late 40s, who wanted to run a marathon for the first time. “Now our Meet & Train is well over 200 members, attracting a few new members every week. We had 80 members in the Dublin Marathon last month. The sport is surging at all levels like that. “The problem isn’t getting volunteer coaches. We have 130 volunteers, some who would do seven days a week, all voluntary, to maybe a mother or father, who helps out for an hour. But it still takes tremendous coordination.” Blackrock AC is another southside Dublin club that is booming, with a celebratory dinner in January to mark its 1,000 members for the first time. On the northside, Raheny Shamrock is developing its first home facility at St Assam’s Church, again to help meet the growing demand for membership. It all makes for healthy reading for Athletics Ireland, as long as waiting lists for juveniles don’t come at the cost of kids being lost to the sport.

Paul Henry’s Coastal Landscape with Galway Hookers Late taoiseach John A Costello is believed to have bought the painting directly from Henry A painting believed to have been bought directly from Irish artist Paul Henry by the late taois­each John A Costello will be offered for sale at auction later this month. Coastal Landscape with Galway Hookers, which is estimated to be worth €150,000, is one of two Henry paintings Costello left to his children. He died in 1976, aged 85. Dubliner Costello was also a barr­ister, attorney general and Fine Gael TD. He was taoiseach twice, from 1948 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957. James O’Halloran, director of ­Adam’s auction house in Dublin, said they sold one of the paintings “almost a decade ago and now we have been consigned the second”. The previous painting was sold for €115,000. Mr O’Halloran said it “is thought by his family that John A purchased the two paintings directly from the artist as there is no record of them being in any exhibition. The painting is unusual as it has two Irish traditional sailing boats, known as hookers, in it”. It has remained in the family since. Costello’s son Declan was also attorney general, and president of the High Court. He died in 2011 at the age of 84. Other works of interest in the upcoming auction is an oil painting by Jack B Yeats, dated to 1912 and entitled In a Dublin Waxworks, with an estimate of €70,000. Previously belonging to Guinness heir Garech Browne, it hung for many years in Luggala Estate in Co Wicklow. Late taoiseach John A Costello is believed to have bought the painting directly from Henry Yeats visited the old Dublin Waxworks in Henry Street in 1905 and made a sketch that he used as the basis for the work. It has a historical significance as a glimpse of a lost Dublin institution, which burnt down two years after the painting was completed. Sculpture is prominent in the sale, with works in bronze by Melanie Le Brocquy, John Behan, Imogen Stuart and Rowan Gillespie. Adam’s pre-Christmas sale of Important Irish Art will take place on November 26 in their St Stephen’s Green rooms at 6pm, and includes about 150 lots. Last week, deVeres auction house on Kildare Street in Dublin saw demand for Eileen Gray-designed items soar. Her famous Transat chair was sold for €10,500. It had an estimate of between €4,000 and €6,000. A blue leather bar stool designed by the renowned architect sold for €4,200; it had an estimate of €1,200. A Jumo lamp designed by Gray was valued at between €600 and €900 but went for €2,800. A set of six rosewood dining chairs by Danish designer Neils Moller made €10,500 - more than three times the asking price. A Svend Ge Madsen-designed Rosewood desk went for €7,000, more than double its estimate of between €2,000 and €3,000. Elsewhere, Adams Blackrock has an exclusive one-off jewellery auction featuring more than 750 pieces consigned by a long-established Irish jeweller that is closing its doors. Elena McCrory, senior associate with Adams Blackrock, said there has been an increase of “younger people interested in vintage jewellery due to sustainability and price. The price of gold has increased substantially, so nine-carat gold pieces garner a lot of interest”. The selection showcases a wide range of contemporary gold jewellery set with precious gemstones. The auction will take place online on Thursday.

Title: The forgotten Irish artist: How does an artist make thousands of artworks, then just disappear?

Great work tends to announce itself even without the benefit of hype. Many moons ago, when Paul Finucane was involved in setting up the medical school at the University of Limerick, in 2007, he and his colleagues decided to establish a collection of medicine-related art for the benefit of students at the college. “I came across a painting called Embryo with Gas Mask at an auction house,” Finucane says. A provocative piece, the work had been used, with its artist’s permission, on an anti-nuclear-power poster in the 1970s. “It’s the notion of an embryo needing to be protected from the environment by having a gas mask,” Finucane says. “While it’s a challenging image, there’s no question about the quality of the draughtsmanship.” Its creator’s name was Donal O’Sullivan. Finucane, a keen collector as well as founding dean of the school of medicine, embarked on a little detective work to learn more about him. This obscure artist, he discovered, had been prolific in the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Dublin, he had gone against the expressionism that was fashionable in Irish art circles at the time, trading instead in powerful, elegant and melancholy figurative art that often discomfited its viewers. A prize winner and college activist, O’Sullivan had been a mover and shaker in his early life; at one point he appeared in the front row of the audience of The Late Late Show to protest against inadequate facilities at the National College of Art, resulting in important reforms. Then mental-health frailties set in. O’Sullivan died by suicide in 1991, aged just 46. In subsequent decades, he was largely forgotten by the art world, his work left to gather dust. It was, Finucane says, an unfortunate lack of recognition. That oversight is being addressed in a handsome book about O’Sullivan’s life and work, which gathers together his creations with reminiscences from Robert Ballagh, Vincent Browne, Annie West, Una Sealy and Cóilín Murray, among other well-known names, along with deeply felt reflections from family and other friends. Finucane and Brendan Lyons of Red Barn Publishing, in west Co Cork, who suggested the book to mark what would have been O’Sullivan’s 80th birthday this year, hope to establish him as an important artist. “We tend to gravitate to stories around people who have not received the attention they deserve,” Finucane says. “Donal was someone who was able to argue for a cause but unable to do the same for his own work and career,” Lyons says. “He was a conundrum.” Ballagh, who wrote the foreword to the book, knew O’Sullivan as a young man – he had been friends with his brother – and appreciated his hard-won skill as a figurative artist. “My studio is in Stoneybatter, and opposite where I am there’s a rather large house which he had a flat in,” Ballagh says. “I used to bump into him. To develop the kind of skills that Donal had takes years and years of endeavour and commitment. Anyone who had an interesting face interested Donal. He was fascinated with Samuel Beckett’s face, with Alberto Giacometti’s face.” Born in 1945 in Dublin, O’Sullivan was, Ballagh says, a shy man who was “also quite convinced of what he was doing”. When he was growing up, his parents, Mary and Patrick, ran a grocery in Ranelagh called Lily’s Dairy. Donal was the fifth of six children, a dreamy character who loved playing with his toy soldiers and drawing constantly, taking the greaseproof paper that separated the layers of Coconut Cream biscuits and working faces into the stains left on the paper. [ How did a small Irish architectural firm come to design one of the world’s biggest museums?Opens in new window ] “He enjoyed a bit of craic – as family we’d all have a loud laugh, and we’d sit together and the craic would bounce back and forth – but he was anxious nearly all of the time,” says his sister Marie O’Sullivan, a fellow artist, who also contributes to the book. “Even to go out the door it took effort.” After studying architecture for a year at Bolton Street College of Technology, in an effort to do something sensible, O’Sullivan switched to the National College of Art, then based on Kildare Street. It wasn’t long before his talents were noticed. He won the Taylor Prize twice, in 1967 and 1968, while at the college. Gerald Davis, of the Davis Gallery on Capel Street, offered him an exhibition while he was still a student, and Suzanne MacDougald showed his work at her Lad Lane Gallery. A distinctive presence dressed in black, with a helmet of hair and a Crombie coat, O’Sullivan had a painstaking working method that relied on sometimes frowned-upon techniques. He drew from images ripped from newspapers – a practice forbidden at art college – and would etch on bread paper, the thin tissue used to wrap loaves. He wasn’t a natural agitator, but he’d had the benefit of a good education as a student at Blackrock College, in South Dublin, and was dismayed by the deficiencies he found at the National College of Art, which was using outmoded methods of teaching, and in any case had inadequate premises. After months of peaceful protest, O’Sullivan, a charismatic spokesman for the student body, decided enough was enough. The students staged a sleep-in from April 22nd until May 28th, 1969. “If you want to protest about a situation, after everything else has failed, you just bring it to a halt, you have a work-in. If you want to stop something happening in a college, you occupy it,” he told The Irish Times on June 19th that year. The protests succeeded. In 1971 the college moved to its current location, on Thomas Street in the Liberties. “He’d be shy and anxious and on edge,” Marie O’Sullivan says of her brother. “But he wouldn’t let that stop him protesting. He would force himself to go in and talk to Brian Lenihan” – minister for education at the time – “and be that public if he felt strongly about something”. Donal’s work was very lyrical, romantic, meticulously drawn, at a time when people were painting brutal commentaries After graduating with an honours diploma, O’Sullivan set himself up in a chaotic studio in an old henhouse in the garden of his family home, on the corner of Ranelagh Road and Sallymount Avenue. A few chickens that remained would cluck over the work he discarded, leaving deposits to which he paid little heed. The hens weren’t his only challenge. The climate at the time was harsh on artists. O’Sullivan was prolific: his studio was crammed with discarded drawings in charcoal and pencil, some of famous names, such as Sinéad O’Connor. Over his lifetime he would make thousands of artworks. But they didn’t seem to offer a vital critique of Ireland in the manner of work by other artists of the day, and he struggled to promote himself, failing to turn up even to his own exhibition launches. He found his main employment as a teacher at Dún Laoghaire School of Art and Design. “Dublin was a grim city,” says Una Sealy, an artist and former student of O’Sullivan’s. “A lot of it was falling down. A lot of the Georgian buildings were either being demolished or held up with girders. There was massive unemployment. Donal’s work was very lyrical, romantic, meticulously drawn, at a time when people were painting brutal commentaries.” Figures such as Patrick Graham and Brian Maguire drove a particular creative vision. “They would have been the artists that people looked up to in the late 1970s and 1980s. Donal’s work was of a high standard, and it has held that quality. But there was a couple of decades when that would not have been in fashion.” Persuading people to buy art was itself quite a feat. “I grew up in the 1960s and 1970s,” Paul Finucane says, “and about the only thing you’d ever see in somebody’s house was a Sacred Heart lamp and a photograph of the pope and maybe John F Kennedy. To have any kind of original art would have been considered a gross waste of money.” A notice from the Evening Press in 1981 carps that O’Sullivan is “too shy to attend his own exhibition but has no handicap when it comes to putting a price on the tag. It’s a pity, really, that people of undoubted talent gain their exclusivity by putting their work out of reach of the many who have vacant places on their walls.” [ A Syrian artist who took refuge in Dublin: ‘Picasso came to this life to open a door. I hope I can open a door’Opens in new window ] Then there was the melancholy aspect to his work that sometimes put people off. “There’s a sadness to his work,” his sister says. “That’s what hits people. People see a kind of darkness. If I was to show his work to someone who has never seen it before, they would nearly always come back and say there’s a darkness or sadness to it.” At certain times in his life O’Sullivan was on medication for anxiety and depression. He became a heavy drinker. He had lengthy stays in hospital, where he seemed to have undergone electroconvulsive therapy: a handwritten poem reflects on the experience. There is great pain in Marie O’Sullivan’s voice when she talks about those periods. A section of the book is devoted to recollections of the Ana Liffey Drug Project, the addiction-aid service where O’Sullivan gave some art-therapy and counselling time. “It was amazing for him to put himself forward to try and help while he was still struggling,” she says. “He was involved in so many things.” By the time the artist died, in 1991, he had fallen out of touch with many of his old friends. When Brendan Lyons began tracking them down, many were delighted to have the opportunity to talk about O’Sullivan and his effect on them. At the book’s recent launch at Cnoc Buí Arts Centre, in Union Hall in west Cork, where Mel Mercier performed an original composition set to O’Sullivan’s poetry, several contributors spoke about their relationship with O’Sullivan, reflecting on his many gifts as a listener, encourager and friend. “I learned so much from him,” Joan Cronin, his former girlfriend, said. “He was generous with his knowledge. I enjoyed the arts, but he gave me the confidence to be critically thinking about it.” For Marie O’Sullivan, who has spent years seeking to re-energise interest in her brother’s art, the attention has been hugely gratifying. “There were so many stories. At the launch, things came up that I didn’t realise. Each person had their own little story of the time they spent with him. I didn’t actually break down – I was afraid I would – but I was very close to tears.” The contributors hope that the book will go some way towards restoring O’Sullivan to his rightful place in Irish art and that curators might pay more attention to his work. “I’d be much more interested in some of the institutions taking an interest in him than the auction houses,” Ballagh says. For Sealy, it’s important that a younger generation of artists become acquainted with him. “Younger artists won’t know who he is,” she says. “He was a very important part of Irish art. What he has done has contributed to what people are doing now. It’s important that this record of his life has been compiled by Brendan and Paul. It’s cementing his legacy.” In a life cut short, the work still speaks, even now. “I’m optimistic,” Marie O’Sullivan says of the future. “Very optimistic.” Donal O’Sullivan: An Artist Remembered, by Paul Finucane and Brendan Lyons, is published by Red Barn; it is available from cnocbuiarts.ie/publications and selected bookshops Sign up to the Irish Times books newsletter for features, podcasts and more © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ethereum: How $10B short squeeze could fuel ETH past $4,500

Here are top three factors that increased the odds of a short squeeze on Ethereum. Massive shorts above price on top of buyer activity and bullish sentiment increased the chances of a short squeeze. Only if the current momentum persists, breaking all resistances below the mark, can Ethereum reach $4,500. Ethereum[ETH] surged by only 5% in the recent market bounce after liquidating shorts that came in at the bottom. The market was showing signs of a reversal, with massive shorts at risk of liquidation. The addition of buy orders from whales and institutions on top of shifting sentiment all set the altcoin up for a run toward $4,500. As of press time, Ethereum price liquidated late short orders that came in below the $3,600 mark after dropping to $3,200. Massive shorts were building above the $3,600 zone, while those of latecomers were disappearing. Over $10 billion in Ethereum liquidity was stacked between $3,600 and $4,500, just above the current prices. Source: CoinGlass Based on current market patterns, Ethereum’s price may be approaching a key breakout zone. If buy orders push past the $3,600 level, it could trigger a rapid short squeeze, potentially driving the price beyond $4,500. Because liquidity is tightly clustered near these levels, short sellers may not have time to react. Whales and institutions were capitalizing on the dip as they were accumulating between $3,000 and $3,400. For instance, a Bitcoin insider whale who had shorted BTC just before the tariff crash took a long position on Ethereum. The whale placed a 5x leverage long on Ethereum, with the position amounting to 40,000 ETH valued at $138 million. His closure of the BTC long position was a hint that ETH could rise faster than Bitcoin in the current conditions. Source: Mister Crypto/X That was not the only buy on ETH. BlackRock also bought $35 million worth of Ethereum, as per CryptoGoos. This further supported a potential comeback for ETH price amid shifting market sentiment. Speaking of market sentiment, the crowd and smart money were all bullish on Ethereum. In fact, the informed money was more convinced than the retailers, as the sentiment gauge read 0.23 against 0.21. Source: Market Prophit This was reflected across the entire crypto market, which rose by 1.35%, at press time. All these observations pointed to a looming short squeeze that could take the price past $4,500. However, the charts indicated that for this price to be hit, short-term levels at $3,460, $3,900, and $4,200 had to be cleared. Source: TradingView Therefore, breaking these zones could push the price past $4,500, as all factors were aligning for such an undertaking.

Title: ZCash (ZEC) Euphoria Is Finally Here — Time To Cash In?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. ZCash (ZEC) has been one of the highlight performers in the cryptocurrency market over the past few months. Although the general digital asset market has faltered in recent weeks, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency has continued to ascend to new price highs. While the large-cap assets have been waxing and waning in terms of market value, the price of ZCash has been on a tear in the past week, breaking into the list of the top-20 largest cryptocurrencies in the sector. Now, the latest on-chain data suggests that euphoria is setting in the ZEC market. In a November 7 post on social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson revealed that the ZCash market might be overheating after weeks of significant upward price movement. According to the on-chain expert, the sentiment surrounding the coin seems to have finally reached the euphoria stage. Wedson noted that the group of network participants mostly behind this euphoria is the ZEC miners. This on-chain observation revolves around two primary metrics, including the Puell Multiple and the Hash Rate. For context, the Puell Multiple is a metric that correlates the issuance value of an asset to its 365-day moving average. This metric measures miners’ profitability on an annualized basis, signaling potential market tops or bottoms. According to the highlighted data from Alphractal, the ZCash Puell Multiple just hit an all-time high, indicating significantly high profitability for the miners. This on-chain signal also suggests that the ZEC price could still have more room for upside movement. Furthermore, Wedson revealed that the ZCash Hash Rate is on a rapid ascent, meaning that miners are devoting more computational resources to the privacy-focused network. As seen with the premier cryptocurrency, a rising Hash Rate often coincides with extended price rallies. Ultimately, the increasing Puell Multiple and rising Hash Rate signals strong network fundamentals for ZCash, which suggests that the price growth seen so far is not solely market speculation. As of this writing, the price of ZCash stands at around $714, reflecting an over 30% jump in the past 24 hours. Price action data shows that the ZEC coin is having the second-strongest annual performance in its history, having soared roughly 1,500% in the past year. In an earlier post on X, Wedson projected an extreme upside of around $1,650 for the price of ZCash. While the current ZEC price already suggests elevated risk for investors, reaching as high as $1,650 would represent full-on market euphoria.

Opeyemi is a proficient writer and enthusiast in the exciting and unique cryptocurrency realm. While the digital asset industry was not his first choice, he has remained absolutely drawn since making a foray into the space over two years. Now, Opeyemi takes pride in creating unique pieces unraveling the complexities of blockchain technology and sharing insights on the latest trends in the world of cryptocurrencies. Opeyemi savors his attraction to the crypto market, which explains why he spends the better parts of his day looking through different price charts. “Looking” is a rather simple way to describe analyzing and interpreting various price patterns and chart formations. However, it appears that is not Opeyemi’s favorite part - in fact, far from it. Being able to connect what happens on a price chart to on-chain movements and blockchain activities is what keeps Opeyemi ticking. “This emphasizes the intricacies of blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency market,” he would say. Most importantly, Opeyemi thinks of any market insights as the gospel, while recognizing that he is only a messenger. When he is not clicking away at his keyboard, Opeyemi is most definitely listening to music, playing games, reading a book, or scrolling through X. He likes to think he is not loyal to a particular genre of music, which can be true on many days. However, the fast-rising Afrobeats genre is a staple in Opeyemi’s Spotify Daily Mix. Meanwhile, Opeyemi is a voracious reader who enjoys a wide category of books - ranging from science fiction, fantasy, and historical, to even romance. He believes that authors like George R. R. Martin and J. K. Rowling are the greatest of all time when it comes to putting pen to paper. Opeyemi believes his reading of the Harry Potter series twice is proof of that. Indeed, Opeyemi enjoys spending most of his time within the four walls of his home. However, he also sometimes finds solace in the company of his friends at a bar, a restaurant, or even on a stroll. In essence, Opeyemi’s ambivert (haha! been searching for an opportunity to use the word to describe myself) nature makes him a social chameleon who is able to quickly adapt to different settings. Opeyemi recognizes the need to constantly develop oneself in order to stay afloat in a competitive and ever-evolving market like crypto. For this reason, he is always in learning mode, ready to pick up the slightest lesson from every situation. Opeyemi is efficient and likes to deliver all that is required of him in time - he believes that “whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well.” Hence, you will always find him striving to be better. Ultimately, Opeyemi is a good writer and an even better person who is trying to shed light on an exciting world phenomenon - cryptocurrency. He goes to bed every day with a smile of satisfaction on his face, knowing that he has done his bit of the holy assignment - spreading the crypto gospel to the rest of the world.

The Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices are down today after a brief rebound yesterday. Crypto pundit Nobler has suggested that these price declines are due to price manipulation rather than a wave of sell-offs among investors. CoinMarketCap data shows that the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices are on the decline today, following significant gains yesterday. In an X post, Nobler stated that Binance, Wintermute, and BlackRock were all selling Bitcoin ahead of the Federal Reserve’s announcement. This explains the DOGE and SHIB decline given the meme coins’ correlation with the flagship crypto. Nobler alleged that these firms have sold over $1.5 billion in Bitcoin and continue to sell more. The pundit added that there was too much market manipulation. Bitcoin is currently struggling to hold above the $100,000 level, which has sparked a bearish sentiment towards the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. The Dogecoin price is currently trading way below the psychological $0.2 level, while the Shiba Inu price continues to underperform, down over 53% since the start of the year. The foremost meme coins are also at risk of a further decline, with speculations that the crypto market might already be in a bear market. Market maker Wintermute recently claimed that liquidity has stopped flowing into the crypto market, which is why the bull market has halted while the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices decline. The market maker further noted that momentum in stablecoins, ETFs, and digital asset treasuries (DATs) has slowed, highlighting a liquidity drain in the market. Notably, companies such as CleanCore and Bit Origin had accumulated DOGE earlier in the year but have since slowed their purchase of the foremost meme coin. Meanwhile, Santiment data also showed that there has been a drop in DOGE and SHIB whale transactions, which also explained the decline in the Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices. Despite the recent decline in the Dogecoin price, crypto analyst XForce stated that the macro target for DOGE remains between $1 and $2, which would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the foremost meme coin. He noted that DOGE has arguably been one of the best idealized Elliot wave 5-wave structures on the macro up to the wave 4 termination point. Furthermore, XForce remarked that the only bullish option left will be observed as an Expanding Ending Diagonal, as impulsive options are now off the table. Meanwhile, crypto pundit SHIB Booster stated that the Shiba Inu price could rally soon as tokens from last bull season are now recording significant gains. The pundit added that a small wave of momentum could send the SHIB price back toward the mid-range, around $0.00001603. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: T Rowe Price’s Calculated Bet: Why the Quintessential “Singles Hitter” Is Swinging for Crypto

In the buttoned-down world of institutional asset management, T Rowe Price has long been the firm that makes boring look brilliant. While competitors chased hot trends and flashy returns, the Baltimore-based firm built its reputation as the quintessential “singles hitter,” compounding modest, steady gains into industry-leading long-term performance through disciplined, research-driven processes. Which makes the 87-year-old firm’s October 2025 filing for the T Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF seem, at first glance, utterly out of character. Cryptocurrencies? The asset class synonymous with wild volatility, 70%+ drawdowns, and a $6.2 million banana duct-taped to a wall? For a firm that has weathered every market cycle since 1937 by staying boringly sensible? Yet for those who understand T Rowe Price’s culture, the move is precisely in character. Because when Price’s research leads somewhere, the firm follows, even when it means moving ahead of the crowd into uncomfortable territory. Price is decidedly not an early mover. The filing comes nearly two years after the SEC’s watershed January 2024 approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which triggered what one analysis called “a 400% acceleration in institutional investment flows” and have since attracted over $150 billion in assets. BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and ARK dominated that first wave, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) becoming the third-largest ETF by inflows in 2024—trailing only broad S&P 500 index funds and accumulating over $50 billion in assets in less than a year. By late 2025, the landscape will have exploded into what Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas describes as an impending reality where there will be “more crypto ETF filings than stocks.” Over 92 cryptocurrency ETF applications now await SEC review, covering everything from single-asset Solana and XRP funds to multi-crypto index products, staking-enabled ETFs, and even proposals for memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. (sigh) Price’s filing, which Balchunas called a “semi-shock” from a “top 5 active manager,” sits frozen with dozens of others during a federal government shutdown that has left the SEC with skeleton staffing and no clear timeline for approvals. Yet Price’s approach differs fundamentally from the herd. While most applications target passive index tracking or single-coin exposure, Price is proposing an actively managed multi-asset fund (holding 5-15 cryptocurrencies) that applies its core competency – fundamental research, valuation analysis, and active portfolio management – to the crypto space. This isn’t about being first to market. It’s about being right. “If you don’t start out as a crypto skeptic, there’s something wrong with you,” writes Blue Macellari, T Rowe Price’s head of digital assets, in one of three recent research papers on cryptocurrencies the firm shared with us. It’s a revealing admission that captures Price’s approach: start with skepticism, follow the data, and let the conclusions emerge. Price hired Macellari, a former crypto hedge fund executive, in 2022, not to chase trends but to build genuine expertise. The firm has spent years “monitoring developments in the digital assets space closely and developing the ability to trade digital assets,” according to company statements. Those conclusions, detailed in research by Justin Thomson (Head of the T Rowe Price Investment Institute) and Stefan Hubrich (Head of Global Multi-Asset Research), suggest that digital assets have reached an inflection point. They’re not just speculative toys anymore; they’re potentially evolving into a legitimate asset class. The key insight: while Bitcoin has endured four drawdowns exceeding 70%, each near-death experience has been followed by stronger recoveries. Despite extreme volatility (daily price swings of 5-10% remain common), the asset class refuses to disappear. More importantly, Price’s analysts have identified a potential path from “risk-on” to “risk-off” status for digital assets. If volatility dampens and cryptocurrencies decorrelate from other risk assets like high-growth equities, they could transition from speculative investments to mainstream portfolio components. For a firm built on fundamental analysis, cryptocurrencies posed a unique problem: how do you value an asset with no cash flows, no earnings, and no balance sheet? T Rowe Price analyst David Kroger addressed this by adapting traditional discounted cash flow frameworks, using staking rewards as a substitute for cash flow in the valuation process. The methodology acknowledges that cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks with different consensus mechanisms; Bitcoin uses energy-intensive “proof of work” mining, while Ethereum employs “proof of stake” validation. (No, I have no clue what those phrases mean.) The critical distinction: unlike gold (another non-cash-generating asset), Bitcoin is actually used for real-world transactions. With Bitcoin’s programmatically fixed supply of 21 million tokens, growth in transaction volume measured in USD necessitates a rising price for Bitcoin. This creates a potential return framework if Bitcoin transaction volumes grow alongside the broader economy. Over the 12 months ended August 2024, more than $1.3 billion in fees were expended on the Bitcoin network to support a total transaction volume of $2.4 trillion, demonstrating real economic utility. The crypto ETF filing comes at a pivotal moment for T Rowe Price. Like many active managers, the firm has faced persistent outflows as investors gravitate toward lower-cost passive strategies. The firm manages $1.77 trillion in assets but has been “seeking to diversify into new areas,” according to industry analysts. In response, Price has launched 24 ETFs in recent years—a dramatic expansion for a firm historically focused on mutual funds. Last month, it announced a partnership with Goldman Sachs to develop new private market products for retail investors. The Active Crypto ETF represents both a continuation of this ETF strategy and something more: evidence that Price’s research apparatus sees genuine opportunity in digital assets, not just a need to check a product box. As VettaFi’s Todd Rosenbluth noted, “It’s exciting to see them expand their ETF lineup beyond stock and bond exposure.” Price’s researchers acknowledge sympathy for the “digital gold” thesis: the view that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against financial collapse, similar to physical gold but with advantages like algorithmic scarcity rather than mere physical limits. But they’ve moved beyond that framework. Understanding value in crypto means “applying alternative notions of utility; it is a parallel world to ‘Trad-Fi,’ with a different lexicon,” Thomson writes. That lexicon includes concepts like decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and token burning, all of which create potential economic value flows. The comparison to gold is instructive but incomplete. Both Bitcoin and gold have scarcity value and bear a cost of carry since neither generates income. But Bitcoin’s algorithmic supply limit (the “halving” that occurs every four years until 2140, when the maximum 21 million tokens will exist) distinguishes it from paper currencies printed without theoretical limits. Thomson opens his research with a cautionary tale about a 1999 stock called Fyffes that jumped 40% in one day merely by announcing a virtual fruit market, then contrasts it with a 2024 crypto entrepreneur paying $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall before eating it in front of journalists. Both stories feature “a whiff of alchemy and transience—that wealth can be created and destroyed from fumes,” Thomson writes. Yet his conclusion is not to dismiss crypto but to separate “the ephemeral from the permanent, the froth from the substance, Ponzi from probity.” Price’s framework suggests that for digital assets to merit inclusion in diversified portfolios, they need an expectation of positive future returns, specifically, excess returns above cash that reward investors for accepting risk. Traditional assets like stocks (with equity risk premiums) and bonds (with duration premiums) have decades of data supporting this expectation. Digital assets have reached what Price calls the “gold stage.” They have economic value greater than zero. The next step is establishing a durable long-term return thesis beyond merely betting on continued adoption or financial collapse. The fact that Price is willing to file for a crypto ETF suggests its research team believes that thesis is taking shape. Hubrich’s analysis is particularly telling: “To formulate a long-term return thesis for digital assets (Das), investors will need to determine whether passive holders should expect to participate in the value added by the blockchain. The answer is likely to depend on the DA, so this analysis will need to be conducted on a case-by-case basis.” This is precisely the type of granular, security-by-security analysis that Price has applied to stocks and bonds for decades. Dominic Rizzo, who manages some of T Rowe Price’s ETFs, signaled the firm’s direction at an ETF conference earlier in 2025, noting that “now is a good time to consider bitcoin exposure” and comparing cryptocurrency pricing to commodities, saying it “closely tracks the cost of mining it.” These weren’t off-the-cuff remarks but deliberate signals from a firm that doesn’t speculate publicly. When the government shutdown ends and the SEC resumes processing applications, Price won’t be first out of the gate. But if the firm’s research proves prescient, the T Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF could establish the standard for how thoughtful, non-speculative institutional investors approach digital assets by applying rigorous fundamental analysis to select among cryptocurrencies based on network usage, staking rewards, adoption trends, and value creation. For a firm that has navigated the Great Depression, multiple wars, the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis, and countless market cycles, launching a crypto ETF is not a panic move or a desperate grab for assets. It’s a calculated decision backed by years of research and a belief that digital assets are evolving into something durable. As software engineer Jameson Lopp observes in Thomson’s research: “First step to understanding crypto: admitting you don’t understand crypto. Final step: realizing that ‘understanding’ is a moving target.” For T Rowe Price, that journey from skepticism to cautious embrace reflects the same discipline that has defined the firm for nearly nine decades. The research led somewhere uncomfortable, somewhere new, somewhere volatile—and Price followed. Whether that decision proves prescient or premature won’t be known for years. But it demonstrates that even the most conservative firms must evolve when the research is clear. Sometimes the most characteristic move is the one that looks uncharacteristic.

Title: Consumer sentiment is sinking across the board — except for Americans with the most stocks

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. The ongoing government shutdown has helped push confidence to near-record lows, but one segment of the population is actually feeling more optimistic. The initial reading for the University of Michigan’s sentiment index fell to 50.3 in November from 53.6 last month, almost matching the all-time low of 50 from June 2022, when the annual rate of inflation hit its post-pandemic high. “With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a statement Friday. The decline was widespread and was seen across different age groups, income brackets, and political affiliations, she added. But not everyone followed that trend. “One key exception: consumers with the largest tercile of stock holdings posted a notable 11% increase in sentiment, supported by continued strength in stock markets,” Hsu said. The survey closed before Tuesday’s elections, which revealed continued voter discontent about affordability as food and energy prices creep higher. The timing is also notable given that it didn’t capture the most recent stock market selloff that sent the Nasdaq to its worst weekly loss since April’s trade war chaos. That came as investors grew more concerned about the AI boom looking like a bubble that could pop soon. Until this past week, the stock market was on a hot streak, notching fresh record high after record high, with the S&P 500 even closing in on the 7,000 milestone. The market’s impact on consumer sentiment comes as stock ownership has broadened over past five years into more income and age groups. A separate University of Michigan report from last month said the increase in market participation has been especially large among lower-income consumers, while participation rates of younger and older consumers have caught up with middle-aged consumers. In fact, a survey released last month from the BlackRock Foundation and Commonwealth showed that over 54% of Americans earning $30,000 to $79,999 a year are now retail investors in the capital markets. And more than half of that cohort began investing in the past five years. Stock ownership has highlighted a divergence in consumer sentiment in recent months: investors are turning more upbeat while non-investors have turned more pessimistic, according to University of Michigan data from October. And participants with the top 20% of stock holdings are especially optimistic. The spilt even mirrors the K-shaped economy that has emerged as higher-income Americans continue to spend and prop up overall consumption, while others have pulled back. Meanwhile, the so-called wealth effect of higher asset prices on consumer spending has become more potent in the last 15 years, making it harder to separate the stock market from the economy. Today, a $1 increase in stock wealth leads to a $0.05 marginal propensity to consume, up from less than $0.02 in 2010, according to Oxford Economics. The University of Michigan pointed out in October that sentiment among stock market participants had been on the rise since May—after tumbling in April when President Donald Trump shocked global markets with his “Liberation Day” tariffs. By contrast, sentiment for non-stockholders continued to decline and had already hit post-pandemic lows. “These patterns are consistent with the fact that strong asset values support consumer sentimentonly for those who own those assets,” the report said. “Meanwhile, given that wealthier, higher-income consumers generate a disproportionate share of aggregate spending, the recent uptick in sentiment among these households may may help buoy consumption spending even amid views of the economy that are relatively subdued from a historical perspective.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Refining My Conservative Retirement Target Portfolio

Using historical data on funds to make assumptions about future performance involves correctly interpreting the trends. Over the past six years, the U.S. has experienced an extraordinarily unusual period: During the next six years, we will probably experience another bear market and modest to moderate inflation. Interest rates are likely to continue falling in the short-term, but not as low as the decade following the financial crisis because of less Quantitative Easing and higher deficits and national debt. High valuations are a headwind to equity returns, and high interest rates are a tailwind for bond returns. In January 2020, before the start of the COVID bar market, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 was an elevated 26 and is currently 31. I believe that the full COVID Cycle from January 2020 to December 2021 and 2025 are more representative of market conditions for the next six years than the period from January 2022 to December 2024. In this article, I explore how alternative investments and mixed asset funds with flexible strategies can be used to develop a conservative portfolio. To evaluate funds, I selected thirty-six funds in twenty-three different Lipper Categories that had good risk-adjusted performance during the full COVID cycle and 2025. I created an optimizer using Excel Solver to maximize the Martin Ratio for the full COVID cycle with constraints for portfolio concentration, minimum returns, drawdowns, yields, allocation to “junk bonds”, and consistency across the individual years and bear markets. Figure #1 shows the performance during the past four bear markets by allocation to stocks for all of the 461 mixed asset funds in the Lipper global dataset with at least six years of history. Note that the severity of the bear market has a larger impact on the portfolio performance than the of the stock to bond ratio. The two black dashed lines show a range of likely maximum downturns for the three bear markets, excluding the dotcom bear market, which was associated with a mild recession. The three maroon squares are the maximum drawdowns of the “Conservative” and “Moderate” portfolios that I created and the target portfolio that I described last month in Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control. The two portfolios created for this article had low to average drawdowns. Figure #1: Mixed Asset Fund Drawdowns During Four Bear Markets Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #1 shows the average annualized returns over the past six years for the mixed asset funds and the “Conservative”, “Moderate”, and original target portfolio. The two new portfolios outperformed both the mixed asset funds and the original target portfolio. Table #1: Mixed Asset Fund Returns for Past Six Years Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I am currently reading “A Crash Course on Crises: Macroeconomic Concepts for Run-Ups, Collapses, and Recoveries” by Princeton University economics professor Markus K. Brunnermeier and London School of Economics professor Ricardo Reis, which researches the interrelationship between financial markets and the economy during a crisis. They describe part of their audience to be “members of the informed public wanting to absorb some of the concepts that should be guiding both macroeconomic and financial policy.” The book contains some wonderful insights into investing behavior, such as “Why don’t other, more sophisticated investors, lean against the bubble, preventing it from arising in the first place?” They continue, “These investors try to forecast how long the bubble will persist, which is governed by the trading behavior of the other (sophisticated) investors.” I have no illusions that I can predict the behavior of other sophisticated investors. As described by Hyman Minsky, many crises are preceded by some type of innovation (such as artificial intelligence) followed by long periods of price increases, speculation, and leverage. These are followed by a period of instability and traders becoming risk-averse and de-leveraging. Stock market price-to-earnings ratios were around 18 before the 1929 stock market crash, peaked at 34 prior to the bursting of the dotcom bubble, hit 21 prior to the start of the financial crisis, and are now at an elevated 31. There are usually “triggering events” that set off chain reactions between asset markets and financial markets that determine the severity of corrections and whether a macro-financial crisis results. At the National Association for Business Economics, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said, “When COVID-19 struck in March 2020, the economy came to a near standstill and financial markets seized up, threatening to transform a public health crisis into a severe, prolonged economic downturn.” The stage is set for a correction, and there are plenty of potential “triggering events” such as a slowing economy, rising inflation, potential supply chain disruptions, and geopolitical risk. Figure #2 represents the investing environment for the past six years. Fiscal and monetary stimulus contained the economic fallout from the COVID bear market lasting from January 2020 through March of that year, but Personal Consumption Price inflation rose from a half percent following the COVID bear market to nearly seven percent by January 2022. Charles Boccadoro described The Great Normalization (TGN) in which interest rates normalized to higher rates, hurting bond performance. The TGN bear market lasted from January 2022 to September of that year. By December 2023, the price-to-earnings ratio had crossed the high valuation level of $25 per dollar of earnings. The debasement trade is partly the result of investors and global central banks buying gold and the increased acceptance of cryptocurrency. I believe that the dollar will weaken but not be replaced as the global reserve currency, and the debasement trade is overbought. Figure #2: The COVID and Great Normalization Full Cycles Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. The full COVID Cycle was from January 2020 to December 2021 and includes the COVID bear market and inflation. I expect cycles of bear markets and inflation to be more frequent in the coming decade than in the decade following the financial crisis. Rates are high, so “The Great Normalization” of rising rates is unlikely to occur to such extremes for many years. Finally, valuations are currently high and more likely to fall than rise either over time or in a correction with a “triggering event”. I set up my Excel optimizer for both the Conservative and Moderate portfolios to maximize the Martin Ratio for the January 2020 to December 2021 period by changing allocations to 36 funds with constraints that I wanted to have drawdowns of less than nine percent for both the COVID and TGN bear markets. Maximum allocations were set for Alternative, Bond, Equity, and Mixed Asset fund types to ensure diversification. The Conservative portfolio has additional constraints of having yields at least 4% with less than 13% allocated to lower quality “junk bonds”. Figure #3 contains the inflation-adjusted results from Portfolio Visualizer assuming 4% annual withdrawals for the Conservative, Moderate, and Original Target Portfolio compared to the Fidelity Asset Manager 40% (FFANX), which is a good global mixed asset fund. The link is provided here. The Conservative and Moderate portfolios had similar returns through 2023, with the Moderate portfolio having higher volatility. Both beat inflation over the six years after adjusting for withdrawals. During the period of rising valuations and the debasement trade, the Moderate Portfolio has outperformed. Both outperformed the Original Target Portfolio from my last article because of a wider selection of funds under consideration, improvements in methodology, and an increase in the maximum allocation for a fund from 10% to 15%. All three outperformed the 40/60 baseline fund, which was negatively impacted during the rising rates period. Figure #3: Conservative and Moderate Portfolio Growth – Six Years Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #2 contains the resulting allocations with the funds sorted from the lowest Ulcer Ratio over the past six years to the highest. I own shares in FPFIX/FFIRX, PCBAX, PMAIX, PZRMX, and AVALX. It will take a couple of years to fill out the rest of the portfolio, depending upon cash flows, and I will lean towards the less risky funds next. Table #2: Portfolio Allocations Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #3 contains the portfolio metrics for the period May 2019 to September 2025 from Portfolio Visualizer. Annualized returns are after withdrawals, while Time-Weighted Rate of Return reflects investment performance. Table #3: Portfolio Performance Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Table #4 contains the metrics and ratings from MFO for the funds for the past six years. They are sorted from the lowest Ulcer Index, which measures the depth and duration of drawdowns from the lowest to the highest. MFO Risk is based on the Ulcer Index comparing all funds, while the Ulcer Rating is for funds within the same category peers. Martin Ratio is the risk-free return divided by the Ulcer Index. The MFO Rating is based on the Martin Ratio for funds within the same Lipper Category. The Batting Average Rating (BA) is based on the percentage of the months that a fund beat its peers. One takeaway is that some of the funds outperformed during down markets but lagged peers overall. Table #4: Fund Metrix – Six Years Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Optimization depends on having funds with low correlations to each other. Notice that some funds had their maximum drawdowns during the COVID (2020) bear market, and some had them during the Great Normalization (2022) bear market. Table #5 shows how the funds performed in each of the bear markets and the bull markets. The lower-risk funds provide some safety during downturns, while the riskier funds provide growth potential. Blue shaded cells indicate the best performers, and red are the worst performers. Table #5: Fund Performance During COVID and Great Normalization Cycles Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Columbia Thermostat bases its stock to bond allocation on valuations. During the financial crisis, the strategy was to invest in all stocks or bonds, and it did not perform well. It has improved its strategy to have a range of allocations depending on price levels and performed well during the COVID bear market. The Fact Sheet indicates that the fund is currently 70% invested in fixed income and 30% invested in equity. It contains the allocation to stocks by the S&P 500 level. BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PBAIX, PCBAX) is an Alternative Global Macro fund that has performed well since the 2008 financial crisis, but during the financial crisis fell nearly 27% in 2008 and returned 26% in 2009. I own shares in PCBAX, but limit allocations to alternatives because they use derivatives, which can be less predictable during a crisis. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) is another good Alternative Global Macro fund that had a maximum drawdown of 7% during the financial crisis. I included it in the original target portfolio from last month. The Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) is based on the concepts developed by Harry Browne in the 1980s to provide steady, long-term growth with low volatility without trying to time the market. The fund managers describe Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) as, “Designed as a core portfolio holding, Permanent Portfolio seeks to preserve and increase the purchasing power value of each shareholder’s account over the long-term, regardless of current or future market conditions, through strategic investments in a broad array of different asset classes.” It invests fixed percentages of its net assets in dollar assets (35%), gold (20%), aggressive growth stocks (15%), real estate and natural resource stocks (15%), Swiss Franc assets (10%), and silver (5%). The PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) is described by the fund managers as “By investing in a blend of inflation-related asset classes, the fund seeks to help preserve and grow purchasing power, enhance portfolio diversification, and guard against market shocks across varying inflation environments.” It currently has a composition of Inflation Linked Bonds 68%), Commodities (22%), Currencies (15%), REITS (10%), and Precious Metals (10%). I own shares in PZRMX. Figure #4 contains some of the funds that did well during 2020 to 2022 with high inflation. These are mostly in the Flexible Portfolio Lipper Category plus DIVO in equity income, Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX, maroon line) in the Alternative Global Macro category, and the PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX, red line) in the Flexible Portfolio Category. During the period in between the bear markets, the S&P 500 rose 89% while core bonds rose a paltry 2.5%. Figure #4: Fund Performance During Inflation (2020 – 2022) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset and St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database. From 2012 through 2019, Permanent Portfolio (PRPFX) and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX) had very similar performance. From 2019 through 2021, PRPFX outperformed PZRMX and greatly outperformed starting in 2023. I prefer owning PRPFX and PZRMX to directly owning gold because it is much more volatile. Over the past year, I decreased my allocation to stock from 65% to 50% which is a small decrease in risk. Rebalancing during high market valuations and downturns is a modest way of “buying low and selling high”. I believe that risk risk-adjusted performance of bonds to be greater than equities for the next few years. Using the bucket approach to match risk assets with spending needs and using bond ladders does more to reduce portfolio risk than lowering the allocation to stocks. As a qualifier, I use financial advisors to manage the majority of my portfolio using a traditional, globally diversified 60/40 portfolio. I am developing this “Conservative Portfolio” strategy for a subset of the portfolio that I manage in addition to traditional bond funds and bond ladders to have liquidity available in any market condition, and with some growth potential.

Science Author, Shanaka Anslem Perera, on X, pointed out that Bitcoin has pivoted from its historic 4-year cycle, which is driven by halving events. As a result of this shift, the coin’s traditional playbook of significant positive momentum has now become obsolete. Still, the crypto enthusiast does not think that Bitcoin’s bull run is over. Historically, Bitcoin’s performance has followed a four-year cycle, largely driven by halving events, which result in a reduction in the block reward. At every point in this cycle, the crypto ecosystem experienced a massive bull run, followed by sharp price corrections. Fast forward to the present day, and there seems to be a notable shift that has now rendered this traditional playbook obsolete. On October 6, 2025, Crypto Twitter declared Bitcoin’s cycle peak at $126,270. Then this was followed by a 21% drop in the coin’s price levels. BITCOIN’S 4-YEAR CYCLE JUST DIED AND NOBODY NOTICED Crypto Twitter exploded calling October 6th the cycle peak. Eighty-four percent crashes incoming. Bear market confirmed. Pack it up. Except the math says they are catastrophically wrong. Every indicator that called previous… pic.twitter.com/b6sj1kGn5e — Shanaka Anslem Perera ⚡ (@shanaka86) November 8, 2025 As a result, several influencers and analysts, armed with historical patterns, predicted an 84% crash and a prolonged bear market. However, Perera believes that there may be a different story to tell. There may still be hope, as he claims that the bull run is far from over. Apparently, key indicators such as the Pi Cycle, MVRV Z-Score, and Puell Multiple, which would usually signal the onset of a bull run, are unusually quiet. According to these metrics, the crypto market is in a mid-cycle consolidation, and not the end of the road. Perera believes that Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) may have played a vital role in redirecting the four-year cycle. Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed a staggering $64 billion, with giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and corporate treasuries acting as a vacuum for every whale dump. The influx of institutional investors into the sector may have rid Bitcoin of certain rollercoasters. On November 4, Coinspeaker reported that Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of up to $186.5 million, led entirely by BlackRock’s IBIT. Within the last six days leading up to November 7, there were consistent outflows totaling $660 million. Within the last 24 hours, the sector has seen up to $240 million flood back into ETFs. In the wake of this situation, the Bitcoin price has recovered by 2.38% and is currently trading at $101,997.13. Consequently, Market experts have concluded that settlement, not sentiment, now governs Bitcoin’s price. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.
