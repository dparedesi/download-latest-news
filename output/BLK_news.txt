Title: From far-right gains to the economy: What’s at stake in Germany’s election?

Germans will head to the polls early next year after the coalition led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed. Berlin, Germany – In some countries, a snap election is held in a matter of weeks. Germany, by contrast, will enjoy a leisurely three months before it goes to the polls in an election that is likely to be overshadowed by the return of Donald Trump to the White House, an increasingly perilous situation in Ukraine, and a flagging domestic economy. Germany’s ruling “traffic light” coalition, formed by the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) collapsed on November 6, after Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed his finance minister, FDP leader Christian Lindner. Scholz has announced a vote of confidence will take place on December 16. The snap poll is expected to take place on February 23. The three-way alliance formed after the 2021 elections was a rarity for Germany, and the FDP’s fiscal hawkishness always made an uneasy marriage with its centre-left partners, who campaigned in the 2021 elections on increased social and climate spending. The final break came during preparations for the 2025 budget, with Scholz arguing to pause Germany’s “debt brake”, which tightly limits public borrowing. Lindner insisted on demanding major public spending cuts and rolling back climate targets. Last week in the Bundestag, Scholz accused the FDP leader of pitting the government’s financial and military support for Ukraine against German pensioners. The national weekly newspaper Die Zeit reported that the FDP had deliberately provoked Scholz to collapse the coalition and force an early election, which the party has denied. “It was difficult to reconcile those three very different political ideas and ideologies,” said Markus Ziener, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think tank, who believes infighting has weakened Germany’s position within the European Union at a time when the bloc is sorely in need of leadership. “The hope could be that the next elections will bring much more stable conditions to form a reliable government.” The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party are currently polling at 32 percent, according to a recent INSA poll, more than all three of the coalition parties put together. Friedrich Merz, a former BlackRock board member who has moved the party rightward since becoming leader in 2022, is therefore well-placed to become the next chancellor. Based on current polling, he could lead a government with the SPD – based on the latest predictions likely to secure 16 percent, as a junior partner, a return to the familiar “grand coalition” that was in place for three of Angela Merkel’s four terms, or with the Greens, which are polling at 12 percent. Merz has promised to roll back several of the coalition’s reforms, including on climate. He wants to lower taxes, reduce social welfare spending and tighten the country’s borders. “It is time for a fundamental course correction in migration, security, foreign and economic policy,” Merz told the Bundestag last week. Scholz, now the least popular chancellor in post-war German history according to polls, has indicated that he will run again as the party’s candidate. But many senior figures in the SPD want to make a clear break with his tenure, and quickly. If he is to be deposed, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius is likely to replace him. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is on course to record a historic result. Assessments from Germany’s domestic intelligence agency that several of the party’s state branches are right-wing extremist organisations have not prevented the party from polling second, at 20 percent. Though all other parties refuse to form a coalition with the AfD, a strong performance could increase its influence on powerful parliamentary committees. Meanwhile, the FDP and the socialist Left party are currently below the 5 percent threshold required to enter parliament. The newly formed, left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance is at 7 percent. Trump’s campaign promise to bring a quick end to the conflict in Ukraine, and threats to pull military assistance to President Volodymr Zelenskyy’s government, come at a time when the war-torn nation is losing ground to Russia in the east and facing major attacks on its energy infrastructure ahead of winter. If Trump follows through, Germany, Ukraine’s second-largest backer, will be expected to dig deep and massively increase its military spending. Scholz recently spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in two years. He tends to tread a more careful approach and has refused to deliver long-range Taurus missiles out of fears of escalating the conflict. By comparison, Merz has been more hawkish on weapons deliveries and indicated he would approve the transfer, in line with the policies of the United Kingdom, France and the United States. Potentially adding further strain to the budget, Trump’s plans to slap 20 percent tariffs on all imports and 60 percent on Chinese imports would have severe consequences for the economy, as Germany remains heavily reliant on exporting manufactured goods. Europe’s largest economy is also its slowest growing. Though it has narrowly skirted recession, Germany’s central bank said on Tuesday that the present stagnation is likely to continue in the face of weak international demand and investment, and the prospect of new US tariffs. “We’re basically in a squeeze here. On the one hand, we probably have to deal with direct additional customs in the United States,” said Ziener. “On the other hand, we will probably be very much affected by high duties against Chinese products.” With no end in sight to the economic woes, more financial institutions and business representatives are calling for a reform of Germany’s debt brake to increase public investment, which has lagged for years. Merz, long known as a fiscal disciplinarian, has recently suggested an openness to reforming it, a possible sign of a shifting consensus. The constitutional-anchored measure limits borrowing to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), but special investment off-budget funds worth hundreds of billions have been used to circumvent it. Dezernat Zukunft, a research institute that advocates for reform of the debt brake, estimates that Germany requires public spending of $782bn before 2030, which it says can be achieved without constitutional amendments. “The deeper question is whether there’s a political majority for debt finance in Germany,” said Max Krahe, director of research at Dezernat Zukunft, a research institute that campaigns for reform of the debt brake. “To say, yes, we are willing to use debt as a financing instrument to tackle all the problems in front of us, whether it’s defence, decarbonisation, infrastructure, competitiveness, education, healthcare.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor to pitch Bitcoin strategy to Microsoft’s board

Microsoft's cash-rich reserves could face a potential shift with Saylor's brief but powerful Bitcoin pitch. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Michael Saylor, prominent Bitcoin advocate and founder of MicroStrategy, will present a Bitcoin investment strategy to Microsoft’s board of directors next month. In a Nov. 19 VanEck-hosted X Space, Saylor shared that he has been allotted three minutes to make a case for Bitcoin investment to Microsoft’s board of directors. While Saylor agreed to the brief presentation, he noted that his separate request to discuss the matter with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has not yet been accepted. He stated: “The activist that put that [Bitcoin purchase] proposal together contacted to me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation.” The development comes after Saylor made headlines last month by offering to help Microsoft generate a trillion dollars using a Bitcoin-based treasury strategy. In the October X post, Saylor asked Nadella to call him if he wants “to make the next trillion dollars for MSFT shareholders.” This offer followed news that Microsoft shareholders would vote on a proposal to explore Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Microsoft’s board has recommended against adopting the proposal. However, market observers noted that key shareholders like Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity would play pivotal roles in the firm’s eventual decision. Microsoft, holding $78 billion in cash reserves, has substantial investments in companies like Skype and OpenAI but has yet to allocate funds to Bitcoin or related assets. Saylor argues this strategy is short-sighted, urging tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, and Google to view Bitcoin as a superior alternative to cash reserves. Saylor said: “If Apple bought $100 billion of Bitcoin, it would likely grow to $500 billion, and the company would have a $500 billion business growing at 20% a year.” Under Saylor’s leadership, MicroStrategy has become the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with over 330,000 Bitcoin valued at approximately $30 billion. Saylor often emphasizes how adopting Bitcoin as a treasury strategy has enabled MicroStrategy to outperform broader markets, presenting a compelling case for other corporations to follow suit.

Title: Bitcoin ATH: As BTC touches $94K, will THESE factors boost it to $100K?

Bitcoin’s meteoric rise past $94,000 marks a turning point, driven by election-fueled hype and institutional adoption. Bitcoin [BTC] reached a new all-time high, surpassing $94,000 on the 19th of November, extending its remarkable rally that began after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. The king coin has surged nearly 35% from around $70,000 on election night. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s surge to an ATH of $94,000 — the coin’s price had dropped to the $92,000 mark at press time — has been driven by a confluence of short-term factors. The RSI climbed to 76.74, signaling strong bullish momentum yet entering overbought territory, suggesting potential caution for traders. OBV has risen sharply, reflecting sustained accumulation by large players, while trading volumes have remained robust, highlighting increased market activity. Media attention has played a pivotal role, with the presidential election sparking renewed interest in cryptocurrencies as speculative assets. The combination of increased mainstream visibility and institutional demand has fueled market enthusiasm. Speculation surrounding Bitcoin as a hedge against potential macroeconomic instability under Trump’s presidency has further amplified its rise. Additionally, whale activity in the market has been notable in the last few weeks, with large buy orders providing a foundation for the rally. However, with RSI approaching critical levels, traders may need to watch for consolidation or short-term corrections. While short-term catalysts have fueled Bitcoin’s recent surge, long-term factors have steadily supported its ascent. Over the past two months, institutional investments have surged, with asset managers like BlackRock increasing exposure to Bitcoin-backed ETFs, signaling growing mainstream acceptance. Corporate treasuries, including Tesla’s, have bolstered holdings as Bitcoin solidifies its status as a digital store of value. Adoption has also expanded, with major payment platforms integrating Bitcoin into retail transactions. Notably, during the presidential election, speculation around Trump’s policy stance on crypto regulation reignited interest. Additionally, reports of Trump Media & Technology Group’s discussions to acquire the Bakkt platform have amplified market optimism. This potential acquisition is seen as a move to integrate Bitcoin into mainstream financial and media ecosystems, further legitimizing its role in global markets and sustaining bullish sentiment. As Bitcoin basks in its historic rally, potential challenges lie ahead. Regulatory responses are expected to take center stage, with global policymakers likely to scrutinize the cryptocurrency’s rapid ascent. Trump’s administration could influence crypto regulations, either bolstering adoption or dampening sentiment depending on its approach. Meanwhile, market corrections are also on the radar. With the RSI in overbought territory and whale-driven momentum at risk of cooling, short-term pullbacks are a possibility. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 Many analysts have suggested that $90,000 could serve as a key support level, but any breach may spark a deeper correction. However, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain robust, providing a strong foundation for continued growth, even amidst short-term volatility.

Title: Further 12 abuse survivors at Spiritan schools have come forward since September’s scoping inquiry
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2024/11/20/further-12-abuse-survivors-at-spiritan-schools-have-come-forward-since-septembers-scoping-inquiry/
Time Published: 2024-11-20T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
A further 12 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools have come forward since the scoping inquiry discovered 347 allegations of child sex abuse at the five schools in September. The scoping inquiry report found that there were allegations made against 67 alleged abuses at the Spiritan-run schools: Blackrock College, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. The incidents of sexual abuse were among a total of 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse at 308 schools run by the religious orders. The abuse was mostly described as having occurred from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, with the highest number of reported incidents occurring in the early to mid-1970s. The latest additional cases are disclosed in a newsletter from Restore Together, a voluntary support group for victims/survivors of sexual abuse in the Spiritan schools. “It is a well-documented fact that sex abuse is underreported and that is especially true of non-recent male, child sex abuse. We are acutely aware that there are many people affected by abuse who need support but have not yet made the very difficult decision to come forward,” the group said. Supported by past pupils’ unions at the five Spiritan schools, Restore Together has highlighted the availability of help and support for abuse survivors through the Spiritan Schools’ Restorative Programme. “There is an entirely confidential listening ear” available to people who may need it, the group said. “Expert therapy and counselling from independent professionals are available to all impacted by abuse, in all Spiritan institutions,” with costs paid for by the Spiritans, it said. “Our collective responsibility is to ensure that no Spiritan survivor of abuse will be left behind,” they said. The scoping inquiry uncovered 130 allegations made against 24 alleged abusers at Willow Park, the primary school next to Blackrock College, and 55 allegations against 13 abusers at Blackrock College itself. The next highest number of allegations was 60 relating to 18 alleged abusers at Rockwell College. There were 32 allegations made against six alleged abusers at St Mary’s College in Rathmines; 10 against four alleged abusers at St Michael’s primary and post-primary school in Ballsbridge; and five allegations against two alleged abusers at Templeogue College. Thirty-seven additional allegations were made against the Spiritans that were not connected to any school. “Child sex abuse is the most abhorrent issue in the history of the Spiritan schools,” Restore Together said. It is “criminal in nature, and horrific in its scale and impact” and though it may have taken place decades ago, it “continues to torment victims/survivors daily and destroy their lives.” Restore Together is in ongoing negotiations with the Spiritans about a redress scheme for survivors of abuse in their institutions. “Considerable progress has been made in recent months and a proposed scheme is in the final stages of review,” the group said. The group expects to launch its own website before Christmas, at www.restoretogether.ie Patsy McGarry is a contributor to The Irish Times © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Michael Saylor to present Bitcoin investment strategy to Microsoft’s board

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Michael Saylor will share his insights on Bitcoin investment strategies in a three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s board of directors, following a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR)—who urged Microsoft to consider Bitcoin investment. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation,” said MicroStrategy co-founder during an X Spaces event hosted by VanEck. “I’m going to present it to the board of directors.” Saylor has publicly encouraged Microsoft to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury. He believes it can make “the next trillion dollars” for Microsoft shareholders. Companies like Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Google, and Meta (formerly Facebook) should discuss and evaluate Bitcoin as a potential investment, Saylor suggested, “because they all have huge hordes of cash, and they’re all burning shareholder value.” Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet on December 10. Top shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity Management & Research. Vanguard, a known crypto skeptic, has also invested in MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR), as well as shares of other crypto firms like Coinbase and MARA Holdings. As of September 30, the asset management giant reported holding approximately 16 million MSTR shares. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has led to huge stock price appreciation, outperforming Microsoft’s stock (MSFT) performance. According to data from Yahoo Finance, MicroStrategy’s stock jumped to a fresh record high at market close on Tuesday. It has skyrocketed 581% so far this year, while Microsoft’s stock has seen around 12% gains over the same timeframe. The NCPPR previously used MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy to persuade Microsoft leadership about Bitcoin buying tactics. They noted that the company’s share price had outperformed Microsoft’s. Microsoft’s board initially recommended voting against the proposal, stating they already “evaluate a wide range of investable assets,” including Bitcoin. While there is interest from certain shareholders, Microsoft’s top priority is artificial intelligence. However, Ethan Peck, deputy director of the NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project, warned that the assessment could trigger a shareholder lawsuit if they decide not to invest in Bitcoin and the asset’s value subsequently rises.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Can’t Afford to Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Keysight Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:KEYS) stands against the other AI stocks investors can't afford to miss. According to a famous Wall Street brokerage Goldman Sachs, the S&P 500 index will reach 6,500 by the end of 2025.

A technician examining a complex circuit board in a semiconductor development lab. Market Capitalization: $26.28 billion Keysight Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:KEYS) is a global technology company that provides electronic design and test solutions that support the development and optimization of AI-driven technologies. On November 18, Keysight Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:KEYS) announced the launch of their new Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software portfolio that transforms the way engineers handle challenges related to next-generation technologies. Their suite of EDA leverages artificial intelligence, machine learning, and Python integrations; speeding up the design process and time taken for complex RF and chiplet products. In turn, this enables easier development of advanced solutions for 5G/6G and data center applications. “AI is transforming how engineers approach complex design challenges. Automating traditionally time-intensive tasks enables engineers to focus on innovation rather than repetitive refinements, resulting in real productivity gains. The foundation for the practical application of AI and ML is first having an open, interoperable workflow and then providing turn-key solutions tuned for specific applications. It's a fascinating time, and AI and ML will undoubtedly be a huge driver of design innovation in the future”. Overall KEYS ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors can't afford to miss. While we acknowledge the potential of KEYS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KEYS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/19/2024 5:01:59 PM PST by xxqqzz Blackstone has agreed to buy Jersey Mike’s Subs, the sandwich chain said Tuesday, in a deal that a source said valued the company at around $8 billion, including debt. Reuters had reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter, that Blackstone was nearing a deal for Jersey Mike’s. The deal, which is expected to close in early 2025, underscores private equity (PE) firms’ increasing interest in franchise operators. Last year, PE firm Roark Capital agreed to buy Subway, Jersey Mike’s bigger rival, in a deal valued at up to $9.55 billion. Jersey Mike’s, known for its submarine sandwiches, traces its roots back to 1956 when Cancro started working at the company’s Point Pleasant, NJ., location, which was founded as Mike’s Subs. Cancro acquired the location in 1975 and began franchising units in 1987. Since then, Jersey Mike’s has grown into one of the major fast-casual restaurant chains in America with over 3,000 locations nationwide open and in development. “We believe we are still in the early innings of Jersey Mike’s growth story and that Blackstone is the right partner to help us reach even greater heights,” Jersey Mike’s founder and CEO Peter Cancro said.

Title: New judge to hear Rosmah’s case

Wednesday, 20 Nov 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: The US$346mil lawsuit filed by 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) against Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor over the alleged purchase of luxury goods using 1MDB monies will be heard before a different judge. This is following Judicial Commissioner Leong Wai Hong allowing Rosmah’s application to recuse him from presiding over the case. In a brief decision yesterday, Leong said he recused himself on the principle of justice. In Rosmah’s supporting affidavit, she stated that the judicial commissioner was a partner and head of litigation and arbitration at law firm Messrs Skrine between 2011 and 2021. Rosmah contended that at the material time at Skrine, which acted for the plaintiff in the present case, the law firm had relations to lawsuits including investigation into 1MDB and her husband, Datuk Seri Najib Razak, who was the prime minister then. “After considering the application, I agree to recuse myself from hearing this suit on the principle that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. “In the premise, I allow the application. This suit will be heard before another High Court judge,” Leong said. This is the second time Rosmah applied for the recusal of the judge in the lawsuit. She, however, failed in her first recusal application. On Sept 9, High Court judge Justice Adlin Abdul Majid dismissed Rosmah’s recusal application, stating that Rosmah failed to prove any real danger of bias if she continues to preside over the civil suit. Justice Adlin said she was in charge of the corporate division when she was with the law firm Lee Hishammuddin Allen & Gledhill (LHAG), while all affairs related to 1MDB were handled by the legal division. It is understood that Justice Adlin was transferred to New Commercial Courts (NCC) from the Civil division, resulting in the lawsuit being brought before Leong. On May 9, 1MDB, SRC International Sdn Bhd and nine subsidiaries filed the civil lawsuit against Rosmah and another individual seeking US$346mil belonging to the company. The plaintiffs claimed that Rosmah had used the funds from the companies to purchase luxury items such as jewellery, watches and handbags. Apart from 1MDB and SRC, other plaintiffs are 1MDB Energy Holdings Ltd, 1MDB Energy Ltd, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Ltd and Global Diversified Investment Company Ltd (formerly 1MDB Global Investments Ltd). The other plaintiffs also include Affinity Equity International Partners Ltd, Alsen Chance Holdings Ltd, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Ltd, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Ltd and Brightstone Jewellery Ltd. They named Rosmah as first defendant and Shabnam Naraindas Daswani (known as Natasha Mirpuri) as second defendant. They claimed Shabnam, who is based in Singapore, had purchased or procured the luxury items on Rosmah’s behalf. The plaintiffs claimed that funds from 1MDB and its subsidiaries were channelled to various offshore entities – including Affinity Equity, Alsen Chance, Blackrock Commodities, Blackstone Asia and Brightstone Jewellery – before being paid out to 48 different vendors based in 14 jurisdictions for the luxury goods. They further claimed the goods sought were “traceable substitute” of 1MDB and its subsidiaries’ trust property, thus the plaintiffs had an equitable proprietary interest in the luxury goods. They are seeking a court declaration that they have an equitable proprietary interest in the good and traceable proceeds in the hands of Rosmah as well as an order for Rosmah to pay the first until the sixth plaintiffs a sum of US$346mil.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Fresh Record High Above $94,000 As Spot Bitcoin ETF Options Trading Kicks Off

The price of Bitcoin punched past another all-time high above the $94,000 mark on Tuesday after options trading on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) officially went live, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) product kicking things off. BlackRock and other asset managers have been seeking to list and trade options for their spot BTC ETFs following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s approval of nearly a dozen Bitcoin ETFs in January. Although the SEC greenlighted the listing and trading options for the IBIT in September, the approval by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) on Monday represented the last major hurdle before their launch today. “A few hundred million so far in options volume on IBIT (a ton for day one),” Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote in a post on X. Balchunas also pointed out that the huge majority of the contracts were calls, suggesting bets that BTC’s price would continue rocketing. According to industry pundit and head of growth at Bitcoin custody firm Theya, Joe Consorti, the launch of options trading on spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds is a huge boon for the top crypto as additional liquidity could unlock a fresh tsunami of institutional and retail investors. “The floodgates for Bitcoin’s next evolution in financial markets are about to open. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETF options, specifically for the IBIT vehicle, marks the beginning of a new era for price dynamics, volatility, and institutional adoption,” Consorti posited in a Nov. 19 post on X. Spot bitcoin ETF options begin trading on the Nasdaq tomorrow.Here's why it matters.[B2YB @TheyaBitcoin] pic.twitter.com/BgDXmXI66M Consorti noted that options are the cornerstone of capital markets as they offer liquidity, risk management tools, and price discovery, specifically for institutional investors that “drive a lot of the core of the market.” “This matters because, in traditional markets, derivatives are 10 to 20 times the size of the underlying market cap,” he explained, before adding that with Bitcoin, listed derivatives are less than 1% of the $1.8 trillion spot market cap. Consorti stated that Bitcoin derivatives are considerably underdeveloped, which hampers the market’s maturity. There is a massive demand for these products from institutional investors to hedge their positions. The expert further said that the majority of Bitcoin derivatives are traded offshore or over the counter on platforms like Deribit, which currently boasts over $30 billion in open interest, while US investors remain sidelined. The US stock market is currently the world’s biggest and most liquid, consisting of 45% of the $110 trillion global stock market, he observed, adding: “Listing options on Bitcoin ETFs brings BTC into the largest capital market in the world and unlocks unprecedented opportunities because of this, namely liquidity in depth.” Retail investors that previously had no access can now foray into the Bitcoin derivatives market, increasing the user base considerably. Bitcoin reached a new peak of $94,040.99 early today per data from CoinGecko. At press time, the BTC price had retraced slightly to $93,567.61, still up 2.6% over the past 24 hours. The market cap of the benchmark crypto has now swelled to as high as $1.85 trillion.

As DOGE shows absolute correlation with Bitcoin, Ethereum strays further to a three-year low. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high of $93,970.91 on Nov. 19, roughly $500 above its previous price peak less than a week ago. BTC rose 3% over the past 24 hours. According to CryptoSlate data, Solana (SOL) closely followed Bitcoin’s performance, with a 2.7% price increase, reaching $244 at the time of publication. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) stood still with a 0.1% drawdown in the same period, priced at $3,128.78. Notably, ETH has accumulated a negative 5% performance over the past seven days, despite its spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) net flows becoming positive recently. Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, highlighted that ETH reached a three-year low correlation with BTC, as the pair’s Pearson correlation coefficient reached 0.3 points. He added: “Just because BTC is strong doesn’t mean you should buy ETH. Each asset is now following its own path.” The Pearson Correlation Coefficient tracks the relation between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1. The closer the relation gets to 1 point, the more positively correlated the variables are. On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) maintains its bullish momentum, rising 10.7% daily to $0.408, its highest price since early June 2021. According to DefiLlama, DOGE’s correlation with BTC has been 0.99 over the past month. The new price peak comes amid boosted optimism following the start of options trading on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out that the ratio between calls and puts on IBIT’s options closed at 0.17. This ratio means much more interest in calls than puts, which is a bullish setup. He added: “For context, this ratio for $SPY is 1.1 and $TSLA is .59 while $TLT is .79.” In the first hours of trading, IBIT’s options registered over $446 million in volume, which Balchunas called “a ton” for an opening trading day.

IBIT traded 73,000 options contracts in the first 60 mins of trading Tuesday, Nasdaq told CNBC, placing the fund in the top 20 of the most active nonindex options. Options trading allows investors to play bitcoin's notorious volatility by letting them buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price based on whether they anticipate the price will rise or fall in a given period. "Bitcoin has a lively derivatives market, but in the U.S. it is still tiny compared to other asset classes, and is largely limited to institutional players," said Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the "Crypto is Macro Now" newsletter. "A deeper onshore derivatives market will enhance the growing market sophistication. This will reinforce investor confidence in the asset, bringing in new cohorts while enabling a greater variety of investment and trading strategies … [That] should, all else being equal, dampen both volatility and downside." The market for options contracts on major ETFs can be extremely active, and are widely used by more sophisticated traders. For example, over the past five business days, Interactive Brokers clients have more options orders on the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the SDPR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) than for the funds themselves, according to data from the brokerage. The launch of the bitcoin ETF options will likely also lead to new funds that incorporate those options, said Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas. "Grayscale already did a filing for a covered call [fund], and I'm sure BlackRock will come out with it too. And then we're going to get buffers, and then we're going to get whatever other trend-following-type strategy that folks think of. I think the ecosystem's really going to start to fly here," Sohn said. Spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in January and have been hailed as the most successful ETF launches in history. Other bitcoin ETFs are expected to have options available as soon as this week. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the rule changes filed by the New York Stock Exchange, which lists the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), and Cboe Global Markets, which lists the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB).

Elixir, the network powering the decentralized yield-bearing synthetic dollar deUSD, has teamed up with BlackRock’s tokenization partner Securitize to launch a liquid staking token for tokenized securities. The partnership seeks to bring billions of dollars in gated capital to the decentralized finance market, Elixir said in an announcement on Nov. 19. Introducing Elixir’s “deUSD RWA Institutional Program” – a first ever partnership with Securitize After months of design and $1B+ of capital interest, this joint program allows Blackrock BUIDL and other RWA holders to seamlessly access DeFi using deUSD as the primary currency pic.twitter.com/rbUTNNadYr — Elixir (@elixir) November 19, 2024 According to the platform, users will leverage deUSD to access Blackrock’s tokenized fund BUIDL and other RWA assets for DeFi across the market. deUSD will be the primary currency of the “deUSD RWA Institutional Program.” In a comment, Elixir founder & chief executive officer Philip Forte said: “Elixir is excited to partner with Securitize to bring this 0 to 1 innovation to DeFi. The Elixir Network is a purpose-built stack powering exchange orderbooks and deUSD (“Decentralized US Dollar”). For the first time ever, holders of tokenized real-world assets can natively use their assets onchain in DeFi, accessing unified liquidity via deUSD.” The collaboration seeks to use deUSD to unlock yield-opportunities for the over $1 billion real world assets that Securitize has issued across DeFi. The offering is via the sToken and the new ERC-4626 vault technology in partnership with Elixir’s “deUSD RWA Institutional Program.” “With the launch of this innovative sToken functionality, Securitize is enabling a new frontier in DeFi by making it possible to leverage any Real World Asset token issued using the DS Protocol,” Securitize co-founder & chief executive officer Carlos Domingo said in a statement. “This functionality not only provides liquidity options but also bridges the gap between traditional assets and the digital asset economy, offering investors more ways to manage and optimize their portfolios,” he added. The RWA onchain market is currently valued at over $13 billion, while tokenized US Treasuries account for over $2.4 billion. On Nov. 19, Bitfinex Securites announced the launch of the first tokenized US T-bill in El Salvador.

Title: BlackRock capital allocation term trust sees $457,062 in stock sales

Full Content:
Saba Capital Management, L.P. and Boaz Weinstein, both significant stakeholders in BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Capital Allocation Term Trust (NYSE:BCAT), have reported the sale of shares valued at approximately $457,062. The transaction, dated November 18, 2024, involved the sale of 28,442 shares at a price of $16.07 per share. Following this transaction, the total shares held by the reporting parties stand at 14,370,170. The recent sale of shares by Saba Capital Management and Boaz Weinstein in BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust (NYSE:BCAT) comes at a time when the trust's stock is trading near its 52-week high. According to InvestingPro data, BCAT's price is currently at 93.25% of its 52-week high, with a previous closing price of $16.04. Notably, BCAT offers an attractive dividend yield, which InvestingPro Tips highlight as a significant payout to shareholders. The trust's dividend yield for 2024 stands at an impressive 21.59%, with the most recent ex-dividend date on November 15, 2024. This high yield could be a factor in investor interest, despite the recent share sale by major stakeholders. The trust's valuation metrics present an interesting picture. With a P/E ratio of 8.78, BCAT appears to be trading at a relatively low multiple compared to many other financial instruments. However, an InvestingPro Tip suggests that the stock's valuation implies a poor free cash flow yield, which investors should consider alongside the attractive dividend. BCAT's market performance has been positive across various timeframes, with a year-to-date total return of 24.15% and a one-year total return of 27.34%. These figures indicate strong performance, which may have influenced the timing of the share sale reported by Saba Capital Management and Boaz Weinstein. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights that could provide further context to BCAT's financial position and market outlook. There are 4 more InvestingPro Tips available for BCAT, which could be valuable for those considering investment decisions related to this trust.

Title: BlackRock supports US strategic Bitcoin reserve amid rumors of executive order

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has reportedly endorsed the idea of creating a US Strategic Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve as states and the Trump administration accelerate plans to institutionalize the digital asset. Satoshi Act Fund CEO and co-founder Dennis Porter revealed the development, which has sparked renewed debates over Bitcoin’s role in national economic strategy. BlackRock, which manages more than $10 trillion in assets, has yet to release an official statement confirming the claim. However, the firm has previously highlighted Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation and a diversification tool for reserves. Porter told CryptoSlate: “It’s a no-brainer for BlackRock to push for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Bitcoin aligns incentives. Now that BlackRock is pro-Bitcoin, they will push for policy that supports the technology. When incentives align, we all win.” Wyoming senator Cynthia Lummis has already introduced legislation for a strategic reserve called “The Bitcoin Act” and previously stated that it would be implemented within the first 100 days of Donald Trump taking office. The bill has become the fourth most viewed US legislative document as of Nov. 19. Porter also revealed that the Trump administration is considering an executive order to formalize the reserve, aligning with the president-elect’s broader pro-Bitcoin stance. Advocates argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, finite supply, and independence from traditional monetary systems make it an ideal complement to gold for safeguarding the U.S. economy against dollar devaluation. Additionally, Porter said that state governments are rushing to pass legislation establishing their own Strategic Bitcoin Reserves before President-elect Donald Trump signs an executive order on the matter. Porter believes that “the states will lead,” framing the push as a decentralized initiative in line with Bitcoin’s ethos. While proponents see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a modernization of reserve assets, critics have raised significant concerns about its volatility, environmental impact, and security risks. Bitcoin’s price, which has historically been subject to extreme fluctuations, could lead to instability in national reserves if adopted on a large scale. Skeptics argue that relying on an asset with such unpredictable swings could expose the US economy to unnecessary risks. Security threats also loom large. Bitcoin, as a digital asset, is susceptible to hacking, cyberattacks, and theft. High-profile breaches in the crypto space have highlighted vulnerabilities in storage solutions, even for institutional-grade systems. Critics worry that a national Bitcoin reserve could become a prime target for bad actors, jeopardizing national economic security.

Title: BlackRock Backs ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ Satoshi Act, CEO Confirms

Time Published: 2024-11-19T17:36:07Z

With President-elect Donald Trump’s recent commitment to using Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset for the United States, speculation regarding the timing and feasibility of this initiative has intensified within the crypto industry. This proposal, first articulated during the 2024 National Bitcoin Conference in Nashville earlier this year by Trump and pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis, has garnered significant attention as major financial players weigh in on its potential implications. Notably, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and a leading issuer of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs), has reportedly expressed support for establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. As revealed by Trump’s previous statements and Senator Lummis’ bill, this initiative aims to address the country’s staggering national debt, currently estimated at $36 trillion, by leveraging BTC’s unique attributes as a digital asset. Dennis Porter, co-founder and CEO of the non-profit organization Satoshi Action Fund (SAF), confirmed BlackRock’s endorsement of the strategic Bitcoin reserve, while emphasizing that Trump’s administration is actively pursuing the creation of this reserve through an executive order. Porter has indicated that his discussions with US Senate offices reveal significant backing for this plan, stating, “Game on, President Trump. The race is on.” He highlighted the situation’s urgency, suggesting that Trump’s team is motivated to act swiftly to implement the reserve before any state can adopt similar legislation. Porter further noted that he is racing to pass the strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation at the state level, potentially ahead of any federal executive order, underscored by his confidence that such laws could be enacted within days of Trump assuming office. Interestingly, Trump’s proposal has found resonance outside the US, with Porter revealing that he has been invited to speak to members of Congress and parliament in two different countries, one in Europe and another in Latin America, about establishing a similar strategic Bitcoin reserve. In parallel with these developments, BlackRock released a report indicating a renewed optimism surrounding regulatory clarity for Bitcoin and digital assets, particularly following the recent US elections. The report suggests that Trump’s campaign commitment to a strategic Bitcoin reserve, alongside the electoral success of pro-crypto politicians in both the House and Senate, could create a favorable macroeconomic environment for Bitcoin’s adoption. Robbie Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, highlighted that while Bitcoin’s long-term adoption will largely be driven by its fundamental use case as a global monetary alternative, other factors, such as declining real interest rates, may also be catalysts for its increased acceptance. When writing, BTC was trading at $92,330, approaching its all-time high of $93,300 reached during last week’s bullish trend.

Bitfinex Securities and NexBridge, a digital asset issuer focused on tokenization of financial assets, have teamed up to launch the first tokenized US Treasury bill in El Salvador. The tokenized T-bill, USTBL, leverages Bitcoin technology. Specifically, the issuers are leveraging the flagship digital asset’s Liquid Network and Blockstream AMP, an asset management platform that allows users to issue and manage crypto assets on the Liquid Network. According to a press release, the product will have an initial offering soft capped at $30 million, and will offer investors access to US Treasury returns in USD. USTBL is backed by iShares Treasury Bond 0-1yr UCITS ETF, the short-term Treasury bond ETF of asset management giant BlackRock. Initial subscriptions open on November 19, 2024, and closes on November 29. However, investors will also get access via further subscription windows. Subscriptions are initially available in the stablecoin Tether (USDT), while the issuers have plans to add support for Bitcoin (BTC). “The inclusion of USTBL tokens in investment portfolios will enable investors to balance digital asset exposure with the stability of traditional finance, offering a new level of diversification that can help reduce overall portfolio risk,” Jesse Knutson, head of operations at Bitfinex Securities, said in a statement. Michele Crivelli, founder of NexBridge, added: “By leveraging Bitcoin’s technology and infrastructure, we’re laying the foundation for a globally accessible financial ecosystem, bringing tokenized U.S. Treasuries to investors worldwide while maintaining full regulatory compliance.” This launch comes amid massive traction across real-world assets tokenization. The RWA on-chain market has grown rapidly with products such as funds, bonds and credit. According to rwa.xyz, the global RWA market is currently over $13 billion, with tokenized US treasuries, bonds and cash equivalents at $2.4 billion.

Title: COP29 Must Deliver the Goods

Geopolitical turmoil must not be allowed to distract global decision-makers from the urgent imperative of tackling climate change. There is no excuse for letting COP29 conclude without delivering ambitious, credible financing commitments to support climate action – including the clean-energy transition – in developing economies. MADRID – Last week, the World Leaders Climate Action Summit took place within the framework of the ongoing United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan. But the gathering attracted less fanfare than it has in the past – a change that does not bode well for our collective future. One reason for the reduced attention to COP29 is the watered-down attendance list: the leaders of the world’s 13 highest-emission countries have decided to skip the event altogether, partly because a G20 summit was scheduled at the same time. The heads of major financial institutions, including Bank of America and BlackRock, have also stayed away from this year’s conference, despite its focus on finance. And the decision to hold the event in Azerbaijan – a country heavily reliant on natural gas – has elicited accusations of “greenwashing” by environmental activists. As with last year’s COP in Dubai, the choice of host highlights the need to come to terms with natural gas as a long-term energy source. More broadly, the world has a lot on its mind. As the Ukraine war approaches its fourth year, a Russian counteroffensive to retake land in the Kursk region – supported by more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers – appears to be imminent. Meanwhile, Israel is fighting on two fronts, in Gaza and Lebanon, and escalation into a wider war appears far more likely than de-escalation. And while it is impossible to predict exactly what the capricious Donald Trump will do once he returns to the White House, the risks of geopolitical instability, democratic erosion, and a sharp reversal on climate policy loom large. A longtime climate-change denier and proponent of the “drill, baby, drill” mantra, Trump has pledged to withdraw the United States from the “horrendously unfair” Paris climate agreement, as he did during his first term in office. According to some reports, an executive order to begin this process has already been drafted. Trump also plans to increase US gas production and exports, and terminate the Green New Deal – which he calls the “Green New Scam” – by rescinding all unspent funds under the “misnamed” Inflation Reduction Act. Recent remarks by Myron Ebell, who helped lead a transition team during Trump’s previous administration, are ominous: “We’re not going to worry about emissions anymore,” he declared bluntly. The “sooner you forget all this stuff about reducing emissions, the better.” While one should not underestimate the threat that Trump poses to the climate, there is reason to hope that the worst-case scenarios will not materialize. During his first term, Trump’s bombastic declarations were not always followed by the promised action. Moreover, states, cities, organizations, and individuals stepped up to protect the climate, partly offsetting the federal government’s failures.

Subscribe Now In any case, the scale of the Trump shock to the environment will become apparent only after he takes office in January. COP29 is happening now, and its objectives cannot wait. Dubbed the “finance COP,” the gathering in Baku is supposed to address the vast climate-finance gap faced by developing countries. The much-touted $100 billion annual target – which developed economies agreed in 2009 that they would meet by 2020 – was reached for the first time just two years ago. The delay notwithstanding, it is nowhere near enough: the annual financing needs of emerging and developing economies (excluding China) are expected to reach about $2.4 trillion by 2030. Against this backdrop, participants at COP29 are attempting to negotiate a New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance. One hopes that the figure ultimately adopted is ambitious. But whatever it is, it will almost certainly fall short of developing countries’ needs. Moreover, implementation will pose a major challenge, as it will have to be handled largely by the private sector, especially private financial institutions. In many countries, particularly in Africa, the clean-energy transition is complicated by a lack of access to electricity. The strong correlation between consistent baseload power and economic prosperity sends a clear message: a reliable, affordable power supply is essential to development. And yet 570 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa still lack access – 80% of the global total – and the number has grown since 2021. Rapid population growth in the Global South is set to exacerbate the problem. Africa alone is expected to be home to 2.5 billion people in 2050 – up from 1.5 billion today. Renewable-energy sources are simply not reliable enough to meet the mushrooming demand that this implies. Hydrogen and nuclear can help to fill the gaps, but both require huge upfront infrastructure investments, which public budgets cannot cover. Mobilizing private capital is thus crucial. To this end, governments must devise effective strategies to mitigate risk and foster a supportive investment environment. Strategic partnerships among governments, international financial institutions (IFIs), and the private sector will be crucial. While many IFIs are still in the early stages of developing their green industrial strategies, they must play a central role in catalyzing private-sector investment and smoothing the clean-energy transition in emerging and developing economies. This includes helping to de-risk investments for first movers and supporting governments in setting ambitious goals, defining pathways to achieve them, and establishing policy frameworks and standards. The Baku Initiative for Climate Finance, Investment, and Trade is a step in the right direction, as it aims to encourage the creation of national, regional, and sub-regional platforms to maximize all three. But, without global buy-in, the impact of such initiatives will be limited. Even at a time of growing geopolitical disruption, we cannot allow ourselves to be distracted from the imperative of tackling climate change.

Trump is correct…we don’t have a climate emergency that needs extravaganzas like COPS or the UN Paris accord.. This is borne out by the Climate Realists able to take the IPCC data and show “no emergency and no need for NetZero” and they make a very good argument... Its only the IPCC admin that are using the emergency tag to get a payday from the west.When you study the scientific facts on the impact of the climate so far, it’s not been an issue with most impact indicators showing no change or even decline. Its only the predictions using models that keep getting it wrong that show any risk. Further our ability to adapt has improved considerably with technology, and I must say, with the use of Fossil fuels.Saying we are “beyond debate” and that “the science is settled” won’t cut it any more with most of the population wanting much more review… Also, many don’t support the notion that the west owes the rest anything in terms of wealth transfer. I would argue they owe the west a lot for the free trade and technology, and I would even say some of the colonization we provided greatly assisted many of them move toward a modern society. I am not suggesting we don’t need to focus on sustainability and continue the great work so far on reducing our load on the environment (But not the climate with mitigation) and the best way to get that done is with pushing prosperity on a global scale as poor people wont focus much on what is needed or control their population for that matter… so we may have to rethink our NetZero journey and allow the use of fossil fuels which is the lowest cost energy that exists across the globe to grow prosperity rapidly before we can even think about NetZero that certainly looks unnecessary, technologically unattainable, economically unviable and extremely foolish.More at https://nigelsouthway.substack.com/p/no-netzero It appears that you have not yet updated your first and last name.

The War Within Season 1 continues and we’ve made another full circuit of all the World Bosses with the return this week of Orta the Broken Mountain in Azj-Kahet. Fortunately there remain no mechanic drops similar to the older expansion’s Legendary Memories so players won’t have to worry about missing out on something important (besides the chance of loot) if they skip a week. As usual the World Bosses drop items that are ilevel-equivalent to the Normal difficulty of the concurrent raid, although with the more staggered ilevels in Palace it should be noted that World Boss drops are i603, or equivalent to the middle bosses of the raid. They can also be upgraded, starting at Champion 3/8. Orta the Broken Mountain resembles previous fights we’ve had such as Kormrok in Hellfire Citadel or Kromog in Blackrock Foundry, with runes and plenty of slamming action. One thing that is important to be aware of is the fact that Orta’s location in the Old Sacrificial Pit of the City of Threads is above an insta-death area, so falling or being thrown into the gaps surrounding the platform will kill you. Runes should be avoided as they will stun when triggered — if this wasn’t a world boss I’d suggest controlled detonation like in similar encounters, but it’s likely best just to avoid them entirely. Tectonic Roars is a raidwide AOE that will knock you back so positioning while it’s being cast is likely important. Finally Orta will grasp and squeeze nearby players at interval and then throw them away once they’re considered a “weakling”; it’s not known whether this means at below a specific health percentage or after a certain amount of time.The Old Sacrificial Pit is well-namedOrta the Broken Mountain is located in the western end of the City of Threads in the Old Sacrificial Pit, and is an easy flight over from the Weaver’s Lair. Because where he’s located is absent of other NPCs you don’t need to worry about your current progress in the zone or whether you are buffed with pheromones. As already mentioned the area beneath the combat zone is instantly fatal, so don’t fall off the platform waiting for the fight to begin.The gear that Orta drops matches the normal Palace appearance, so those looking to farm transmog as well as gear upgrades will want to take the time to down the boss. In addition to unlocking the normal look, upgrading from Champion 3/8 to 5/8 will unlock the heroic appearance as well. Unlike the Dragonflight first tier bosses, Orta drops two possible armor pieces for every class in addition to a ring that can drop for all characters:Ring is Critical Strike/Haste, with Critical Strike providing most of the secondary statsCloth classes can get a Chest that matches the Priest appearance or a Belt that matches the Warlock setLeather classes have a chance at Legs that match the Demon Hunter set or Boots that match the Monk appearanceMail classes can receive a Chest that matches the Hunter appearance or Boots that match the Shaman setPlate classes have a chance at Legs that match the Death Knight set or a Belt that matches the Paladin appearanceAs always defeating Orta the Broken Mountain counts as a World Quest with possible rewards of gold, Coffer Key shards (used for Delves), and Resonance Crystals.Blizzard Watch is made possible by people like you.Please consider supporting our Patreon!Filed Under: Azj-Kahet, World Boss, World QuestAdvertisement The Old Sacrificial Pit is well-namedOrta the Broken Mountain is located in the western end of the City of Threads in the Old Sacrificial Pit, and is an easy flight over from the Weaver’s Lair.

Title: Lessons For Sustainability Investing From The 2024 Election

The future may lie with a carbon tax, private sector innovation, economic inclusion of communities left behind and muscular corporate governance. Businesses will continue to treat ESG problems as business problems. Republican elephant US Presidential Election 2024 Banner with infographics of republicans. American ... [+] Election campaign statistics or results of republican party. Electoral symbol with map and graphs. Vector illustration. The scale of the defeat of the Democratic party in the 2024 election is staggering. They have lost the House, the Senate, the Presidency and one might argue the Supreme Court. The question now is what, if anything, can the sustainability movement learn from this defeat? What can one do over the next four years? To answer this question, consider arguments under E/S and G categories, for expositional ease. 1.0 Environment: 1.1 Reporting as the theory of change to address climate might have peaked: Did we burn too much political capital on the theory of change caused by extensive reporting of emissions and climate risk exposure? The theory, loosely speaking, was to force firms to disclose their emissions. Market participants could then channel capital away from firms that disclose more emissions and hence increase their cost of capital. Capital would flow to firms that report smaller or even negative emissions (as they remove carbon) and hence encourage innovation in producing scalable cheap green energy. The theory proved to be somewhat simplistic as my co-authors and I have shown in several papers. Green innovation took off thanks to subsidies not reporting. It is not obvious that divestment in equity of the so-called sin stocks hurts the cost of capital of firms that sell sin. The SEC climate risk rule will probably be shelved although more and more firms are voluntarily disclosing scope 1 and 2 emissions anyway. Abandoning the SEC’s climate risk rule makes the ISSB the de-facto ESG/sustainability standard setter for the world. The ISSB is shareholder focused and is hence more likely to strike a balance between decision usefulness of new data points for valuation and risk assessment relative to compliance costs imposed on firms, unlike CSRD, CSDDD and the like asked for by the EU. The extra-territorial requirements imposed by the EU disclosure rules and California’s emission disclosure requirements will force most US multi-national and inter-state companies to report on climate risk and emissions (scope 1, 2 and 3 for California) anyway. But pushing reporting as the theory of change to address climate risk may have peaked with the 2024 election. 1.2 Push for a sensible carbon tax: Instead of worrying about net zero commitments that very few firms were on track to fulfil anyway, should we instead advocate for a price on carbon? Neither side of the political spectrum is happy with how the current system works. We have defaulted to a world where we hold fossil fuel manufacturers, asset managers and financial institutions to account for high carbon products and services. As a result, we have implicitly absolved politicians and consumers from their responsibility to reduce society’s carbon footprint. Creating a set of rules for red states separately from that for blue states is not sustainable in the long run. By asking banks and other companies to deprive fossil fuel firms of investment, we expose ourselves to the risk of energy insecurity as supply demand imbalances will spike gas prices as we saw after the Ukraine invasion. Making public companies report carbon emissions will create incentives for high carbon emission units to go dark or go private. Such arbitrage, in turn, only enables a small number of individuals or funds to make outsized financial returns at the cost of societal pain. A carbon tax would automatically increase the prices of carbon intensive goods, lead to lower demand for such goods and hence coax consumers to switch to low carbon alternatives, wherever available. If low carbon alternatives are not available, innovation dollars will more readily flow to try and discover such alternatives. Indigent citizens, dependent on high carbon products such as commuting and heating oil, will naturally have to be shielded from the economic pain of a carbon tax for a while via subsidies that are financed from the revenue that flows in from carbon taxes. Banks and financial companies will have to then account for the impact of the carbon tax explicitly on the cash flows and credit worthiness of the companies they finance. The cost of capital to finance carbon friendly solutions will automatically fall. On top of that, a gradually increasing carbon tax will provide much needed certainty to businesses about the US’s regulatory response to climate change. In sum, we need a cohesive agenda where every citizen has skin in the game to address the climate crisis. A carbon tax is perhaps the only viable tool at our disposal. Without a carbon tax, climate losses will keep escalating and will eventually be borne by the taxpayer, one way or the other. A targeted well designed carbon tax now will stop worse outcomes in the future such as energy insecurity and social unrest. I hope both the red and blue stripes of our country can come together around a carbon tax. The alternative is a much bigger bill for taxpayers and the planet in the future. Thankfully, a small bipartisan caucus supporting a carbon tax does exist. Is it time to get to know and empower that caucus? 1.3 Coalesce around innovation and bipartisan agreement: There are several small wins that both sides can agree on. Republicans are unlikely to be averse to setting up a carbon market with adequate guardrails. Both Republicans and Democrats can come together on permitting reform. The Republicans will potentially push for permits for oil and gas firms and the Democrats for renewables. Presumably both agree on the focus on nuclear energy. It is interesting to observe that Microsoft, Amazon and Google have invested in nuclear power to deal with the ravenous power needs of the AI revolution. The political left would also do well to stop calling for the end of fossil fuel companies as the pace of the energy transition is likely to slower than previously thought possible and because we have not given consumers an alternative to fossil fuel in most cases. Perhaps one could focus on opportunities to innovate out of the climate hole in the form of new technology to make green technology affordable at scale. Out-innovating China and Europe is surely the best version of an “America First” policy. 1.4 Live with segmented markets in the US and overseas: Turning to green bonds, net zero commitments and green financing in general, markets are geographically segmented as Europe has pursued these initiatives more vigorously than we have. Blue states are also likely to pursue decarbonization and transition at the local level (city, municipality) via building codes, traffic tolls and the like. Impact and ESG investors are likely to cluster in the blue states and in Europe. For instance, BlackRock sells sustainable investing strategies more successfully in Europe than in the United States. The rhetoric fueling the anti-ESG movement in the red states will hopefully die down. The blue states might double down on ESG almost as a means of resistance. Fragmentation in rules will lead a Balkanized regulatory framework that will increase a firms’ cost of compliance and risk management. Of course, the business reality on the ground is much more complex and displays shades of red and blue. Texas, for instance, is already a leader in clean energy. My co-authors, Dhruv Aggarwal and Lubo Litov, and I have just discovered that the state pension fund that votes the most aggressively against “Say on Pay” proposals related to CEO compensation was not New York, or California but Florida! 2.0 Social factors: It is quite clear from the data that voters in rural areas and small towns did not vote for the Democratic party. The educational, healthcare and social support infrastructure in these areas leaves much to be desired. Recognizing fully that it is not necessarily the remit of companies to address social problems, could we consider a world where: · we provide subsidies to companies to open distribution centers or factories in these regions. Perhaps the state picks up the health care costs of private sector workers located in these areas. Healthcare is a significant driver of outsourcing and the temping of America. · we in-source our call centers from overseas to these regions. · we find opportunities for folks in rural areas to work remotely for larger firms. · we provide a quota for rural and small-town poor students in our elite universities, with family incomes below a certain threshold, and add service back home as a criterion for such assistance. · we provide subsidies for universities or community colleges or coaching academies to train the workforce in these areas for service jobs, given that manufacturing is not coming back to the US. A quick glance at the 50 poorest counties in the US suggests that most of them host prisons or correctional facilities. The US census finds that roughly 20 million people lived in a persistent poverty county in the 30-year period spanning 1989-2019. The 341 counties identified in persistent poverty were not evenly distributed throughout the US. Over 80% were in the South and nearly 20% of all counties in the South were in persistent poverty. Many were clustered in informal subregions such as the Southwest border, the Mississippi Delta, the Southeast, Appalachia, and in some counties with higher amounts of American Indian and Alaska Native tribal lands. Although, this is not just a red state problem. It turns out that 21% of the counties in New York state are persistently poor. Can companies that aim to do well by doing good play a part in addressing persistent poverty, with appropriate attention and help from the Government? 3.0 Push on G: Make the lives of activists and short sellers easier: The implicit idea that sustainability investing is about long-term corporate thinking or long-term EPS, as opposed to next year’s EPS. It is hard for me to believe that long term thinking is somehow out of fashion after the election or less needed than before. Indexers will continue to hold stocks for decades. The question is whether we want them to be disengaged owners. If yes, will the new administration consider empowering short sellers and activists such as Elliott Management or Trian to release capital trapped in overvalued firms and invest more capital in undervalued firms? As I have written many times before, there are hundreds of firms in the S&P 1500 that have not earned a return that covers the opportunity cost of investing in US treasuries. Finally, it is worth repeating that businesses, even without ESG investing, will do what it takes to address changing social norms of the customers, workers and communities they interact with. This is because most ESG problems are business problems, as articulated next. 4.0 Most sustainability/ESG problems are business problems I have stated several times that, to me, sustainability/ESG problems are mostly business problems. I am not sure much is going to change on this dimension. To illustrate this argument, consider the risk factors disclosed by Waste Management, a company headquartered in Houston Texas (a red state), in its 2023 10-K. I have classified these risk factors as E and S. One does not expect to see G flagged as risk factors as no CEO wants to suggest that his governance ecosystem is not effective. I have left brief comments under a few risk factors to indicate whether the new administration will mitigate relevant risks for Waste Management (WM). E risk factors 1. We utilize an energy surcharge and other mandated fees. 2. Supply chain, regulatory or permitting disruptions or delays could detrimentally impact the execution timeline for our planned expansion of our Recycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy businesses. · It is hard for me to believe that WM will quit the recycling business because of the new administration. 3. Our operations must comply with extensive existing regulations, and changes in regulations (environmental protection, health, safety, land use, zoning, limitations on siting and constructing new waste disposal, limitations, bans, taxes or charges on disposal or transportation of out-of-state waste, significant financial obligations relating to final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation, environmental regulatory changes; new information about waste types previously collected, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) or other emerging contaminates and other reasons, governmental entities have increased their interest in implementing EPR regulations to reduce municipal spending on recycling programs). · Some of these regulations will ease. But class action lawyers might end up becoming more aggressive if enforcement agencies back off. 4. We may be unable to obtain or maintain required permits or expand existing permitted capacity at our landfills, due to land scarcity, public opposition or otherwise, which can require us to identify disposal alternatives, resulting in decreased revenue and increased costs. 5. We have made significant investments in an extensive natural gas truck fleet, which makes us partially dependent on the availability of natural gas and fueling infrastructure and vulnerable to natural gas prices, and requirements to transition to other vehicle types could impair these investments. · Businesses make long term investments that are harder to simply unwind because of a new administration. 6. The seasonal nature of our business, severe weather events resulting from climate change and event driven special projects cause our results to fluctuate, and prior performance may not be indicative of our future results. · Good businesses, regardless of whether they are in a blue state or a red state, worry about the cash flow implications of climate change. 7. Our operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. · It is again hard to believe that the entire apparatus of environmental, health and safety laws will be abandoned by the new administration. 8. Our sustainability growth strategy includes significant planned and ongoing investments in our WM Renewable Energy segment; changes to federal and state renewable fuel policies could affect our financial performance, and such investments may not yield the results anticipated. 9. The impact of climate change, and the adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs, could increase our costs to operate. · The costs of having to comply with climate change legislation may fall but WM operates in California and is hence subject to that state’s Clean Fuels Program and Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act. S risk factors 10. Our employees, customers or investors may not embrace and support our strategy. · This is the textbook argument for why companies have incentives to worry about stakeholders in the long run, even if there are no regulations mandating such a focus. 11. We may not be able to hire or retain the personnel. 12. Our business is subject to operational and safety risks, including the risk of personal injury to employees and others. 13. If we are unable to attract, hire or retain key team members and a high-quality workforce, or if our succession planning does not develop an adequate pipeline of future leaders, it could disrupt our business, jeopardize our strategic priorities and result in increased costs, negatively impacting our results of operations. 14. Our business depends on our reputation and the value of our brand. 15. Increases in our labor costs as a result of labor unions organizing, changes in regulations related to labor unions or increases in employee minimum wages, could adversely affect our future results. 16. We may not be able to achieve our sustainability related goals, including reduction of our greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, or execute on our sustainability-related growth strategy and initiatives, within planned timelines or anticipated budget, which could damage our reputation and negatively impact the benefits anticipated from our investments. · These risks will dramatically fall under a Trump administration. 17. Focus on, and regulation of, environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) performance and disclosure can result in increased costs, risk of noncompliance, damage to our reputation and related adverse effects. · These risks will dramatically fall under a Trump administration. 18. Increasing customer preference for alternatives to landfill disposal and bans on certain types of waste could reduce our landfill volumes and cause our revenues and operating results to decline. · One could argue that customer preferences will encourage innovation in private structures to effectively signal participation in green initiatives. 19. Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and data protection issues and expanding laws could negatively impact our business, subject us to criticism and expose us to increased liability. 20. We could face significant liabilities for withdrawal from multi-employer pension plans. The long and short of this review is that it is difficult to imagine a radical rehaul of firms’ strategies, which intentionally or otherwise are designed to care for stakeholder interests, just because of the 2024 election. In sum, the sustainability movement would do well to pivot to innovation around affordable green energy at scale, a carbon tax supplemented by a well-functioning carbon market and corporate social responsibility at home to address the plight of those left behind in the last three decades. Neither party wants managers to waste capital that can be released by doubling down on G. Businesses will do what it takes to address changing social norms of the customers, workers and communities they interact with. One Community. Many Voices.

Founded as a B-Corp, NationSwell is a force for social, economic, and environmental progress In the world of purpose-driven business, few organizations exemplify leadership and impact as clearly as NationSwell. Founded as a B-Corp, NationSwell is a force for social, economic, and environmental progress. Its mission? To empower impact leaders across sectors with the community, support, and capabilities they need to accelerate their work and drive systemic change. Greg Behrman, CEO of NationSwell, recently sat down with me and shared the organization’s purpose and vision and how it tackles some of today’s most pressing challenges through collaboration and innovation. “We’re a B-Corp that draws inspiration from impact leaders who are driving progress and working to build the future we need. We built a company to be in deep service to those leaders. Our mission at NationSwell is to provide the expert community and the essential support those leaders need to lead at their best.” NationSwell’s vision, he added, is to be “the world’s leading partner powering a thriving social impact ecosystem: supporting the community of cross-sector partners working together to make the world more fair, just and prosperous for everyone.” A Diverse, Cross-Sector Community NationSwell’s community is intentionally curated, comprising around 150 leading companies, investment firms, financial institutions, private foundations, nonprofits, and individual visionary and community-based leaders, who were invited to join the membership community and with whom NationSwell actively partners. This diverse membership spans industries and sectors, creating a vibrant, collaborative network. “We’ve sought to curate the community with authentic and committed leaders doing inspired work – and have intentionally designed the community to cut across industries and sectors,” Behrman explained. “So often impact leaders know the person in their role in their space. NationSwell helps to open the aperture,” he added. The goal is to foster cross-sector collaboration and partnerships that spark innovation and drive systemic change. NationSwell’s unique model focuses on deep, impact-driven, and human-centered engagement, offering members a range of services including insights and best practices; catalytic connections and relationship development; intimate and actionable conversations and experiences; and award-winning strategic consulting, thought leadership, and creative storytelling. “Our members are busy. A lot is coming at them, and a lot is demanded of them. They are also service-minded and always thinking of how best to support others,” Behrman noted. “Our nimble, personalized model enables us to be the partner that is there to serve them. They deserve it.” Greg Behrman, CEO of NationSwell Supporting Leaders in Turbulent Times The current landscape is rife with uncertainty, and NationSwell is stepping up to help its members navigate these challenges. Behrman described how the organization is providing vital insights, resources, and connections to help leaders stay effective and inspired. “We are helping our members and partners to navigate uncertainty and turbulence by ensuring they have exposure to what others are doing and thinking, and line of sight into what’s working best,” says Behrman. Through curated conversations with peer leaders and visionaries, NationSwell fosters collaboration and shared learning. Additionally, they’re focusing on supporting leaders; and broader impact teams, recognizing the critical role of the emerging leaders in shaping the future of the field. Driving Collective Action Through Collaboratives A cornerstone of NationSwell’s work is its Collaboratives—intensive programs that unite funders, experts, and practitioners to tackle systemic challenges. These initiatives are designed to facilitate shared action, providing the structure and expertise necessary for impactful collaboration. “Our Collaboratives are designed and optimized to provide a range of support. Through Collaboratives we bring together incredible groups of funders, experts, practitioners, and community-based leaders — taking them on a shared action journey designed to help them learn, connect, elevate their work and grantees; refine their strategies and efforts; and identify opportunities for co-investment and shared action,” Behrman explained. Recent efforts include programs like Case for Childcare and Place-Based Impact, both of which recently earned Anthem Awards. Those Collaboratives were launched in partnership with organizations like Pivotal Ventures, Annie E. Casey Foundation, BlackRock Foundation, Starbucks, Mass Mutual, Cisco, KPMG, and American Family Insurance. At Climate Week this year, they launched a new Collaborative on Clear Air in partnership with Coupa. This week, they are launching a new Collaborative on Collective Wealth Building, developed in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Travelers, and other key funders to address wealth disparities and promote community prosperity. Behrman highlighted the value these Collaboratives bring: “Each Collaborative also produces one-of-a-kind resources that fill a gap and help advance the field.” A cornerstone of NationSwell’s work is its Collaboratives—intensive programs that unite funders, ... [+] experts, and practitioners to tackle systemic challenges. Pioneering Partnerships and Initiatives NationSwell’s impact extends far beyond its Collaboratives. Behrman highlighted several key initiatives, such as a partnership with Johnson & Johnson to advance health equity and a collaboration with Omidyar Network to explore responsible uses of AI. In the workforce development space, NationSwell is currently partnering with JP Morgan Chase - and a range of other leading local stake-holders - to design a system-wide strategy in Columbus, Ohio. It also partnered with Stacey Abrams, her sister Andrea, and the team at American Pride Rises to support DEI initiatives. On the democracy and civic engagement front, NationSwell produced Civics Inc., a report that explores how companies can activate their employees and communities. This report, developed with Patagonia, recently won an Anthem Award and was highlighted in a Fortune article co-authored with Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert. Advice for Purpose-Driven Leaders Behrman’s advice for leaders navigating today’s complex landscape? Three things. Stay deeply anchored in core values and deepest beliefs, remain curious and open to listening, and recognize the vital role of impact leaders. “Their vision, voices, and values will light the way forward,” he emphasized. NationSwell’s work is a testament to the power of collaboration and the potential for purposeful leadership to drive meaningful change. As Behrman put it, “I believe impact leaders will do their best and most important work in the years ahead. That provides me with purpose and hope.” One Community. Many Voices.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) stands against other trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. According to Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, artificial intelligence models capable of performing at human levels may emerge as early as 2026. That is, if current advancements hold steady. Amodei compares the path to general artificial intelligence with educational stages. Currently, he notes that we’re starting to get to PhD level, while last year we were at the undergraduate level. READ ALSO: 10 AI News Making Waves Today and 10 AI Stocks to Watch on Latest News and Analyst Ratings “If you just eyeball the rate at which these capabilities are increasing, it does make you think that we’ll get there by 2026 or 2027”. He also acknowledged that possible setbacks may exist, such as data shortages, limitations in scaling AI clusters, and potential geopolitical issues impacting microchip supply chains. Previously, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a similar claim, noting that artificial general intelligence can be achieved in five years with the current hardware. According to Altman, the benchmark would pose “surprisingly little” change to society. How fast we can get to AGI is a debate of its own. In the meantime, let’s take a closer look at the latest developments and innovations shaping the world of artificial intelligence. In its first, a robot has been trained by watching videos of seasoned surgeons, performing the same surgical procedures skillfully as human doctors. The findings, led by Johns Hopkins University researchers, were illuminated at the Conference on Robot Learning in Munich, a top event for robotics and machine learning. “It’s really magical to have this model and all we do is feed it camera input and it can predict the robotic movements needed for surgery. We believe this marks a significant step forward toward a new frontier in medical robotics.” In other news, CNBC’s David Faber reports that Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI is raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation. Musk’s AI startup seeks to “understand the true nature of the universe. Last year, xAI released a chatbot named Grok, modeled after “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.” The chatbot aims to directly compete with companies including ChatGPT creator OpenAI. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer at work, surrounded by a wall of computer monitors connected to a 'Data Cloud' platform. Market Capitalization: $42.2 billion Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) is an artificial intelligence data cloud company. It integrates AI and machine-learning capabilities into its platform allowing customers to create generative AI applications and build large language models. On November 15, Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne maintained a “Buy” rating on Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and set a price target of $170.00. The buy rating comes from a slight quarter-over-quarter improvement in sentiment. Moreover, survey results conducted with decision-makers at 15 large partners also suggest the company’s product growth may accelerate in 2025, with a possible increase in pace. The analyst notes speeding up in case its artificial intelligence (AI) features help boost data usage. Overall, SNOW ranks 10th on our list of trending AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of SNOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Mad Money Episode: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch list. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's "easy" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some "serious gains." "I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It’s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don’t count. But that, people, is nonsense." Cramer said banks do not "care" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation. "I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I’m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds."

For this article we watched the latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's talking about. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 130 Commenting about Broadcom in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer said: “I am also pulling for Broadcom. I think Broadcom should do well. I don’t know whether Cisco is going to hurt it today with its light guidance because I think Broadcom is doing very very well.” Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. The company’s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We continued to build our position in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers – such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few – will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA’s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.” Overall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Companies say RTO mandates make work more creative — it might take more than that
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/rto-mandate-may-not-be-enough-to-boost-creativity-collaboration-2024-11
Time Published: 2024-11-19T09:49:10Z
Full Content:
Companies are betting that asking employees to return to the office will help boost creativity. HR pros say that's only the start. While being physically present may boost collaboration and the flow of ideas, workplace specialists told Business Insider that RTO mandates alone might not be the answer. To get the rest of the way, companies need bosses and a culture that fosters creativity. "You can have a fully in-person organization and still not optimize those things because your culture and your leadership don't bring them out in their people," said Leena Rinne, the vice president of coaching at the corporate training platform Skillsoft. "If you have a really stifling and unsafe culture, but you're trying to get more creativity, bringing people back together is not going to get you there." Amazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told all corporate employees they had to be in the office five days a week. Goldman Sachs, Salesforce, and JPMorgan have done the same. Bosses want "the water cooler effect" of spontaneous collaboration, said Cary Cooper, a professor of organizational psychology and health at the Manchester Business School. Whether they get it is another question — research on RTO benefits has been inconclusive. Some studies found that returning to the office doesn't really improve employee performance and may drive them to quit. Others suggest it can improve collaboration and strengthen bonds between employees. Alongside any office-return rules, employers should "rethink the role of the manager," Cooper said. He recommended prioritizing soft skills that will help leaders motivate their teams, particularly Gen Zers new to the workplace. "We've been recruiting the wrong kind of manager for this generation," he said. Those staff "want a better work-life balance," Cooper said. "And they want a good quality of working life. That means somebody has to create that, and that somebody has to have good social skills." Workers often don't love being asked to return to the office. At Dell, almost half of US staff rejected the back-to-office call. At Amazon, some employees have joked that they would rather be fired than comply. Jeri Doris, the SVP of people at the HR and payroll platform Justworks, said companies need to justify the working setup they choose, not just mandate it. "We need to treat people like adults," Doris said. The goal should be "creating an environment where people can grow, thrive, and feel seen." Doris recommended tying office attendance to particular tasks, like coming in for particular meetings. Rinne, the workplace-coaching pro, cautioned against an "executive nostalgia" that pushes old-school bosses to want workers where they can see them. "We're not going back to the workplace of yesteryear," she said. "It's different now. We feel different. We have different skills." She said that creativity and personal resilience at work both proliferated with the rise of remote work. Poorly-executed returns can erode them. "If we want more collaboration, what do our people and our leaders need to be doing to accelerate collaboration?" Rinne said. "Because it's not just me and you sitting in the same room that makes us collaborate." Overall, strategy isn't what gets results, Rinne said. "It's your people who get your results," she said. "How I show up to work every day drives what I accomplish and how I contribute to this organization," she added. "If I'm leaning in and excited about it, that's very different from leaning out and doing the bare minimum." Jump to

Title: Judge recuses self from 1MDB’s US$346mil lawsuit against Rosmah
URL: https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/11/19/judge-recuses-self-from-1mdbs-us346mil-lawsuit-against-rosmah
Time Published: 2024-11-19T05:16:00Z
Full Content:
Tuesday, 19 Nov 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: The US$346mil lawsuit filed by 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) against Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor (pic) over the alleged purchase of luxury goods from 1MDB's monies will be heard before a different judge. This is following Judicial Commissioner Leong Wai Hong allowing Rosmah's application to recuse him from presiding over the case. ALSO READ: ‘US$346mil luxury goods linked to 1MDB, SRC scandal’ In his brief decision on Tuesday, JC Leong said he recused himself on the principle of justice. In Rosmah's supporting affidavit, she stated that the JC was a partner and head of litigation and arbitration at law firm Messrs Skrine between 2011 and 2021. Rosmah contended that at the material time at Skrine, which acted for the plaintiff in the present case, the law firm had relations to lawsuits including investigation into 1MDB and her husband, Datuk Seri Najib Razak, who was the prime minister then. "After considering the application, I agree to recuse myself from hearing this suit on the principle that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. "In the premise, I allow the application. This suit will be heard before another High Court judge," JC Leong said. This is the second time Rosmah has applied for the recusal of the judge in the lawsuit. She, however, failed in her first recusal application. ALSO READ: Rosmah amassed RM1.63bil worth of jewellery, designer goods with 1MDB funds, court told On Sept 9, High Court judge Justice Adlin Abdul Majid dismissed Rosmah's recusal application, stating that Rosmah failed to prove any real danger of bias if she continues to preside over the civil suit. Justice Adlin said she was in charge of the corporate division when she was with the law firm Lee Hishammuddin Allen & Gledhill (LHAG), while all affairs related to 1MDB were handled by the legal division. It is understood that Justice Adlin was transferred to New Commercial Courts (NCC) from the Civil division, resulting in the lawsuit being brought before JC Leong. On May 9, 1MDB, SRC International Sdn Bhd and nine subsidiaries filed the civil lawsuit against Rosmah and another individual seeking US$346mil belonging to the company. The plaintiffs claimed that Rosmah had used the funds from the companies to purchase luxury items such as jewellery, watches and handbags. Apart from 1MDB and SRC, other plaintiffs are 1MDB Energy Holdings Ltd, 1MDB Energy Ltd, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Ltd and Global Diversified Investment Company Ltd (formerly 1MDB Global Investments Ltd). Other plaintiffs are Affinity Equity International Partners Ltd, Alsen Chance Holdings Ltd, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Ltd, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Ltd and Brightstone Jewellery Ltd. They named Rosmah as the first defendant and Shabnam Naraindas Daswani (also known as Natasha Mirpuri) as the second defendant. They claim that Shabnam, who is based in Singapore, had purchased or procured the luxury items on behalf of Rosmah. The plaintiffs claim that funds from 1MDB and its subsidiaries were channelled to various offshore entities - including Affinity Equity, Alsen Chance, Blackrock Commodities, Blackstone Asia and Brightstone Jewellery - before being paid out to 48 different vendors based in 14 jurisdictions for the luxury goods. "A total of 320 such payments totalling US$346,010,489 were made," the plaintiffs stated. They further claim the goods sought were “traceable substitute” of 1MDB and its subsidiaries’ trust property, thus the plaintiffs have an equitable proprietary interest in the luxury goods. They are seeking a court declaration that they have an equitable proprietary interest in the good and traceable proceeds in the hands of Rosmah as well as an order for Rosmah to pay the first until the sixth plaintiffs a sum of US$346mil.

Title: BlackRock Bags Abu Dhabi’s Operational License For AI And Private Markets

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Key takeaways The prominent global investment and asset management company BlackRock has received Abu Dhabi’s operational license. A November 18 Bloomberg report disclosed this newest development regarding BlackRock’s expansion moves. The report noted that the license will enable the asset manager to diversify its AI and private markets in the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). BlackRock also seeks a license to operate in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), an international financial hub in the region. This new office will enable the company to work closely with sovereign wealth funds, wealth managers, and Abu Dhabi-based investment entities. ADGM stands out due to the participation of several crypto-related entities, including M2, Blockdaemon, Laser Digital, and others. In a statement to Bloomberg, Charles Hatami, BlackRock’s Middle East Head, disclosed the company’s scope of activities via its expansion to Abu Dhabi. He pointed out that BlackRock will focus on artificial intelligence infrastructure and private markets in the region. Further, Hatami applauded Abu Dhabi’s proactiveness and commitment to innovation, labeling the region as a “global financial center.” He noted that the region has become an attractive hub with its friendly policies for different companies and businesses. Hatami stated: “Abu Dhabi has rapidly transformed into a global financial center. Its strategic location, proactive government policies, and commitment to sustainable growth make it an ideal location for capital markets.” BlackRock’s latest operational license in Abu Dhabi comes at the heel of another license from Saudi Arabia last month. The asset manager received approval to establish its regional headquarters in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This move aligns with BlackRock’s efforts to expand within the region. Earlier this year, the company disclosed its readiness to allocate $5 billion from its Public Investment Fund to invest in the Middle East and develop a Riyadh-based investment team. BlackRock remains distinctive as the issuer of the largest US-based spot Bitcoin ETF. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, IBIT, boasts net inflows of over $29.28 billion and total assets worth $42.89 billion as of November 15. The UAE has recorded a growing dominance in digital finance. According to an August report from investment migration consultancy company Henley & Partners, UAE ranked third in a crypto adoption index. The nation’s capital, Abu Dhabi, has become one of the regions with a favorable environment for innovative technology and financial growth. This friendly atmosphere has attracted various AI companies and investments. In April, Microsoft revealed its $1.6 billion investment in an Abu Dhabi-based AI tech entity, G42. Also, in September, Microsoft disclosed its plan to develop two AI centers in the region. This move aligns with the tech company’s goal of global AI expansion. Microsoft highlighted that one of the centers will help AI projects that resolve key societal goals. Meanwhile, the other center will concentrate on creating industry standards for the responsible use of AI. Get the latest updates, trends, and insights delivered straight to your fingertips.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Enhanced Government Fund, Inc. (the Fund) (NYSE: EGF, CUSIP: 09255K108) today announced the completion of its annual offer to repurchase a portion of its outstanding shares of common stock from its stockholders (the Repurchase Offer). Under the terms of the Repurchase Offer, the Fund offered to repurchase up to 5% of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the Shares) for cash at a price equal to the Fund's net asset value per Share calculated as of the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange on November 18, 2024 (subject to the repurchase fee of 2% of the net asset value per Share, which was deducted from the repurchase price (the Repurchase Fee)). As previously announced on November 15, 2024, the expiration date of the Repurchase Offer, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the Fund's depositary agent, indicated that 439,157 Shares (approximately 12% of the Fund's Shares outstanding as of November 15, 2024) were validly submitted for tender and not withdrawn. Since more than 5% of the Fund's outstanding Shares were validly submitted for tender, the Fund repurchased validly tendered Shares on a pro rata basis. However, the Fund accepted all Shares validly submitted for tender by stockholders who owned, beneficially or of record, an aggregate of not more than 99 Shares and who validly tendered all of their Shares, before pro rating Shares validly tendered by other stockholders. Consequently, approximately 42% of Shares validly submitted for tender were accepted for repurchase. On November 18, 2024, and subject to pro ration as applicable, validly tendered Shares were repurchased by the Fund at $9.80 per Share, the Fund's net asset value per Share determined as of 4:00 p.m. EST, Monday, November 18, 2024 less the Repurchase Fee. Shares validly tendered and accepted will not be entitled to receive any Fund dividend or distribution with a record date on or after November 22, 2024. The Fund is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to provide stockholders with current income and gains. None of the Fund, its investment adviser or its Board of Directors made any recommendation to any stockholder as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering Shares in the Repurchase Offer. For client-specific information regarding the Repurchase Offer, please contact your broker or financial advisor, or in the case of registered stockholders, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., which is acting as the depositary agent in connection with the Repurchase Offer.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Advisors, LLC (BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)) announced today the final results of BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: MUI, the Fund) tender offer (a Tender Offer) for up to 50% of its outstanding common shares (the Shares). The Tender Offers, which expired at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on November 15, 2024, was oversubscribed. Therefore, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, the Fund will purchase Shares from all tendering shareholders on a pro rata basis, after disregarding fractions, based on the number of Shares properly tendered (Pro-Ration Factor). The final results of the Tender Offer are provided in the table below. Fund Name Ticker CUSIP Number of Shares Tendered Number of Tendered Shares to be Purchased Pro-Ration Factor Purchase Price BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. MUI 09253X102 44,715,010 35,996,072 0.80505121 12.7890 Equal to 98% of the Fund's net asset value per Share as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on November 18, 2024 (the business day immediately following the expiration date of the Tender Offer). Payments for Shares tendered and accepted are expected to be made within approximately five business days after the expiration date. Questions regarding the Tender Offer may be directed to Georgeson LLC, the Information Agent for the Tender Offer, toll free at the numbers disclosed in the Fund's Offer to Purchase. Conversion to an Unlisted Interval Fund As previously announced, the Fund will be converting from an exchange-listed, closed-end fund to an unlisted, continuously-offered closed-end fund that conducts periodic repurchases of its shares, also known as an interval fund (the Conversion). The Fund's Shares will continue to trade on the NYSE until the effective date of the Fund's delisting from the NYSE, which will be announced at a later date. It is currently expected that the Conversion will occur in the first quarter of 2025, on such date as will be announced by the Fund. Shareholders who continue to hold Shares following the completion of the Tender Offer, but who do not wish to hold Shares of an unlisted interval fund, may sell their Shares in the normal course on the NYSE prior to the effective date of the Fund's delisting from the NYSE. Please note that, following the Conversion, the Fund's Shares will no longer trade on a stock exchange and shareholders will therefore have limited options to sell their shares outside of the Fund's quarterly offers to repurchase between 5% and 25% of the Fund's Shares. Important Notice This press release is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute a recommendation, an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell any common shares of the Fund.

Title: ‘He’s been unbelievably helpful’ – Thomas Clarkson thanks Cian Healy for his assistance in ‘surreal’ week

Ireland's Thomas Clarkson during the Autumn Nations Series clash against Argentina at the Aviva Stadium. Photo: Brendan Moran/Sportsfile Thomas Clarkson got to make his debut twice on Friday night, the Wicklow native able to get a feel for things when he came on as a temporary replacement when Finlay Bealham was in the sin-bin during the first half against Argentina before getting 28 minutes after half-time. At the end of this month, he’ll go back to Leinster as a fully-fledged Ireland international and his next task will be to force his way into the match-day squad for the biggest games when he’s competing with Tadhg Furlong and former France international Rabah Slimani. This week, his involvement will be impacted by the health of Furlong and Tom O’Toole and whether Andy Farrell reckons he did enough against Argentina to merit another go. Realistically, he’s fifth in line behind Furlong, Bealham, O’Toole and Oli Jager, but injuries have opened the door and the 24-year-old has shown he can cope at the highest level. Certainly, Farrell has challenged Clarkson and Sam Prendergast to build on their debuts. “It was a big old task for Tom Clarkson coming on, especially when it’s a game of collision-winning and they’re going to test you through the forwards. They’re a good scrummaging pack and I thought he did really well,” he said. “It’s not about one cap, is it? It’s what you do with that one cap and how hungry you are to kick on now to gain on that experience.” Clarkson is still listed as a ‘training panellist’ rather than a full squad member and he was due to leave the set-up once their pre-New Zealand camp in Portugal was complete. Then came a tap on the shoulder. “I wasn’t supposed to be kept on after Portugal so to be kept on and end up playing it was a bit crazy,” he said. “We were gyming on the Monday and the team was announced Tuesday morning, so he [Farrell] kind of gives lads a heads up about what they are doing. “So, he was like, ‘You are going to be involved, 24th man for the New Zealand game’ because obviously Tadhg had been in and out with a few niggles so I was half expecting it. “It was either me or Jack Boyle because they normally take a tighthead so I kind of had a rough idea but he confirmed it there before we left. “I’m delighted and obviously incredibly grateful to the staff that they put a bit of trust in me it was a great day for me and my family and everyone else. “It was a bit surreal, like coming out for the anthem, it hadn’t been that full for the warm-up and then coming out and the fact it was dark as well so that added an extra bit. I had a big family there for the day. I think it was 10 so it was class. “I was still pretty nervous coming on [the second time]. “I wasn’t expecting 30 minutes as well so I was just trying to just make sure I was going at it from the start. Probably blew my load a little at the start, I was running around like a headless chicken there for the first 20 minutes, the last 10 I kind of died a little. “But I suppose that’s what you might expect, first cap.” Clarkson, whose grandfather Tony worked on the Irish Independent Sports desk and remains one of his biggest fans, began playing rugby at Wicklow RFC before attending Blackrock College. A talented swimmer who competed for national titles in the butterfly at U-12s, he is a dual national with an Italian mother and Irish father. He played alongside Ryan Baird, Harry Byrne and Craig Casey on the Grand Slam-winning 2019 U-20s team and was part of the 2022 Emerging Ireland squad, but he’s had to be patient at Leinster where he’s been involved in one Champions Cup game to date. Making the step up to international rugby was big, but Clarkson says Cian Healy was a huge help in settling him down in the build-up as he prepared to make his own milestone appearance. “He has been unbelievably helpful,” he said of the 133-cap veteran prop. “Just, sitting down watching training every day, making sure I understand, because I didn’t really get that many reps during the week because there was only two tightheads training. “He sat down with me and made sure I understood everything he was doing so I could do the same thing.”

Just look at the amount of money flowing into digital asset funds. A Monday report from European asset manager CoinShares said that assets under management for crypto investment vehicles are now at a new all-time high of $138 billion. The new peak mark comes after investors threw $2.2 billion at such funds last week, the report said. 📈 Digital asset inflows reached US$2.2bn last week, bringing year-to-date inflows to a record US$33.5bn. #Bitcoin and #Ethereum saw inflows of US$1.48bn and US$646m respectively. Short bitcoin investment products saw inflows of US$49m. Full report: https://t.co/W1BDGvhJ3B pic.twitter.com/45YkiVTOyV — CoinShares (@CoinSharesCo) November 18, 2024 CoinShares tracks funds around the world that give investors exposure to digital coins and tokens, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Europe and Asia. “This recent surge in [investing] activity appears to be driven by a combination of looser monetary policy and the Republican party’s clean sweep in the recent U.S. elections,” the report said. It added that most of the money was focused on U.S.-listed spot ETFs, giving sophisticated and retail investors exposure to Bitcoin. Wall Street regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), approved 11 new spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. The funds—managed by the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale—give investors from top hedge funds to small-timers using their phones the ability to invest in the cryptocurrency in a streamlined and regulated way. Following Donald Trump’s White House win earlier this month, Bitcoin’s price has surged to new highs above $93,000—partly driven by investors buying into the American ETFs. CoinShares’ report added that enthusiasm around Ethereum, the second-biggest digital asset, also surged: $646 million hit products, giving investors exposure to the coin last week. Since the Republican presidential victory on November 8, money has flowed into the crypto space. The week before, investors put nearly $2 billion into crypto funds. President-elect Trump has promised to help the digital asset industry, making various promises on the campaign trail.

Title: Canadian pension funds exposed as battery maker Northvolt struggles to survive

Time Published: 2024-11-18T23:22:31Z

Workers walk at the site of the Northvolt Ett factory in Skelleftea, north Sweden on Feb. 23, 2022.JONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP/Getty Images Several Canadian pension funds have sizable financial exposure in the event of a bankruptcy filing by Northvolt AB, the Swedish battery maker that is burning through cash as growth in demand for electric vehicles lags expectations. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Investment Management Corp. of Ontario (IMCO), Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec participated in US$2.3-billion in convertible debt financings for Stockholm-based Northvolt, joining major automakers and financial institutions to support the European battery hope as its future looked bright. OMERS also bought an undisclosed number of Northvolt shares in 2021. The Financial Times reported on Sunday that Northvolt is considering seeking protection from creditors in the coming days after talks about a rescue package collapsed. The company is still trying to secure short-term financing, but time is getting short, the FT said, quoting unnamed people involved in the negotiations. Northvolt has suffered this year as EV demand growth slowed and a US$2.15-billion battery order was cancelled. In recent months, it has cut a fifth of its staff and shelved many of its expansion plans. Meanwhile, the fate of a $7-billion factory planned for Quebec has yet to be decided. Northvolt said little about its current predicament when contacted by The Globe and Mail on Monday. “Financing negotiations are ongoing,” Northvolt spokesperson Emmanuelle Rouillard-Moreau said in an e-mail. “We are maintaining close communication with our investors and key partners. We will share updates and the outcome of these discussions once decisions have been finalized.” The terms of Northvolt’s convertible debt – including under what circumstances it would be swapped for equity – have not been disclosed, which makes it hard to gauge where the four Canadian pension funds rank in terms of seniority in the event of a bankruptcy, or how much of their initial investments are at risk of being wiped out. Lenders typically rank ahead of equity owners when a company is restructured. Northvolt’s ownership group also includes some of the biggest automotive and financial names, such as Volkswagen AG VWAGY, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Goldman Sachs. The latter was said to be leading ill-fated rescue-package talks that were aimed at securing a reported US$300-million. The total exposure among the Canadian pension funds is murky, making it difficult to glean the precise values of the funds’ investments from public disclosures. The four pension-fund managers participated in a series of debt issues in 2023, including a US$400-million investment from IMCO. CPPIB invested US$55-million, while OMERS and BlackRock Inc., which is the world’s largest asset manager, also participated as Northvolt expanded its existing US$1.1-billion convertible debt program to US$2.3-billion. In November, 2023, the Caisse took on US$150-million in convertible debt. OMERS was an earlier backer of the battery maker and has made three investments, starting with the purchase of an undisclosed stake in a US$2.75-billion private placement of equity alongside a host of other investors, including Swedish pension funds, Goldman Sachs and Volkswagen. OMERS has not disclosed the size of its equity position. Spokespeople for OMERS, CPPIB, IMCO and the Caisse all declined to comment beyond confirming investments that were publicly announced. In September, Northvolt announced it was cutting its Swedish work force by 1,600 and suspending a number of its expansion projects. It retreated from its growth strategy as automakers such as General Motors Co. GM-N, Ford Motor Co. F-N, Volvo Car AB VOLVF and Volkswagen tempered their EV outlooks and spending to deal with high capital costs and some resistance among car buyers, who face sticker shock and still-spotty charging infrastructure. In June, BMW cancelled a US$2.15-billion order for Northvolt battery cells. All of this turmoil has raised questions about the Quebec plant, which has been awarded billions of dollars in loans and production incentives from the federal and Quebec governments. Northvolt has said that it is conducting a strategic review of the facility in Saint-Basile-le-Grand, Que., and results are expected in the coming weeks.

Title: Tokenization’s Tailwinds: Payment Networks and Real-World Assets

Time Published: 2024-11-18T22:03:32Z

No matter the application, the guiding principle behind tokenization remains the same: replacing sensitive data with a digital representation (token) that protects that data. Recent weeks and months have seen the rise of what we might term two “tracks” of tokenization. There’s payment tokenization, and then there’s the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). The former protects card-level details and the cardholder through a digital representation of the 16-digit card details that is without value. The latter streamlines the transfer of assets, such as stocks, bonds and real estate, between parties. Mastercard, for example, plans to phase out the need to enter card numbers, static passwords and one-time codes when making online purchases by the end of the decade through tokenization and biometric authentication. The company’s tokenization technology has reduced cart abandonment and increased transaction approvals by 3 to 6 percentage points, while also minimizing the risk of fraud, as 30% of the payments network’s transactions are tokenized. During Visa’s most recent earnings call Oct. 29, management said more than 30% of the firm’s transactions are tokenized, and Visa has issued more than 11.5 billion tokens. The PYMNTS Intelligence report “The Tokenization Innovation Report: The Future of Security and Personalization” found that 78% of merchants enable network or payment tokens. Larger merchants are more familiar with tokenization. Eighty percent of merchants generating $10 million to $50 million in annual revenue are “very or extremely familiar” with payment data tokenization solutions, more than the corresponding 35% of those generating $1 million to $5 million and 14% of those generating less than $1 million in annual revenue. Another 97% of payment service providers use network tokens to provide digital wallet payments. The growing awareness of tokenization comes as roughly two-thirds of merchants said they had experienced payments fraud; more than three-quarters said they had seen at least some online transactions fail, per the report. Total tokenized market capitalization could reach $2 trillion by 2030, McKinsey estimated. Last month, Visa debuted its Visa Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP), which allows banking partners “to create and experiment with their own fiat-backed tokens in a VTAP sandbox.” In an initial use case, the platform enabled the issuance, transfer and redemption of a bank token on a blockchain, along with interactions of the token with smart contracts. Last week, Tether launched its own RWA tokenization platform, dubbed Hadron, which lets users “tokenize anything, anywhere,” including everything from stocks to loyalty points. In March, BlackRock unveiled its first tokenized fund issued on a public blockchain, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The company said last week that it expanded the offering, “by enabling BUIDL to be used within leading blockchain-based financial products and infrastructure across ecosystems.” In another example, Citigroup partnered with Wellington Management and WisdomTree in February to explore the tokenization of private markets. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Crypto boom 'more than just a fad'

The crypto boom following the US election has pushed the price of Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency, to a new all-time high of more than 3 million baht, say industry executives. The surge in crypto prices after the US election is more than just a fad, indicating a major shift in the global financial system amid political and policy changes that are having a wide impact, said Nirun Fuwattananukul, chief executive of Gulf Binance. A combination of favourable policies, institutional acceptance and technological developments are laying the foundation for a new financial system, he said. "We are at a critical turning point. The growth of the crypto market is not just about price, but a fundamental change in the way we manage and access financial services. This change will affect all sectors of the global economy and will determine the future of the financial system for the next decade," Mr Nirun said. Peerapat Hankongkaew, chief investment officer of Cryptomind Advisory, said president-elect Donald Trump has a policy to make Bitcoin the national reserve currency of the US. When that policy takes root, Bitcoin will again set a new record high price, he said. "Investing in Bitcoin now would be worthwhile to capitalise on the long-term trend," said Mr Peerapat. Bitcoin may be an asset to protect itself from inflation. In addition, the increasing demand has caused the price to rise even higher. "If the US can make Bitcoin a reserve currency, other countries will have to follow," he said. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has a gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) that takes about 20 years to reach a value of US$30 billion, but investing in the Bitcoin ETF took only one year to reach a value of $30 billion, said Mr Peerapat. He said over the long term, Bitcoin can maintain its bull run. "The increase is just starting and now is the time to buy," said Mr Peerapat. "Bitcoin is seen as a store of wealth. It is a new asset that can substitute for money. The amount to invest in Bitcoin should match your level of knowledge of the cryptocurrency." Speculation on Bitcoin after the US election drove the price to surpass $91,000 on Nov 14. "This market movement is not just about price, but a structural change in the financial ecosystem that will determine the future of the global financial system," said Mr Nirun. "Financial institutions are making major adjustments to meet growing customer demand and business opportunities. We are seeing a clearer convergence between traditional and digital finance, driven by policy and institutional acceptance," he said. "This reshuffle signals a clear recognition of the role of crypto at the policy level. We expect to see the development of a more pro-innovation legal and regulatory framework, while maintaining a focus on investor protection and system stability." The development of technological infrastructure, the creation of new products and services, and the development of personnel with expertise in digital assets are occurring rapidly in the financial sector. These changes will help increase efficiency and reduce costs in the overall financial system. In terms of investment product development, the industry is starting to see the rise of more sophisticated financial instruments, such as digital asset-based ETFs, derivatives and structured products that combine digital and traditional assets. These financial innovations will increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market. The integration of traditional and digital financial markets is accelerating, especially in terms of infrastructure, payment systems and risk management. Leading financial institutions around the world are investing heavily in blockchain technology and digital systems to support the growth of the digital asset market, he said. "The future of capital markets will be a seamless integration of traditional and digital systems. This shift will affect the allocation of capital worldwide, especially in emerging markets that may benefit from easier access to funds, lower transaction costs and increased fundraising efficiency," said Mr Nirun.

The leaders of the United States and China both participated in the recently held APEC Summit in Peru, with artificial intelligence dominating headlines again. Latest reports from Techopedia suggest that the two countries have in principle reached an agreement that neither nation would delegate control of nuclear weapons to artificial intelligence systems.

Sullivan further noted the agreement reflects how, even amidst competition, the US and the PRC can work responsibly to manage risks.

Title: Could Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Grow 10x Over the Next 3 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Stocks That Could 10X Over the Next 3 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) stands against the other stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. The new president of the United States is set to take office in January 2025, and investors are concerned about how the new policies will impact big tech. On November 14, Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO of IBM, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his expectations from big tech as the new presidency takes over the White House. Krishna shares that he expects more innovation and less regulation in the tech sector, with certain "guardrails." He adds that the business community is particularly excited and expects strong tailwinds to the US economy as we enter 2025. In the same interview, William Kerwin, an analyst at Morningstar Technology, appeared to discuss the potential future of big tech under the new presidency and how the new policies could impact companies, particularly those trading in China. Kerwin emphasizes that a lot is yet to unfold but the most crucial element is tariffs. With a proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports, companies reliant on the region will face severe headwinds and may have to seek trade relationships with other regions like India and Southeast Asia. However, he does add that high exposure to China does not necessarily equate to "high investment risk." READ ALSO 10 Best Predictive Analytics Stocks to Invest in Now and 12 Cheap Chinese Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Speaking of mergers and acquisitions and antitrust regulations, Kerwin is rather optimistic. He expects more merger and acquisition deals to come through over the next four years. In addition to that, he expresses that anti-trust regulations are less likely to be focused on a specific company or a product, and more on the platforms and their respective use cases offered by big tech. Kerwin also adds that he does not expect significant breakups but foresees regulations to be enforced that "erode" the competitive advantages the big tech companies enjoy at the moment. Kerwin believes that companies well exposed to artificial intelligence are currently overvalued. However, he reiterates that this "does not mean" that there are not any opportunities within the sector. He also shares a couple of names in the chip equipment and semiconductor sectors that are well-positioned at the moment. He suggests that while these sectors are pressed over cyclicality worries and the fear of AI reaching maturity, some companies hold promise and are valuable. Since investors are excited to see the business opportunities coming over the next four years, there are certain stocks, especially in the realm of technology, most likely to gain significant momentum. That said, let's take a look at the 8 stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years. Our Methodology To come up with the 8 stocks that could 10x over the next 3 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) stands against other best nickel stocks to invest in. Investing News Network highlighted that Nickel witnessed strong price momentum in H1 of the year as the prices took support from investor sentiment and speculation throughout commodity markets which saw a surge in prices for precious and base metals. Nickel prices remained volatile during Q3 2024 due to market speculation, Chinese stimulus, and oversupply. Among the contributing factors was the supply of laterite nickel out of Indonesia, which led to mine curtailments in New Caledonia, Australia, and Europe. Furthermore, the increased demand for battery production in China is yet to reach the levels required to make up for the increased supply. Despite the EV sector in China showing a YoY increase of 32% during the first 9 months of 2024, the industry's nickel demand was not able to make up for shortcomings in the broader economy. Nickel remains a critical component in NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) batteries, which are used in EVs. For the last few quarters, the market saw a significant oversupply of nickel from Asian markets, mainly from Indonesia. As per S&P Global, mined nickel production from the country saw an increase of 99,000 metric tons during Q3 2024 and is expected to be in the 2.4 million metric ton range by 2024-end, making up 57% of total global production. Despite growing demand for batteries, the oversupply situation has not been under control. This is mainly because of a weak Chinese economy. China has been tagged as the largest consumer of nickel in the world as a majority of the metal is being used in stainless steel production. However, a difficult real estate sector and broad economic deflation impacted the demand. Investing News Network went on to say that Nickel found pricing support in September, with the Chinese government rolling out stimulus measures focused on fueling economic growth. The measures also included a 0.5% cut to the mortgages and a reduction in the downpayment to buy a home to 15% from 25%. Even though there was an initial surge in nickel prices after the package, the prices retreated once again. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. Despite the challenging market conditions, Nickel’s long-term demand in the EV industry is robust. According to EV Magazine, as automakers prioritize the high-nickel battery chemistries because of range and performance advantages, nickel consumption should be fueled as a result of the global shift toward electrification. As per Benchmark estimates, the battery nickel demand is expected to triple by the year 2030. Mid and high-level performance EVs are expected to fuel the growth of battery nickel demand in the coming years, mainly in Western markets. Benchmark projections demonstrate that nickel-based chemistries will capture 85% of battery cell production capacity outside of China by the year 2030. The batteries should make up for more than 50% of nickel demand growth by 2030, touching 1.5 million tonnes of nickel demand by the decade's end.
