Photo: AP Photo/Trevor Collens An opening night outing against the Western Force is a long way from a Six Nations debut in Marseille, but there were shades of Joe McCarthy’s breakthrough performance for Ireland in the way he played in Perth on Saturday. The second-row’s trademark mullet means he fits right in Down Under and he looked as comfortable as he has done in some time as he thundered around the Optus Stadium, skittling blue jerseys as he went. It was a tour de force from the Blackrock second-row, who made two linebreaks and a total 34m across 15 carries and scored a try off the back of Henry Pollock’s brilliant chip and chase. He threw 11 passes including one in the build up that got the Lions moving for Tomos Williams’ try that broke the game open in the second half, with two offloads in the mix as well. Up against retiring former Wallaby Sam Carter and current squad member and enforcer Darcy Swain in the Force second-row, he was a nuisance in contact, turning over a Western Force maul at a crucial stage in the first half, making two dominant tackles and 18 in total in a high work-rate outing. He was busy in the lineout, taking five throws and the local broadcast team that included former Wallaby second row Justin Harrison and Michael Hooper raved about his performance, awarding him the man of the match award. On a night when the Lions’ discipline was highlighted by their coach, McCarthy coughed up just the one penalty. Afterwards, his bruised face bore the hallmarks of a tough night’s work but there was a lightness about the way he spoke that was light years away from his ‘everybody loves to hate Leinster’ line from a few weeks ago. Between the URC title win and a change of scenery, McCarthy looks unburdened and that is a dangerous prospect for the Australians. “It’s such an exciting team to play with – all the players are awesome so you get such a buzz playing with them,” he said. “I loved it. Once I came in for the first session, the standard of training was so high and I just thought, ‘Jeez, I’m going to get so much better, being in this environment.’ I just ripped into it. “It does feel weird [to call yourself a Lion]. It’s very, very cool. “The atmosphere was class and it’s only going to get better. Maybe not all the Lions fans made it to the first game in Western Australia but there were still a lot of red jerseys out there which was cool and there was a good buzz out there. “It was fun to get a bit of space and get my hands free as well. That’s kind of how the Aussies play so that was a bit of a taster today. They look for offloads and linebreaks. It was good to play in a fast-paced game with a lot of offloads.” McCarthy reckons the Lions is going to bring the best out of him. “It’s hard to put your finger on it, sometimes things just happen for you,” he said. “But you might prepare super well for a game and things don’t happen for you. I don’t know. “Especially here, it feels like a level up. There are people here doing everything for you so you try to lean into that, with the medics and the nutritionists. I try to lean on the support staff we have. “I was nervous and on edge a bit this week about playing well, but I’m probably at my best when I feel like my back’s against the wall a little bit.” It helps that McCarthy and his Ireland teammates know the coach and what he wants. Lions coach Andy Farrell watches his players warm up ahead of their rugby match against the Western Force in Perth, Australia. Photo: AP Photo/Trevor Collens Andy Farrell was visibly animated at half time in the dressing-room and he got the required response from the team after the restart. “Andy was pretty calm, generally, but he’s good at getting the boys up,” McCarthy said. “We started really fast but then we let them off the hook a bit with a few penalties. They were still in the game at half-time but then we kicked on a bit. He got us going a bit – he’s really good with the emotion for getting you up. No matter how many games you play for him, he finds a way to do it and we were better for it in the second half.’ “He wants us to be super physical, on the edge, but he tells us, ‘Don’t be desperate, don’t force things – earn the right to get off the line, make tackles and make turnovers.’” This could be a big couple of weeks for the McCarthy family with Joe’s younger brother Paddy in the Ireland squad for their tour of Georgia and Portugal. He’ll then travel out with brother Andrew and parents Joe and Paula in time for the Test series where their boy is set to have a big impact. “I can’t wait for that. They’re going to come out for the last three weeks, to watch the last four games,” McCarthy said. “If Paddy’s playing my family will travel out to Tbilisi. They’ll enjoy that. He was delighted that he made the summer tour and it meant that he could fly to Australia as well. I’m sure he’ll bring his boots with him! “It’s huge. I’d love to see him make his Ireland debut – that would be special.” If he keeps going the way he’s going, they’ll get bang for their buck and in the meantime he’s fully invested in getting the most out of this experience. His role away from rugby is to come up with the Lions’ ‘thought of the day’ with Northampton Saints winger Tommy Freeman. Yesterday, they told the squad that “Today is the oldest you ever have been and the youngest you ever will be”. McCarthy certainly looked like he’s taking an approach that will see him seize his day as a Lion.

Title: Bloomberg: 'Golden Age' of Mass Migration Ends for Business
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/06/29/bloomberg-golden-age-of-mass-migration-ends-for-business/
Time Published: 2025-06-29T16:50:41Z

Business leaders must hire Americans and buy high-tech machines because “the Golden Age [of migration] for employers is ending,” says the pro-migration Bloomberg. “We are witnessing a paradigm shift when it comes to mass immigration, rather than a temporary change,” the June 27 article stated: For as long as most of us can remember, business has been able to call on a ready supply of foreign workers. The giants of Silicon Valley, farmers and food processors, hotels and restaurants, housebuilders and megastores: All have dealt with labor shortages by recruiting immigrants. One result has been an astonishing demographic transformation: 16% of the British population, 20% of the Swedish population, 19% of the German population and 14.3% of the US population were born abroad. WATCH — WOW! Trump Admin Says There Were ZERO May Border Crossings: But public opinion is increasingly opposed to migration, so companies should revive their pre-migration efforts to train locals for new jobs instead of importing workers, Bloomberg recommended: Domestic supply chains have fallen into disrepair in recent decades, in part because both governments and employers have been able to turn to the easy option of importing immigrants. … Companies need to take a more prominent role in fixing domestic [labor] supply chains. Tap into the neglected pool of talent in working-class communities by sponsoring charter schools, endowing university scholarships or spotting and then sponsoring talented students. Improve vocational education by introducing apprenticeship programs or forging relationships with local high schools. Take a more prominent role in providing career guidance in local schools. Employ more unconventional workers such as older workers by introducing flexible working hours or extended holidays. Companies also must invest more in wealth-generating, labor-saving machines instead of exploiting the post-1990 bubble of government-supplied cheap migrant labor, Bloomberg added: This is particularly true of industries that now rely on imported labor such as construction, farming and hospitality. America’s postwar experiment with the factory-based production of houses proved to be a tremendous success, with the price of factory-made homes falling by two-thirds in 1955-73, before it was destroyed by a combination of construction unions and red tape. In agriculture, “intelligent” AI-powered machines can do things that were too delicate for dumb machines, such as nurturing seeds and controlling weeds. In hospitality, robots can do ever more delicate cleaning jobs. The Bloomberg article focused on blue-collar labor and did not spotlight the harm of migration on white-collar Americans. Still, Bloomberg is also posting a series of scoops about the H-1B labor inflow that is displacing many young Americans. Moreover, the Bloomberg article is more evidence that elite opinion is turning away from migration, largely because the establishment media are no longer able to hide the civic chaos, mass deaths and rapes, public anger, primitive ideologies, and economic damage caused by elites’ decision to sideline native populations in favor of the profits earned from foreign migrants. WATCH — ICE Arrests Over 80 Illegal Aliens Working at Louisiana Racetrack: “I used to subscribe to the near consensus among economists that immigration to the US was a good thing,” Professor Angus Deaton wrote in a March 2024 post for the International Monetary Fund. He continued: Longer-term analysis over the past century and a half tells a different story. Inequality was high when America was open [to migration], was much lower when the borders were closed [to migrants], and rose again post Hart-Celler (the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965) as the fraction of foreign-born people rose back to its levels in the Gilded Age. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” he said. But most business groups and establishment media sites remain pro-migration, regardless of the massive government failures and massive civic chaos that led to the reelection of President Donald Trump in 2024.

Title: The Rocket  Fueled: Bitcoin Supply Shock Incoming, Keiser Says

Time Published: 2025-06-29T16:39:01Z

Bitcoin appears to be tightening its grip on market attention once again—this time not because of price volatility, but due to a looming structural scarcity that some of the asset’s most vocal supporters say is unfolding in real time. Max Keiser, Bitcoin advocate and advisor to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, issued a clear statement on Tuesday, June 25, 2025, via his X account. “I’ve done the math. A Bitcoin supply shock is imminent,” Keiser posted, punctuating the forecast with a rocket emoji. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of Bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins. According to blockchain data, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoins have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created. That number is falling fast. This event, part of Bitcoin’s four-year issuance schedule, cut block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. As a result, the daily release of new coins dropped to approximately 450 BTC per day—down from around 900 before the halving. That drop in new supply arrives just as institutional demand shows no signs of easing. Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, institutional entities have poured billions into the asset. Data from early 2025 shows that ETFs, particularly BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), have absorbed large volumes of BTC. As of June 2025, BlackRock leads all ETF issuers with substantial Bitcoin holdings, outpacing even Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, which now controls over 500,000 BTC. In January 2024 after the ETF approvals, Samson Mow warned of a double-edged market pressure: a supply shock from the halving and a demand shock from ETF buying. His view now seems to be taking shape. Mow and Keiser argue that market liquidity could dry up fast when these forces collide. Trading volumes also support the idea of a supply shock. On June 24, Bitcoin trading volume exceeded $3 billion in just one hour. Such spikes indicate growing participation from institutions and retail investors alike, especially during periods of market uncertainty. Bitcoin’s role as a potential store of value is also finding renewed interest amid global instability. The ongoing accumulation by large firms and new treasury entrants such as Metaplanet and ProCap BTC, recently co-founded by VC investor Anthony Pompliano, add weight to the notion that Bitcoin is becoming a preferred long-term asset. On June 25, 2025, Keiser’s remarks will be accompanied by a broader analysis of the changing dynamics in Bitcoin supply and demand. Analysts point to a structural shift—less Bitcoin is being created and more is locked away in institutional vaults. That imbalance already affects availability on exchanges, where reserves continue to drop. Keiser and Mow’s predictions are not new, but the timeline may tighten. With less than five million Bitcoin left to mine, and the next halving set for 2028—when block rewards will fall again to 1.5625 BTC—the pressure on circulating supply may continue to intensify. For now, the data shows demand rising while supply falls. Whether that translates to market movement remains to be seen. But Bitcoin’s architecture ensures one thing: the supply side will not expand. As of late June 2025, that’s no longer just a theoretical talking point—it’s becoming visible on the blockchain.

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Register $2 Billion Inflows As Institutional Demand Surges – Details

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The US Bitcoin spot ETFs logged over $2 billion in net inflows last week, marking a three-week streak of positive momentum. Despite a bearish start to June, with $128.81 million in net outflows during the first trading week, investor appetite soon quickly rebounded. This turnaround has resulted in a cumulative $4.63 billion in deposits over the past three weeks. On Friday June 27, the 12 US Bitcoin ETFs registered net inflows of $501.27 million bringing the aggregate deposits of the last week to a staggering $2.22 billion. According to data from ETF tracking site SoSoValue, the clean streak of daily inflows from last week extends the ETFs’ positive performance to 14 consecutive days. In analyzing individual ETF data from this week, the BlackRock IBIT registered $1.31 billion in net deposits solidifying its position as the market’s unrivalled leader. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark/21 Shares’ ARKB also experienced substantial cumulative inflows of $504.40 million and $268.14 million, respectively. Grayscale’s BTC, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, Invesco’s BTCO, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC also recorded moderate net flows ranging from $1million – $25 million. In familiar fashion, Grayscale’s GBTC produced the only net outflows losing $5.69 million in withdrawals, but still retains its position as the third largest Bitcoin ETF with $19.79 billion in net assets. Following this week, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have now recorded $4.50 billion in net flows in June signaling a resolute demand from institutional investors despite Bitcoin market troubles. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has witnessed extensive corrections since hitting a new all-time high of $111,790 on May 22. Over the last month, BTC has made no new price discovery trading largely between $100,000 and $110,000 to form a descending price channel. While this price performance reflects a neutral market sentiment, the high influx of capital into the Bitcoin ETFs signal a long-term confidence by institutional investors on Bitcoin’s price appreciation prospects. In other developments, SoSoValue data also reveals that US Ethereum Spot ETFs notched up a cumulative inflow of $283.41 million over the last week extending their positive streak to seven consecutive weeks. In June alone, these ETFs saw total inflows of $1.13 billion, marking their largest monthly gain in 2025. As of the time of writing, the total net assets of the Ethereum ETFs stand at $9.88 billion, accounting for 3.37% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,441 with Bitcoin prices set around $107,339. Semilore Faleti is a cryptocurrency writer specialized in the field of journalism and content creation.

Title: Senate removes provision that would sell off public lands from megabill

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/29/2025 8:09:19 AM PDT by RandFan The Senate has removed a controversial provision from its megabill that would have sold off hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who was leading the push on the measure, announced late Saturday that the measure would be stripped from the bill. “Because of the strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families – not to China, not to Blackrock and not to any foreign interests,” Lee said in a post on X. “For that reason, I’ve decided to withdraw the federal land sales provision from the bill,” he added. Lee had initially proposed selling off between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of public lands. After that proposal was rejected by the Senate parliamentarian, he put forward a new measure that would have sold off between 600,000 and 1.2 million acres. But, the Utah Republican indicated in his post on Saturday that he would work with President Trump to find uses for what he described as “underutilized” lands. “President Trump promised to put underutilized federal land to work for American families, and I look forward to helping him achieve that in a way that respects the legacy of our public lands and reflects the values of people who use them most,” he wrote. While the measure had some GOP support, it also received pushback from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. (Excerpt) Read more at thehill.com ...

The only exception to federal ownership of state lands is a mandatory process to purchase state lands for "needful buildings" (US Const., Art.

Democrats for the most part would not want any Federal land sold to private interest. Those on both sides that are in the pockets of Blackrock and/or the CCP would not want any restriction on who the land was sold to, because the want the government to get the maximum benefit from the sale. On the upside I did see that Trump has cancelled the "No Roads" on US Forest Land in the interest of forest management. 3 posted on 06/29/2025 8:21:57 AM PDT by Pontiac (The welfare state must fail because it is contrary to human nature and diminishes the human spirit.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: RandFan There's a lot about this bill I don't like, but a significant alternative just isn't possible. The raxor thin margins in the House and Senate means there is only an extremely narrow path. Sometimes you have to vote for something you don't like because the alternative of having nothing is worse. That's true today, and it was true when McCarthy was Speaker. The people and members can b*tch and scream about what the country needs, and they may well be correct, but the math and makeup of Congress imposes limits that can't be ignored in terms of what is possible.

That would keep Blackrock, the Chicoms and Bill Gates away. Yes it would limit how much is sold and how quickly it is sold, but it would keep that land out of the hands of the above which is the whole point. The federal government owns a ridiculous amount of land in the west. It stifles the growth of those states and makes home prices artificially high. In addition to the above, it would generate good revenue for the federal treasury to sell some land. Land sales used to be a nice 10% or so of federal revenues per year. 8 posted on 06/29/2025 8:44:14 AM PDT by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: RandFan Typical of DC.

After that proposal was rejected by the Senate parliamentarian, he put forward a new measure that would have sold off between 600,000 and 1.2 million acres. But, the Utah Republican indicated in his post on Saturday that he would work with President Trump to find uses for what he described as “underutilized” lands. “President Trump promised to put underutilized federal land to work for American families, and I look forward to helping him achieve that in a way that respects the legacy of our public lands and reflects the values of people who use them most,” he wrote.

The raxor thin margins in the House and Senate means there is only an extremely narrow path. Sometimes you have to vote for something you don't like because the alternative of having nothing is worse. That's true today, and it was true when McCarthy was Speaker. The people and members can b*tch and scream about what the country needs, and they may well be correct, but the math and makeup of Congress imposes limits that can't be ignored in terms of what is possible.

We can devise a lottery of Federal land. Anyone who can prove they are the direct descendant of an American resident or Native American tribe prior to 1867 gets one lottery share for a land division in Alaska.

If your direct ancestors were here before 1803 you get a lottery share for Louisiana Purchase land in addition to all the other lotteries. Each lottery would be for random but similar plots of Federally owned surplus land in a particular lottery location. Once drawn, the land is yours to develop or sell (after a reasonable waiting period). You (the new owner) of course would be responsible for any applicable property taxes or hazardous materials remediation costs (e.g. abandoned mine clean ups).

Title: Bitcoin Bet Turns Bitter: 5 Lawsuits Vs. Strategy For $6 Billion Losses

Strategy Inc., the company once known as MicroStrategy, is now at the center of at least five class‑action lawsuits. Investors claim the firm hid big risks tied to its Bitcoin holdings and painted a rosier picture than what was real. The lawsuits hinge on about $6 billion in unrealized losses and cover an 11‑month stretch from April 2024 through April 2025. According to filings, the complaints say executives made untrue and misleading statements about Bitcoin’s ups and downs and an accounting change that forces the company to mark its crypto to market. One lead plaintiff, Abhey Parmar, insists that top officers breached their duties and oversold the company’s outlook. Based on reports, law firms are already bidding to lead these actions—the kind of scramble you see when big money is at stake. Strategy is facing at least five class action lawsuits alleging securities fraud due to $6 billion in unrealized BTC losses. The lawsuits accuse the firm of misleading investors about Bitcoin risks and profitability. Legal experts say such competing filings are common as firms… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 27, 2025 Investors point to trades by new CEO Phong Le and CFO Andrew Kang as proof of inside dealing. They sold about $32 million in stock just before the public disclosure of the accounting shift. Lawyers say that timing raises questions about whether executives knew how badly the mark‑to‑market losses would hit the books. If they held back material facts until after their trades, that could stiffen the case. In April, Strategy warned shareholders it wouldn’t break even in Q1 because of those same unrealized Bitcoin losses. The firm reported a loss of $16.49 per share and cautioned it might not turn a profit soon. That announcement triggered the first suit—filed on May 16 by Pomerantz LLP—and prompted follow‑ons from Gross Law Firm; Bronstein Gewirtz & Grossman; Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check; and Levi & Korsinsky. Despite the courtroom drama, the stock is up nearly 30% so far this year. Strategy now holds 592,345 BTC, with a total market value north of $63 billion. The firm bought its Bitcoin at an average of $70,702 per coin, and today they trade around $106,824—an unrealized gain of about $21.3 billion, or roughly 50%. Those figures help explain why investors have stuck with the plan. Based on the latest SEC filings, founder Michael Saylor is the biggest holder, with close to 20 million shares—worth almost $8 billion at $389.50 per share. Other big names include Vanguard at 8.55%, BlackRock at 5.80%, Capital International Investors at 5.80%, Susquehanna Securities at 4.82%, and Jane Street Group at 4.70%. Strategy’s stock trades near $393.24, valuing the company at about $107.50 billion—a 1.67x premium over its net asset value.

Title: Breaking: Mike Lee's Public Land Sale Plan Is Dead

Facing overwhelming opposition from all Democrats and a growing number in his own party, Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee tonight withdrew his proposal to sell millions of acres of public land to help balance the federal budget. In a statement issued by his office, Lee said that because of the “strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families — not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests. For that reason I’ve made the decision to withdraw the federal land sales provision from the bill.” Lee’s language, a central part of the omnibus federal budget bill, would have put more than a million acres of BLM land on the auction block starting later this year. Senate leaders, hurriedly working to get the budget to a floor vote this weekend, gave Lee the opportunity to pull his provision, pages 202 to 211 of the thousand-page Big Beautiful Bill, knowing that it would have faced certain defeat by the Republican-majority Senate. That language would have forced the sale of BLM land in 11 Western states to offset tax cuts and royalty rebates to gas and oil drillers. The language in those pages, sponsored and revised over the last two weeks by Lee, would have created the largest disposal of public land since the Homestead Act. Tens of thousands of hunters, anglers, hikers, and public-land recreationists have pummeled the offices of their congressional delegations with increasingly strident demands to kill Lee’s bill. That continued pressure from a broad and vocal coalition of rural hunters, suburban hikers, livestock producers, Main Street business owners, anglers, dirtbag climbers, and whitewater rafters made the difference, says Montanan Randy Newberg, host of Fresh Tracks and a vocal public-land advocate. “Mike Lee did something that we’ve not been able to do, to have all Americans become focused on one issue, no partisanship, no Rs, no Ds, and in the process I hope they have sent a message that public lands are that third rail of American politics,” says Newberg, one of several social-media personalities who rallied his audience around defending public lands. “I think you could also say the same of the Senate, they put partisanship aside to kill this bad idea.” Newberg singled out the work of New Mexico Democrat Martin Heinrich for his ability to keep all Democrats aligned on killing Lee’s bill, and working across the aisle to convince fellow Western Republicans that it was bad for their constituents. While calls for the removal of the land-sale language from the mega bill was nearly unanimous, Lee kept digging in, making revisions that increased the amount of land that could be sold and adding vague language that seemed to stray from what he said was his intention: to allow Western municipalities to buy surrounding federal land in order to grow and build affordable housing for their residents. But in the most recent iteration, released by Lee’s office last night in order to satisfy the Senate’s budgetary rules, the highest priority for would-be disposed BLM lands was their appraised value. That highly valued land would likely have been bought by amenity purchasers, not cash-strapped Western cities. By adding lands with unallocated subsurface mineral rights to the total, the latest draft of the bill alarmed conservationists —— as much as 3 million acres of BLM land might have been available for sale to private industries, speculators, and even foreign governments. The Senate’s budget reconciliation process allows the omnibus budget package to pass by a simple majority. Republicans have only a 3-seat majority in both the Senate and House, but four Western Republicans had indicated they wouldn’t support the budget bill if it contained Lee’s land sales provision. Sources report that the roster of Republicans quietly in opposition to the measure was large and growing, causing the Senate leadership to strike Lee’s language in order to move the rest of the Big Beautiful Bill, which among other things could make tax cuts permanent for the wealthiest Americans and also includes cuts to Medicaid, public-lands management agencies, and federal reimbursements to rural hospitals. The Senate’s death blow to Lee’s bill removes pressure on the House of Representatives to kill the language. The House had been considered the “backwall” in efforts to make sure the land-sale provision didn’t advance to President Trump, who had indicated strong support for the proposal.

Title: ‘The Canal Is Ours’

The building projects both power and exclusion. For most of the twentieth century it was the administrative seat of the former Panama Canal Zone, a US enclave to which most Panamanians were denied access. The canal—one of the infrastructural marvels of the twentieth century and a crucial artery of global trade—became the epicenter of US power in Latin America when Teddy Roosevelt secured control of its surrounding territory in 1903. It retained that distinction for nearly three quarters of a century, until Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama’s military leader, Omar Torrijos, that gradually ceded the Canal Zone to the Republic of Panama. The cession was to be completed by 12:00 PM on that December day in 1999. When the morning arrived, heavy rains drenched the isthmus, but a sea of people turned out all the same. At the strike of noon the crowd rushed up the hill to the Administration Building, waving Panama’s tricolor flag. “The canal is ours,” Panama’s president, Mireya Moscoso, proclaimed from atop the stairs. That celebration echoed this past December, when hundreds of people gathered at the Administration Building to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the end of the canal transition. The Panama Canal Authority, the semiautonomous entity that has overseen the maritime passage since 1997, placed a plaque on the front of the structure commemorating the achievement, which many in Panama and across the hemisphere consider a triumph of Latin American self-determination in the face of centuries of US hegemony. The festivities were not without anxiety. A week earlier, at an event hosted by the right-wing nonprofit Turning Point USA, then–president elect Donald Trump proclaimed that the US was being “ripped off at the Panama Canal”—presumably a reference to the tolls that container ships pay to traverse the passage. Trump complemented the speech with a series of posts on his social media platform, Truth Social, alleging that China was running the waterway and announcing that, consequently, the US would be taking it back. The comments sent shockwaves through Panama. President José Raúl Mulino flatly rejected them, asserting the country’s “nonnegotiable” sovereignty over the passage and insisting that “every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjoining zone is Panama’s and will remain so.” But even as Panamanian society recoiled at Trump’s rhetoric, other sectors saw an opportunity for vindication. When Carter negotiated the Panama Canal Treaties in 1977, he met stiff resistance from the Zonians, US citizens whose families had lived in the Canal Zone for generations, running the waterway and maintaining the slice of middle-class American society that cropped up around it. Carter is effectively a national hero in Panama, but many of the Zonians have long considered him an enemy. “I just hope Jimmy Carter stays alive long enough to see Trump take back the Panama Canal,” one participant posted in a Zonian group on Facebook after Trump’s initial provocations. Carter died that same week. Even amid the funeral rites, Trump continued to disparage Carter’s cession of the US colonial enclave in Panama as “a very big mistake.” For the Panamanians who showed up at the Administration Building on December 31, such language was deeply alarming. But it held an appeal for some of the Zonians, who recall the canal transition as a personal epic of paradise lost. Demostenes Angel/AFP/Getty Images Demonstrators gathering at the Panama Canal’s Administration Building to celebrate the waterway’s final handover to Panamanian control, Panama City, December 31, 1999 At the time of the treaty negotiations, many Zonians rallied behind the burgeoning neoconservative movement, donating to right-wing politicians and collaborating with organizations like the American Conservative Union and the Heritage Foundation—the latter going on to design Project 2025, the policy playbook that has informed much of the second Trump administration’s governance.1 By ceding the canal, they thought, Carter had demonstrated a weakness that, as the arch-conversative Republican senator from North Carolina Jesse Helms warned at the time, “could literally destroy America.” Bound to the Zonians’ plight, then, was the question of America’s global standing. The US’s decline from its postwar grandeur has many causes, but for the Zonians and Trump alike, some answers might be found on the isthmus of Panama. * In 1903 Teddy Roosevelt sought rights to construct a sea-level canal across Panama, then a province of Colombia. When Bogotá refused, he pivoted to Panama’s oligarchy, which had repeatedly agitated for independence over the course of the nineteenth century. Roosevelt promised to recognize and defend the new Panamanian nation, with his gunboats if necessary; in exchange the Panamanian elite gave Washington control over a ten-mile-wide stretch of territory that would encompass the canal. The agreement was enshrined in the 1903 Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty, which leased US rights to the territory “in perpetuity.” In November of that year, Washington gained the Canal Zone and Panama gained nationhood in one stroke. Advertisement The task of excavating the canal brought tens of thousands of workers from around the world: European and Chinese émigrés, migrants from surrounding Latin American countries, West Indian laborers seeking opportunity in the face of the stagnation then plaguing former plantation slavery economies. Among the “ditch diggers” were thousands of white US citizens (the hiring of Black US citizens during the construction period was limited), hailing from all corners of the country but especially from northeastern and midwestern industrial centers like New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The meaning of the term “Zonian” has evolved in the past half-century: depending on whom you ask, it could refer to military personnel stationed in one of the fourteen US military bases that once lined the canal, or to US civilians who moved to the Zone over the mid-twentieth century to work for the Panama Canal Company. But in its most restrictive use the term applies to the white US canal builders and their descendants. The first generation of Zonians came from a range of backgrounds—some were engineers, others manual laborers—yet all found themselves on a preferential end of a system of Jim Crow–style segregation that the US exported to the isthmus in the early twentieth century.2 At the base of that system was a two-tiered wage hierarchy. White laborers got paid in gold American dollars (the “gold roll”) whereas other laborers, largely West Indian and Panamanian, got paid in local coin, typically Colombian silver pesos (the “silver roll”). That distinction, in turn, shaped the rest of economic and social life: there were gold towns and silver towns, gold schools and silver schools, movie theaters, recreation areas, drinking fountains, and so on. The Isthmian Canal Commission, the administration overseeing the canal’s construction, claimed to be distinguishing merely between “skilled” and “unskilled” workers, but many gold and silver positions demanded identical responsibilities and duties. A “gold-roller” could make somewhere between two to four times as much as a “silver-roller” for effectively the same job. Otis Historical Archives/Wikimedia Commons A hand-tinted lantern slide of Spanish laborers working on the construction of the Panama Canal, circa early 1900s This system of segregation drew on some of the mechanisms of Jim Crow, as well as its animating spirit, but was complicated by the international setting of the Zone. To preserve white Americans’ primacy, race was “mapped onto nationality,” as the historian Rebecca Herman has written.3 To be American was, in effect, to be white; by extension, “to be a non-U.S. citizen was to be defined as non-white.” European canal builders and white Latinos were relegated to the silver roll; Black US citizens had been restricted precisely because they complicated the logic of the gold–silver hierarchy. By the 1930s some twenty worked civilian jobs in the Zone, almost all of them on the silver roll. The Canal Zone Government didn’t, moreover, extend birthright citizenship to children born to non-US citizens in the Zone, ensuring that even babies born in the Zone’s Gorgas hospital would be denied gold-roll status unless their parents were US citizens. In 1948, to accord with the Truman administration’s civil rights reforms, the Canal Zone administration changed the dual payment system from gold and silver to “US-rate” and “local-rate” (or in some instances “Latin American” rate). A 1955 bilateral agreement prompted lukewarm efforts to unify the wage system, but the Zone’s personnel bureau largely ignored the mandate. By 1961 only 240 Panamanians received US-rate wages, and the discrepancy between the two schedules persisted at a rate of four to one. It would not be until December 1977, two years before the implementation of the treaty and twenty-three years after the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, that the Zone’s last segregated “Latin American” school would officially close.4 * As the century progressed, successive Panamanian administrations sought to reclaim the Zone, forging a series of new bilateral agreements that modified but never annulled the 1903 treaty. By midcentury, nationalist sentiment boiled over into a series of violent clashes between Panamanian citizens and the Zone’s military and civilian populations. Perhaps the most significant occurred on January 9, 1964, when a group of Panamanian students marched into the Canal Zone and attempted to raise a Panamanian flag outside the enclave’s Balboa High School. Their efforts were met with violence, first from the Zone’s residents and police force and then from the US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM)—the arm of the US Department of Defense headquartered in the Canal Zone. The confrontation ignited widespread riots that left three hundred people wounded and two dozen dead. Advertisement Amid the upheaval, Panamanian President Roberto F. Chiari suspended diplomatic relations with the US; the terms of their resumption three months later included initiating a process to negotiate a new treaty, which would replace the Hay-Bunau-Varilla agreement. Former president Aristedes Royo, who helped negotiate the Torrijos-Carter treaties and served as the civilian face of Panama’s dictatorship when the agreements went into effect, told me that by trying to keep the Panamanian students from raising their flag that January day in 1964, the Zonians ultimately benefited the Panamanian cause. Royo and I spoke in late 2023, as he was completing his tenure as minister of canal affairs. We met in his wood-paneled office, which was converted from a former Canal Zone school and located only a short distance from where the flag riots broke out. As he recalls it, the 1977 treaties owe a debt of gratitude to “the Zonians’ poor conduct that day.” The road from the riots to the Torrijos-Carter treaties was hardly straight. Successive US administrations delayed, uneager to cede any control over such a strategic foothold. Only in the aftermath of Washington’s catastrophic war in Vietnam, when Carter took office seeking a foreign policy rooted in respect for international law and the self-determination of other nations, did Panama’s fortunes change. At the time of treaty implementation, some 3,500 “true” Zonians—white US civilian laborers with multigenerational histories on the isthmus—and their families resided in the enclave, a select minority among the 14,500 total US and Panamanian workers employed by the Panama Canal Company and the Canal Zone Government. To these Zonians, whose daily reality depended on Washington’s forcible presence in Panama, the 1977 agreement spelled the end of a way of life. Those that remained over the transition period would be tasked with training a Panamanian workforce to take over their jobs. When the treaties entered into force on October 1, 1979, it marked the formal dissolution of the Canal Zone as such: the Republic of Panama immediately assumed jurisdiction over much of the ten-mile-wide territory. US military bases and personnel in Panama came under a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), an accord establishing a legal framework to dictate the rights and privileges of military-affiliated foreign nationals stationed in another country. US personnel began gradually turning over townsites, military bases, and infrastructure in the former Zone, to be completed over the following decades. In accordance with the Panama Canal Act of 1979, the legislation that implemented the treaties, Canal Commission employees were allowed to retire as early as forty-eight with eighteen years of service, or at any age after twenty-three years of service, effectively ensuring that all workers employed at the time the Torrijos-Carter Treaties were signed would be able to start collecting pensions upon the completion of the transition in 1999. The possibility of early retirement was not enough to placate the Zonians. Even before the ink had dried on the Panama Canal Treaties, negotiation efforts sparked what some in the community have called “the exodus.” A world was ending, and Jimmy Carter was the horseman of their apocalypse. On September 30, 1979, they went to bed under US jurisdiction and awoke under the government of Omar Torrijos, a mestizo general from the hinterlands of Panama.5 The vast majority of the community left Panama and resettled elsewhere, predominantly in the southern climes of the US. They were under no legal obligation to depart; Torrijos had extended citizenship to the Zonians in the years leading up to the treaty, and many of them became dual citizens. Nevertheless, as H.B. Twohy, a fourth-generation Zonian, told me, many felt an expectation to “go back home to a place I’ve never lived before.” U.S. National Archives and Records Administration/Wikimedia Commons The docks of Balboa, the capital of the American-administered Panama Canal Zone, 1923 There is a general feeling among the Zonians of having been unjustly abandoned by a federal government that had for years administered every facet of their lives, from housing to employment to grocery shopping at subsidized commissaries. There is a prevailing notion, too, that the media has dealt them an unfair hand, particularly in its portrayals of the Canal Zone’s racial segregation. “When the treaty came about, everybody was pissed,” recalled Mike Andrews, a onetime cooling and refrigeration foreman who lived and worked on the Atlantic side of the Zone. Despite his opposition to the transition he decided to remain in Panama, where both his parents are buried. Andrews departed the former Zone in 1991 to run a fishing lodge in Panama’s Darién province and has since retired. We spoke in January of 2024 at a Zonian reunion at the Elks Lodge, a beloved Zonian haunt a short drive from the Administration Building just outside Panama City. The mounted antlers of countless bucks lined the walls. “There are few places that the Americans who stayed after the treaty have to go to,” he told me, other than the lodge where we were talking. Before the transition, Andrews said, he used to hunt and fish freely in the Zone’s thick jungles and abundant waters, but now he was irked by Panama’s tighter gun regulations. “We had a utopia,” he told me. “It’s sad what happened…since the treaty. Panamanians have destroyed this country.” * The Zonians did not go down without a fight. At the time of the Torrijos-Carter Treaty negotiations, they pinned their hopes on Ronald Reagan, who as a Republican primary candidate for the 1976 presidential elections gave a fervent, oft-repeated stump speech that made him a hero to US citizens in Panama: [The] Canal Zone is not a colonial possession. It is not a long-term lease. It is sovereign United States Territory every bit the same as Alaska and all the states that were carved from the Louisiana Purchase. We should end those negotiations and tell the General: We bought it, we paid for it, we built it, and we intend to keep it. That the claim was inaccurate—in fact the 1903 treaty leased the Canal Zone territory to the United States in perpetuity rather than transferring ownership—made little difference to the Zonians and their neoconservative allies in the metropole. “We thought he was going to be our salvation,” Andrews recalled of Reagan, who lost the 1976 primary to Gerald Ford but went on to oust Jimmy Carter from the White House in a landslide four years later. After Reagan won the presidency, in Andrews’s telling, he had too much “political pressure put on him” to thwart the canal transition. And yet the US hardly stayed out of Panamanian politics after 1980. The Department of Defense maintained its Southern Command headquarters in the Canal Zone neighborhood of Quarry Heights and continued training Panama’s military, the Panamanian Defense Forces, at the US Army School of the Americas, located in the former Zone’s Fort Gulick. One of the school’s graduates, Manuel Noriega, became the de facto dictator of Panama in 1983 following Omar Torrijos’s death in a suspicious plane crash two years prior. Noriega was a crucial collaborator in the Reagan administration’s War on Drugs, funneling information to the Drug Enforcement Agency and the CIA even as he forged his own narcotrafficking empire. By 1982 he was charging runners from Pablo Escobar’s Medellín drug cartel $100,000 per trip to use Panamanian airstrips to transit their wares, sending members of the PDF to coordinate the operations and payments.6 By mid-decade the US–Panamanian relationship was fraying, in part as a result of Noriega’s illegal activities, which the journalist Seymour Hersh detailed in June 1986 in a bombshell investigation for The New York Times. As Panamanians took to the streets in opposition and the dictatorship meted out increasingly violent repression, the general came to seem more like a liability than an asset. Finally, in 1989, the US Department of Defense unleashed some 26,000 troops on the isthmus to depose and capture Noriega. Steve Starr/Corbis/Getty Images American tanks in the streets of Panama City during the US invasion, 1989 Washington helped install the US-friendly president Guillermo Endara, who was sworn into office on one of the remaining US military bases in the early morning hours of December 20 at the very moment that Operation Just Cause—as the US called the invasion—descended upon the country. Eighteen thousand Panamanians lost their homes to the operation; the Pentagon reported 516 Panamanian casualties, but independent human rights groups estimated that civilian deaths were in the thousands. Many of the slain were residents of El Chorrillo, an Afro-Panamanian neighborhood in downtown Panama City that was also home to the PDF headquarters. The Department of Defense all but razed El Chorrillo to the ground in an indiscriminate bombing campaign in the first hours of the invasion; thousands of Chorrilleros had to be resettled in temporary housing, and many found themselves in active or defunct US bases along the Canal. Twenty-five-hundred people would ultimately spend two years living in improvised shelters fashioned from airplane hangars that were previously part of the Albrook Air Force Station.7 Despite the carnage, much of Panamanian society was relieved to be rid of Noriega. In the years leading up to his ouster the Cruzada Civilista (Civil Crusade), a dynamic coalition drawing from all sectors of the country’s citizenry, assembled a peaceful movement against the strongman. Some of its members would go on to have prominent government positions in post-invasion Panama, including José Raúl Mulino. The country rebuilt, democracy returned, and those exiled by the dictatorship could at last return home. In the following decades relations between Washington and Panama City have been amicable and robust. All the country’s heads of state since 2000 have received their higher education in the US, and the two countries have signed numerous security and free trade agreements since the end of the canal transition. Even as the canal’s administration became solely Panamanian, US presence remained palpable: a retired naval admiral and former commander in chief of the US Atlantic Fleet chairs the Panama Canal Authority’s advisory board. The US has also remained the canal’s primary customer: roughly 40 percent of all the country’s container shipping moves through Panama each year. The Zonians, for their part, largely adapted to life in the continental US, resigned to commemorating their history at reunions in Florida or, for the more committed, returning to Panama for annual events. Some have purchased reverted buildings in the former Canal Zone and fixed them up as vacation stays for part of the year. Many maintain their dislike for Carter and incline toward conservative politics. Mike Andrews, for one, considers Reagan the best president of his lifetime, even if he failed to recover the Canal Zone. “This is a very strong Republican populace,” he told me about his fellow reunion attendees in 2024. Most Zonians have by now come to accept the transition as an inevitable part of history. At this year’s Elks Lodge reunion, however, the enclave the Zonians came to commemorate had reemerged as a major news story. The newly appointed secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was about to land in Panama for his first official trip abroad. “Did you pick out your house yet?” some of the pro-Trump attendees half-joked, suggesting that perhaps their past was not quite past after all. * Rubio arrived on February 1. In Panama City there was a nervous mixture of dread and excitement. More progressive sectors of society were predictably incensed. The historically radical University of Panama held an emergency teach-in following Trump’s inauguration, where students and faculty posted enormous signs proclaiming that “Panama Is and Will Remain Sovereign and Neutral”—both refuting Trump’s claims that China was operating the canal and stressing that Panama has no legal obligation to kowtow to Washington. (One of the original 1977 Torrijos-Carter agreements, the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, stipulates as much.) The labor union conglomerate SUNTRACS led protests that shut down large swaths of Panama City; some members trampled signs portraying Rubio in an SS uniform and standing before a Nazi flag. Enea Lebrun/picture alliance/Getty Images A protester confronting police offers during Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama City, February 2, 2025 Not everyone was as quick to condemn the new administration. Many Panamanians were intrigued that the first Latino US secretary of state was visiting their country. On the morning of Rubio’s meeting with President Mulino, onlookers gathered near the presidential Palacio de las Garzas in the neighborhood of Casco Viejo, a small outcropping of lowlands perched on the Bay of Panama. Before the meeting Rubio attended mass in a nearby cathedral that housed an image of the Caridad del Cobre, the Virgin of Charity and Cuba’s patron saint—a nod to his Cuban heritage. The area was swarmed with press and onlookers, some of whom posed to take selfies with Rubio, who spoke to Mulino’s staff and ministers in Spanish. For Rubio, the trip was intended to christen an era of resurgent US dominion in the Americas—one in which the United States would unilaterally dictate other nations’ immigration and trade policy. Panama is of outsized importance to both issues. The southeast end of the country is flanked by the Darién Gap, a treacherous strip of jungle separating South and Central America through which more than 300,000 migrants passed last year on their way north toward the US–Mexico border. Then, of course, there is the country’s relationship with Beijing. China is the Canal’s second-largest customer and has significantly increased direct investment in Panama over the last decade. At a press conference after his meeting with Rubio that February morning, Mulino announced the first of what would in the coming months grow into a cavalcade of concessions to the Trump administration. He assured his constituents that no US military invasion was imminent—an understandable preoccupation for a citizenry that watched Black Hawk helicopters swarm their neighborhoods decades ago—but announced that he would modify Panama’s anti-immigration efforts to accord with the Trump administration’s demands. SENAFRONT, Panama’s corollary to the US Border Patrol, has collaborated with the US government for years on anti-immigration initiatives, receiving direct training from the US Army; there is even an ICE office in the US embassy in Panama City. But Rubio’s visit made plain that Washington expected still more draconian measures. Among other things, Mulino announced that he had offered the US the use of an airstrip to facilitate deportation flights for migrants attempting to pass through the Darién Gap. Before Rubio left the country in the following days, he personally oversaw a deportation flight leaving from the former US airport at Albrook, outside Panama City. Mulino also announced that Panama would withdraw from the Belt and Road initiative, Beijing’s sweeping global infrastructure program encompassing 150 countries around the world, including more than twenty in Latin America. Panama became the first country in the region to sign on to the initiative in 2017, the year it established formal diplomatic relations with Beijing. That rapprochement occurred during the first Trump presidency, during which the state department failed to appoint a US ambassador to the country, leaving, as Mulino put it, “many empty seats” into which China easily slid. And yet China’s presence in Panama is nowhere near as extensive as Trump has claimed. Panama’s relationship to the US remains far more longstanding and robust, and the Mulino administration has made clear which side it’s taking in the emergent new cold war. In a particularly telling move, the week before Trump’s inauguration, Mulino’s government announced that it would audit the Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of the Hong Kong multinational CK Hutchinson Holdings, owned by the billionaire Li Ka-Shing. In 1997, when the canal’s incoming Panamanian administration offered foreign governments and multinationals leases on concessions to some of the ports along the passage, Ka-Shing vastly outbid his American competitor for control of the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal, offering Panama $22 million in annual rent and 10 percent of its port revenue for a duration of twenty-five years. Panama renewed those contracts as recently as 2021, but the announcement suggested that Mulino’s administration might be hoping to find inconsistencies in Panama Ports’ bookkeeping that could give Panama legal cause to sever the agreements—a development that would permit it to cut one of its principal ties with China at its own discretion. As the audit dragged on, the US sought its own workaround: On March 4 the US asset management firm BlackRock announced an agreement with CK Hutchinson Holdings to purchase 90 percent of the Panama Ports Company. Trump lauded the deal as a foreign policy victory. The Chinese government, for its part, was quick to denounce the agreement as a “hegemonic act” that thwarted “the legitimate rights and interests of other countries through coercion, pressure, inducement, and other despicable means.” Beijing has a series of legal mechanisms it may draw on to probe the deal, including the use of a sweeping National Security law passed in 2020 in response to protests that had erupted in Hong Kong the year prior. Panama, meanwhile, struggling to assert some self-determination, announced that its audit had turned up evidence of misconduct that may lead it to deem the 2021 contract illegal and void. In the event that Panama manages to annul its concessions agreements with CK Hutchinson Holdings, the Panama Ports Company could be ousted from the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal regardless of who owns it, potentially allowing for bids from foreign governments and multinationals on Panama’s terms. The strategy, if it works, will allow Panama to maintain a semblance of autonomy even as it placates Washington by extricating China from its ports. Mulino’s attempted balancing act has yielded dubious results. His pivot away from Beijing and his deference to the US on immigration policy have not stopped Washington from pursuing physical encroachments on the isthmus. Shortly after the BlackRock deal was announced in March, Trump ordered the Pentagon to draw up plans for military actions in Panama—a perplexing move, since Panama demilitarized after the US invasion and has no standing army. And in April Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, fresh off accidentally leaking information about military strikes in Yemen to the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic via Signal, returned to the isthmus to exact still more concessions. During his visit the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding permitting the US to deploy troops to some of Washington’s former military installations along the waterway, which Panama transformed into commercial logistics hubs after the transition. The deployments are rotational, with US troops moving through sites that will remain under Panama’s full administrative authority. The memorandum stopped short of allowing the US to establish its own bases in the country or to retake control of the installations it had vacated by 1999. All the same, it dealt a remarkable blow to Panamanian sovereignty. * As Marco Rubio terminated his February trip to Panama, I met again with Aristedes Royo, this time in a cafe in the business district of Obarrio in downtown Panama City. Royo had concluded his term as minister of canal affairs roughly a year earlier, and that day he was holding court for a cortege of reporters from around the world who had come to the isthmus to cover Rubio’s visit. When Royo and I first spoke in 2023, he concluded the interview with an emphatic affirmation of the good will between Panama and the US—a happy ending to a personal and national saga, one he assumed would not be undone. At our recent meeting, however, he sang a different tune. “It may be dangerous to be America’s enemy,” he said with a slow shake of his head, quoting a line attributed to Henry Kissinger, “but to be America’s friend is fatal.” Mark Schiefelbein/POOL/AFP US Secretary of State Marco Rubio walking with Ricaurte Vasquez, the administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, during a tour of the canal’s Miraflores locks, Panama City, February 2, 2025 Royo spent much of our second conversation explaining in painstaking detail how the Panama Canal functioned—the role of the Panamanian citizens who pilot small vessels to guide container ships through the locks system and the structure of the Panama Canal Authority, which employs more than eight thousand Panamanians to administer and run the waterway. The operation was Panamanian through and through, he emphasized: Panama would be able to limit the access of vessels from any nation if they posed a threat to the canal’s security and neutrality. It felt as though he were attempting to speak to the Trump administration through me, that if he could convince me that China was not running the canal, then the US government would understand it, too. In the following months Panama’s security minister, Frank Ábrego, and its canal administrator, Ricaurte Vásquez Morales, offered similar assurances to visiting US officials. And yet none of them have seemed to stop the Trump administration from reiterating its claims about Chinese incursion. Some in the Zonian community have echoed the allegation. “You can go throughout Panama and see big road signs all in that squiggly Chinese writing,” Mike Andrews told me. In Zonian groups on social media, Trump’s language and policies have inspired debate. Some members celebrated the prospect of renewed US control over the waterway, while others seemed resigned to the idea that there would be no return to the Zone they once called home. (“As a czbrat I loved the cz. But get over it,” one posted in a Facebook group after Trump’s inauguration.) If there was a consistency across the community, however, it was the prevailing sense of historical grievance. “It has hurt many a Zonian that Panama has not erected any monument or memorabilia thanking the USA for the Canal,” Andrews said over e-mail. Panamanians, meanwhile, took to the streets in response to April’s memorandum of understanding, claiming that the president had signed away the country’s autonomy. Mulino has since informed his constituents that he will not renegotiate the security deal. “Panama’s sovereignty is not at stake, it’s not handed over, it’s not given,” he said in his weekly national press conference on May 8. And yet now that US troops are positioned to deploy to three of Washington’s former military bases on the isthmus—Fort Sherman, Rodman Naval Station, and Howard Air Force Base—the country’s military will have a presence on Panamanian soil without parallel since the last century. The installations are nestled in las áreas revertidas (“the reverted areas”), a large stretch of which Panama decades ago transformed into a bucolic nature reserve and rechristened Sovereignty National Park.

Title: Spot XRP ETF Path Made Clear After Ripple CEO Confirms Ending SEC Case ‘Once And For All’

The nearly five-year legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be finally coming to an end after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced Friday that the company plans to drop its cross-appeal in the prolonged case. “Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said,” Garlinghouse wrote in a post on X. “We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important— building the Internet of Value. Lock in.” Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said. We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important – building the Internet of Value. Lock in. https://t.co/ZsRgDfcpLh The announcement comes just a day after U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint bid from Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission to slash a $125 million penalty and toss out a permanent injunction imposed against the blockchain payments company last year. That decision followed less than two weeks after the SEC and Ripple asked that the court reduce the civil penalty over illegal XRP sales to $50 million, significantly less than the $2 billion sought under former Chair Gary Gensler. The legal drama between Ripple and the SEC has been going on for years since December 2020, when the regulator accused the XRP-linked firm of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering. In 2023, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP on crypto exchanges did not break securities laws. Torres did, however, rule that other direct sales of the token to institutional investors qualified as securities. Ripple was fined $125 million and banned from similar sales. Both Ripple and the SEC agreed to allow $50 million of the initially-imposed $125 million fine to go to the SEC, with the remaining $75 million to be returned to the San Francisco-based company, though they have encountered pushback in court over the past month. XRP was changing hands around $2.19 on Saturday, reflecting a 5% increase over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The token is up a whopping 358% over the past year. According to Nate Geraci, the President of ETF Store, the conclusion of the case effectively removes the regulatory hurdle blocking the approval of U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Over nine asset managers have so far filed for XRP ETF products in the US, including major issuers like Bitwise, ProShares, 21Shares, and Franklin Templeton. Despite the growing XRP ETF filing frenzy, BlackRock — issuer of the largest spot Bitcoin ETF — has yet to submit paperwork for an XRP-based investment vehicle. Geraci believes that with no regulatory obstacles in sight, BlackRock could soon apply with the SEC to introduce an ETF tied to the industry’s fourth-largest crypto by market cap.

Title: Billions in corporate buys can’t budge Bitcoin—5 reasons the BTC price won’t move

Why is Bitcoin’s price flat even as companies buy billions? Hidden dynamics behind ETF flows, paper bitcoin, and market manipulation, for a start. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. From Michael Saylor to David Bailey, Anthony Pompliano to Jack Mallers, and everyone in between, there’s a rising tide of executives buying bitcoin for their corporate treasuries. Large companies and Wall Street are vacuuming up billions of dollars’ worth of BTC every week, yet its price remains relatively untouched. One Bitcoiner took to Twitter to ask why and received more than 1.3K replies. Here’s the best: “Can anyone explain to me why companies are buying billions of dollars of bitcoin every week and the price is virtually unchanged over the last 6 months?” Bitcoin Cam’s question clearly reflects the broader sentiment of Crypto Twitter, receiving over 800,000 views in a few hours and more than 1,300 replies. Even Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff chimed in with his 2 cents: “The whales who already own a bunch of Bitcoin are selling to these buyers to cash out their huge gains.” But the best reply came from SightBringer, who provides signal-bearing intelligence across macro, crypto, and capital. He said: “They’re buying billions and the price isn’t moving because this isn’t a market anymore – it’s a controlled ignition chamber.” Then he broke it down point by point: Basically, large investors like BlackRock and Fidelity are buying real bitcoin through special funds called ETFs. This isn’t just pretend money; these are actual coins being tucked away for the long term. In 2025, public companies bought a record number of bitcoins, and these ETFs are seeing billions in new money come in. The coins are being taken off exchanges, so fewer are left for everyone else to buy or sell. Here, SightBringer explains that most trading on big crypto exchanges doesn’t actually move real coins. Instead, it’s just “paper bitcoin” (IOUs or promises to deliver bitcoin later). This means there’s a lot of trading, but not much real bitcoin changing hands. If everyone tried to take their coins out at once, things could get messy (think Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in 2023). This makes the market seem bigger than it really is. Echoing Schiff’s reply, in point 3, SightBringer means that large holders, known as whales, aren’t selling their old coins on the open market. Instead, they’re selling quietly to new buyers or moving coins to private wallets. This keeps the price from jumping around. In April alone, Glassnode revealed that whales had absorbed more than 300% of the newly mined bitcoin supply, drastically reducing the coins available to everyone else. Big companies and funds don’t like wild price swings. They need stable prices to make sure everything works smoothly. BlackRock and others are even saying bitcoin is less volatile than before, which is good for them, as the asset becomes more credible to investors. SightBringer maintains that the market is being manipulated, with the BTC price being held back on purpose. When it finally breaks out, it could go exponentially higher, and it might not come back down. That’s why the big players are getting ready now, so they’re in the best position when the real move happens. “The real question isn’t “why isn’t it moving?” It’s: Who’s making sure it doesn’t and why?” At the time of press 1:30 pm UTC on Jun. 28, 2025, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 0.11% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $2.13 trillion with a 24-hour trading volume of $38.52 billion.

Title: Former Fianna Fáil minister Mary Hanafin declares intention to contest the presidency

LAST UPDATE | 28 Jun FORMER FIÁNNA FÁIL minister Mary Hanafin has said that she’s “in the mix” for the party’s presidential nomination. “If I could contest it, I would happily do that. It’s a role I would hope people could feel I would do well, both nationally and internationally,” she told The Irish Independent. Sixty-six-year-old Hanafin previously told The Irish Times in April that she was open to the conversation of contesting the presidency – although she said it was ultimately up to Taoiseach and party leader Micheál Martin. She is the first Fianna Fáil party member to announce her intention to contest the nomination. This afternoon, Cynthia Ní Mhurchú was asked on RTÉ’s Saturday with Colm Ó Mongain if she had ruled out a bid for the Fianna Fáil presidential nomination, who replied that she was “extremely happy” in her current role as an MEP. Ní Mhurchú did not wholly rule out the prospect. Fine Gael’s MEP Seán Kelly has all but declared his intention to run, having told The Journal in Brussels earlier this week that the main deterrent is the length of a presidential term. Hanafin was first elected to the Dáil in 1997, serving the Dún Laoghaire constituency. Throughout her three consecutive terms as a TD, she held a number of Cabinet positions, including Minister for Education, Minister for Enterprise, and Minister for Social and Family Affairs, and Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport. Advertisement Hanafin pictured in 2011. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo In 2011, she was briefly deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, having lost the party’s leadership election to incumbent leader Micheál Martin. Hanafin left office in 2011. In 2014, she served as a councillor on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county council, representing Blackrock. She remained on the council until 2024. In 2014, Hanafin defied the wishes of Martin for her to refrain from submitting nomination papers to contest the local elections in the Blackrock area. Dubbed the ‘Battle of Blackrock’, Hanafin was ultimately elected on the first count. She drew criticism from former Taoiseach Brian Cowen’s wife Mary Cowen in 2016, when Hanafin was apparently rebuffed by Martin after she announced she intended to join Fianna Fáil’s front bench were she elected to the Dáil. Hanafin subsequently made remarks regarding Martin at the party’s ardfheis – which Mary Cowen derided in a Facebook post. Hanafin is the daughter of Des Hanafin, a businessman and Fianna Fáil councillor who also served as a senator. Her brother John Hanafin was a member of the Seanad from 2002 to 2008.

Title: ‘Huge’ BlackRock Crypto Bombshell Suddenly Hurtling Toward Bitcoin At Key Price ‘Turning Point’

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has bounced back in recent weeks, surging as serious U.S. dollar collapse fears drive billionaire interest in bitcoin. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has soared toward its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, with traders betting a looming Federal Reserve flip will turbo-charge the crypto market. Now, as U.S. president Donald Trump issues a surprise crypto prediction, bitcoin and crypto are braced for a “huge” BlackRock crypto market bombshell that has suddenly appeared on the “horizon.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has become one of the most bullish bitcoin price voices on Wall ... More Street in recent years. In-kind redemptions for the bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have taken Wall Street by storm over the last 18 months could be coming soon, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Hester Peirce. “I can’t prejudge, but we hear that there’s a lot of interest,” Peirce, who heads up the SEC’s crypto task force, said on stage at a Bitcoin Policy Institute event, adding that in kind bitcoin and crypto ETFs are now “on the horizon.” In-kind redemptions allow investors to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying asset rather than receiving cash, which is currently the case for the spot bitcoin and crypto ETFs approved by the SEC in early 2024—a change described as “huge” by Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In-kind redemptions for bitcoin and crypto funds would make it cheaper and quicker for traders to buy and sell ETF shares, potentially making them more attractive to institutional investors on Wall Street. Earlier this year, BlackRock, which has dominated the spot bitcoin ETF market with its $75 billion IBIT fund, asked the SEC to permit in-kind creations and redemptions for bitcoin ETFs, instead of having to use cash, with the likes of Fidelity and other smaller bitcoin and crypto ETF providers following suit. "Those (forms) are going through the process now," Peirce said. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed to an all-time high this year, helped by BlackRock's massive $75 ... More billion bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024 that now hold 1.4 million bitcoin worth $152 billion. BlackRock’s fund alone holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth almost $75 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network. Meanwhile, the combined bitcoin price and crypto market is on the verge of a “turning point” as it hits $3.4 trillion, according to one analyst. “The $3.4 trillion to 3.55 trillion range is a turning point, which has activated sellers and prevented the market from consolidating higher,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, said in emailed comments. “Since the end of Wednesday, bitcoin has been testing the $108,000 mark, but it will sell off when it touches this level. Over the past couple of days, we have seen a smooth but steady intraday uptrend, accompanied by heavy buying from medium—and long-term investors. We see this as a sign of buying by professional market participants and link it to strengthening stocks, which increases the likelihood of reaching $110,000 or even $112,000 as early as this week.”

Title: Best Altcoins Wall Street Might Chase After BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Breakout

BlackRock just made headlines by flipping the script: its spot Bitcoin ETF, iBIT, is now generating more fee revenue than its own S&P 500 ETF, IVV. That’s a major milestone – and a wake-up call. When the world’s biggest asset manager starts earning more from Bitcoin than from traditional stocks, you know the tide is turning. And while Bitcoin might be leading the charge, it’s unlikely to stay alone at the top. As institutional interest expands, the best altcoins with real potential could be next in line. In a development few could have predicted a year ago, BlackRock’s iBIT ETF is now generating $186M in annual fees – surpassing the $183M earned by its S&P 500 ETF, IVV. That’s not just a win for Bitcoin – it’s a bold signal that institutional interest in crypto is growing rapidly and with conviction. With billions in capital at stake, traditional finance is no longer ignoring digital assets. This shift suggests a structural change in how institutions view crypto – no longer as a fringe speculation, but as a legitimate, fee-generating investment class. New crypto projects that show promise, utility, and strong community backing may soon attract serious attention from the same institutional investors who once wouldn’t touch crypto at all. Wall Street’s appetite is growing, and the smart money is looking for what’s next after Bitcoin. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the powerhouse utility token behind Best Wallet, a next-gen DeFi platform redefining what a crypto wallet can be. At the core of its ecosystem, $BEST unlocks real benefits: reduced transaction fees, early access to new crypto projects, higher staking rewards, and exclusive perks through iGaming partnerships. It also enables access to Upcoming Tokens – a secure, in-app crypto presale hub that helps users dodge scam sites and buy early, safely. Security is no afterthought either. The wallet is powered by Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP tech, giving users full control without compromising safety. So far, $BEST has raised $13.6 million in its presale phase, with the current price sitting at just $0.025245. It’s still early, but clearly not under the radar, especially with forecasts predicting a potential high of $0.072 in 2025 and up to $0.82 by 2030. Wall Street might want to start paying attention. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is where AI agent, influencer culture, and crypto collide. It’s not just riding the wave of viral content, it’s helping creators own it. Built as the first AI-powered content and monetization platform, $SUBBD empowers creators to generate income directly from their audience while automating the behind-the-scenes work that usually eats up their time (and profits). Creators get an AI assistant to handle chat, editing, scheduling, and monetization. Fans can interact via AI-generated photos, videos, and avatars – all approved by the original influencer. Payments are instant, low-fee, and borderless, with crypto or fiat options. $SUBBD already boasts a combined reach of 250M+ followers through its ecosystem of creators and ambassadors. With $702K raised and $SUBBD currently priced at $0.055775, it’s still early – but not unproven. If Wall Street’s next bet is on the creator economy, $SUBBD may be one of the few projects that actually understands what Gen Z wants, and how to monetize it. $ONDO is the token behind Ondo Finance, a project that’s bringing traditional assets like U.S. Treasuries onto the blockchain in a way that institutions can actually get behind. Ondo Finance is all about making real-world financial tools – like bonds and short-term government debt – accessible on-chain, with full compliance and transparency. Right now, $ONDO is trading around $0.7554. Holding $ONDO gives you a say in how the project evolves, including decisions around new products and the development of Ondo Chain – their own upcoming Layer 1 blockchain. One of Ondo Finance’s standout products is $OUSG – a token that gives accredited investors access to short-term U.S. Treasuries, with 24/7 minting and redeeming via RLUSD (Ripple’s USD-backed stablecoin). As institutions look beyond Bitcoin for yield and stability, $ONDO is well-positioned to be part of that next move. If BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF success proves anything, it’s that institutions are diving into crypto. As Wall Street looks beyond Bitcoin, projects like Best Wallet Token, SUBBD Token, and Ondo Finance offer real utility – from DeFi access to creator monetization to tokenized Treasuries. These three could be next on the institutional radar. Before investing in crypto, make sure to do your own research (DYOR). This article is for informational purposes only and not financial advice.

Title: “This evil man”: The guy accused of trying to kill Trump is about to face Aileen Cannon

Whatever happened to the guy accused of trying to kill President Donald Trump? There was the shooter who killed an audience member and grazed Trump at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania last year; he was killed by Secret Service agents seconds later. Last November, Justice Department officials also said that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had hired an operative to plot to kill Trump; that man is believed to still be at large in Iran (Iran, for its part, has denied such a plot). But there is one alleged, would-be assassin who is both alive and in federal custody. Last fall, 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh was arrested near the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, for what the FBI said was an apparent attempt on Trump’s life. His case — handled by the same Trump-appointed judge who heard his classified documents case — is proceeding quietly in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Related Routh’s alleged assassination plot — taking place just two months after the first attempt on Trump’s life — quickly became emblematic of how dire heightened political divisions leading up to the 2024 election had gotten. That polarization beget greater tensions and even conspiracy theories, which Trump himself capitalized on to the detriment of the public, according to Yotam Ophir, a University at Buffalo professor of communications whose research focuses on misinformation and extremism. “Trump was quick to politicize the attempts on his life and to attack the left for inciting violence,” the author of “Misinformation and Society” told Salon in an email. “America has been going through a very intense polarization and politicization in recent years, making the public more likely to accept unfounded accusations against the other side, while also incentivizing politicians and other elites (e.g., media personalities) to capitalize on that and use partisan language to score political points and harm the opposition.” Routh himself appeared to be a disgruntled centrist, a former registered Democrat — now unaffiliated with either party — turned 2016 Trump voter who would later vote in the 2024 Democratic primary while voicing support for ex-Republican presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy. Routh also has an extensive criminal record, including several felony convictions between 2002 and 2010, predating his arrest last September. On Sept. 15, 2024, a Secret Service agent noticed “what appeared to be a rifle poking out of the tree line” while surveying the perimeter of the Trump International Golf Club course during Trump’s golfing session, the criminal complaint said. The agent would fire their weapon in the rifle’s direction. Around the same time, a witness saw a man flee from the area and take off in a Nissan SUV, according to the complaint. Officers from the Palm Beach County and Martin County Sheriff’s Offices would locate and stop the SUV about an hour later and arrest Routh. The witness identified Routh as the same individual who fled the golf club, while cell phone records showed that Routh’s phone was in the vicinity of the tree line area at the time the agent noticed the rifle. A federal grand jury indicted Routh on five charges on Sept. 24, 2024: attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate; possessing a firearm during a crime of violence; assaulting a federal officer; possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon; and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. If convicted, he faces a sentence of up to life in prison. During his arraignment on Sept. 30, Routh pleaded not guilty. He has been detained at FDC Miami pending trial ever since. A public defender for Routh, Kristy Militello, did not respond to requests for comment. The case appears to be progressing steadily and is still in its pretrial discovery period, where the parties share relevant documents and evidence, court records show. Presiding U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon scheduled two pre-trial conferences for early August and September 2025, setting the trial’s official start date for Sept. 8. Notably, the presiding judge is the same Trump-appointee who oversaw the president’s classified documents case before dismissing it last year. Cannon faced heavy scrutiny during Trump’s federal prosecution over his alleged retention of national security documents from legal experts, who accused her of unnecessarily delaying the case by entertaining the Trump legal team’s tactics. We need your help to stay independent Rourth’s legal team, for their part, filed a motion in October to have Cannon recused from the case, citing Trump’s appointment of her, praise of her rulings in his favor and, later, Cannon’s past friendship with a prosecutor on the case. “This motion presumes that this Court would preside over this case impartially,” the filing said. “However, given the heightened stakes and the public scrutiny, there should not be any doubts about even the appearance of impartiality of the presiding judge.” That effort ultimately failed, with Cannon rejecting the claims and denying the motion. The DOJ also filed a motion in the case in October asking that the court block some of the discovery materials from dissemination to the public to protect civilian witnesses and other sensitive information, citing the public and media interest in the case and Routh’s own desire for “the spotlight.” “A conspiracy theory, as scary as it may be, offers some comfort in the form of order and clear explanations.” Routh, the government said, published a book that included a call for Trump’s assassination, drafted multiple letters to various media outlets to discuss his views, wrote a separate letter announcing a $150,000 bounty for someone to kill Trump and — while in jail in September — informed his daughter during a phone call that he wanted addresses of several news agencies to mail letters to them. “All of this lends credence to the United States’ good faith belief that discovery materials left in Routh’s possession outside the presence of his attorneys would be improperly disseminated to the media and general public for reasons inconsistent with the fair administration of justice and the spirit of the Standing Discovery Order,” the filing reads. That request was granted, in part, and does not appear to have been challenged since the Trump administration assumed control over the Justice Department. In the immediate aftermath of the thwarted attempt, Routh himself became the subject of widespread rightwing conspiracy theories. Far-right influencers attempted to link the plot to Ukraine due to Routh’s vocal support for the Eastern European nation. Some tried to connect him to asset management giant BlackRock as they did with slain-Trump shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, who inadvertently appeared in the background of a BlackRock commercial. Others argued that the assassination plan was an inside job, given that Routh would have had to have known Trump would be golfing that day. The conspiratorial hubbub reflects what Ophir calls a “proportionality bias,” the idea that big events must have grand plans behind them, despite the reality being that “life is often arbitrary and we are more fragile than we want to admit.” “We strive for order and meaning (some of us more than others) and we really struggle to accept how vulnerable we all are, to death, to crime, to a deadly virus,” Ophir said. “A conspiracy theory, as scary as it may be, offers some comfort in the form of order and clear explanations. If we know who to blame, maybe we also know how to solve the problem.” “It’s easier to blame the other political side and to hope that taking care of them will take care of the problem,” he added. We need your help to stay independent The trial was initially set to begin in November 2024 but was first continued to February 2025 at the Justice Department’s request due to the complexity of the ongoing investigation and the high volume of discovery, which the department said includes hundreds of interviews, reports and photographs; body camera footage and the contents of multiple electronic devices as well as multiple forensic examinations and more than one hundred subpoenas issued. In another December 2024 motion, Routh sought a trial date no earlier than December 2025, citing a need for “sufficient time to review discovery and evaluate potential defenses.” The court granted the request in part, calling Routh’s requested trial date “excessive given the facts and circumstances.” Since then, the case has progressed normally, with paperless orders from the most recent status conference and submission dates for court filings indicating it remains on schedule for the September trial date. But Routh now has even more legal problems. In April, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced state-level charges against Routh after concluding its own investigation into the alleged attempted assassination. Those charges are attempted first-degree murder and terrorism, the Republican said in a post to X. “We can not allow justice to be delayed or denied,” Uthmeier said in an accompanying video, which also accused the Biden administration of working to block the state’s investigation into the incident. “And thanks to the president, our U.S. attorney general and the FBI director, we are moving forward in our pursuit. Our state-wide prosecutors will work to hold this evil man accountable and keep Florida safe, strong and free.” Uthmeier’s office did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Start your day with essential news from Salon. Sign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course. Meanwhile, Routh’s defense filed a last-ditch effort to have the final two firearm charges against him dropped under a Second Amendment claim. Cannon, again, handily denied the motion in May. According to the docket, the judge most recently ruled on the Justice Department’s requests to preclude “legally prohibited and factually baseless defenses” and admit potential evidence. Per Cannon’s previously outlined schedule, the next major date in the case is July 28, when the government’s exhibit and witness list, both parties’ jury selection questions and proposed jury instructions are due. The Justice Department declined to weigh in on the status of the case, with a spokesperson stating that it does not comment on ongoing litigation.

Title: Ripple’s ‘Ethereum-style’ roadmap: Smart contracts, lending & legal clarity

Can Ripple’s Ethereum-inspired playbook lure big money? Ripple’s [XRP] Q2 has been rough. While capital flowed into high-beta plays, XRP lagged hard, shedding nearly 30% against Ethereum [ETH] after clocking a stellar 100%+ run in Q1. But that shift wasn’t random. It was driven by strategy. You see, Ethereum devs executed a well-timed comeback with the Pectra upgrade in early May, which helped fuel a 40% rally, snapping ETH out of its post-November slump. Now, Ripple seems to be drawing from that same blueprint. The only question is, will the market reward XRPL’s roadmap the same way it did Ethereum’s? Ripple is making bold moves to upgrade the XRP Ledger. Earlier this year, Ripple bought Hidden Road, a well-known prime broker, for $1.25 billion. Prime brokers help large investors by offering services like trade execution. With this deal, Ripple is giving institutions better tools to trade capital using XRP. But that’s just the start. Ripple is also planning to launch a new lending protocol in Q3 2025. It’s also adding more programmability, bringing smart contract features that could let developers build apps like they do on Ethereum. Put together, this roadmap is clearly targeting institutional readiness. With ETF speculation heating up and Ripple officially withdrawing its cross-appeal in the SEC case, the timing between legal clarity and technical expansion couldn’t be better. Source: X The market’s early response reflects that shift. At press time, XRP broke out above $2.15, rallying 5%, while Open Interest (OI) climbed 3%, indicating speculative liquidity is re-entering derivatives markets. But the catch is, none of this sticks without real institutional buy-in. The XRPL roadmap mirrors Ethereum’s playbook post-upgrade. But to generate similar re-pricing, institutional capital must follow. The XRP/ETH ratio offers a clear lens into capital rotation dynamics. From the 13th of November, the ratio exploded 550% over five months, closely tracking XRP’s 217% rally off its $0.70 base, topping out near $3.40 in mid-January. What’s notable is how the ratio held firm despite XRP shedding 35% from its peak. While Ethereum sank to a multi-year low of $1,440, the ratio stayed resilient deep into Q2, signaling that rotational flows favored XRP through much of the drawdown. Source: TradingView (XRP/ETH) But by late Q2, the tide turned. The ratio collapsed nearly 40%, bottoming at 0.0008, marking a sharp divergence. The catalyst? Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade. Deployed in early May, Pectra helped ETH break through the $2,000 ceiling, igniting a wave of renewed inflows. Stablecoin velocity spiked, BlackRock kicked off accumulation, and annualized fees crossed $7.3 billion. More importantly, with the Glamsterdam upgrade slated for late 2026, ETH regained narrative dominance. Now, Ripple’s pivot toward “Ethereum-style” upgrades looks far more strategic than coincidental. But will the market respond the same way? That’s the inflection point. Without institutional follow-through, the XRP/ETH ratio could chart even lower.

Title: Private equity wants to get into your 401(k). Trump might let them.

Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows The private equity industry wants to get into your 401(k). The industry is lobbying the Trump administration to issue an executive order that would open the way for retirement plans to add private equity investments. The effort brings to mind Groucho Marx’s famous observation, “I don’t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member.” Why would this supposedly elite investment class want the Trump administration to make it easier for small-time savers to invest in their offerings? The answer, as you might suspect, is nothing good. Before I proceed further, some explanations are in order. Private equity consists of companies and other investments controlled by private firms, which are almost always acquired with significant amounts of debt — hence the term “leveraged buyout.” The stated idea is to buy a company, overhaul its underlying finances, and then sell it again within a few years at a profit. The private equity industry boomed following the 2008 financial crisis, when consistently low interest rates facilitated mergers and acquisitions. While the industry blamed then-Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan and the Biden administration’s tougher antitrust enforcement for the end of the M&A boom, the real culprit was the return of high interest rates and private equity shops overvaluing their holdings. Unable to sell many of their holdings at the price they would like, and short of traditional institutional investors in their funds, where can private equity turn? I’m afraid that this is where you enter the picture. The industry has every reason to expect help from this White House. Republicans in Congress have already placed a provision in Trump’s big, beautiful budget bill that would increase the tax break for interest payments on the leveraged buyouts that private equity loves. And toward the end of Trump’s first term, his administration loosened regulations surrounding 401(k) accounts, agreeing with industry lobbyists that the arena met the standard of a “prudent” investment for retirement savers. To be clear, in the view of many, it is not. The Biden administration, for instance, backtracked on much of the previous Trump-era guidance. And employers, who are considered fiduciaries for worker retirement accounts and can find themselves in court battling their former employees if things don’t work out, didn’t exactly race in to offer up private equity offerings in 401(k) accounts. Champions of private equity claim that with promising startups and other companies less likely to go public than in the past, private equity could give mom-and-pop savers access to greater diversity in their portfolios as well as the possibility of higher returns. The reality is different. The industry is famously opaque, and its high fees cannibalize much of the gains. “PE funds may look good on paper since they place a high value on their unsold companies, but this is not money that investors can take to the bank,” says Eileen Appelbaum, the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. “Since mid-2022, the companies in private equity portfolios have been overvalued, and PE funds have been unable to sell them at the price they are demanding.” The result is a poor investment — except for the fat cats collecting management fees on it, that is. A recent analysis found that the S&P 500 returned better results than private equity over a one-, three-, five-, and 10-year period. Multiple other studies have yielded similar results. Compounding this: The private equity model can be horrible for consumers and employees of the companies acquired and owned in this fashion. That’s because the debt to acquire the company isn’t the responsibility of the private equity firms, their partners or principals. It is, instead, a dead weight on the books of the company unfortunate enough to be purchased in this way, often leading to service and staff cutbacks, price increases and selling off companies piecemeal. Private equity-controlled companies are more likely to declare bankruptcy than those with different ownership structures, and those filings are hovering at record rates. Of the 10 largest corporate bankruptcies in the first quarter of 2025, seven companies were owned by private equity. Think Forever 21. Think Joann, the fabrics and crafts chain. Think Prospect Medical Holdings, which owns more than dozen hospitals. In fact, health care companies controlled by private equity charge higher prices, yet their patients have higher rates of accidents, complications and deaths. In other words, private equity all too often acts as an economic scavenger and parasite. The efficiencies of scale the industry claims it can find can literally be deadly. And for what? To make some fabulously wealthy members of the investment class even wealthier? Nonetheless, now with Trump back in the White House, the financial services industry is racing in to make private equity in your retirement accounts a reality. Earlier this week, BlackRock announced it was debuting a target date fund that would include stocks, bonds and private equity and credit investments. This follows similar moves by State Street and retirement plan provider Empower. Again, none of this is appropriate for savings that are supposed to let Americans enjoy a stable retirement. This won’t end well — for you, that is. Private equity is a club, and you don’t want it to accept you as a member. Helaine Olen is a managing editor at the American Economic Liberties Project.

Title: Stocks usually rise by 10% a year. Those days may be over.

Full Content:
Americans are wise to invest in the stock market, we are told, because stocks have yielded historical gains of about 10% a year. But not, perhaps, this year. Many analysts predict that the S&P 500 index will end 2025 essentially flat, or with only meager gains. In one June 25 roundup, Yahoo Finance charts several strategists with year-end projections that put the benchmark S&P index between 5,600 and 6,100. Those figures fall below, or only slightly above, where the S&P started the year, around 5,900. Some forecasts range higher, and forecasters have been growing more bullish about American stocks in 2025. But anyone who predicts double-digit returns this year risks being branded an outlier. If big investment firms expect the stock market to finish 2025 more or less where it started, how should armchair investors react? Is the investment landscape shifting beneath our feet? First, let’s explore the reasoning behind those gloomy forecasts. The stock market opened strong in 2025. The broad S&P index sat near its all-time high, following two years of conspicuous growth. That growth spurt, alone, was enough to seed caution in forecasters. A surging S&P means stock prices are relatively high. Some stocks are overpriced. Bargains are fewer. The index may not have that much room to grow. “I believe that, given the strong returns over the past two years, some lower returns are expected,” said Eric Teal, chief investment officer at Comerica Bank. Comerica’s own projections call for the S&P 500 to end the year at 6,400, a number toward the high end of forecasts. Wall Street prognosticators have been bearish on stocks in 2025 because of one overarching theme: uncertainty. “It’s all the volatile actors in our current economy,” said Catherine Valega, a certified financial planner near Boston. “It’s like you don’t know from one day to the next: Do we have tariffs? Do we not have tariffs?” It’s hard to predict how President Trump’s import taxes will affect prices, and thus, inflation. The trade war, coupled with Trump’s immigration crackdown, could slow economic growth. Recession fears are heightened. The Federal Reserve may or may not ease interest rates in response. “We’re assuming that we sidestep a recession, that interest rate cuts are on the horizon, but not immediate,” Teal said, reflecting a common view on Wall Street. “And so, there is an element of cautious optimism that I think is in the market, but a high degree of uncertainty and macro policy unknowns that will keep markets contained.” There’s another big reason, analysts say, why year-end forecasts for the S&P 500 are trending low: Forecasters tend to err on the conservative side. “The analysts have historically kind of underestimated S&P 500 returns,” said Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy, Americas, at BlackRock. “People don’t want to stick their necks out with a bold prediction and be wrong.” That impulse, she said, also explains why stock forecasts tend to bunch together. No one wants to stand out. “It’s hard being an outlier,” said David Meier, a senior analyst at Motley Fool. Meier cites yet another reason why stock forecasters tend to aim low: “Being negative, let’s call it bearish, tends to get more clicks,” he said. Readers gravitate to distressing news about stocks. Now, let’s move on to the practical question: If the S&P 500 might not gain much ground in 2025, what should ordinary investors do about it? The easy answer, of course, is to do nothing. Stock market projections for next month, or next year, shouldn’t matter much to an investor who is in for the long haul, advisers say. And that advice applies to just about everyone: If you aren’t in for the long haul, experts advise, stocks might not be for you. “If you need funds soon, don’t have it invested,” said Randy Bruns, a certified financial planner in Naperville, Illinois. “If you don’t need the funds for 15 years, stop looking at the volatility.” Market downturns tend to be brief. Recessions are shorter than they seem. Anyone who is saving for retirement, or for other long-term goals, can generally ride them out. “If you have the luxury of being a long-term investor, be one,” Akullian said. There is, however, a longer and more nuanced answer to the question of how to respond to those conservative projections for stocks in 2025. It involves this complicating factor: Stock market forecasts are also surprisingly conservative for 2035. Vanguard, the investment firm, predicts the U.S. stock market as a whole will rise by an underwhelming 3.8% to 5.8% a year over the next 10 years. “Growth” stocks, the likes of Nvidia and Amazon, are projected to rise by only 2.5% to 4.5%: not much faster than inflation. Those forecasts are based on the idea that many U.S. stocks are overpriced, in essence, and trading above their real value. In Vanguard’s analysis, everyday investors who want the gaudy returns they have come to expect from American growth stocks would do well to look elsewhere: Global stocks. Small-cap American stocks, in companies with a lower market value. “Value” stocks, trading below their intrinsic worth. “I would say it’s time to have a more balanced allocation,” said Teal of Comerica. Bruns, the financial planner, suggests average investors should “diversify across all the broad asset classes that should comprise a textbook portfolio.” That doesn’t mean you should sell all of your Alphabet stocks, experts say. But the time might be right to scrutinize your portfolio. Does it include foreign stocks? Small-cap stocks? Bonds? If not, then you might consider rebalancing your portfolio to make it more diverse. “The easiest way to do that, if you are a 401(k) contributor, is to change your future allocations,” Valega said. That way, you don’t have to tinker with your current investments. Not sure how to rebalance? “Reach out to your adviser,” Valega said. “That’s what we’re there for.”

Title: From all-out brawls to eye-gouging and worse: a brief history of Lions Tour violence

Expect some conflict. Sit back and watch the claret flow. Take in some dust-ups and assaults, and hope the Lions get their retaliation in first. Bin the political correctness. The game against Argentina last Saturday at the Aviva Stadium was not like what may be coming down the line at the Lions, with a reasonable chance of some traditional brutality on the field. Why? Because that’s the way Lions’ tours always have been, a journey of character tests, challenges and physical melees, this first tranche of five episodes beginning on Saturday against Western Force in Perth before Queensland Reds, Waratahs, ACT Brumbies and an Australian and New Zealand invitational mix. The run-in games are, as history has shown, a softening-up process, a mincing machine where club players on the fringes of the national side, as well as those in Joe Schmidt’s Wallabies squad, are playing to hold their place or earn their place. The reputations of the touring players are there to be shredded, with folklore telling us nefarious methods come with the playbook. It has always been that way, and not just in the last century. From Duncan McRae raining down punches on Ronan O’Gara in 2001, to the tour-ending spear tackle on Brian O’Driscoll by New Zealand’s Tana Umaga and Keven Mealamu in 2005 and the gouging of Luke Fitzgerald at Loftus Versfeld in 2009, foul play has featured prominently on Lions tours. “This is your f**king Everest, boys,” Jim Telfer told a room of bowed heads in the 1997 Living with the Lions documentary. [ Lions v Western Force: Kick-off time, team news, where to watch and more ] That’s the way they have always set up, primed to play on the edge and it’s the way the opposition have also been hardwired over the last 50 years or more. The most famous bout of thuggery was in South Africa 1974, although the plan for Lions players to punch their nearest rival had a gestation period of six years following the 1968 tour and a match against Eastern Transvaal. There Wales prop John O’Shea was the first Lion ever to be sent off for foul play. Pelted with oranges on his way to the locker room, he was blamed for the punch-up. His defence was that he had retaliated after an opponent attacked scrumhalf Roger Young. Leaving the pitch O’Shea was then hit by a spectator, triggering a tunnel brawl that involved reserves, officials and police as play continued. Then 1968 tumbled forwards to 1971 when the New Zealand touring squad travelled to Canterbury. The Lions won the match, but maybe lost in the battle when Irish prop Ray McLoughlin chipped a bone at the base of his left thumb and Sandy Carmichael was hospitalised with multiple fractures of his cheekbone. Carmichael, the first player to win 50 caps for Scotland, was doing what props do and bored into the opposition at scrums. For that, Alister Hopkinson, the opposing prop, landed a few punches on the Scot with the damaging shot that fractured his cheek bone in five places coming later via a backhanded fist that caught him in a lineout. McLoughlin’s thumb injury occurred when a fight erupted with players from both sides pummelling each other near the touchline. Not the most accurate of blows, McLoughlin landed his shot on the head of Grizz Wyllie, breaking his left thumb. Grizz also punched Fergus Slattery as the Blackrock player unwisely held on to his jersey. The 1974 tour to South Africa was broiling before it even took off and its essence was the personality of captain Willie John McBride and his ’99 one-in, all-in’ spirit. Speaking to The Telegraph four years ago, former England forward Roger Uttley recalled the mood set by McBride when the squad had gathered in London. “Before we had even left the country, we were gathered in the Churchill Hotel just near Marble Arch and outside we could hear the anti-apartheid demonstrations in full flow,” Uttley said. “Willie spoke and you could hear a pin drop. ‘Gentlemen. If you have any doubts about going on this tour, I want you to be big enough to stand up now and leave the room. I have been to South Africa before and there is going to be a lot of intimidation, a lot of cheating. So if you’re not up for a fight, there’s the door’. “No one moved. I can still remember the silence and the hairs on the back of the neck rising.” The third Test in Port Elizabeth was the defining match of the series for its choreographed violence. Known as the Battle of the Boet Erasmus Stadium, Scotland’s Gordon Brown punched his opposite number, Johan de Bruyn, so hard the Orange Free State man’s glass eye flew out and landed in the mud. “So, there we are, 30 players, plus the ref, on our hands and knees scrabbling about in the mire looking for this glass eye,” recalled Brown, who died from cancer in 2001. “Eventually, someone yells ‘Eureka!’ whereupon De Bruyn grabs it and plonks it straight back in the gaping hole in his face.” After Brown’s death, De Bruyn presented his widow with the glass eye in a specially made trophy. When another fight broke out, the Wales full-back JPR Williams sprinted over half the length of the pitch to deliver a right hook to second row ‘Moaner’ van Heerden. “That’s not something I’m proud of,” orthopaedic surgeon Williams said later. It wasn’t always South Africa who transgressed, although the Springboks, of all the nations toured by the Lions, prided themselves on physicality. In 1989 the second Test against the Wallabies became the Battle of Ballymore when the Lions scrumhalf Rob Jones kicked off with Nick Farr-Jones at a scrum put-in. From there it was bedlam, with the commentary left to call it as it happened. “They are all joining in now. There’re punches galore. It’s an all-in brawl,” the exasperated commentator said. “It was [initially] between the half backs, but everyone joined in.” The wasn’t much French referee Rene Hourquet could do about it, and when Dai Young later aimed a boot at Steve Cutler in a ruck another free-for-all kicked off. With the century turning, three tours in a row in 2001, 2005 and 2009 would see three Irish players targeted in different violent ways. In 2001 Ronan O’Gara’s came up against New South Wales Waratahs midway through the second half. The images are of a kneeling McRae raining down the punches. Replays show that between the glancing blows and the fully landed punches as he held O’Gara with his left arm, the Munster outhalf took 11 shots resulting in eight stitches around his left eye. O’Gara’s running commentary to the doctor as he was getting stitched in the changing room said it all. “F**king cheap shots,” he said breathing heavily as the doctors carefully pulled his face together. “Caught me with the first one. Couldn’t f**king defend myself. F**king trying to look after the ball.” The spear tackle on O’Driscoll four years later might come across as the most calculated act. It took just over 40 seconds in the 2005 first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch to end his participation in the match and the tour and to sideline him for seven months. Calculated how? Well, the ball was with New Zealand lock Ali Williams 30 feet away when Umaga and Mealamu almost cartoonishly turned the Lions’ centre upside down and rammed him into the ground dislocating his shoulder. “It happened in slow motion and I knew I had to get my head out of the way,” O’Driscoll said on Irish television after the tour. “My shoulder took the brunt of the fall.” In Umaga’s book Up Close, published in 2007, in a classless comment he called O’Driscoll a “sook” or crybaby. In the 2009 tour to South Africa, the Lions lost their first Test match, making the second vital to save the series. On the day the Loftus Versfeld Stadium bristled with hostility. “The South African fans appeared to be waving as our bus approached, but as we got closer we realised they were all doing the ’w****r’ sign,” Welsh prop Adam Jones write in Bomb, his 2015 autobiography. Again, the match was brutal, physical and unforgiving and as Fitzgerald found out it quickly became insidious. Less than a minute in Springbok flanker Schalk Burger gouged the Irish winger. “Luke said he had to pull Burger’s hand off his eyes. That’s not sport, that’s not the way we play. It is not the gentlemanly thing to do – it’s disgusting,” Wales and Lions’ scrumhalf Mike Phillips said afterwards. And Burger’s punishment? A slap on the wrist. He sat it out for 10 minutes. With the Lions, that’s the way they roll. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Peruse a lifetime’s worth of art and antiques in the Dún Laoghaire home of their collector

House content auctions are rarer now than in the past, when viewing the interior of a discreet deceased neighbour’s lavish home was a weekend hobby for many people. Nowadays, most houses are emptied of their furniture, precious paintings and various collectibles, and these items are put up for sale in auction rooms with a mélange of pieces from other homes. Not so in the case of 6 Royal Terrace West, Dún Laoghaire. The contents of the property will be on view in the house, July 12th-14th, 10am-5pm each day, in advance of the auction in Sheppard’s auction rooms in Durrow, Co Laois on July 15th and 16th. Royal Terrace, one of the architectural gems of south Dublin, was built as two facing terraces on opposite sides of a four-acre park in 1860. The two-storey over basement homes were part of the expansion of Dún Laoghaire following the opening of the Dublin-Kingstown railway line in 1834 and the completion of the harbour in the 1840s. Until recently, number 6 was owned by Philip and Constance Murphy. Originally from west Cork, Philip was the youngest of six children of TJ Murphy, Labour Party TD and minister for local government in 1948-1949. Philip Murphy, who died in September 2024, was a solicitor and an avid collector of antiques. The house, which was put on the market by Savills with a guide price of €1,400,000 earlier this year, is currently sale agreed. Both Philip and Constance, who predeceased him, were active member of the Royal Terrace West Residents’ Association. “The terrace wouldn’t be intact today if it wasn’t for the work of Philip Murphy,” says a neighbour, Breasal O’Caollai. As well as campaigning against any development that would destroy the integrity of these Victorian homes, Murphy also led the campaign to bring the park back into public ownership. “He was the custodian of the square since they moved there in the 1960s. He was concerned about maintaining the architectural heritage of the area and he persuaded the county council to buy back the land in the 1980s from Monkstown Hockey Club,” says his niece, Hilary Walsh. The Royal Terrace park, which has been planted with trees and laid out with paths and green spaces, is now popular among locals and visitors alike. The Murphy’s Victorian terraced house has many original features, which are complemented with antique furniture, clocks, art and carefully chosen ornamental pieces. “I can remember visiting the house, seeing all the clocks wound up, smelling the furniture polish and everything just so pristine,” says Walsh. And so, this house content auction offers members of the public a rare opportunity to see a lifetime’s collection of antique furniture, oriental art and ornaments (including Chinese snuff bottles), several antique clocks and mirrors, silver and wooden boxes, in an almost museum like setting. “Each item offers insight into a life lived with genuine engagement and appreciation for the decorative and historic arts,” says Michael Sheppard, who has been cataloguing the items over the past few weeks. One of the more unusual items for sale is a rare 19th-century French automaton bird clock under a glass dome (€5,000-€8,000). It features a rotating tree with multiple taxidermy hummingbirds and other exotic birds perched among naturalistic silk flowers. The mechanism causes the birds to rotate in synchrony with the passage of time. Also of note is a mid-20th century hand-knotted Donegal wool carpet (€5,000-€8,000). This piece was inspired by the designs of Charles Francis Annesley Voysey, the English architect and designer renowned for his Arts and Crafts style wallpapers, fabrics and furniture – some of which can be seen in London’s Victoria and Albert Museum. Antique furniture enthusiasts may also be drawn to a Victorian Wellington mahogany chest (€400-€600). Named after the 1st Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley – who led the British armies to victory at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 against Napoleon – the chest is tall and narrow with a single key locking all seven small drawers. This offers a perfectly secure, compact and portable storage for someone frequently on the move. Meanwhile, Whyte’s Summer Online auction, which ends on Monday from 6pm, offers collectors a snapshot of 20th-century Irish artists, as well as affordable prints of works by Paul Henry and Jack Butler Yeats, among others. Take, for example, the painting of Frescati House in Blackrock, Co Dublin, by artist and architectural historian, Peter Pearson. Painted in 1982, a year before the Georgian house was demolished, the painting is a reminder of its loss. Originally built in 1739 for the family of John Hely Hutchinson, then provost of Trinity College Dublin, Frescati House was later owned by the Fitzgeralds, who also owned Leinster House in Dublin and Carton House in Co Kildare. The Fitzgeralds named the house Frescati, a deliberate derivative of the Italian city of Frascati – a name which was revived for the Blackrock shopping centre, built on the land of the demolished mansion. Among the lots at Whyte’s auction are some interesting watercolours. These include a watercolour and pencil drawing of St Peter’s Church in Drogheda, Co Louth by Thomas Ryan (€300-€500); a watercolour of the Museum Building in Trinity College Dublin by Eve Lyn Hope (€500-€700); and September Morning, Castle Archdale, Co Fermanagh by Colin Middleton (€1,200-€1,500). The Self-Portrait by Paul Hewson (Bono), entitled, Baked Beans Boy (€300-€500), is also sure to draw some interest. sheppards.ie; whytes.ie Estimate £100,000-£150,000 Hammer price Unsold Auction house Bonham’s Estimate €80-€100 Hammer price €200 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €2,000-€3,000 Hammer price €2,400 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €500-€700 Hammer price €500 Auction house Morgan O’Driscoll © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ETF giants hold 6% of Bitcoin – But BTC at $73K could break their patience
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=505736
Time Published: 2025-06-27T22:00:21Z
Full Content:
Over 1.2M BTC locked in ETFs, will 50% profits tempt institutions to break ranks? Bitcoin [BTC] ETF inflows have surged again, with institutional investors tightening their grip on supply. Over 1.23 million BTC, that is, roughly 6.2% of the circulating supply, is now locked in Bitcoin Spot ETFs. That’s 6 out of every 100 coins, signaling growing confidence in BTC as a long-term allocation. Yet, the MVRV score of 1.43 indicated that ETFs were still in an average profit zone. In fact, that is far below the 3.7 highs seen during previous bull cycles. Historically, gains in this range have been enough for traditional players to start trimming positions. Will this time be different? As of press time, BlackRock’s IBIT had the most daily inflows with $692K added. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $200K gained. However, Grayscales’ GBTC saw a few outflows of about $185K. This indicated further institutional building up, spearheaded by BlackRock, which had 692,876 BTC in total. Source: CoinGlass The spread of holdings across ETF providers highlights not just participation but a broadening trust from traditional finance. With total ETF addresses inching close to 1.5 million BTC, the uptrend since November 2024 has been clear, despite a few pause periods. Recent analysis of BTC ETFs revealed an average cost of about $73600—excluding GBTC—acting as a significant support level during market corrections. This level represents a median breaking point for conservative investors, who often prefer to take profits quickly compared to long-term crypto holders. Traditionally, these investors view 40-50% profits as adequate. Source: Burak Kesmeci/X But depending on what happens to the bullish momentum as well as the tightening of supply, they may wait longer and target higher multiples. The relatively moderate MVRV Ratio means profit-taking pressure isn’t overwhelming—yet. All in all, the indicators were positive as far as BTC ETF activities were concerned, although it must be taken with caution as the profit margins were weak at the time of press.

Title: Crypto clarified: 8 expert insights on scale, stability and strategy

UPDATED 15:00 EDT / JUNE 27 2025 by Victoria Gayton Crypto’s latest evolution is less about chaos and more about construction. Stablecoins are gaining traction as real-world assets move on-chain, regulatory infrastructure is taking shape and developers are laying new groundwork for how digital value flows across systems and borders. At theCUBE + NYSE Wired Crypto Trailblazer NYC event, that reinvention took center stage. Executives from across the crypto and blockchain ecosystem discussed everything from tokenization and compliance to talent pipelines, decentralized finance and the next wave of fintech integration. Whether building new bridges to Wall Street or doubling down on distributed networks, these leaders are shaping the next phase of blockchain-backed business. Abra’s Bill Barhydt joins theCUBE’s John Furrier to discuss classic Bitcoin and emerging new currencies. “The classic Bitcoin crypto is what people are holding, and there’s new currency coming out,” said theCUBE Research’s John Furrier during the event. “You’ve got two things: Mainstreaming the store of value and making that liquid and trading it … and then the wave coming … a paradigm shift … but it’s happening fast. We’re hearing from big institutions looking at how to figure out how do you digitize and create a digital twin … separate from all the stuff we love, agents, [artificial intelligence] stuff’s happening, too, so the massive wave is coming on all fronts.” Furrier and theCUBE Research’s Dave Vellante spoke with a lineup of C-suite crypto executives and entrepreneurial visionaries during theCUBE + NYSE Wired Crypto Trailblazer NYC event, in an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s livestreaming studio. Conversations spanned blockchain infrastructure, decentralized finance, market volatility and emerging opportunities across fintech and enterprise. Here’s a breakdown of eight standout interviews from the event: Abra Capital Management LP offers a platform that allows users to earn a yield on Bitcoin, stake Solana and Ethereum, and borrow against their crypto holdings, according to Bill Barhydt (pictured), founder and chief executive officer of Abra. The service is designed to make decentralized finance accessible without technical complexity, and clients retain title to their assets through separately managed accounts rather than relying on exchange-based custody. Bitcoin functions as a fixed-supply, appreciating asset that outpaces traditional stores of value, Barhydt noted. Tokenized real-world assets such as real estate and equities can be traded and used as collateral in global lending markets worth trillions. Barhydt also sees crypto infrastructure playing a future role in automated agent economies, where stablecoins and decentralized autonomous organizations enable new forms of digital ownership and financial activity. Watch theCUBE’s complete interview. CoinFund Management LLC, an early mover in crypto-native investments, backs visionary founders through pre-seed, seed and Series A/B stages while also running a liquid strategy focused on tokens and equities. Fundamental research underpins its approach, examining bespoke technologies shaping digital value exchange. Embedding private property digitally through decentralized, trustless systems is redefining the architecture of the internet, according to Christopher Perkins, chief executive officer of CoinFund. Decentralization can mitigate centralized AI’s vulnerabilities, strengthening data sovereignty, distributing computational tasks and enhancing transparency in AI model training. As Stablecoins inject potentially $2 to $3 trillion on-chain, decentralized finance will surge, enabling AI-powered transaction agents. Clear, proactive policy measures to bolster digital asset security could empower private sector innovation, lure talent back to the U.S. and ensure a safer entrepreneurial landscape, Perkins noted. Get the full story on theCUBE. Dynamic Labs Inc., backed by investors Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund, streamlines crypto wallet infrastructure, making it simpler for developers and businesses to build fintech apps and neobanks. By abstracting complexities such as money movement, security and key management through multi-party computation, Dynamic enables developers to prioritize brand building over backend intricacies. Its platform facilitates rapid, global money transfers and supports innovative business models, including micro-communities integrated with crypto payments, according to Itai Turbahn, chief executive officer of Dynamic Labs. Dynamic Lab’s Itai Turbahn talks with theCUBE about the company’s newly launched stablecoin accounts. Dynamic’s newly launched stablecoin accounts further streamline transactions, enabling smooth fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat conversions through a single software development kit. This capability simplifies the launch of global payment apps and neobanks, drastically lowering the entry barriers for financial innovators. Additionally, Dynamic’s “server wallets” are tailored for the emerging agent economy, empowering AI-driven agents to transact and manage funds autonomously, according to Turbahn. Don’t miss the full story on theCUBE. ICE Ventures LLC entered crypto early by developing institutional-grade, on-premises custodial infrastructure and introducing physically delivered Bitcoin futures contracts, a move ahead of its time. Responding to market evolution and regulatory developments such as the GENIUS Act, ICE is now unlocking the potential of stablecoins by exploring currency pairs backed by highly regulated tokens such as USDC, according to Trabue Bland, senior vice president of futures exchange at ICE Ventures. ICE’s global network of exchanges positions it uniquely to enhance crypto price discovery and bring efficiency to electronic trading — especially as stablecoins grow in usage — addressing market inefficiencies such as fragmented pricing and high fees. Additionally, as AI’s energy demands surge, ICE leverages its deep expertise to navigate and capitalize on emerging opportunities at the intersection of artificial intelligence and energy markets, Bland noted. Catch theCUBE’s complete interview. Anchorage Digital, a subsidiary of Anchor Labs Inc., the sole federally chartered crypto bank in the U.S., provides institutional-grade services, including custody, staking, settlement and trading, attracting major institutions such as BlackRock Inc. for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The crypto industry’s maturation is underscored by Circle Internet Financial LLC’s IPO and bipartisan legislative efforts, such as the GENIUS Act, which brings crucial regulatory clarity to stablecoins. These assets often carry less risk and more stability than traditional bank deposits, according to Diogo Monica, co-founder and executive chairman of Anchorage Digital. Anchorage Digital’s Diogo Monica talks with theCUBE about bringing regulatory clarity to stablecoins. Stablecoins essentially tokenize dollars backed primarily by U.S. Treasuries, requiring decentralized blockchain infrastructure to function securely and independently of traditional financial constraints. The upcoming wave of asset tokenization — covering fixed income and equities ahead of real estate — promises enhanced global liquidity, fractional ownership and frictionless portfolio trading. As crypto quietly integrates into mainstream applications, many users engage with blockchain-enabled financial solutions without even realizing it, signaling a subtle yet profound shift in everyday finance, according to Mónica. Watch the full interview on theCUBE. 10T Holdings LLC, a growth equity fund that targets solely crypto, blockchain and Web3 assets, invests in developed-stage companies, typically generating at least $40 to $50 million in revenue. Dan Tapiero, founder, chief executive officer and chief information officer of 10T Holdings LLC, predicted in 2019 that the crypto market would reach $10 trillion in total value within a decade; it’s already halfway there at approximately $5 trillion today, prompting plans for a new fund targeting an even larger $50 trillion market. Significant growth in public crypto and blockchain enterprises is imminent, with at least 10 portfolio companies expected to go public within the next two years, according to Tapiero. Recent shifts in U.S. regulatory and political attitudes now position the United States to become the global hub for crypto and blockchain innovation, with government efforts aimed at solidifying this leadership. Public listings on major exchanges, such as the NYSE and NASDAQ, are essential for legitimizing cryptocurrency enterprises — especially those tied to stablecoins — both domestically and internationally. Additionally, global demand for stablecoins continues to rise sharply, especially in countries with unstable currencies, highlighting their critical role in wealth preservation and everyday transactions worldwide, according to Tapiero. Listen to the full story on theCUBE. Ledger SAS develops hardware solutions that safeguard sensitive online information, initially targeting cryptocurrency private keys, but now expanding into decentralized identity, healthcare data and broader digital assets. As tokenization becomes widespread and public blockchain applications proliferate, robust hardware security solutions will become indispensable for safely managing diverse digital assets, moving beyond simple investment speculation, according to Pascal Gauthier, chief executive officer of Ledger. Ledger’s Pascal Gauthier talks with theCUBE about enhancing digital security standards. Ledger maintains two core business segments — consumer and enterprise — both dedicated to enhancing digital security standards. Its enterprise division leverages proprietary intellectual property to secure private keys and governance layers, establishing rigorous access controls and preventing asset mismanagement. Additionally, Ledger fosters a dynamic developer ecosystem, supporting third-party apps on its security platform, and provides user-friendly products such as “Stacks,” which combine ease of use, robust security and multiple backup capabilities, according to Gauthier. Check out theCUBE’s full story. Talos Global Inc. was established to provide institutional-grade trading systems for digital assets, anticipating the growth of crypto into a comprehensive asset class that encompasses all capital markets. Initially connecting fragmented liquidity providers — including exchanges, over-the-counter desks, market makers, and decentralized platforms — Talos has evolved to offer advanced solutions such as portfolio management and settlement tools. As traditional institutions increasingly adopt digital asset infrastructures, the industry enters what is seen as the final transformative phase, according to Anton Katz, chief executive officer of Talos. Talos’ unified platform caters to traditional asset managers, overseeing trillions in assets and providing a secure and familiar gateway for incorporating digital assets into diverse investment portfolios. Driven by client demand for faster, globalized and more accessible financial solutions, the migration of traditional asset classes onto digital rails appears inevitable, despite operational considerations such as balancing rapid settlements and necessary oversight. Embracing a build, buy or partner approach, Talos aims to become a comprehensive “one-stop shop” for institutional investors, covering the entire investment lifecycle from pre-trade preparation to post-trade compliance, according to Katz.

Title: Founder of Neuralink rival Precision Neuroscience reveals what people often get wrong about brain-implant surgery
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/neuralink-rival-brain-implant-surgery-doesnt-need-to-be-invasive-2025-6

The most important matter, gray matter that is, sits right at the surface. At least that's the line from Dr. Ben Rapoport, the cofounder and chief science officer of Precision Neuroscience, a brain-computer interface, or BCI, company. "Many people have the impression that the data that we care about is sort of everywhere inside this dimensional structure," Rapoport, a neurosurgeon and engineer, told Business Insider. That's a big misconception, he said. People often incorrectly assume that "you need electrodes that penetrate deep inside the brain to get that information out," he added. But brain implants don't need to be as invasive as they might sound, he said. Precision is developing a thin film that sits on the brain and records brain activity in patients with paralysis. "We implant modules of 1,024 electrodes on the brain surface in the area that controls movement, especially the hand," Rapoport said. That allows them to have cursor control, typing ability, access the internet, use PowerPoint, play games, and word process, he added. These are actions that require vision, movement, sensation, and executive function — core parts of consciousness that are concentrated in the brain's outermost layer, the cortex, Rapoport said. Deeper inside are "connections, you know, between those activities and also sort of subconscious processes, because the brain coordinates a lot of activities in the body that don't take place consciously," he added. The New York-based startup, which received FDA clearance for part of its wireless brain-computer interface in April, has raised $155 million in funding since it launched in 2021. It is one of a few companies advancing this technology as part of the Implantable BCI Collaborative Community, an initiative launched in partnership with the FDA in 2024. BCIs are largely classified into two categories: invasive and non-invasive. Non-invasive BCIs, which don't require surgery, often rely on external sensors to detect the electrical signals in the brain. BCIs that are implanted record neural activity directly from the brain and are being developed to restore speech, movement, and other complex functions in people with neurological conditions. The buzziest BCI these days is Elon Musk's Neuralink, which has ambitions to create a "symbiosis" between the human brain and AI. But there are a host of other companies working on BCIs as a way to treat neurological diseases, like Precision Neuroscience. The company has tested its temporary device in over forty patients in early clinical studies. Over the next year, it will prepare for the first human studies of its permanently implanted devices. "There are certain internal validation checks and internal milestones that we need to meet for ourselves and for the FDA before we want to start implanting the permanently implanted wireless device in humans," Rapoport said. The company's ultimate goal is to help paralyzed people get "back to a level of functional capacity where they can be significantly independent, economically self-sufficient, and hold a job in the workplace," Rapoport said. Correction: June 27, 2025 — An earlier version of this story said that Dr. Ben Rapoport was the founder and CEO of Precision Neuroscience; Dr. Rapoport is the cofounder and chief science officer. An earlier version also mischaracterized the film that goes on the brain. It is not studded with electrodes; the electrodes are embedded. The story also clarifies that the implants are not a potential cure but a potential treatment for neurological disorders. Jump to

Law firms look to head consolidated class action suits, a role that would enable them to boost their earnings from the case, they said. They often file separately in such cases until a judge names a lead plaintiff and combines the separate actions. “Law firms jockey for position as lead counsel in securities class actions because the fees can be very lucrative,” said University of Michigan Law School professor Adam Pritchard—“tens of millions of dollars and occasionally more in the biggest cases.” Each suit accuses Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, of misleading investors about the anticipated profitability and risks in its Bitcoin buying by making “materially false and misleading” public statements. They allege the fraud occurred over an 11-month period between April 30, 2024 and April 4, 2025. The first class action was filed by Pomerantz LLP on May 16. But rather than join in the first class action, identical lawsuits have been filed by Gross Law Firm, Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, and Levi & Korsinsky. None of the five law firms responded to repeated requests for comment from Decrypt. “The position of lead plaintiff is valuable,” Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, told Decrypt. “The lead plaintiff controls the litigation and selects counsel, who will eventually be counsel for the class. So when a case looks strong, multiple firms and plaintiffs will file complaints to throw their hat in the ring.” Lipton and Pritchard said that law firms file identical suits in cases like this to advertise themselves as the right firm to see the case through. Each of the five firms has sent multiple press releases trying to attract more plaintiffs. Many of them prominently remind potential participants of the July 15 deadline for when a judge will choose a lead plaintiff. Once that happens, the rest of the plaintiffs will be consolidated under that plaintiff’s class action. But law firms don’t just want a lot of plaintiffs; they want to secure the biggest investors possible, Pritchard explained. That’s because the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 says that courts should award the lead plaintiff spot to someone who’s volunteered to assume that role and has the largest losses. “The theory is that a plaintiff with more skin in the game will oversee the case and the lawyers,” Lipton said. “Institutions are favored, as well, because again they are more likely to provide necessary oversight.” It’s not clear yet if any of MSTR’s largest holders have signed on to become plaintiffs in the competing class actions. As of an October SEC filing, Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is still the single largest shareholder with 19,998,580 shares, worth almost $7.8 billion at the current MSTR price of $389.50. But there are large institutions in the mix, including Vanguard Group with an 8.55% stake, BlackRock and Capital International Investors with 5.8% stake each, Susquehanna Securities with a 4.8% stake, and Jane Street Group with a 4.7% stake in the company. The value of Strategy’s 592,345 BTC recently climbed above $63 billion, according to bitcointreasuries.net. The lawsuit frenzy kicked off after Strategy warned investors in April that it was unlikely to report a Q1 profit because of the nearly $6 billion in unrealized losses on its BTC holdings. In an SEC filing, the company said it “may not be able to regain profitability in future periods, particularly if we incur significant unrealized losses related to our digital assets.” The company went on to report a $16.49 per common share decline in Q1. In early April, the company’s 528,185 Bitcoin was worth approximately $41.3 billion. Strategy spent a whopping $7.7 billion buying BTC in Q1 at an average price of $95,000 per coin. But by the time the company needed to file its Q1 earnings report, the price of BTC had sunk to about $82,000 per coin. It has since rebounded to about $107,000, as of this writing. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt. But it has been acknowledging the lawsuits in 8-K filings with the SEC. In each one it repeats: “We intend to vigorously defend against these claims. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome, or provide a reasonable estimate or range of estimates of the possible outcome or loss, if any, in this matter.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Neil Doak names Ireland Under-20 side for World Championship opener against Georgia

Full Content:
Ireland v Georgia, Stadio San Michele, Sunday, 5pm Irish time (Live on Rugby Pass TV) It’s been a difficult season to date for the Ireland Under-20s, losing four of five matches in the Six Nations and finishing bottom of the table. To compound matters they suffered a heavy defeat to Scotland, the only team they beat in that tournament, in a warm-up game ahead of the World Championship. There were some mitigating circumstances for Neil Doak’s side, injuries depriving them of key players, but it doesn’t begin to explain the recurring performance glitches that undermined their ambition. Aspects of their patterns were good, they didn’t lack courage or character, but they got lost very easily in the weeds of their mistakes. The playing personnel didn’t deviate much despite the results with the majority of changes coming in a turnstile selection within the matchday 23 from one game to the next, where starters were benched and then reinstated and vice versa. There is a presumption that secondrow Alan Spicer and tighthead prop Niall Smyth are still sidelined through injury. In more uplifting news, prop Alex Usanov, Luke Murphy and Derry Moloney are all fully rehabilitated in time for Sunday’s opening game in Calvisano. Tullamore native Páidí Farrell, who plays with Old Wesley, will make his first start in a tournament game. He possesses a rare attribute in Irish rugby circles, top-end pace and given reasonable ball is a try-scoring threat as he demonstrated capably and consistently in the All-Ireland League. There is a nice balance and plenty of footballing ability in the back three of Farrell, Charlie Molony and Derry Moloney, while the relocation of Ciarán Mangan (younger brother of Leinster’s Diarmuid) from wing to outside centre bodes well from an attacking perspective. He plays alongside the hard running Eoghan Smyth in midfield. Tom Wood, son of former Ireland international Keith, has won the number 10 shirt, with Clark Logan at scrumhalf. In the Six Nations, Wood showed a nice skill set and self-possession to play his way through tougher moments. He has a better kicking game than his dad. Billy Bohan, a player to emerge with credit during the Six Nations, teams up with Henry Walker and Alex Mullan in a ball-playing frontrow. Mahon Ronan and Billy Corrigan put in huge shifts in every match, while Murphy’s addition to a backrow which also contains captain Éanna McCarthy and Michael Foy, introduces steel and quality. Foy was arguably Ireland’s best player in the Six Nations, a turbocharged presence on both sides of the ball. Ireland’s bench has a number of players who can change the tempo of a match, none more so than replacement scrumhalf Will Wootton. Georgia will test Ireland’s mettle at the set piece, breakdown and on the gain-line. As they demonstrated last year when the sides met in this tournament, the Georgians are very sticky opponents, with Ireland squeezing home in a one-score game. They’d bite your hand off for a similar result here. Doak’s side will later play hosts Italy and New Zealand in their other pool games. IRELAND: Charlie Molony (UCD); Páidí Farrell (Old Wesley); Ciarán Mangan (Blackrock College), Eoghan Smyth (Cork Constitution), Derry Moloney (Blackrock College); Tom Wood (Garryowen), Clark Logan (QUB); Billy Bohan (Galway Corinthians), Henry Walker (QUB), Alex Mullan (Blackrock College); Mahon Ronan (Old Wesley), Billy Corrigan (Old Wesley); Michael Foy (UCC), Éanna McCarthy (Galwegians, capt), Luke Murphy (Young Munster). Replacements: Mikey Yarr (UCD), Alex Usanov (Clontarf), Tom McAllister (Ballynahinch), Conor Kennelly (Highfield), Bobby Power (Galwegians), Will Wootton (Sale Sharks) Sam Wisniewski (Old Belvedere), Daniel Green (QUB).

India's IPO market is gaining momentum after a slow start, as the stock market stabilizes following earlier volatility driven by global trade concerns. The blue-chip Nifty 50 index, which hit a one-year low in April, now sits just 2.4 per cent below record highs from last year, as easing geopolitical tensions and trade fears spurred risk-on sentiment. HDB Financial, a unit of India's biggest private lender HDFC Bank, saw its issue subscribed 16.7 times over, driven by qualified institutional buyers such as foreign investors and mutual funds who bid for 55 times their reserved portion. Non-institutional investors bid for 10 times their portion, while retail investor interest was comparatively muted, with their shares being oversubscribed just 1.4 times, exchange data showed. The strong investor response makes HDB Financial's IPO the most subscribed offering over $1 billion since Zomato's in 2021, data from Prime Database showed. "The response to the issue has been very encouraging, and considering the issue size signals that investors are growing increasingly confident of the local market as global trade worries ebb out," said Narendra Solanki, head of research at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. "The bid numbers show that the primary markets are coming back to life after a lull earlier this year, and such a response for a sizeable issue like HDB's should give IPO hopefuls in the pipeline confidence to also come forth to test waters," Solanki added. HDB Financial' s IPO, the biggest ever by an Indian non-bank lender, was one of six offerings this week, five of which were oversubscribed in a range of 2-86 times. Earlier this week, Credila Financial Services and Pine Labs filed for IPOs. HDFC Bank, which holds a 94 per cent stake in HDB, sold shares worth up to ₹10,000 crore , while HDB issued new shares worth ₹2,500 crore. The company is targeting a valuation of up to $7.1 billion at the upper end of the 700-740 rupees price band. The stock is expected to start trading on July 2. HDB had already raised $392 million from anchor investors, including BlackRock funds, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and Norway's sovereign wealth fund.

Title: These Staten Island teens are running their own business while still in high school

Susan Wagner High School's virtual enterprise program allows students to take a deep dive into entrepreneurship, studying finance, marketing and other business applications before launching their own company. Here, Joseph Weisberg, center, who teaches the course, poses with his students for a selfie while on a class trip. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — For the past several years, a group of students at Susan Wagner High School has been operating a small business. The culmination of long hours, field trips and lots of classroom learning, the smallish virtual bakery enterprise was formed after its owners took several courses in finance, learned about break-even analysis and marketed their well-thought plan to local business owners. It’s a study in entrepreneurship that has undoubtedly changed their lives. “I came into high school very shy, not talkative, bad at public speaking,” said Liam Smith, a now-eloquent senior who’s headed to Hunter College to study biology in the fall. “But this class went beyond financial literacy. Not only did we become familiar with Quick Books, Excel and all the other Microsoft extensions, we filled our resumes with important life skills as well.” The four-year program, which is part of the school’s Business Academy, introduces students to the foundations of business in freshman year, followed by leadership and public presentation lessons in year two. During junior year, participants write a business plan and begin marketing a product. Senior year is when they launch and run a virtual company. Students in the Virtual Enterprise program pose for a picture outside of BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investment management and financial services firms. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) “This is the real deal — we have been a New York State Career and Technical Education [CTE] entrepreneurial preparatory program since 2021. We prepare students to become entrepreneurs and teach them to understand financial literacy,” said Joseph Weisberg, Susan Wagner’s CTE business teacher and virtual enterprise coordinator. “In this classroom they’re learning how to plan a career and make an impact in the local business community.” Weisberg, who worked as an accountant and had prior teaching experience before coming to Wagner in 2023, says students who complete the program are well prepared to enter the workforce with a solid understanding of career and financial management. “First they learn finance, marketing and management skills and in their final year they take part in a virtual enterprise where they sell a virtual product through an online marketplace,” he noted. “It’s simulation based, but the experience is very real.” For the past two years the students operated an inclusive bakery, one which catered to those with dietary restrictions. The students researched ingredients and even partnered with local bakers who advised them on how to prevent cross contamination and other food allergy issues. Susan Wagner High School's virtual enterprise program allows students to take a deep dive into entrepreneurship, studying finance, marketing and other business applications before launching their own company. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) “Each student walks away with a resume and cover letter, and plenty of real-life experience ready to apply for a position that suits them,” Weisberg said. “Over the course of four years, the students are taking a very in-depth look at the life of an entrepreneur. Many decide to continue studying business in college, others are well-prepared to jump right into the workforce.” Weisberg’s students say it is by far the best part of their high school experience. “My favorite part is how Mr. Weisberg values us,” said Max Koleci, a junior. “He takes a couple of students and gives them larger roles, shows us how to lead. From day one I knew I wanted to be one of those leaders.” Koleci praised the “tight knit” program, detailing how he was inspired by a class trip to the BlackRock, one of the world’s largest investment management and financial services firms. He called the entire experience “enlightening.” Students in Susan Wagner High School's Virtual Enterprise program work on a project in class. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) “We’re learning things in this program that I know I’ll apply in real life,” he said. “Business is very interesting and even though I’m not quite sure if I will pursue this field in the future, I know that I will use these lessons in whatever path I might take.” Chasity Gordon, also a junior, agreed. “This class has helped me learn who I want to be,” Gordon said. “I entered the program in sophomore year, and we had lessons in Adobe, Canva, PowerPoint. I know now that I want to pursue a career in marketing.” “This program helped me discover a lot of things about myself,” Liam Smith added. “I am so much more communicative and no longer anxious or stressed, struggling to picture my future — short or long term.” Each student walks away from the program with a Career and Technical Education diploma, a specialized New York state high school accreditation that recognizes students who have completed a rigorous program of study in a specific career field. It signifies that a student has not only met the standard graduation requirements but has also gained valuable skills and knowledge in a chosen career area. Students present a business plan during one of their Virtual Enterprise classes. (Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg)(Courtesy of Joseph Weisberg) While students say that diploma is “a big deal,” it’s most certainly not the only thing they earn from this course. “This is by far the best program that Wagner offers,” Max Koleci concluded. “Mr. Weisberg always tells us ‘even if you hate business, you will learn how to prepare a budget, how to calculate interest on car payment…’ and that’s the kind of real-deal stuff we’ve learned in his classroom.” If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
