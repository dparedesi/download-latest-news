Profits increase to €4.7m for Persian Restaurants, which runs several outlets Amir Afsar The operator of the first McDonald’s outlet in Ireland, on Dublin’s Grafton Street, last year recorded pre-tax profits of €4.68m. Owned by Amir Afsar, Persian Restaurants Ltd operates a number of McDonald’s restaurants in Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford, including the Grafton Street outlet. New accounts show the company’s revenues increased by 9pc from €48.28m to €52.72m. The pre-tax profit of €4.68m followed a pre-tax loss of €220,497 in 2022. The loss was mainly due to a payout of €5.6m to directors. Pay to directors last year was less than 10pc of the 2022 payout at €531,557, made up of emoluments of €487,000, and €44,557 in pension contributions. Persian Restaurants also operates McDonald’s at the Nutgrove Shopping Centre, in Rathfarnham, and the Frascati Shopping Centre, in Blackrock. The Grafton Street outlet is the country’s oldest McDonald’s. It opened in 1977. The company last year recorded post-tax profits of €4.07m after incurring a corporation tax charge of €614,737. The profit last year takes account of non-cash depreciation costs of €1.24m. At the end of December, accumulated profits at the company totalled €19.59m, and the company had cash of €19m. Another McDonald’s franchisee, Elaine Sterio, operates five McDonald’s restaurants in the Co Louth and north Dublin areas. The most recent accounts for Ms Sterio’s Glenellen Restaurants Ltd show its revenues increased from €21.52m to €24.68m in 2022. Ms Sterio started working for McDonald’s in 1989 while studying. Pre-tax profits at Glenellen Restaurants in 2022 decreased by 20pc from €1.47m to €1.16m. Numbers employed decreased from 342 to 320 as staff costs increased from €7.05m to €7.7m. McDonald’s is currently embarking on a €40m expansion plan for Ireland, which will create 1,000 jobs here over the next four years. It now has 95 restaurants here, all of which are operated by franchisees. McDonald’s invested €42m between 2018 and 2023 in Ireland. This included the refurbishment of existing outlets and the opening of new restaurants. As part of the investment, McDonald’s currently has two planning applications before Tipperary Co Council and Wexford Co Council, for new restaurants. A number of locals in Thurles, Co Tipperary, are objecting to McDonald’s Ireland constructing a new drive-thru fast-food restaurant for Thurles, on health grounds. In one objection, Ronan Spain, of Carraig Donn, Clongour, Thurles, told the council: “As a father of two young children, I object to the development of a fast-food restaurant on health grounds, particularly as we are in the midst of an obesity crisis in this country, where one in five children aged under five is obese, according to a study referenced on the HSE website on October 10th 2024.” The council has placed the application but the only item the planning authority has sought further information from concerns a traffic issue. McDonald’s is to provide an assessment of traffic queuing at the drive-thru. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Tether was an outlaw for years. Now the $132 billion stablecoin has a key ally in Trump’s Cabinet
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/11/25/commerce-nominee-howard-lutnick-tether-booster-cantor-fitzgerald/
Time Published: 2024-11-25T18:01:47Z
Full Content:
For a decade, the crypto firm Tether built itself into one of the world’s wealthiest financial institutions, recently surpassing even mighty BlackRock in profits. Today, Tether’s eponymous stablecoin, a digital token pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, is one of the world’s major currencies, and the company, which has long operated in the financial shadows, is making a play for mainstream legitimacy. Now, thanks to a mix of sound strategy or good luck, Tether has a key ally in the highest corridors of power: Howard Lutnick, CEO of U.S. financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald, and President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for commerce secretary. Cantor Fitzgerald serves as the main custodian for Tether’s U.S. Treasury bills, which are the primary asset backing Tether’s stablecoin. Lutnick—who rebuilt Cantor Fitzgerald after 658 of its employees died on 9/11—has been touting Tether in TV appearances and recently bought a 5% ownership stake in the crypto firm, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal. But with Tether facing a reported probe from the Justice and Treasury departments into possible money laundering violations, which the company has denied, critics warn Tether—whose founder is an Italian former plastic surgeon—may have undue influence at the highest levels of the U.S. government. “The first concern is any potential conflicts with the existing engagements that [Lutnick] has,” Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told Fortune. “It’s hard to imagine him remaining engaged in the way he is now and serving as commerce secretary.” To address this conflict of interest, Lutnick reportedly plans to hand over Cantor Fitzgerald’s relationship with Tether to his colleagues and to his son, who interned with the crypto firm. A spokesperson for the Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Tether has long been one of the most powerful—and scrutinized—companies in crypto, thanks to its ubiquitous stablecoin, which is used for global trading and as a financial hedge for people without access to the dollar. As a result of its offshore operations and often opaque business practices, Tether has also faced scrutiny about the integrity of its reserves, and its popularity with drug traffickers and terrorism financiers. Tether has been subject to enforcement actions as well, including by the New York attorney general and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and is reportedly facing a probe by the Justice and Treasury Departments. Tether has denied it is complicit in illegal activities, and touted its work with law enforcement agencies and blockchain analytics firms such as TRM Labs. In the past, a big source of mistrust around Tether has been its reliance on little-known banks as partners, including the Bahamian Deltec, to manage the reserve of dollars and Treasury bills that are intended to keep its stablecoin pegged to $1. For this reason, its relationship with New York–based Cantor Fitzgerald, which Lutnick first disclosed in a December 2023 podcast, has been a key boost. “I’m a big fan of this stablecoin called Tether,” he said at the time. Lutnick has since boosted the company’s work at crypto conferences. According to the Wall Street Journal, the two firms began working together in late 2021. The alliance between Cantor Fitzgerald and Tether is growing closer. In addition to the former’s ownership stake, the Wall Street firm is reportedly planning a Bitcoin lending program. Along with his work at Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick served as one of Trump’s economic advisors during his 2024 presidential campaign, later leading transition efforts. Lutnick was in the running for the Treasury secretary position until last week, when he was named as Trump’s nominee for commerce instead. A Treasury appointment would have created more conflict over Lutnick’s relationship with Tether, owing to the department’s reported probe into the company as well as the fact that Treasury is a much more influential department than commerce. Nonetheless, House, the Columbia professor, warns that any cabinet position will hold substantial influence in the White House, in part owing to access to privileged information and overlapping regulatory frameworks. Stablecoin legislation is set to be a policy priority for the Republican-controlled Congress during the next session. “If the diversion from consideration of Mr. Lutnick for Treasury secretary to commerce secretary is being posited as a way to reduce or weaken concerns about conflict of interest, I think that is misguided,” House said. “Because those concerns will remain regardless of the type of cabinet-level role one would take.” He added that it is common for business executives to take on cabinet positions, but that any possible conflicts should be reviewed during the confirmation process. Despite Lutnick’s assurances that he will step down from Cantor and divest himself of any interests, investors seem to be reacting to Tether’s growing prospects, with its market cap growing by nearly $15 billion since the presidential election. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Is Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (SHLS) the Best Renewable Energy Penny Stock to Invest In Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Renewable Energy Penny Stocks to Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shoals Technologies Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SHLS) stands against the other renewable energy penny stocks. On November 11, the Financial Times reported that the U.S. clean energy industry faces a significant setback following Donald Trump’s election victory. The article highlights that several developers have halted projects, and investors are selling shares due to uncertainties about policy direction and federal funding under the incoming Trump administration. According to Mike Carr, president of Solar Energy Manufacturers for America, approximately half a dozen clean energy projects are awaiting policy certainty before proceeding. Trump’s election, combined with the prospect of a Republican-controlled Congress, has led to a sharp decline in renewable energy stocks. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF dropped 7% after the election. Additionally, short sellers of renewable energy stocks reportedly profited over $1 billion in the aftermath. Despite the turbulence, some industry leaders and analysts remain cautiously optimistic, suggesting that the economic case for renewable projects could persist under a Trump administration. They also believe that existing tax credits for power generation and manufacturing may remain intact. However, they warn that sectors such as offshore wind and electric vehicles may face significant challenges. Trump has pledged to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, a major driver of U.S. clean energy investment, and vowed to expand oil and gas production while halting offshore wind projects and EV mandates. Biden’s target to reduce emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels by 2030 is at risk under a second Trump term. Such a shift could result in an additional 500 million tonnes of carbon emissions in the energy sector by the end of the decade. While uncertainties loom over the renewable energy sector, the industry continues to demonstrate resilience. According to a report by Rhodium Group, a New York-based research institute, the renewable energy and transportation investment in the United States has continued to break records, reaching a new high of $71 billion in the third quarter of 2024. This marks a 12% increase from the same period in 2023 and a nearly unbroken quarter-on-quarter growth trend over the past three years. The report highlights that renewable investment accounted for 5% of total US private investment in structures, equipment, and durable consumer goods, up from 4.5% in the third quarter of 2023. Retail investment was a major driver of this growth, increasing by 9% relative to the previous quarter, largely due to a surge in zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales. However, investment in renewable technology manufacturing remained flat quarter-on-quarter, while investment in deploying technology to decarbonize energy and industrial production slipped 7% quarter-on-quarter. The report also assessed the progress of the US renewable electricity transition and found that the current pace of capacity expansion is falling short of what is needed to deliver a 40% reduction in net GHG emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. The analysis of projects in the pipeline suggests that both solar and wind are underperforming, aligning more closely with a scenario that would yield only a 30% reduction by 2030. Despite the challenges and uncertainties facing the renewable energy sector, the industry's resilience and potential for growth remain evident. With that in context, let's take a look at the 10 best renewable energy penny stocks to invest in. Our Methodology To compile our list of the 10 best renewable energy penny stocks to invest in, we used clean energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 renewable energy stocks trading below $5 as of November 22. From that list, we narrowed our choices to 10 stocks according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from the database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

However, the company’s net loss was recorded at $300,000 compared to $9.8 million during the prior-year period, which indicates a potential recovery trend. The company’s gross profit percentage came at 24.8% compared to 10.5% in the prior-year period. This increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to the decrease in wire insulation shrinkback expenses. As of September 30, Shoals Technologies’ (NASDAQ:SHLS) has a backlog and awarded orders totaling $596.6 million. Shoals Technologies (NASDAQ:SHLS) has introduced a variety of innovative products designed to optimize solar and electric vehicle (EV) installations.

Title: Why Photographers Should Understand Bitcoin

Do you remember Kodak brownies and the like? Obviously digital photograph absolutely crushed Kodak, even though ironically Kodak I think made the first digital camera? Also, the very foolish and shortsighted thing that conducted; she almost self sabotage herself by kind of trying to kill off her own digital camera, concerned that we would eat into the profits of her film business. A similar insight; Steve Jobs, upon unleashing the iPhone, obviously he knew that it was going to eat into the iPod iPod touch market, but obviously it was the right step forward. This is a book that apparently Steve Jobs recommended everyone to read. The general idea is that the paradox and difficulty that innovator’s face is that in order to innovate something new, you kind of need to kill your own business, even have the courage to self cannibalize if necessary. So for example, I think Ford has done a decent job at this semi trying to get into the electric car market, instead of just hoarding her gas guzzler cars. But the difficulty of a Ford or any other car company is that because they did not start off 100% carte blanche electric, they’re never going to catch up to Tesla, Do you remember in the early days of Tesla, in which the evaluation was far greater than that of any major car company and everyone thought that it was insanely overvalued? Who is laughing now? So a book that nobody knows about is the mobile wave by Michael Saylor; in which he accurately predicts that mobile phones, mobile technology, all the big magnificent seven companies to take over the world. He predicted the success of Amazon Facebook Twitter Google and Apple before anyone really took notice. In fact I recommend everyone to read them all way, because it shows the inside that Michael Saylor is not new to the game; he’s been in the game for a long time, over 30 years. Apparently he has seen his stock drop to an ALL TIME LOW of $.20, And now it is currently in the mid 400s. So I guess I was right all along about bitcoin, ever since I bought like 2.2 bitcoins or 2.4 bitcoins for about 20,000 or $25,000, back in 2018 when bitcoin was only around $6000-$7000 a coin. ￼ sing that we’re about to have the hundred K party, I’ve almost I guess like 12 or 13 X ‘d my initial prediction? Anyways, if you’re right about bitcoin and was right about bitcoin… And no no no bitcoin is not gonna drop down to like 60,000 or 30,000, that does not how engineering works. For people who think that bitcoin is risky, ask people… Is it risky to cross the bridge or go on a flight? No. Why? Things were engineered that way! With bitcoin, you’re not gonna have all these people who you’re trying to proselytize turn around and tell you that you were right, and shower you with good news. No no no, they might either feel low-key envious or jealous of you, and won’t probably really say much. This is also why I don’t really tell people about bitcoin too much if they don’t seem like they have a strong need for it; for example my uncle who’s worked in the jewelry business for like over 30 years, he wants to retire, and I’m kind of in the process of helping him Sell his gold and his other reserves and stuff, in order to buy bitcoin. Even he at the age of 64, being a gold jeweler for like over 30 years know that bitcoin is the future. But his issues that he cannot stomach the volatility, he says it is like drugs, “mah-yyak”– when I was with him last I just set him up with Coinbase, and just bought the daily maximum for his account which was $3500, I think we bought windows around $65,000 a coin, and already it’s like $99,000 a coin. But once again, I think the difficult thing with bitcoin is that like is probably the most addictive crack cocaine on the planet, because it is being traded 24 7, it is extremely volatile because volatility is vitality. Anything that is allowed to trade every single waking moment, on weekends as well as the evenings, and also bank holidays, is going to have more volatility because people are just bored at home, they cannot play the traditional market so they’re going to just try to buy and sell bitcoin, do some sort of weird options trading to try to squeeze a few bucks here and there.￼ I was randomly think about Peter Thiel and his zero to one book; I think if you thought about bitcoin like a year or two ago, you might’ve seen that are artificial intelligence in AI was the right bet. But no, it is most certainly bitcoin. Why? Assuming that the world runs on money, and bitcoin is perfect money, it is like maybe 80 to 90% the solution to the problems of humanity. For example, what are the greatest bad things that happened to humans? It mostly has to deal with financial distress. I almost wonder people who get addicted to gambling, drugs, cycles of poverty is because the money right now the fiat currency is toxic. You cannot blame somebody for remaining sick if they only have a sewer water to drink, and they have kids and are also forced to feed their kids sewer water. It doesn’t matter how smart hard-working or intelligent you are, as long as you’re drinking sore water, you’re going to perpetually be sick, throwing up, permanently infected with cholera. So you know you have all these Crusades on the Internet and charity is talking about providing clean water to like poor kids in Africa? I think the same thing with bitcoin– it is like the chance to give clean water to 8 billion people on the planet. Except instead of water, it is clean money. Nontoxic money. It matters if you’re at church a nonprofit a charity, mother Teresa Gandhi etc. Matters if you’re at school, a parent organization, if you have kids you’re single own a dog whatever. Ultimately you’re going to have to pay the rent, pay your mortgage, or pay property taxes. I don’t think there is anyone spot on the planet in which you cannot live or survive without money a banking account or Notes. Even all these weirdos who try to buy a $200,000 AMG sprinter van and live off the grid with star Link or whatever, you still need money, and sooner or later you’re going to have to need some sort of semi permanent address, ideally your mom‘s house or your wife’s family‘s house or something. Because for the most part if you’re American, at this point you cannot really survive without having a single address for doing taxes and stuff. And I also think that now, unfortunately you also need a cell phone number, or else you cannot even apply for basic stuff, because you’re going to have to get the one time password authentication code codes texted to your phone. Anyways, it’s gonna be a big deal once Apple integrate bitcoin into her iCloud ecosystem.

Wouldn’t it just makes sense for you to buy bitcoin directly on an iPhone using Apple Pay, and store it on your iPhone and or iCloud Apple ID account?

Title: My Bitcoin Ethics

Do you remember Kodak brownies and the like? Obviously digital photograph absolutely crushed Kodak, even though ironically Kodak I think made the first digital camera? Also, the very foolish and shortsighted thing that conducted; she almost self sabotage herself by kind of trying to kill off her own digital camera, concerned that we would eat into the profits of her film business. A similar insight; Steve Jobs, upon unleashing the iPhone, obviously he knew that it was going to eat into the iPod iPod touch market, but obviously it was the right step forward. This is a book that apparently Steve Jobs recommended everyone to read. The general idea is that the paradox and difficulty that innovator’s face is that in order to innovate something new, you kind of need to kill your own business, even have the courage to self cannibalize if necessary. So for example, I think Ford has done a decent job at this semi trying to get into the electric car market, instead of just hoarding her gas guzzler cars. But the difficulty of a Ford or any other car company is that because they did not start off 100% carte blanche electric, they’re never going to catch up to Tesla, Do you remember in the early days of Tesla, in which the evaluation was far greater than that of any major car company and everyone thought that it was insanely overvalued? Who is laughing now? So a book that nobody knows about is the mobile wave by Michael Saylor; in which he accurately predicts that mobile phones, mobile technology, all the big magnificent seven companies to take over the world. He predicted the success of Amazon Facebook Twitter Google and Apple before anyone really took notice. In fact I recommend everyone to read them all way, because it shows the inside that Michael Saylor is not new to the game; he’s been in the game for a long time, over 30 years. Apparently he has seen his stock drop to an ALL TIME LOW of $.20, And now it is currently in the mid 400s. So I guess I was right all along about bitcoin, ever since I bought like 2.2 bitcoins or 2.4 bitcoins for about 20,000 or $25,000, back in 2018 when bitcoin was only around $6000-$7000 a coin. ￼ sing that we’re about to have the hundred K party, I’ve almost I guess like 12 or 13 X ‘d my initial prediction? Anyways, if you’re right about bitcoin and was right about bitcoin… And no no no bitcoin is not gonna drop down to like 60,000 or 30,000, that does not how engineering works. For people who think that bitcoin is risky, ask people… Is it risky to cross the bridge or go on a flight? No. Why? Things were engineered that way! With bitcoin, you’re not gonna have all these people who you’re trying to proselytize turn around and tell you that you were right, and shower you with good news. No no no, they might either feel low-key envious or jealous of you, and won’t probably really say much.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber "If these people had to be honest, it would all be over." -- Mike Benz. “Now that our cheques are bouncing and we are starting to default on our debts, our entire civilization appears to be manifesting suicidal behavior in an effort to control the firing squad.” — Luke Dodson. “Joe Biden” is feeling blue. Not a joke. In the lurid sunset of his dwindling term-in-office, the long shadow of his legacy points toward a gigantic glowing cinder where North America used to be. Such are the grievances of the outgoing president. I pass unto you and your legions of white supremacist slobs the ashtray that was once our mighty nation. Fix that! But, as Sir Mick Jagger observed some time ago: you can’t always get what you want. “Joe Biden,” in despair, sinks deeper into his McTeer power recliner and slips back into the bitter dream of his nemesis, a beast named Chrump. . . . It’s such a chewy name: Chrump, a fricative fiesta! The tongue briefly presses against the alveolar ridge before releasing, then curls back, and the jaw opens slightly to form this vowel sound, the lips close to let the sound resonate nasally before releasing air. Chrump Chrump Chrump. Like, what your mouth would feel like working through a bowl of Froot Loops. So satisfying! The outgoing Party of Chaos can’t stop chanting it on the cable news networks, as if trying to invoke the ancient furies, ghastly, terrifying figures with snakes for hair, dogs' heads, blood-red eyes, and bat-wings, brandishing torches and scourges to mortify their enemy. Otherwise, fantasy aside, they are in paralysis as this enemy, Mr. Trump, marshals his pieces on the gameboard: Musk, Vivek, Bobby Jr, Tulsi, Bondi, Hegseth . . . . Ay-yeeeeee! They are coming to get us. . . . Somebody. . . do something. . . ! Okay, then, who, exactly, in the shadows behind the half-conscious ghoul in the White House, thinks that now is a great time to commence an ATACMS (Attack’ems) missile barrage on Russia as the very thing to salvage our Ukraine project? You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Hey!

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

Not a joke. In the lurid sunset of his dwindling term-in-office, the long shadow of his legacy points toward a gigantic glowing cinder where North America used to be. Such are the grievances of the outgoing president. I pass unto you and your legions of white supremacist slobs the ashtray that was once our mighty nation. Fix that! But, as Sir Mick Jagger observed some time ago: you can’t always get what you want. “Joe Biden,” in despair, sinks deeper into his McTeer power recliner and slips back into the bitter dream of his nemesis, a beast named Chrump. . . . It’s such a chewy name: Chrump, a fricative fiesta! The tongue briefly presses against the alveolar ridge before releasing, then curls back, and the jaw opens slightly to form this vowel sound, the lips close to let the sound resonate nasally before releasing air. Chrump Chrump Chrump. Like, what your mouth would feel like working through a bowl of Froot Loops. So satisfying! The outgoing Party of Chaos can’t stop chanting it on the cable news networks, as if trying to invoke the ancient furies, ghastly, terrifying figures with snakes for hair, dogs' heads, blood-red eyes, and bat-wings, brandishing torches and scourges to mortify their enemy. Otherwise, fantasy aside, they are in paralysis as this enemy, Mr. Trump, marshals his pieces on the gameboard: Musk, Vivek, Bobby Jr, Tulsi, Bondi, Hegseth . . . . Ay-yeeeeee! They are coming to get us. . . . Somebody. . . do something. . . ! Okay, then, who, exactly, in the shadows behind the half-conscious ghoul in the White House, thinks that now is a great time to commence an ATACMS (Attack’ems) missile barrage on Russia as the very thing to salvage our Ukraine project? You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Hey!

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable.

NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

They are coming to get us. . . . Somebody. . . do something. . . ! Okay, then, who, exactly, in the shadows behind the half-conscious ghoul in the White House, thinks that now is a great time to commence an ATACMS (Attack’ems) missile barrage on Russia as the very thing to salvage our Ukraine project? You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Hey!

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2.

The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows.

It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Hey!

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Hey!

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating.

If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia?

However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation.

Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating.

My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence.

Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict.

However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Beverage Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against best beverage stocks that pay dividends. Retail sales rebounded significantly in October as the economy remained stable and consumers overcame worries about a port strike and other challenges that had dampened sales in September, according to the CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor. NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay noted that consumer spending picked up again in October, supported by job growth and increased wages throughout the year. He observed that inflation remained largely confined to services, with prices for some retail goods even declining. Shay indicated that October’s sales performance had laid a solid foundation for the holiday shopping season to begin on a positive note. When we examine specific sectors, we see that grocery and beverage stores experienced a 0.87% increase on a seasonally adjusted month-over-month basis and a 3.76% rise year-over-year without seasonal adjustments. The food and beverage industry faced significant challenges during the pandemic. While in-home consumption surged, out-of-home dining virtually ceased, leading to a substantial decline in business and severely impacting the sector. Since then, the industry has undergone numerous transformations and is now in a recovery phase. According to a Market Research report, the global food and beverages market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% between 2022 and 2027. The market's growth is being driven by shifting consumer habits, out-of-town retail parks, and retail stores.

In 2023, spending on out-of-home cold coffee, such as iced coffee, cold brew, and frozen coffee drinks, reached $17.7 billion—more than double the $8.5 billion spent in 2016, according to the food service research firm Technomic. Additionally, the National Coffee Association (NCA) reported that coffee consumption outside the home has returned to pre-pandemic levels as people resume visiting coffee shops and workplaces. Over a third of consumers who drank coffee on a given day did so away from home, marking the highest rate since January 2020, as highlighted in the NCA's National Coffee Data Trends report. Consumer behavior plays a critical role in shaping any industry, and the beverage sector is no exception. This industry is adapting to evolving preferences, with more Americans seeking alternatives to alcohol. Beverage companies emphasizing the health benefits of their products are striving to tap into this trend. According to data insights firm NCSolutions, over 40% of Americans aim to reduce their alcohol consumption in 2024, an increase from 34% the previous year. Among Generation Z, this figure rises to 61%, compared to 40% in 2023 who expressed similar intentions. Technology stocks have been the standout performers this year, with gains of nearly 29%. While food and beverage stocks haven't seen exceptional growth, the Food & Beverage index, which represents companies across various sub-industries in the sector, has still delivered a modest year-to-date return of 7.5%. Over the past 12 months, the index has risen by approximately 14%. Pixabay/Public Domain To select the best beverage stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked companies that are primarily involved in the production and distribution of a wide variety of liquid refreshments, including soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, bottled water, energy drinks, fruit juices, sports and nutritional drinks, and dairy-based beverages. From that list, we selected 10 companies that pay dividends to shareholders and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 Warren Buffett's favorite, The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) ranks second on our list of the best beverage stocks that pay dividends. The American multinational beverage company is well-known to consumers, offering a diverse range of drink brands and maintaining a global presence. The company's greatest competitive advantage is its strong brand, which creates an economic moat, helping it stand out from competitors in the industry. In addition to its long history of providing a consistent product, it has developed exceptional marketing expertise, ensuring the brand remains prominent and top-of-mind for consumers. The stock has delivered a nearly 7% return to shareholders since the start of 2024.

Its adjusted operating margin reached an impressive 30.7% in Q3, reflecting a highly profitable business model. This consistent profitability has directly benefited shareholders, as The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) has increased its dividend for an astounding 62 consecutive years.

Title: Putin Is Throwing Human Waves at Ukraine, But Can’t Do It Forever

Posted on 11/25/2024 4:46:13 AM PST by Timber Rattler One of the bleakest places on Earth today is the central processing facility for the remains of dead soldiers in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, the logistical hub of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Designed to process hundreds of corpses at a time, this sprawling mega-morgue has been hopelessly overwhelmed for many months. Footage from the inside, posted by witnesses on social media, shows hundreds of bodies in various stages of decomposition and limbs strewn across the corridor floors. In wooden boxes lining the walls from floor to ceiling, row after row after row, are the lucky ones: those whose bodies were recovered from the battlefield, identified, sealed in zinc-lined caskets, and prepared for dispatch to their grieving relatives in the farthest corners of Russia. Many more corpses have been abandoned to rot in Ukrainian fields because evacuating them is impractical under the constant barrage of the defenders’ artillery and drones. To be sure: These soldiers’ deaths are the necessary consequence of Ukraine’s right to defend itself against an illegal war of conquest. What’s more, many of these ordinary Russian soldiers likely committed despicable brutality and war crimes against Ukrainians, including defenseless civilians. But the horrific rate at which Russians are getting killed at the front—much higher than corresponding Ukrainian losses, although exact numbers are kept secret by both sides—points to two disturbing truths about the Russian way of waging war. First, a cruel disregard for human life extends to Russia’s own forces, which the Kremlin systematically deploys in so-called meat grinder and human-wave attacks. Second, mass death among Russian troops has become part of an increasingly explicit eugenics policy, by which the Kremlin seeks to rid Russia of undesirable elements and reconfigure the Russian population.

Title: Is Uber Technologies (UBER) the Best Stock to Invest in for the Next 3 Months?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies. Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally. First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms. Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers. Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services. Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil. Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies. Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced. On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes. The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

Title: Investing with a clear conscience: How should Catholics manage their money?

By Jonah McKeown CNA Staff, Nov 25, 2024 / 06:00 am In today’s complex society, it takes effort to ensure that your hard-earned money, once invested and out in the financial ether, doesn’t fund the kinds of things that Catholics abhor — like abortion, pornography, or unethical labor practices. But surely the Church itself, with its significant invested assets, has this figured out already… right? Though the principles behind Catholic investing have been clearly articulated in recent years, sources told CNA that many Catholic entities still have a long way to go to make sure their investments actually align with those principles. Case in point: when Daniel Catone, founder of Arimathea Investing, and his team of financial experts started digging into the finances of Catholic entities who approached them, they discovered something extraordinary — and surprisingly pervasive. Nearly all of their Catholic clients, including many U.S. dioceses, were unwittingly funding — sometimes to the tune of millions of dollars — products and practices that directly contradict the faith. “We have to look at the reality of the choices that we’re making with our dollars, [because] just as Our Lord will call us to account for every careless word that comes from our mouths, so too will the Lord call us to account for every careless dollar that left our wallets,” Catone told CNA. Arimathea is just one of a growing number of Catholic firms seeking to help individuals, ministries, and dioceses align their investment portfolios with the teachings of the Catholic Church, all while seeking competitive financial returns. The Church has weighed in quite comprehensively — and quite recently — on the topic of investing, both at the level of the bishops of the United States in 2021 and at the worldwide level with the 2022 Vatican document Mensuram Bonam. Mensuram Bonam — the title of which means “a good measure” — casts a wide net, exhorting investors to consider the ethics and consequences of their actions, especially how their investment choices will affect the world’s most vulnerable. It emphasizes that Catholic investors should seek not only to avoid harm but also actively promote good. The document identifies a set of core principles for investors rooted in Catholic social teaching. The principles include the recognition of the dignity of every human being; promoting the common good; working in solidarity with the most vulnerable; caring for the environment; and subsidiarity — the idea that decision-making should be done at the most appropriate level. The guidelines also lay out specific exclusionary criteria that Catholic investors need to be aware of and screen for. These include the funding of abortion, armaments, nuclear weapons, contraceptives, embryonic stem cell research, pornography, addictive substances, human rights violations such as breaches of labor laws, corruption, and unfair business practices. The development of Mensuram Bonam was prompted, in part, by a controversy in recent years over the Vatican’s own investments. In April 2021, an Italian investigative news program accused the Vatican’s treasury of investing 20 million euros (then around $24 million) in several pharmaceutical companies involved in making emergency contraception, or the “morning-after pill.” A subsequent 2022 policy was drawn up mandating that the Holy See’s financial investments cannot contradict Catholic teaching. The U.S. Catholic bishops’ “Socially Responsible Investment Guidelines,” released in 2021, applies to the U.S. investment landscape many similar concepts found within the latter-written Mensuram Bonam. (Story continues below) The bishops urge the importance of discerning whether investments will protect human life, which means avoiding any company involved in abortion, euthanasia, and assisted suicide, embryonic stem cell research, human cloning, and other practices the Church teaches to be evil. At the same time, investors must endeavor to promote human dignity and the common good, the bishops wrote. This means Catholic investors should avoid companies known to persistently violate the human rights of their workers or who operate in countries with poor human rights records. Companies with ties to pornography, human trafficking, or a non-Catholic view of gender identity and expression should be avoided, the bishops noted. This also means eschewing investments in certain “harmful habitual behaviors” and “addictive materials” such as gambling, tobacco, and recreational drugs; also firearms, the bishops said, except for legitimate hunting, military, or law enforcement use. At the same time, the bishops urged investors to support positive things such as renewable energy sources; biodiversity and water resources; affordable housing; and, in the face of an often negative outlook from many Hollywood productions, virtuous media that strengthens families and contributes to a more positive and humane culture. After a successful two-decade career in finance overseeing billions of dollars in investments, Catone, who has a master’s degree in theology, went all-in on what he calls “faithful investing.” He founded Arimathea in 2023 as an asset management company that conducts in-depth, tech-forward research to ensure its clients’ portfolios — “dollars meant to be used for the people of God” — are truly Catholic-aligned. By trusting large secular firms like BlackRock or Morgan Stanley to manage their money, many Catholics are unknowingly funding organizations and practices that directly contradict the Church’s teachings, he reiterated, citing Arimathea’s own rigorous research. These include investments in companies like Microsoft, which not only pays for employees’ abortion travel but also has been known to violate workers’ rights in developing countries; other companies that directly cause abortions by distributing Plan B drugs; even companies such as hotel chains that directly profit off the sale of pornography, he said. “I came to the realization that the secular world was, in a way, pulling the wool over the eyes of the Catholic Church. And shocking as this may sound, most people do not become bishops because they’re really good at picking stocks, and so they rely upon the expertise of these secular organizations,” Catone said. He urged Catholics to examine their own investments, such as their 401(k), with a trusted financial adviser. “Step 1 is to stop treating our money as ‘out of sight, out of mind.’ Because the Lord is calling us to live a fully integrated life,” Catone said. “Our Lord Jesus Christ needs to be the Lord of every part of our life … and that also includes our 401(k) and our IRA. So in order to wake up, the first step is to open our eyes … because we can’t repent of what we don’t know.” On Arimathea’s website, Catholics can send their investment portfolio to the company, which will then screen it, for free, offering a kind of “report card” on the ethicality of each investment from a Catholic perspective, Catone noted. He added that Arimathea’s research is informed by a strong understanding of Catholic theology — a rarity among investment firms — as well as what he calls a “literal reading” of the 2021 USCCB document. Arimathea is also working to develop a network of accredited advisers who are trained in the principles of Catholic social teaching and can guide Catholic investors, he said. The goal is not merely to avoid “bad” companies but also actively seek out investments that promote human dignity and the common good, he emphasized. One way to do this is through proxy voting, a tool for influencing corporate behavior and promoting change from within that Catone said can be helpful in pushing companies to adopt more ethical practices. He said Catholics should be actively engaged in trying to improve the companies they invest in and have had some success at that in the past. Catone said the success Arimathea has had financially demonstrates that it is possible to invest in a way that is fully in line with the Catholic faith without sacrificing monetary returns. “What we’re trying to show at Arimathea is you can draw the line ... and say you know what? No abortion, no pornography, no drugs, no slave labor. And you know what? The returns are great,” he concluded. Shane Giblin, CEO of The Abbey Group, told CNA that the cultural milieu following the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade exposed “a bit of a crisis in the area of Catholic investing.” The Abbey Group came about in the late 2010s after St. Michael’s Abbey in Orange County, California, under Giblin’s fundraising leadership, managed to raise $150 million to build a new abbey, far outpacing expectations. They started doing pro bono consulting to help other Catholic entities replicate their success, launching officially in 2020 with a goal to help worthy Catholic causes generate and grow the resources they need to fully live out their mission. The Abbey Group is selective in its projects, evaluating them based on alignment with Catholic teachings, the potential impact of their endeavors, and the strength of their leadership. Giblin said in the wake of Roe’s overturn, the “screens” that were being applied to many Catholic investment portfolios needed to be reevaluated; it wasn’t clear how effective they were, or what they were doing to potentially limit returns, he noted. The other thing that Giblin said he noticed was that many Catholic investors weren’t allocating much to private equity — the buying and selling of shares in privately-held businesses. “What we saw was a great deal of interest and encouragement in creating an alternative investment solution that is authentically Catholic, specifically something in the private equity space,” Giblin said. To address the need, Giblin said Abbey Group Capital has partnered with Carrick Capital Partners, a firm run by a faithful Catholic, to help its clients grow the money they raise — and do so in a way that aligns with the Church’s teachings. The partnership, which benefits from the spiritual guidance from the Norbertine priests at the abbey, ensures investments align with Catholic values, such as avoidance of abortion and positive support for mothers wishing to keep and raise their children, Giblin said. Giblin said he hopes their approach will inspire others in the Catholic community to adopt similar strategies, ultimately contributing to a more dynamic and competitive landscape in Catholic investing. “It seems all too often that the Catholic space has to make the decision between either being excellent or being authentically Catholic. I think that’s a problem that we need to really break ourselves out of, a dynamic we need to run away from, because they’re not mutually exclusive terms,” he said. “I’ve seen a resurgence of late that gives me a lot of hope. I think that people are starting to become far more rigorous and far more attentive to the necessity to steward these resources with a great deal of vigilance when it comes to what they’re investing in and what they’re not investing in.” Richard Todd, CEO of Innovest, a Catholic financial firm based in Colorado that manages about $50 billion, said there was little awareness of the possibility, or even the need, for Catholic-aligned investments back in 1996 when he founded his firm. But that landscape has changed significantly with the rise of large, secular investment firms “taking advantage” of trusting Catholics, he said. “The ‘other side’ has been taking advantage of Catholics for, I would say, probably the last 10 years, but very specifically in the last five,” Todd told CNA. “It used to be, as a Catholic investor, if you owned a company, you could trust management to do what’s right for the company. But it’s no longer the case because of this pressure that these large asset managers are putting on.” Todd said Innovest works with clients to develop customized investment guidelines that reflect their unique values, allowing organizations like dioceses and universities to articulate their specific ethical concerns and ensure that their investment portfolios are truly aligned with their mission. They then design diversified portfolios that include traditional stocks and bonds, along with alternative investments such as real estate, private debt, and private equity. Todd, echoing Catone, emphasized the importance of going beyond simply avoiding harmful investments, emphasizing the importance of seeking out companies that promote positive values. He said Innovest looks for companies that prioritize human flourishing and foster a strong company culture, and also reiterated the importance of Catholics with large investments using proxy voting to influence companies for the better. “Many organizations that are Catholic don’t pay any attention to proxy voting. They end up voting for things that are completely outside their values, outside Catholic values. We believe that understanding how proxies are voted is really crucial,” he said. He noted that a popular framework of values-based investing, environmental, social, and governance (ESG), also known as impact investing, can include elements that are “anti-Christian” or misaligned with Catholic values. He said he seeks to educate clients on the differences between secular investing, ESG, and Catholic investing. Like Giblin, Todd said he firmly believes that investors do not have to sacrifice financial returns to invest in alignment with Catholic values. He pointed to the rise of competent asset managers who are adept at managing Catholic-values portfolios while achieving market-competitive or even superior results compared with secular portfolios. “I think, though, that there are [still] very few in the Catholic world that think this way. I think we’re in the first inning,” Todd said. “There are some, I think, that are moving in this direction that are prominent and well known. Our hope is that their courage will help lead others to really take a serious look at the way they manage their money. But there’s a lot to be done.” Your monthly donation will help our team continue reporting the truth, with fairness, integrity, and fidelity to Jesus Christ and his Church.

Title: Wall Street Embraces MBS’s Money Man

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access After the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, business leaders made a show of shunning Saudi Arabia, doing deals only behind closed doors. Now it’s all out in the open. On November 14, Wall Street feted Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the head of Saudi Arabia’s nearly $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund and a close confidante of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (MBS). At Cipriani—a private members’ club at 55 Wall Street—bright flowers at the center of the tables matched the ruby-red drapes. This gala, thrown by the Business Council for International Understanding, was a mark of the massive volume of Saudi investment capital percolating through the American economy. That itself isn’t new, but in recent years it’s become clear that the shame associated with Saudi funding in the wake of the grisly 2018 murder and dismemberment of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi has faded. Few seemed to even notice that the governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund—which a Senate subcommittee is currently investigating for undue foreign influence in the fund’s seemingly hostile takeover of the PGA golf Tour—was receiving an award in Manhattan. On stage in Cipriani’s Greek revival ballroom, the president of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, presented Al-Rumayyan with a large crystal paperweight. Sitting with them at the long head table was HuffPo founder Arianna Huffington, and among the hundreds of minglers making their way through the room were hedge-fund titan Ray Dalio, Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel, former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. The evening’s theme—“Champions of Change: Values in Practice”—couldn’t have been more incongruous for Al-Rumayyan, the billionaire lieutenant to one of the world’s most brutal rulers. (I had hoped to attend in person to investigate whether anyone there had qualms about honoring MBS’s money man. Sadly, I was told that the proceedings were closed to journalists.) But the whole event managed to avoid greater scrutiny because Saudi power in the United States, under successive presidents, has become so normalized. In 2023 alone, the Public Investment Fund spent $31.6 billion worldwide, and it currently holds about $20 billion worth of US stocks. Beyond its vanity projects like the futuristic city of Neom or its gifting of $2 billion to Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, PIF is planning a staggering $40 billion AI fund. Meanwhile, its venture capital arm has doled out about $3 billion a year to Wall Street stalwarts and the entire universe of private equity and venture capital firms powering Silicon Valley. “There’s no distinction between the [Saudi fund’s] money and the de facto ruler, who is Mohammed bin Salman,” Hala Aldosari, a Saudi activist living in exile in the US, told me. This is not just a Trump phenomenon. President Joe Biden’s about-face—capped by fist-bumping MBS on a visit to the kingdom in 2022 that broke with his campaign pledge to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah”—explicitly gave American business permission to go all in. Since Israel launched its war on Gaza, the Biden administration has further revived MBS’s global stature and tamped down its already muted human rights rhetoric. As Aldosari put it, “It’s going to get worse with Trump now, but in terms of US foreign policy in the Middle East, it’s very much problematic regardless of the political party.” In anticipation, many American and international companies are already expanding their dealings in Saudi Arabia. Even the consultancy founded by the late Madeleine Albright, which long held itself out as a values-driven firm, just opened a headquarters in Riyadh. In Saudi Arabia, basic freedoms have not improved since Khashoggi was lured inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and murdered. The regime’s crackdown on women’s rights activists has accelerated. “It’s the worst we’ve ever seen,” Aldosari says. Prison sentences are getting longer even for relatively low-profile cases, as part of what she calls the regime’s “systematic approach” to snuffing out dissent. She cited two women recently prosecuted for their tweets, notably Nourah al-Qahtani, who was jailed for 45 years and Salma al-Shehab, who received 34 years. Plus, earlier this year, a Saudi cartoonist named Al-Hazza was sentenced to 23 years. In a new report, Human Rights Watch documents how the Public Investment Fund has enabled internal clampdowns in Saudi Arabia. Drawing upon newly released court documents, Human Rights Watch notes that Al-Rumayyan was a key figure in the 2017 Ritz roundup in which 200 wealthy Saudi royals and businesspeople were detained and blackmailed in the luxury hotel in Riyadh. While it’s tough to get American business to care about issues of global human rights, the risks inherent in working in an autocracy might get their attention. Human Rights Watch details how the state has repeatedly expropriated the assets of people and companies, without due process. One Saudi entrepreneur based in the US (who would speak to me only on the condition of anonymity) emphasized that Western corporations that engage with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund are exposed to financial as well as reputational risks. “By associating with a fund connected to human rights abuses, they face increasing backlash from investors, consumers, and global stakeholders demanding ethical accountability,” he told me. “The absence of reliable dispute resolution mechanisms in Saudi Arabia leaves companies vulnerable to arbitrary practices, such as unjust expropriations, without any credible options for redress.” But investment capital apparently remains in short supply, and Al-Rummayan’s sovereign wealth purse holds $925 billion. (He also chairs the national oil company, Saudi Aramco.) In the months following Khashoggi’s assassination, business and finance leaders only quietly sealed deals with Saudi Arabia; now it’s out in the open. The Ritz Carlton, the site of MBS’s five-star detention facility, is once again home to big business. In late October, a think tank connected to Al-Rumayyan’s sovereign wealth fund hosted its annual summit in Riyadh, known as Davos in the Desert. In the room were billionaires Dalio, Larry Fink, Ken Griffin, Marc Rowan, Eric Schmidt, and Steve Schwarzman. Elon Musk, who has also benefited from Saudi financial largesse, took the time to appear by video. The public panels focused on innovation and financial trends while studiously avoiding politics, yet there were, as ever, moments that revealed why they had really gathered in Saudi Arabia. David Rubenstein, the Carlyle billionaire who as recently as last year played host to the Biden family for Thanksgiving at his Nantucket retreat, has become a regular of these Saudi events. Moderating a panel, Rubenstein began by flattering the host—or perhaps calling the event for what it is. “Let me ask Yasir,” Rubenstein began, “is the biggest problem with being the governor of the PIF fund that you don’t have enough requests for money?” Al-Rumayyan laughed, but the numbers are nothing to joke about. Attendees told The New York Times that just a small check from him could amount to $100 million. The Saudi fund’s venture arm notes on its website 143 startups, investment funds, and real estate companies that it’s currently backing. Among those listed: Rowan’s Apollo, Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors, and Schwarzman’s Blackstone. Fink’s BlackRock received $5 billion from the PIF for a new investment platform. PIF says that $70 billion of agreements were inked at the October confab, including a partnership between the Saudi fund and Google Cloud to “advance AI research in Arabic-language models,” according to the company. Its president and chief investment officer, Ruth Porat, sat on the panel with Al-Rumayyan in Riyadh. A few weeks later, the Google executive presented him with the Eisenhower Award for Global Transformation in New York, for “values in practice.” But what values does Saudi investment represent beyond the value of money? Juan David Rojas John Nichols Elie Mystal Books & the Arts / Zoe Adams Expect to see more of the Saudi sovereign-wealth kingmaker. Days later at Madison Square Garden, Al-Rumayyan chatted with President-elect Trump at an Ultimate Fighting Championship match, with Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy nearby. It’s likely that in Trump’s second term there will be many more galas for Al-Rumayyan, with a full state visit for MBS on the horizon. We now confront a second Trump presidency. There’s not a moment to lose. We must harness our fears, our grief, and yes, our anger, to resist the dangerous policies Donald Trump will unleash on our country. We rededicate ourselves to our role as journalists and writers of principle and conscience. Today, we also steel ourselves for the fight ahead. It will demand a fearless spirit, an informed mind, wise analysis, and humane resistance. We face the enactment of Project 2025, a far-right supreme court, political authoritarianism, increasing inequality and record homelessness, a looming climate crisis, and conflicts abroad. The Nation will expose and propose, nurture investigative reporting, and stand together as a community to keep hope and possibility alive. The Nation’s work will continue—as it has in good and not-so-good times—to develop alternative ideas and visions, to deepen our mission of truth-telling and deep reporting, and to further solidarity in a nation divided. Armed with a remarkable 160 years of bold, independent journalism, our mandate today remains the same as when abolitionists first founded The Nation—to uphold the principles of democracy and freedom, serve as a beacon through the darkest days of resistance, and to envision and struggle for a brighter future. The day is dark, the forces arrayed are tenacious, but as the late Nation editorial board member Toni Morrison wrote “No! This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak, we write, we do language. That is how civilizations heal.” I urge you to stand with The Nation and donate today.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Trending on Financial Media. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are trending on financial media. The AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Private equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018. The private equity firm has tried twice to get the memory chipmaker listed on the stock exchange, once in 2018 and then again earlier this year.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

The advisory cites the recent movement in the shares for the downgrade. It also lowered margin assumptions for fiscal 2026 to reflect management guidance of lower margins due to Blackwell products. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are trending on financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The hedge fund manager takes a piece of a popular consumer brand. Today, Millennium has over $70 billion in assets under management and is one of the world's largest hedge funds. Investors should understand that Millennium is a "pod shop," which means it allocates capital to different teams (or "pods") that all have their own strategies and a lot of autonomy. In the third quarter, Millennium sold large portions of its stakes in artificial intelligence (AI) companies Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) and bought a new stock that Wall Street thinks can soar. Broadcom isn't the only way to tap the AI revolution. There are currently eight publicly traded companies with market caps of $1 trillion or more: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), the world's biggest retailer and the largest company in the world by revenue, has quietly blown away the rest of the retail sector in recent years as its commitment to omnichannel sales and reputation for everyday low prices have delivered steady growth. Walmart reported another round of strong quarterly results on Tuesday morning. Microsoft and Broadcom are more stable long-term AI plays. Markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving. Earnings from retailers and October inflation data will be the week's highlights. On the surface, Boeing (NYSE: BA) looks as though it has all the ingredients of a potential millionaire-maker investment. The aircraft market is growing, competition is minimal, and government contracts are plentiful. The phrase "economic moat" -- popularized by investing legend Warren Buffett -- refers to certain types of durable competitive advantages a company can possess that make it difficult for potential rivals to make inroads against it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) did it again. Shares pulled back slightly on the news as investors have gotten accustomed to the chip titan regularly besting expectations, and some analysts wanted to see stronger fourth-quarter guidance, which called for $37.5 billion in revenue -- a 70% increase from the quarter a year ago. At the time of this writing, Nvidia is now worth $3.5 trillion. One FAANG stock was unceremoniously left out of the "Magnificent Seven." That was a costly blunder.

We recently compiled a list of the 14 AI Stocks on Wall Street's Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against the other AI stocks that are on Wall Street's Radar. Latest reports from tech news platform TechCrunch indicate that MatX, a chip-design startup focused on supporting large language models, has raised $80 million in a funding round. This follows the $25 million seed round it held less than a year ago. The latest round, led by Spark Capital, values the company at a pre-money valuation in the mid-$200 million range and a post-money valuation in the low $300 million range, per TechCrunch. MatX was co-founded two years ago by former Google TPU team members Mike Gunter and Reiner Pope, who aim to address the global shortage of AI-specific chips. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The company’s chips are optimized for AI workloads of 7 billion to 20 billion parameters or more, providing high performance at lower costs. MatX highlights its advanced interconnect technology, which enhances scalability for large clusters.

Per the report, the chipmaker said it is also evaluating the future of its 50-acre Hawthorn Farm property and working to consolidate its footprint at its Silicon Valley headquarters.

Title: American Tower Corporation (AMT): Are Hedge Funds Bullish On This Real Estate and Realty Stock?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-tower-corporation-amt-hedge-091243879.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) stands against the other real estate and realty stocks. As reported by Realtor, America’s newly elected president Trump has blamed illegal immigration for the country’s housing affordability crisis since these immigrants are in the race for an already short supply of homes and hence, plans to do the largest deportation operation in American history. It is important to consider that the recent post-pandemic surging home prices started off before the illegal immigration levels climbed. Furthermore, Realtor.com senior economist Ralph McLaughlin referred to this move as something that would create negative consequences for the housing market by stating: “In the short run, reducing immigration could severely hurt the labor supply needed for new homebuilding since up to a third of residential construction employment consists of foreign-born workers” Simultaneously, Trump wants to cut regulations and permit requirements that add unnecessary costs to new homes. Regarding this, economists believe that although reduced regulations might lower homebuilding costs, they would neither solve the entire housing crisis nor fulfill Trump’s dream of cutting the cost of a new home in half by eliminating regulations. Mortgage rates are directly tied to 10-year Treasury bond yields which tend to grow with investors forecasting stronger economic growth and higher inflation. According to Mortgage News Daily, the 30-year fixed mortgage rates briefly rose, settling at 6.98% following Trump’s victory. Despite two rate cuts by the Fed, the rate has surged by almost 1% since the month of September. Trump has also stated his enthusiasm related to somehow lowering mortgage rates, without a clear mechanism unveiled as of yet. Economists and analysts believe that the President’s economic agenda could potentially lead to a surge in mortgage rates. Trump has plans to reduce tax rates, impose tariffs on foreign goods, and ease regulations, policies that are going to lead to a rise in inflation and government debt, which is going to drive up the interest rates and mortgage rates. Before the elections, 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists agreed that Trump's policies would fuel inflation, calling Joe Biden's economic agenda vastly superior to Donald Trump's. Doug Bauer, CEO of Tri Pointe Homes, joined CNBC to discuss what’s next for the US housing market. He sees the lower corporate tax and the easing of regulations for banks as positives. With banks being encouraged to put dollars into all businesses especially the land and land development business to small and medium-sized builders, it is going to help the industry as a whole. Regarding the deportation, he believes the discussion is pretty early but his company, as a larger builder, has not faced any problems on the labor side of the equation. Finally, he mentioned that the core issue remains the supply. While a reduction in interest rates would unlock the resale market, the new homebuilding is a 'state and local issue' as there are a lot of regulations pulling back the land that could be utilized to build affordable housing. Ivy Zelman, Zelman and Associates CEO, also appeared on an interview with CNBC, to reiterate Bauer’s point about the issue regarding the new home market. In her opinion, the housing market weakness is at the entry level while the move-up market remains strong and resilient despite rates moving higher. While first-time homebuyers are facing extreme affordability issues, she thinks cities and municipalities could partner with local builders to utilize land that’s not out so far in the rural areas and that the solution lies at the local government level. Trump also plans to open up federal land for building. However, a limitation of this would be a lack of federal land located near the places where people wish to work and live. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 10 best real estate and realty stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we first use a stock screener to make an extended list of the relevant companies with the highest market caps. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best real estate and realty stocks to buy according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A wide angled view of a high-rise office building, the windows reflecting a nearby cityscape. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73 American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts founded in 1995 as an American Radio subsidiary. The firm offers services and solutions to deploy and support wireless networks in 24 countries across six continents. It has a portfolio of independently owned US and international tower real estate and a network of data centers in the US. AMT’s customers include mobile network operators, multinational telecommunications companies, media and broadband providers, and government agencies. The ongoing exponential growth in mobile data consumption has driven AMT’s performance in the US. The company’s performance is backed up by the strong underlying demand for its portfolio of communications assets. Its synergy revolves around having that global expertise and experience enabling it to navigate operational risks in new markets while simultaneously creating opportunities. With a resilient demand and strength of underlying fundamentals across the portfolio, AMT is well positioned. The company is pursuing long-term growth by managing its diverse markets. AMT has planned to reduce its exposure to emerging markets which are more vulnerable to the macro environment as the firm continues to focus on incremental investments in developed economies. In September, AMT closed the sale of operations in India to Data Infrastructure Trust, an Infrastructure Investment Trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management. For the third quarter of 2024, the firm’s total revenue grew by less than 0.1% to $2,522 million while net income and adjusted EBITDA declined. As emphasized by CEO Steven Vondran, the carrier rollouts of 5G coverage tend to support robust activity levels in the United States and Europe while demand for AMT’s global portfolio of communications infrastructure assets is evident. Hence, American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is a leading independent owner, operator, and developer of multi-tenant communications real estate, having a solid portfolio of over 148,000 communications sites and a highly interconnected footprint of US data center facilities. Overall AMT ranks 1st on our list of the best real estate and realty stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AMT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

AMT is likely to gain from the solid demand for wireless connectivity and capital allocation strategy despite customer concentration and consolidation. If you're an investor looking for high-yield investments with some solid upside potential, there is perhaps no better place to look than the energy midstream space. The sector has gone through a transformation in the past decade, with midstream companies reducing leverage and being more disciplined when it comes to funding growth projects. Against that backdrop, let's look a three great MLPs -- Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET), and Western Midstream (NYSE: WES) -- investors might want to consider buying and holding forever. Englander has taken a contrarian approach by selling Wall Street's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stock in favor of a premier healthcare company that's more than 90% below its all-time high. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) supplies the most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for developing artificial intelligence (AI) models. Many of the world's largest technology companies are spending boatloads of money to fill their data centers with those chips as they jostle for leadership in the AI race. As a result, Nvidia's data center revenue generated triple-digit percentage growth in each of the last six quarters. Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management just raised the fund's position in foundry specialist Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. It remains to be seen if Super Micro can still take care of its paperwork in time to satisfy the Nasdaq. Vertiv and Target have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Consider, for example, that a study by Hartford Funds and Ned Davis Research found that between 1973 and 2023, companies that grew or initiated dividend payments delivered annualized returns of 10.2%, while dividend non-payers delivered only 4.3% (and an equal-weight S&P 500 fund averaged 7.7%). Healthy and growing dividend payers will tend to have stock prices that rise over time, while paying dividends that are also increased over time. Given that stock profile, you might think it's smart to snap up the fattest dividend yields you can find -- perhaps focusing on the biggest dividend yields in the S&P 500. The disconnect between policymakers’ housing aspirations and market realities continues widening, with October’s housing starts and permits dropping to recession-level figures despite widespread calls for increased construction.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) stands against the other stocks featured in Jim Cramer's Lightning Round. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a market trend that's been generating impressive gains, especially when investors target heavily shorted stocks. He explained the phenomenon as he said that investors find success by betting that these companies are in better shape than short sellers expect. According to Cramer, this approach has led to some significant wins in recent times. He pointed out the behavior of short sellers, noting that when things go wrong for them, they panic. “The shorts always panic when their trades fall apart because, unlike longs, if you're a short seller, you can lose a lot more than a hundred percent of your investment if the stock goes up too much.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer on Nvidia Plus Other Stocks and Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 7 Stocks Cramer also highlighted that while short sellers can profit when a company fails, it’s a risky game with significant asymmetry. He explained that while a stock’s price can only fall to zero, it has the potential to rise indefinitely. Cramer cautioned that although short sellers might be hoping for a stock’s downfall, they are equally vulnerable to the nightmare scenario of infinite losses if the stock price continues to climb. In such situations, when short sellers run out of options, they are forced to buy back shares, which can send the stock price even higher. For shareholders, this scenario can be advantageous. While short sellers may be a threat when predicting a stock’s decline, their need to buy back shares can act like rocket fuel for the stock’s price when good news emerges. “If you're a shareholder, they're your worst enemy when they're talking about a stock going to zero. But once the stock starts soaring on any good news, the shorts are your best friend because their forced buying is like rocket fuel and they can't stop the propulsion while you just get to go along for the ride.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episodes of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Oil derricks in the background with a few workers in the foreground, emphasizing the company’s oil and gas production activities. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71 When Cramer was asked about Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), he questioned why Buffett was a buyer of the stock. “I think it's okay… it's Warren Buffett's oil. I don't know why he anointed this one, but he’s anointed it, he got a very good preferred deal. Look, Coterra is the way I like to do this thing… And by the way, they are not climate deniers, all right. Coterra is run by Tom Jorden. The stock is really on a tear lately because people realize the last acquisition… brought… a lot more oil so that the portfolio between oil and natural gas is much more balanced. It's a buy.” Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is involved in the acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and gas properties, as well as the production of chemicals and the transportation and marketing of oil, gas, and related products. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Berkshire Hathaway owned 255.28 million shares of the company worth $13.157 billion in the third quarter. For the third quarter, it posted earnings of $0.98 per diluted share, significantly surpassing analysts' expectations, largely due to its effective cost management practices. In terms of cash flow, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) generated $3.8 billion in operating cash flow for the third quarter. The company’s production during the period averaged 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), surpassing the midpoint of its production guidance by 22,000 BOE/d. Overall OXY ranks 1st on our list of the stocks featured in Jim Cramer's Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of OXY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than OXY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NYSE:GL), saying: “Well, it's kind of an interesting Medicare supplement insurance company… nothing wrong. It sells at eight times earnings. I'm gonna tell you it's fine, it's not exciting, it's not boring, it's just fine.” Globe Life (NYSE:GL) offers life and supplemental health insurance products, as well as annuities, to lower middle- and middle-income families in the United States through its various subsidiaries. On November 14, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.2400 per share. This dividend will be distributed to all holders of outstanding common stock as of the close of business on January 6, 2025, with payment scheduled for January 31, 2025. As of November 22, the stock’s yield was 0.87%. Matt Darden, Co-Chief Executive Officer recently highlighted the company’s consistent history of share repurchases, with approximately $10 billion of common stock bought back since the launch of its share repurchase program in 1986. On November 18, Globe Life (NYSE:GL) further announced an extension to its stock repurchase program, authorizing the buyback of up to $1.8 billion worth of common stock. This new authorization supersedes a previous approval of $1.3 billion that was made earlier in the year on April 29, 2024. Overall GL ranks 4th on our list of the stocks featured in Jim Cramer's Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of GL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) stands against the other stocks featured in Jim Cramer's Lightning Round. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a market trend that's been generating impressive gains, especially when investors target heavily shorted stocks. He explained the phenomenon as he said that investors find success by betting that these companies are in better shape than short sellers expect. According to Cramer, this approach has led to some significant wins in recent times. He pointed out the behavior of short sellers, noting that when things go wrong for them, they panic. “The shorts always panic when their trades fall apart because, unlike longs, if you're a short seller, you can lose a lot more than a hundred percent of your investment if the stock goes up too much.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer on Nvidia Plus Other Stocks and Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 7 Stocks Cramer also highlighted that while short sellers can profit when a company fails, it’s a risky game with significant asymmetry.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Talking about MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Cramer remarked: “I've gotta tell you, it's a Bitcoin play. I prefer to actually own Bitcoin. I know that Citron put some sort of short on it. All I can tell you is own Bitcoin. That's a winner.” MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) provides AI-powered enterprise analytics software and services. It is also known for its involvement in Bitcoin development. Recently, it faced a setback in its stock performance after Citron Research announced its decision to bet against the company. According to a post made by Citron on X, the company has transitioned into a Bitcoin investment fund, and its business operations are no longer closely tied to its software offerings. The post criticized the company's increasing focus on Bitcoin investment, stating that the company’s market volume had become detached from Bitcoin's underlying fundamentals. While Citron Research expressed continued confidence in Bitcoin's future, the firm revealed that it had hedged its position with a short position on the stock. On November 22, appearing on CNBC's 'Squawk Box', Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), described the company's approach to generating revenue by focusing on its role as a Bitcoin Treasury company. He explained that the company earns money by selling the volatility of Bitcoin and reinvesting the proceeds back into the cryptocurrency. He said that in addition, the company strips the volatility, risk, and performance from fixed-income securities, transferring those factors to common stocks. Saylor noted that critics who short the stock believe that if the premium on the equity disappears, the company won’t be able to make money. However, he argued that they overlook the strategy where, when borrowing money at 6% and investing it in Bitcoin, the company stands to gain significantly. For example, if Bitcoin appreciates by 30% or even 60%, MicroStrategy could realize a 90% spread on Bitcoin, compared to an 80% spread. Overall MSTR ranks 5th on our list of the stocks featured in Jim Cramer's Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of MSTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Ukrainian woman (50s) arrested for allegedly trespassing former State-provided accommodation

A Ukrainian woman in her 50s who was evicted from State-provided accommodation for failing to pay a daily contribution fee has been arrested and remanded in custody for allegedly trespassing her former accommodation. Tetiana Kiselova was evicted from her accommodation in Dublin city on November 15th after failing to pay the €10 fee before then seeking shelter at a site she had lived in prior, in Blackrock, Co Dublin. At Dún Laoghaire District Court last week, Ms Kiselova was charged with trespassing the building in such a manner that caused or was likely to cause fear in another person. She was remanded in custody until November 25th. Since March, social welfare payments for Ukrainians living in State-provided accommodation were cut from €232 per week to €38.80, with the Blackrock Community Alliance believing the cut has resulted in Ukrainians failing to pay the fee. Ms Kiselova received a letter from the Department of Integration on November 12th advising that access to her room would be revoked and her room reallocated as she refused to pay the fee. She was told she would not receive any further offers of accommodation and would have to make her own arrangements. A spokesman for the Department of Integration said those residing in serviced accommodation are informed that failure to pay is considered a refusal of emergency accommodation. “In relation to the case referred to, following non-payment, the individual was supported to engage with their local Intreo office for financial support if required and provided an additional three weeks in which to make payment,” a spokesman said. “Despite this, the individual refused to pay the contribution.” The mandatory daily contribution fee of €10 was introduced in 2022 for those fleeing the war in Ukraine and applies to serviced accommodation such as hotels and B&Bs where self-catering options are not available. The spokesman said the department does not collate data on the number of accommodation refusals linked to non-payment of the charge. As the accommodation site in Blackrock where Ms Kiselova was found trespassing is no longer under contract with the Department of Integration, it said it could not comment on events following her eviction. The building was under contract until it was ended in October as part of the consolidation of the accommodation portfolio for those fleeing the war in Ukraine. Last month, buses arrived to the property in Blackrock to take 29 Ukrainians to alternative accommodation. The majority of the group, who had been living in the building since arriving to Ireland in 2022, refused to board the buses despite being told they would not receive subsequent offers of accommodation. The 20 Ukrainians who refused to board the buses, including six children attending local schools, have been hosted at the property by the owners while they try to seek a solution, according to Blackrock Community Alliance. However, applications for the accommodation recognition payment were refused this week, while rent supplement applications have also been rejected by the Department of Social Protection. A letter issued to local representatives and general election candidates by Blackrock Community Alliance said: “The owners offered in September to host the group for two months until November 28th, allowing three months to get clarity from the departments on how the group of 20 can be accommodated. This arrangement expires next week. The group is seeking support from local representatives to find solutions to the crisis.” Jack White is a reporter for The Irish Times © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘Housing? I have to admit to being comfortable and it’s not affecting me’: Polarised views in south and west Dublin

As voters do their ‘big shop’ on the final Saturday before going to the polls, concerns in divergent parts of Dublin are notably different. The housing crisis is mentioned in both south county and west Dublin, but it and the cost of living preoccupy more minds in the latter. “Getting our own house is not on the cards at all,” says Anna Raymond outside the main supermarket on Neilstown Road. The area, comprised mainly of local authority housing, is classified by the independent agency Pobal, drawing on Census 2022 data, as “very disadvantaged”. Ms Raymond, shopping with her partner Sean Kearney and their baby Leopold, explains they live with his parents in a three-bedroom council house. “Sean’s brother just moved out so the baby is going to have his own bedroom. The cost of living is so much – food, going out, everything.” The working couple are concerned about “the rise” of the far-right. “We will be voting left anyway. We know Gino Kenny [TD, People Before Profit]. He has been really good in the community for years,” says Ms Raymond. “And Sinn Féin. Mark Ward all the way,” adds Mr Kearney, referring to one of the party’s two TDs and candidates in this Dublin Mid West constituency. Housing, the cost of living and immigration concern Paddy Reilly, a truck driver in his 60s. “It seems the Government are looking after immigrants instead of their own first. I am feeling it and seeing it. “I am on a tight budget. Socialising is out the window. You can’t go out, so you lose out on friends. That is lonely of course. The only time I go out is to go to work. The price of groceries is very high, very. “I would have been Sinn Féin but not now,” he continues. “I am voting for the Irish Freedom Party.” Referencing the party’s candidate, councillor Glen Moore, Mr Reilly says: “He’s speaking for the people. He’s good and people are voting for him.” Rob, in his 40s, did not want to give a surname. He has had to move back in with his parents. “It’s virtually impossible for anyone of my age to get on the housing ladder. I don’t want to live in shared accommodation with strangers. My vote won’t be for any of the big parties. I love Gino [Kenny]. I think he’s great.” For Jacqueline Smith too, housing is the number one issue. Her five sons, the oldest in his 40s, live with her in a three-bedroom council house. “It is stressful. They were born in the area and can’t live in it – can’t get anywhere to rent. The cost of living? Don’t even go there. I’ll vote Sinn Féin. I want to see a change.” Thirty kilometres away in a part of South Dublin classified by Pobal as “affluent”, shoppers in Blackrock shopping centre are concerned with wasteful public spending, a lack of long-term planning and taxes. “The local issue for me is the swimming pool in Stillorgan,” says Bernie Collins, retired insurance worker. “It’s closed ten years and nobody is doing anything about it. Housing? I have to admit to being comfortable and it’s not affecting me. It’s a pity people can’t get on the housing [ladder] but people have to get out and work, get off the dole. Money is handed out too handy, in my opinion.” Scott Graham and Ally Mulrooney, both 21, say “mainly housing” is deciding their votes. “I live at home but eventually I will need to move out,” says Mr Graham. His girlfriend is renting a room in a house near Croke Park for €800 a month. “We don’t even have a sittingroom,” she says. “I have looked at rents,” says Mr Graham. “I couldn’t afford to pay more than €1,000 and there’s nothing. I work part-time. I like the policies of the Social Democrats. I feel like they have a chance, I want a different tack to be taken. Sinn Féin? I think my parents would disown me if I voted for them.” A woman in her 60s who did not give her name said: “I’d like to see a party with a plan instead of smarties being given out in the budget. I’d like to see a vision and I don’t see that.” Brendan Nicholson, in his 60s, is “okay financially”. He wants to see more “strategic thinking” and less “giving away money to buy votes . . . It’s coming back to the time of Bertie [Ahern] when they thought they were flush [with stamp duty returns].” Young couple Ger and Roisín Cronin, expecting a baby, “luckily” own their home. “Across the board things are getting more expensive and there doesn’t seem to be much coming back,” says Mr Cronin. “We get taxed quite a lot, the USC is still there, and we don’t really see much in return.” Gavin O’Leary, from Rathcoole owns a marketing business. He “fortunately” has a house and a mortgage he can sustain. “Our children are young – won’t need housing for a while. I work really hard, don’t get days off, so we have enough. Traditionally we’d be a Fine Gael household,” he continues. A Fianna Fáil candidate who helped with speed bumps on his road, however, will get his vote on Friday.

Title: Ireland hockey star Hannah McLoughlin leaves home comforts behind as she bids to realise her potential in Belgium

Dubliner hopes to reach great heights with lessons from the low countries Hannah McLoughlin poses with Irish team-mates Ellen Curran (right) and Sarah Torrans (left) after Gantoise's won 4-1 win against Waterloo Ducks last week Hannah McLoughlin's spot in the dressing room. Hannah McLoughlin is a Davy ambassador. Davy is proud to support young Irish athletes. In her continuing quest to improve, Ireland international hockey star Hannah McLoughlin upped sticks and moved to the professional hockey outfit Gantoise in Ghent, Belgium this past August. Her decision came off the back of a loss in Olympic qualifiers against Spain in a penalty shoot-out. “I went to answer the question, ‘how good can I be?’” McLoughlin says. She knew the infrastructure was world-class in Belgium having introduced equal pay for male and female players two years ago, which would offer the step up her game required. A massive moment for the centre-back was getting her name on the back of the jersey. “The jersey is mine; it has my name on it. In Ireland, I would get a kit for the season and would be expected to return it if I moved club,” she says. “In Gantoise, I have a permanent locker in the female changing rooms with all my stuff in it and that will be there for the two years that I am contracted to play.” Has homesickness affected McLoughlin? “Well, I’ve never been on a J1 as I chose to play hockey during the summers. I was away for six weeks in Bali two years ago but am an only child and very close to my parents. “I think between my parents they have missed two games in the last 12 years. I thought moving would be tougher, but I am quite an independent person, and I love being in control of my day” she said. The Dubliner began playing when she was 12 years old and was earmarked as a natural talent. Now playing centre-back, her skill is clearly on show but matched in equal part by a quiet professionalism. Belgium made it to the semi-finals of the Olympics this year, losing to China and are currently ranked No 3 in the world. The professional league means McLoughlin’s time is no longer divided between work and sport. After studying economics and finance in UCD she went straight on to the Davy internship and got a flexible working agreement. The centre-back noted balancing work and sport is a challenge Irish players face: “it’s hard to approach an employer when you are playing professionally”. For a 24-year-old it’s daunting to move country but the gains proved too tantalising. Club facilities at Gantoise include meeting rooms, performance rehabilitation on site and a water-based pitch (an international-standard pitch, most pitches in Ireland are not water-based). Hannah McLoughlin's spot in the dressing room. Her new club Gantoise have won the past four league titles, so expectations and standards are high. Part of moving country is acclimatising to the culture you land in, and in this regard the Belgians are very different. According to McLoughlin, “relative to Ireland they are a lot more laid-back”. The young hockey star says they express their feelings in a different manner. “They are incredibly direct, but there is no bad feeling about it.” In Ireland, there is a sense of, “God, if I give feedback to a fellow player, they will get upset with me”, she says. In her new club, McLoughlin is expected to speak up if she has an issue, to hold it in is seen as a negative. A new culture, location and team-mates also has its challenges. She moved in August and says: “I’ve settled in really well”. It is a one hour, 15-minute flight from her local airport to Dublin and having six Irish players on the team has made the transition easier. “The club set me up with a car, accommodation support and a salary, so I can focus solely on the game”. Adjusting to a fully professional set-up may be daunting in terms of workload but increased specialisation has advantages. “I do three trainings a week, one extra technical session, two strength sessions, a video session and maybe one individual mobility session,” she adds. Hannah McLoughlin is a Davy ambassador. Davy is proud to support young Irish athletes. The Blackrock native says that being fully pro means you can be more focused. “I have a lot more time to cook so my nutrition is a lot better.” Being on the pitch with world-class players means intense focus on the finer details, one of which is nutrition. “I am still in contact with the Sport Ireland nutritionist, and I have a lot more time to cook from scratch. In Ireland, I used to meal prep a lot more. When asked where she wants to be in five years, McLoughlin says: “I have been to a World Cup, an Olympics and I play week in, week out with some of the world’s best players. I just want to get better, faster, as these are absolutely necessary when I am called back for international duties.” McLoughlin’s overall sense of Belgians is: “people back their strengths a lot more here. In something as simple as fashion, no two people are wearing the same thing, they [Belgians]are less concerned with how they are being perceived”. Gantoise’s newest signing gives a window into how she spends her downtime. “I would often go out for meals on my own, read a book, I’m less self-conscious here about ‘are people looking at me?’ than in Ireland.” McLoughlin’s goal is clear to build skills and bring them back to the Irish team. She is contracted for Gantoise for the next two years, like Irish football players of old seeking tougher competition in the Premier League. Steel sharpens steel and no doubt this move will enrich Ireland’s hockey future.

The world’s largest digital asset is trading just below $98,000 after falling to a three-day low of $95,800, according to CoinGecko data. The dip sent long liquidations soaring to an 11-day high above $344 million while shorts coughed up around 136 million, CoinGlass data shows. Analysts expect much of the same witnessed over the last two weeks, with demand from retail and institutional investors likely unaffected by intraday swings. “As we continue to see strong demand for Bitcoin alongside further easing of monetary policy by global central banks, prices are likely to remain supported as we approach the end of the year,” QCP Capital wrote in a note last week. Investor sentiment continues to be bolstered by favorable tailwinds stemming from the incoming Donald Trump administration, with the President-elect having vowed to drive a crypto agenda. Wall Street’s top cop, the Securities and Exchange Commission, will also have a change of guard following Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Chair Gary Gensler announced his decision to resign from the post last week after years of backlash from the crypto community for what they termed as a heavy-handed approach to regulation through litigation. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to fire Gensler if elected to the Whitehouse, much to the applaud of a packed crowd during the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville in July. Now, Trump will get to choose a new agency head, which has spurned speculation of an industry-favorable pick, perceived by many to take a lighter touch on digital assets. That optimism has spread to other assets, including XRP, which lept to a three-year high at $1.59 on Friday as speculation grew that the SEC would withdraw its case against the asset's steward, Ripple Labs. There’s also soaring demand for U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, particularly from BlackRock, which continues to top the list among 11 other rivals in inflows and trading volume. Options trading on some of those products are also helping to drive price volatility, analysts previously told Decrypt, with much of the activity focused on further upside in coming months.

Title: Bitcoin’s rally stalls after nearing the historic $100k level

(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin steadied after a rally toward $100,000 fizzled just shy of the historic level, as traders assess whether optimism stemming from President-elect Donald Trump’s support for crypto is becoming stretched. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge Record NYC Thanksgiving Travel Signals Airport, Traffic Mess Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. The digital asset fell as low as $96,580 on Monday after coming within $300 of the six-figure milestone on Friday. It was changes hands at around $97,000 as of 9:44 a.m. Monday in New York, as Trump’s pick of hedge fund executive Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary helped sentiment in global markets. Investors are worried Bitcoin “will have to take a breather now that it has basically tested the $100,000 level,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, adding that bullishness around Bitcoin “is getting extreme.” Trump’s incoming US administration is viewed as a crypto tailwind across Wall Street and beyond. The overall value of the digital-asset market has surged about $1 trillion since the Republican’s victory on Nov. 5. Trump’s Agenda Trump has promised friendlier regulations and pledged to set up a national Bitcoin stockpile, though the timeline for implementation and the feasibility of the Bitcoin reserve remain open questions. “I’m seeing an increasing skew to the sell side as we near the $100,000 mark,” said David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime broker FalconX. “This suggests we may experience consolidation around this level in the near term before a sustained breakthrough above it.” Traders had seized on the US crypto outlook to push Bitcoin to the verge of $100,000, a symbolic level that for crypto supporters repudiates skeptics who see little intrinsic value in digital assets. Cantor Talks The latest developments included a Bloomberg News report that Cantor Fitzgerald LP is in talks with Tether Holdings Ltd. about receiving support from the stablecoin issuer for Cantor’s planned lending program for clients who put up Bitcoin as collateral. Cantor’s Chief Executive Officer Howard Lutnick is co-chair of Trump’s transition team and the president-elect’s pick to run the Commerce Department. The transition team has also held discussions over whether to create the first-ever White House post dedicated to digital-asset policy. Cash has poured into US exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin since Trump’s win, and the products have now amassed $107 billion in assets. “Bitcoin was extremely overbought since the election, it was bound to stall out,” said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive officer at crypto investment firm FRNT Financial Inc. “That said, this is barely a pullback, we’re just back at levels from mid-last week.” --With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla.

Title: State Based Bitcoin Reserves Could Help Drive Pro-Crypto Policies Forward

LONDON, ENGLAND - OCTOBER 23: A visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin on ... [+] October 23, 2017 in London, England. Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Lightcoin have seen unprecedented growth in 2017, despite remaining extremely volatile. While digital currencies across the board have divided opinion between financial institutions, and now have a market cap of around 175 Billion USD, the crypto sector coninues to grow, as it sees wider mainstreem adoption. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) Corporate buyers and headlines aside, state-based bitcoin acquisitions could play a critical role in the bitcoin market going forward. As bitcoin continues to flirt with the $100,000 level, the discussion and interest in bitcoin and other cryptoassets continues to increase. Building on the momentum built during the campaign of now President-Elect Trump, the buzz around the possibility of positive changes at the federal level for the bitcoin industry has continued to build both on social media and in policy circles. Specifically politicians such as Senator Lummis have continued to advocate for federal legislation that would – in addition to other actions – enable the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve. In addition to policymakers continuing to discuss these issues, the financial market media has also been covering the idea, with media segments focusing on the potential for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund to purchase bitcoin as its primary asset. On top of these developments the TradFi investment into crypto continues to accelerate. Specifical examples include the approval of spot ETF options issued by Blackrock, following the accelerant provided to adoption and prices following the approval of the spot ETFs in January 2024. With these ETFs attracting nearly $34 billion in assets since launch, surpassing gold, these are not an asset class that can be ignored. Additionally, Microstrategy announced a $1.75 billion bond issuance to purchase more bitcoin (maturing in 2029), while using proceeds from a share sale to purchase $4 billion of bitcoin. All of these activities and fund flows are reason for optimism, but another trend could both send prices higher as well as increasing the legitimacy of the asset for more mainstream investment. Let’s take a look at how the possibility of a state-based bitcoin reserve fund might play an outsized role in the bitcoin market as 2025 approaches. Perhaps the most obvious effect of the positive momentum and conversations (at both the state and federal level) will be the positive effect on the price of bitcoin, and potentially other cryptoassets more broadly. In 2024 alone the price of bitcoin has jumped from approximately $43,000 from the beginning of January to the almost $100,000 level in November, reflecting both the increased buying powered by institutional acquisition as well as the positive sentiment in the space at large. If either the U.S. federal government or state governments begin purchasing bitcoin at any significant level this will only serve to push the price higher. This development is celebratory for investors and long-term holders of bitcoin, to be sure, but also solidifies another reality of the crypto space. Bitcoin increasingly does not, despite the original intent of the cryptocurrency, appear to be forming into the currency of the future in the near to medium term. Especially since the conversation around bitcoin continues to focus on its value as an investment, hedge against inflation, or as a strategic reserve tool, the likelihood of its adoption for currency purposes continues to decrease. Price increases might be celebrated, but increasingly shifts bitcoin to an asset class versus a currency option. The pressure that is being brought to bear at the federal level to construct a pro-crypto regulatory regime, including the establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve, cannot be underestimated as the Trump regime prepares to return to Washington. The crypto sector spent approximately $200 million on the most recent election cycle, and with over 200 members of Congress having received funding and support from these lobbyists the likelihood of a pro-crypto Congress is relatively high. In addition to this President-Elect Trump, while on the campaign trail, made substantial overtures and promises to the industry to support and foster innovation and growth in the United States. While individuals such as Senator Lummis continuing to pursue policy objectives such as The BITCOIN Act, which would facilitate the creation of a reserve, and discussion of a strategic bitcoin reserve continuing to grow; advisors and policy wonks would be well served to watch these conversations as they develop. Positive momentum aside, politicizing crypto – which establishing a strategic reserve at the federal level would – also opens the door to crypto being yet another political football for policymakers to debate over moving forward. This could include tweaks and changes to the tax code that become subject to the whims of the executive branch, versus IRS section updates. While the likelihood of federal action might seem virtually guaranteed to crypto proponents the reality is that the crypto sector and investing community still remains small versus TradFi markets. This is both an acknowledgement of the still emerging and developing status of crypto markets and assets, as well as providing an insight into opportunities at the state level for crypto policy leadership. For example, Wyoming is in the midst of minting and issuing the first state-backed stable token in the form WYST. When viewed in conjunction with efforts underway in states like Pennsylvania to create strategic bitcoin reserves on the state level, it looks increasingly likely that crypto policy leadership might emerge from the states alongside – or perhaps before – policy at the federal level.

Posted on 11/24/2024 12:30:04 PM PST by McGruff The Kremlin is allegedly ready to discuss a ceasefire, Reuters reports, citing current and former representatives of the Russian government. According to a secret document of the Russian MOD, the Kremlin intends to divide Ukraine into three parts. 🔺The East of the country (Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson regions), as well as Crimea, should go to Russia. 🔺The second large part of the country (including the regions of Kiev, Sumy and Odessa) is planned to be turned into a "pro-Russian state entity." The power structures in this zone will be staffed with pro-Russian personnel, and Russian troops will be stationed on its territory to provide security. This means that "Ukraine will turn into a puppet state controlled from Moscow." 🔺The rest of the western part of Ukraine is called “disputed territories” in the document. What to do with them is supposed to be decided in the course of negotiations between Russia and neighboring countries — Hungary, Poland and Romania. (Excerpt) Read more at x.com ...

Title: GE Vernova (GEV) Rated Overweight: Meeting AI’s Massive Energy Demands

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates You Can’t Miss This Weekend. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against other AI news updates you can’t miss this weekend. The race to get ahead in artificial intelligence is compelling companies to intensify their efforts each day. In latest news, ChatGPT creator OpenAI has been considering developing its own web browser, according to a report by The Information. The report reveals that the company has spoken about the product with websites such as Redfin, Conde Nast, Priceline, and Eventbrite. Having already entered the market with SearchGPT, the move would be placing OpenAI head-to-head with Google, the company that holds the major share of the browser and search market. READ ALSO: 10 AI News Stories You Can’t Miss and 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now However, the company isn’t just delving into search and browsers. According to Tech Crunch, OpenAI is also researching algorithms that can predict human being’s moral judgments. OpenAI gave a grant to Duke University researchers for a project called “Research AI Morality.” When asked for more details, an OpenAI spokesperson referred to a press release stating that the grant is part of a larger $1 million, three-year funding effort for Duke Professors working on creating “moral AI.” As per the press release, the OpenAI-funded project aims to develop algorithms capable of “predicting human moral judgments” when moral conflicts arise in fields like medicine, law, and business. However, it isn’t clear yet whether such kind of an achievement is possible with the current levels of technology. In other news, AI firm Anthropic is getting another funding boost. Amazon is increasing its investment in Anthropic to $8 billion, strengthening its partnership in artificial intelligence, the companies announced Friday, the 22nd. “We’ll keep pushing the boundaries of what customers can achieve with generative AI technologies.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). lassedesignen/Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is a global energy company and a soaring AI stock driven by the demand for energy to power artificial intelligence technology. On November 21, Wells Fargo analyst Michael Blum initiated coverage of the power-generation technology company with an “Overweight” rating and a $385 price target. This is the second-highest price target listed by FactSet, as reported by Barrons. According to Blum, GE Vernova can help meet the massive energy demands from artificial intelligence through its power generation and grid products. Blum further states that GE Vernova’s transformers, HVDC, and grid software offerings are well-positioned to benefit from growing power demand. “As power demand grows and more distributed generation is added to the mix, aging grids will require significant investment to manage the increasingly complex and dynamic environment,” Blum said. “GEV’s transformers, HVDC [High-voltage direct current], and grid software offerings are well positioned to benefit from this growing demand”. Overall, GEV ranks 2nd on our list of AI news updates you can’t miss this weekend. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

It’s all about diving headfirst into the meme culture. During the months of April and May 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge in value, achieving a remarkable market capitalization of $1.6 billion. Initial investors saw their fortunes skyrocket in an instant, sparking a fervent community that rallied around the project. This surge ignited a “memecoin season,” leading to numerous new meme-based coins undergoing dramatic price fluctuations. With its promising potential, PEPE is set to compete with the leading meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. The straightforward strategy and clear roadmap resonate with a wide audience. The strategy encompasses securing listings on prominent exchanges and launching a “meme takeover.” As the market buzzes with anticipation for the upcoming Bitcoin halving and the potential for a bullish surge, PEPE is poised to capture the spotlight. Despite its limited utility compared to other cryptocurrencies, the robust community backing it and its viral appeal could ensure it remains a focal point in the digital landscape. Only time will reveal whether PEPE will soar to new peaks or if the excitement will dwindle. Envision a realm where you wield total authority over your data.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are leaders of digital innovation that have created massive shareholder wealth over the past decade. Through distinct strategies and different areas of market focus, the core business for both tech giants is centered on online advertising. Let's discuss whether Alphabet or Meta Platforms is the better buy right now. The Observer made a profit of more than £3m last year, according to internal figures which raise questions over claims it must be offloaded to protect The Guardian. After flying high during the first half of the year, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has lost some momentum; the company's shares are down by 11% since June 1. Millennium Management's stake in Eli Lilly increased by 86% in the third quarter. Should you follow Englander's lead and increase your stake (or initiate a position) in Eli Lilly? The market rally is hot, but keep a cool head. Nvidia is the giant, but Astera Labs is the new AI chip leader. The hedge fund manager takes a piece of a popular consumer brand. Broadcom isn't the only way to tap the AI revolution. Both represent great long-term opportunities for buy-and-hold investors. Microsoft and Broadcom are more stable long-term AI plays. On the surface, Boeing (NYSE: BA) looks as though it has all the ingredients of a potential millionaire-maker investment. The aircraft market is growing, competition is minimal, and government contracts are plentiful. The phrase "economic moat" -- popularized by investing legend Warren Buffett -- refers to certain types of durable competitive advantages a company can possess that make it difficult for potential rivals to make inroads against it.

Title: Morgan Stanley joins US peers putting Mideast HQ in Riyadh

Morgan Stanley got regulatory approval to locate its Middle East headquarters in Saudi Arabia, joining Wall Street rivals including Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in expanding their presence in the kingdom. “Establishing a regional HQ in Riyadh reflects the growth and development of Saudi Arabia and is a natural progression of our long history in the region,” said Abdulaziz Alajaji, the chief executive officer for Saudi Arabia and the bank’s co-head of the Middle East and North Africa region said in a statement on Sunday. Under new rules that came into force this year, firms must have a regional base in Saudi Arabia with at least 15 employees, including executives overseeing other countries, or risk losing business with the kingdom’s vast network of government entities. The move is part of a plan by the Saudi government to cut down on what it calls “economic leakage,” a term it uses for state spending that can benefit firms in neighboring business hubs, most prominently Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Morgan Stanley has been present in Saudi Arabia since 2007, when it set up an equity trading business in Riyadh, and became one of the first international asset managers to launch a Saudi equity fund two years later. CEO Ted Pick was among a host of executives and investors to speak at Saudi Arabia’s flagship Future Investment Initiative last month. In recent months, BlackRock Inc. and Lazard Inc. have joined the ranks of firms granted HQ licenses in the kingdom, while State Street Corp has said it will apply for one. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Why photographers should understand bitcoin

Time Published: 2024-11-24T14:36:51Z

Do you remember Kodak brownies and the light? Obviously digital photograph absolutely crushed Kodak, even though ironically Kodak I think made the first digital camera? Also, the very foolish and shortsighted thing that conducted; she almost self sabotage herself by kind of trying to kill off her own digital camera, concerned that we would eat into the profits of her film business. A similar insight; Steve Jobs, upon unleashing the iPhone, obviously he knew that it was going to eat into the iPod iPod touch market, but obviously it was the right step forward. This is a book that apparently Steve Jobs recommended everyone to read. The general idea is that the paradox and difficulty that innovator’s face is that in order to innovate something new, you kind of need to kill your own business, even have the courage to self cannibalize if necessary. So for example, I think Ford has done a decent job at this semi trying to get into the electric car market, instead of just hoarding her gas guzzler cars. But the difficulty of a Ford or any other car company is that because they did not start off 100% carte blanche electric, they’re never going to catch up to Tesla, Do you remember in the early days of Tesla, in which the evaluation was far greater than that of any major car company and everyone thought that it was insanely overvalued? Who is laughing now? So a book that nobody knows about is the mobile wave by Michael Saylor; in which he accurately predicts that mobile phones, mobile technology, all the big magnificent seven companies to take over the world. He predicted the success of Amazon Facebook Twitter Google and Apple before anyone really took notice. In fact I recommend everyone to read them all way, because it shows the inside that Michael Saylor is not new to the game; he’s been in the game for a long time, over 30 years. Apparently he has seen his stock drop to an ALL TIME LOW of $.20, And now it is currently in the mid 400s. So I guess I was right all along about bitcoin, ever since I bought like 2.2 bitcoins or 2.4 bitcoins for about 20,000 or $25,000, back in 2018 when bitcoin was only around $6000-$7000 a coin. ￼ sing that we’re about to have the hundred K party, I’ve almost I guess like 12 or 13 X ‘d my initial prediction? Anyways, if you’re right about bitcoin and was right about bitcoin… And no no no bitcoin is not gonna drop down to like 60,000 or 30,000, that does not how engineering works. For people who think that bitcoin is risky, ask people… Is it risky to cross the bridge or go on a flight? No. Why? Things were engineered that way! With bitcoin, you’re not gonna have all these people who you’re trying to proselytize turn around and tell you that you were right, and shower you with good news. No no no, they might either feel low-key envious or jealous of you, and won’t probably really say much. This is also why I don’t really tell people about bitcoin too much if they don’t seem like they have a strong need for it; for example my uncle who’s worked in the jewelry business for like over 30 years, he wants to retire, and I’m kind of in the process of helping him Sell his gold and his other reserves and stuff, in order to buy bitcoin. Even he at the age of 64, being a gold jeweler for like over 30 years know that bitcoin is the future. But his issues that he cannot stomach the volatility, he says it is like drugs, “mah-yyak”– when I was with him last I just set him up with Coinbase, and just bought the daily maximum for his account which was $3500, I think we bought windows around $65,000 a coin, and already it’s like $99,000 a coin. But once again, I think the difficult thing with bitcoin is that like is probably the most addictive crack cocaine on the planet, because it is being traded 24 7, it is extremely volatile because volatility is vitality. Anything that is allowed to trade every single waking moment, on weekends as well as the evenings, and also bank holidays, is going to have more volatility because people are just bored at home, they cannot play the traditional market so they’re going to just try to buy and sell bitcoin, do some sort of weird options trading to try to squeeze a few bucks here and there.￼ I was randomly think about Peter Thiel and his zero to one book; I think if you thought about bitcoin like a year or two ago, you might’ve seen that are artificial intelligence in AI was the right bet. But no, it is most certainly bitcoin. Why? Assuming that the world runs on money, and bitcoin is perfect money, it is like maybe 80 to 90% the solution to the problems of humanity. For example, what are the greatest bad things that happened to humans? It mostly has to deal with financial distress. I almost wonder people who get addicted to gambling, drugs, cycles of poverty is because the money right now the fiat currency is toxic. You cannot blame somebody for remaining sick if they only have a sewer water to drink, and they have kids and are also forced to feed their kids sewer water. It doesn’t matter how smart hard-working or intelligent you are, as long as you’re drinking sore water, you’re going to perpetually be sick, throwing up, permanently infected with cholera. So you know you have all these Crusades on the Internet and charity is talking about providing clean water to like poor kids in Africa? I think the same thing with bitcoin– it is like the chance to give clean water to 8 billion people on the planet. Except instead of water, it is clean money. Nontoxic money. It matters if you’re at church a nonprofit a charity, mother Teresa Gandhi etc. Matters if you’re at school, a parent organization, if you have kids you’re single own a dog whatever. Ultimately you’re going to have to pay the rent, pay your mortgage, or pay property taxes. I don’t think there is anyone spot on the planet in which you cannot live or survive without money a banking account or Notes. Even all these weirdos who try to buy a $200,000 AMG sprinter van and live off the grid with star Link or whatever, you still need money, and sooner or later you’re going to have to need some sort of semi permanent address, ideally your mom‘s house or your wife’s family‘s house or something. Because for the most part if you’re American, at this point you cannot really survive without having a single address for doing taxes and stuff. And I also think that now, unfortunately you also need a cell phone number, or else you cannot even apply for basic stuff, because you’re going to have to get the one time password authentication code codes texted to your phone. Anyways, it’s gonna be a big deal once Apple integrate bitcoin into her iCloud ecosystem. This is actually a very very big opportunity for Apple; the head of security, on the planet and privacy… If Apple were able to provide security to your bitcoin or your keys or whatever, Wooden apple being in some way is the best custodian? Even better yet… We already have our bank of counseling to Apple Pay. Wouldn’t it just makes sense for you to buy bitcoin directly on an iPhone using Apple Pay, and store it on your iPhone and or iCloud Apple ID account? For people who don’t trust the cloud I get it, but still… For all practical purposes I think the cloud is like 1 trillion times safer than cold storage options. For example even me, all my photos are backed up to dropbox, Google Drive and Apple photos. Even worst case scenario all my photos get deleted, it’s OK I could start again! I think especially with Apple Apple ID Face ID touch print thumb ID, it’s almost the most logical way to feel secure with your bitcoin. Larry Fink, CEO Blackrock, even Michael Saylor. ￼ even Donald Trump!￼ When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: Kraft Heinz (KHC): Navigating Challenges and Strategic Shifts in Warren Buffett’s Portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Warren Buffett’s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) stands against other Warren Buffett’s longest-held stocks. Warren Buffett has cemented his legacy as Wall Street’s most successful investor. During the high-flying stock market of the 1960s, he leveraged his investment partnership to acquire Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling New England textile company at the time. Today, the firm is a vastly different entity, boasting a diverse range of businesses from Geico insurance to BNSF Railway, an equity portfolio exceeding $266 billion, and an enormous cash reserve of $325.2 billion. Decades of strong returns have built Buffett’s unmatched track record. Since he took over in 1965, the company’s shares have delivered an annualized gain of 19.8%. Buffett has famously stated that his ideal holding period for a stock is “forever”. True to his word, the Oracle of Omaha has held onto some of his favorite stocks for the long haul, allowing them to deliver steady share performance and generate passive income for his portfolio over time. Moreover, market analysts and investors alike have consistently praised Buffett’s disciplined, long-term approach to investing, more so now that his firm has become the latest non-tech firm to surpass a $1 trillion market cap, highlighting Buffett’s stock-picking abilities. However, despite strong market performance through much of 2024, Buffett seems to have adopted a more defensive stance. Concerned about inflated valuations amid high interest rates and worsening economic conditions, he has offloaded significant holdings in companies whose valuations have surged too high. Billionaire investor David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital echoed this in his hedge fund’s quarterly letter, noting Buffett’s cautious approach: “One could argue that sitting out bear markets has been the underappreciated reason for his outstanding long-term returns. It is therefore noteworthy to observe that Mr. Buffett is again selling large swaths of his stock portfolio and building enormous cash reserves.” Over the past two years, Buffett has been an active net seller of stocks. His firm offloaded a total of $36.1 billion in stocks during the third quarter, marking the eighth consecutive quarter in which Berkshire was a net seller of equities. At the company’s annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett mentioned the possibility of a future rise in the corporate tax rate. Moreover, in his 2023 letter, Buffett also addresses common questions about Berkshire, including whether the company can continue to achieve the same level of outperformance as in the past: “There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can’t. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance. Nevertheless, managing Berkshire is mostly fun and always interesting. On the positive side, after 59 years of assemblage, the company now owns either a portion or 100% of various businesses that, on a weighted basis, have somewhat better prospects than exist at most large American companies.” Our Methodology To create our list of Warren Buffett’s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A closeup of an assembly line worker inspecting a newly produced jar of condiments and sauces. Warren Buffett’s First Major Purchase: 2015 Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Q3 2024: $11.43 billion The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), a global food and beverage leader formed by the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and Heinz, produces a wide range of products including condiments, dairy, meat, beverages, and other grocery items. On October 25, Stifel analysts downgraded The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) from Buy to Hold, pointing to sluggish volume recovery and increased reinvestment needs. Stifel also voiced caution about the overall food sector, keeping a Neutral weighting despite food stocks trading at a significant 30% discount to the S&P 500, putting the sector in the 6th relative percentile. Additionally, in its Q3 2024 earnings report, The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) revealed a larger-than-expected quarterly revenue decline, with net sales down 2.8% to $6.38 billion. The company also revised its 2024 earnings per share outlook to the lower end of its prior $3.01–$3.07 range. A Deutsche Bank report indicates that The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) may need to make deeper capability improvements to achieve its long-term financial goals, underscoring the challenges and operational complexities the company faces on its growth path. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) has also strategically sold off its underperforming brands to raise capital, acquired brands with stronger growth potential, and strengthened its traditional brands through product innovation and marketing efforts. This approach also helped the company navigate inflationary pressures in 2022 and 2023 by gradually increasing its prices. Overall, KHC ranks 8th on our list of Warren Buffett’s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of KHC, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KHC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Walmart (NYSE: WMT), the world's biggest retailer and the largest company in the world by revenue, has quietly blown away the rest of the retail sector in recent years as its commitment to omnichannel sales and reputation for everyday low prices have delivered steady growth.

Let's explore whether or not the company can overcome its near-term accounting challenges to unlock explosive shareholder value.

Moreover, in his 2023 letter, Buffett also addresses common questions about Berkshire, including whether the company can continue to achieve the same level of outperformance as in the past: “There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can’t. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance. Nevertheless, managing Berkshire is mostly fun and always interesting. On the positive side, after 59 years of assemblage, the company now owns either a portion or 100% of various businesses that, on a weighted basis, have somewhat better prospects than exist at most large American companies.” Our Methodology To create our list of Warren Buffett’s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:VRSN), based in Reston, Virginia, is a global provider of network infrastructure and domain name registry services, acting as the exclusive registry for the .com and .net domains. It also serves as one of the tech-sector stocks in Warren Buffett’s diversified portfolio. In its Q3 2024 earnings call, VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) reported a 3.8% year-over-year revenue increase to $391 million. Despite this growth, the company saw a dip in its total domain name base and forecasted lower renewal rates. On the other hand, earnings per share rose by 13.1% to $2.07, and the company announced plans to launch new marketing programs aimed at boosting growth in its domain name base. VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is also in discussions with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) about .com domain pricing and the overall ecosystem health, while preparing for the renewal of the .com registry and the introduction of the new Top-Level Domain (TLD) .web. Baron Asset Fund stated the following regarding VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN), a global provider of internet infrastructure and domain name registry services, manages the .com and .net domains. Shares of VeriSign declined because of continued weakness in new domain registrations, stemming largely from weaker demand in China. We believe that VeriSign maintains an exceptional competitive position and the contractual ability to raise prices. Longer term, we are encouraged by VeriSign’s opportunity to win the rights to administer the “.web” domain, produce substantial free cash flow, and generate attractive capital returns as it continues to prioritize share buybacks. Overall, VRSN ranks 7th on our list of Warren Buffett’s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of VRSN, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VRSN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks on the list. With the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least. Naturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled ‘Global Strategy Paper No. 71, the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This ‘concentration’ refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. Since the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street’s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company, and the world’s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns. As per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index “by an annualized 200 bp-800 bp” over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today’s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang’s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade. GS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market’s performance of the two indexes before the bubble’s ‘pop’ to point out that “the trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).” This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall “has been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.” Linking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this “extreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.” Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then “this would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.” While stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk’s car company record stunning gains. Goldman’s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that “the biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.” He shared that “any sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.” These include “energy, traditional energy versus renewables” with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%. Tuteja added that “the resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election” was a standout from the market’s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that “what I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.” This is because “it takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.” According to him, in 2016, “regional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.” Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that “under the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime’s policies.” For some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Within this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024’s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings “growth alone can explain 40% of next quarter’s cash spending growth.” Just like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the “typical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.” Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects “cash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,” but cautions that “the potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ top growth investment stocks, we used the bank’s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm’s cash flow from operations. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A financial analyst in their office, monitoring the daily performance of the stock market. Growth Investment Ratio: 92% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor designer that designs and sells CPUs and GPUs. Its products are used by consumers and businesses. In today’s AI era, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the few companies capable of offering both CPUs and GPUs for AI computing. This places it well to capitalize on any cost constraints that NVIDIA’s GPU customers might face or for firms looking to switch away from Intel’s CPUs. Yet, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s limited resources also mean that the firm struggles to compete at scale with its larger rivals. As a result, it is the perpetual underdog in an industry where high volumes often determine brand and pricing power. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s third-quarter results led to the firm’s Gaming business seeing a strong 90%+ operating income drop, and soon afterward, the firm announced that it would lay off 4% of its workforce. Sustained revenue from AI customers is key to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s hypothesis. During the Q3 2024 earnings call, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s management commented on its AI business: “Turning to our Data Center AI business, Data Center GPU revenue ramped as MI300X adoption expanded with cloud, OEM and AI customers. Microsoft and Meta expanded their use of MI 300X accelerators to power their internal workloads in the quarter. Microsoft is now using MI 300X broadly for multiple co-pilot services powered by the family of GPT 4 models. Overall, AMD ranks 22nd on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. Data centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe’s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 21, Mizuho raised the price target on the stock to $175 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after the company reported a strong October-end quarter sales result of $35.1 billion and guided January-end quarter revenue to $37.5 billion, which the advisory notes was in line with consensus at $37 billion, but below buy-side estimates of $39 billion-plus. The advisory, which says Nvidia remains a Mizuho 2024 Top Pick and is leading the AI accelerator market, recommends investors buy the pullback. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
