Semiconductor startup Groq was once so close to going broke that the CEO took inspiration from the US's fundraising during World War II. Jonathan Ross, who founded the company in 2016 with a group of former Google engineers, said that it took seven years to find a product that would sell. When a cash crunch approached, the CEO told his employees, "'We're going to run out of money. We need you to trade salary for equity,'" Ross said in an episode of The Twenty Minute VC podcast uploaded on Monday. He likened the ask to World War II bonds, through which governments asked citizens to help finance their military efforts amid a depressed economy. "We literally took pictures of the war bonds and we put Groq Bonds on it instead," he said. Ross said it was an "intense" decision because people who had left their careers elsewhere and had families were banking on him. He said that they were worried everyone would leave — but 80% of employees participated. The cash compensation reduction helped Groq stay afloat before the startup raised the first portion of a $300 million fundraising round. In 2021, the AI hardware and software company closed a $300 million funding round, co-led by Tiger Global Management and D1 Capital. Last week, Groq inked a deal for $1.5 billion from Saudi Arabia to expand delivery of its advanced AI chips to the Middle Eastern country. In August, the company was valued at $2.8 billion after it raised $640 million from a round led by BlackRock, Cisco Investments, and Samsung Catalyst Fund. Paying employees partially in equity instead of all cash is common for both public and private tech companies. These shares encourage employee retention and serve as a performance incentive. Employees often trade higher cash compensation at established companies for lower cash and equity options at a startup, betting the equity could soar. Early-stage startups sometimes temporarily reduce cash compensation in favor of equity in the company when they are in danger of running out of money. Grok's CEO is one of the few business leaders who has been public about the decision. "If you lean towards that vulnerability, people are often going to go with you," Ross said on Monday about his employees sticking with Groq. Some of the world's largest startups, including OpenAI, Stripe, and SpaceX, have allowed employees to sell their shares through tender offers, letting them cash out even though the company opts to stay private or does not want to be acquired. A tender offer gives employees of private companies a chance to sell a certain number of shares at a fixed price during a limited timeframe. Correction: February 19, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misspelled Groq's name in the eighth paragraph. Jump to

Title: Who Is Driving the Global Privatization of Domestic Infrastructure?

Yves here. I have retitled the post by John Ruehl because I regard the original title, which reflects the positioning of the piece to be misleading. Ruehl, playing on xenophobia, had declared: Foreign Companies Are Driving the Global Privatization of Domestic Infrastructure. In reality, this is pure and simple class warfare. Here, capitalists, mainly in the form of big fund managers and their investors, profit at the expense of the broader citizenry. A popular vote on these matters (with accurate briefs) would almost certainly lead to rejection of the economic proposal, “Sell the family china and rent it back at inflated prices.” Admittedly, Sydney-based Macquarie Bank was a pioneer and early leader in infrastructure finance, which grew out of its expertise in project finance, particularly big mining deals. Macquarie’s initial move to the pole position reflected the fact that infrastructure deals were technically difficult due to the many moving parts and there were less taxing ways in investment banking to make similar amounts of money (another way the pattern of big dogs pursuing easy money is that complex products like mortgage securitizations had disproportionate female representation at high levels of the industry). But as you can see, half of the biggest infrastructure funds are American, including the biggest, a BlackRock entity.,US concerns also represent more than half the funds raised in this top echelon. From Infrastructure Investor 100: Ruehl starts by showcasing the infamous sale of Chicago’s parking meters, a deal we lambasted in detail close to when it was first inked. Ruehl goes though hoops to depict the city as abused by furrniers because it was largely foreign investors who picked up the equity in the deal…after Morgan Stanley, who structured the original deal, defaulted. Ruehl does not understand or acknowledge that the continued extraction from Chicago results from the original, one-sided terms Morgan Stanley got the clueless city to agree to. This blaming foreigners for the very successful and durable predation by Morgan Stanley is seriously off base. Similarly, Ruehl points to the fact that the US is the major market for sale of government owned assets. The US runs chronic trade deficits. That means we import capital. We do that via sales of securities and other assets. If the US was not running such large and persistent trade deficits, we’d have a lot less in the way of this property-hawking (not that we are fans of the Trump tariffs, but indifference to our yawning trade deficits is part of how we wound up here). Ruehl raises the specter of evil funniners using ISDS to enforce their rights. Again, see the Morgan Stanley example. The contracts for infrastructure sales are exceedingly investor-favorable. It is hard to see a scenario where a government entity in the US (where precedents are well-set) could wriggle out of one in US courts. And that’s before getting to the fact that the big private equity and fund management firms are far and away (as a group) the biggest buyers of sophisticated legal services. Not only would it be hard to find a firm with decent expertise that was not conflicted out and/or was unwilling to make it impossible to ever be engaged by the big financiers by opposing them. A government entity suing a general partner is a one off. That also makes it a less attractive legal matter. Moreover, as far as I can tell (again given the pre-existing investor-friendly legal climate in the US), ISDS cases against US government entities are rare (I can’t recall ever hearing of one but knowledgeable readers please pipe up). I suspect to the extent they happen, they relate to state environmental or labor laws. Consistent with that: The United States is the most frequent home state of investors litigating ISDS cases, which have brought 174 cases against other states to date. Finally, Ruehl is unduly concerned with the general partner(s) in these investments and not the limited partners. As with private equity, public pension funds, as in managing money for government employees, are top participants, along with private pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, family offices, and life insurers. Admittedly, Canadian and Australian public pension fund managers were early to this party. But fixating on the national angle obscures the fact that this is yet another facet of how rentiers pinch the public purse. By John P. Ruehl, an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022. Produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute On February 4, 2025, Chicago’s business community pushed back against Mayor Brandon Johnson’s proposal to raise real estate transfer taxes, adding to the city’s ongoing economic struggles. Besides a struggling pension fund, high home prices, and other factors, a significant contributor to the city’s woes lies in the controversial privatization initiatives from the 2000s, known as the “Great Chicago Sell-Off.” Over the past two decades, these decisions have siphoned an estimated $3 to $4 billion from Chicago. The privatization trend began under former Mayor Richard M. Daley, starting with the Chicago Skyway. In 2005, the 7.8-mile toll road was leased to a consortium led by Spain’s Ferrovial and Australia’s Macquarie Group for $1.83 billion. Tolls were raised immediately, and in 2016, the 99-year lease was sold to “a trio of Canadian pension funds” (the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP)) for $2.8 billion. Australia’s Atlas Arteria Ltd. then acquired a two-thirds stake for $2 billion in 2022, while OTTP retained the remainder. In 2006, four downtown parking garages with more than 9,000 spaces were leased for 99 years to Morgan Stanley for $563 million. After Morgan Stanley defaulted on its debt tied to the lease agreement, control was transferred in 2014 to lenders, including France’s Societe Generale, the German government, and Italy’s UniCredit S.p.A. In 2016, Australia’s AMP Capital and Canada’s Northleaf Capital Partners acquired the garages. Abu Dhabi came into the picture in 2008. In a $1.16 billion deal, 36,000 parking meters were sold to Chicago Parking Meters (CPM) LLC for 75 years, a consortium led by Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley’s Infrastructure group soon restructured CPM’s ownership, transferring major stakes to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Germany’s Allianz through complex investment vehicles. Over the next five years, parking fees more than doubled. By 2022, CPM recovered its entire $1.16 billion investment, while the city had spent $78.8 million buying back parking spots to cover the revenue it would have generated until 2084. As of 2024, the investment has returned $700 million, with 60 years left on the lease. Daley’s goal was to balance the city’s budget without raising property taxes before leaving office. However, the one-time payments resulted in long-term consequences. In addition to financial losses, the privatization deals have hindered Chicago’s ability to modernize infrastructure by limiting efforts to build bike lanes and reduce car dependence downtown, and people even need to get permission or make payments to companies thousands of miles away for local street parades. Growing Privatization Profit-driven entities argue that privatizing public infrastructure leads to greater efficiency through expertise and investment. However, their focus is on profit maximization, not service improvement, leading to long-term rent-seeking behavior. Furthermore, in contracts with limited liability companies, the government assumes the losses, while private companies reap the profits. Companies can walk away or demand renegotiations, while governments are left to maintain services, absorb long-term revenue losses, and burden the public with higher costs. As Chicago’s experience shows, privatization has extended beyond domestic markets to become an international phenomenon. Starting in the 1980s, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank reforms encouraged the privatization of public infrastructure to attract investment, leading to its internationalization. “A 2006 study by the Norwegian government of IMF conditionality revealed that 23 out of 40 poor countries still have privatization and liberalization conditions attached to their IMF loans,” stated an Oxfam Briefing Paper. By 2000, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and multinational corporations began treating infrastructure as a global asset class, involving extended leases that frequently change hands. Foreign companies operate under bilateral investment treaties or trade agreements, allowing them to bypass local courts. Disputes are often mediated in foreign courts or through international arbitration, such as Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) and the World Trade Organization. By exploiting legal loopholes like offshore subsidiaries and tax havens, companies can also shield profits while facing little public scrutiny. Despite these issues, domestic infrastructure continues to be increasingly available on international markets. United States While Chicago remains the most prominent American example, similar deals are widespread across the country, primarily involving companies from allied or dependent nations. In 1998, Atlanta became one of the first cities to enter into an international privatization deal over public services, signing a 20-year and $428 million contract with United Water, a subsidiary of France’s corporate conglomerate Suez, to operate the city’s water system. Celebrated as the biggest privatization contract in the U.S. at the time, it led to claims of quality decline, delays, and other mismanagement before the contract was terminated, leading to the infrastructure being returned to public control in 2003. Nonetheless, the trend continued. By 2006, foreign companies were leasing and operating 80 percent of U.S. port terminals along with a smaller share of the nation’s airports. The UK’s National Grid owns and operates electric transmission networks in the northeastern U.S. Indiana has since become a prominent example of experimenting with international privatization. France’s Veolia entered a 20-year contract to manage Indianapolis’s waterworks in 2002. The deal was, however, eventually canceled in 2010. Meanwhile, its airport was managed by Britain’s BAA from 1994 to 2007. In 2006, the Indiana Toll Road was leased to a foreign consortium led by Spanish and Australian companies for 75 years for $3.8 billion. It was later sold for $5.7 billion to Australia’s IFM Investors in 2015. United States entities have purchased some infrastructure abroad, such as in 1999, when a subsidiary of Bechtel privatized Cochabamba’s water system in Bolivia before controversy forced its exit. But for a major economy, the U.S. owns surprisingly little foreign infrastructure. It has few state-owned enterprises for overseas infrastructure investment, though some private entities like Blackstone’s Infrastructure Partners division and Corsair Capital are active. Instead, extensive domestic privatization opportunities have made U.S. infrastructure a prime target for American and foreign investors. Canadian and Australian Companies Canadian and Australian pension funds and other entities, driven by well-funded systems, consolidation, government support, and early privatization experience, have become major infrastructure investors in the U.S. and elsewhere. The CPPIB owns toll roads worldwide, the OTPP holds stakes in airports across Europe, along with the Channel Tunnel, while the Canadian company Brookfield Infrastructure Partners owns telecom infrastructure across Europe. Roughly half of Australia’s pension pool is invested outside the country. But Australia’s Macquarie Group, in particular, has seen its assets surge, emerging as the “world’s largest infrastructure asset manager.” Since the 1990s, Macquarie Group has focused on identifying underperforming or undervalued public assets to acquire and restructure, and it established its Global Infrastructure Fund in 2001 “to invest in infrastructure financing opportunities in the U.S., Canada, UK, and the European Union,” according to its website. In addition to Chicago’s Skyway, Macquarie holds long-term operational licenses for the Dulles Greenway toll road in Virginia and the Foley Beach Expressway in Alabama, among others. Macquarie’s toll road portfolio in India is worth an estimated $2 billion, and it took a 49 percent stake in Greece’s largest utility, Public Power Corporation (PPC) in 2021. It also led the push for privatizing the UK’s Bristol Airport in 2001, while Britain’s largest water utility was sold to an international consortium led by Macquarie Group from 2006 to 2017. Macquarie also took full ownership of the UK’s National Gas Network in 2023. According to a July 2023 Guardian article, “Macquarie is well known for taking advantage of volatile markets. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, it bet big on non-investment grade loans, known as junk debt. ​​The debt was cheap, but the quality was decent and the returns turned out to be excellent.” Europe The UK has been a major market for infrastructure investors since the global wave of privatization in the 1980s. Beyond Macquarie’s infrastructure holdings, the UK’s largest electricity generation company was privatized and acquired by France’s EDF in 2009. Foreign investors have continued to diversify, with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) poised to take over Newcastle Airport, after acquiring a 37.6 percent stake in Heathrow with French co-investor Ardian in 2024. Europe’s collective experience with infrastructure privatization has been marked by controversy, largely due to Western European corporate dominance. As the EU expanded, some Western EU companies bought control of critical infrastructure in Eastern EU member states. In 2015, Greece privatized 14 regional airports handing them over to a consortium led by the German company Fraport. This move was unpopular in Greece, especially following the austerity measures imposed by the EU and Germany during Greece’s economic crisis. However, the EU also provides safeguards in such deals, including profit sharing and economic support to member states. Outside the EU, resolving disputes is even more challenging. French water companies like Veolia and Suez are leaders in global privatization efforts but have ended up in court over dealings with Argentina in the 1990s, Egypt in the 2000s, and Gabon in the 2010s. Argentina renationalized its oil company from Spanish company Repsol in 2012 after domestic backlash, damaging relations between the two countries. Such cases can be particularly sensitive when they involve former colonial powers and their former colonies, as economic disputes risk being seen as extensions of past dominance, with former ruling states accused of leveraging privatization to maintain influence. China China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) predominantly focuses on building infrastructure in non-Western countries, though the 2020 takeover of Laos’ electric grid shows an exception. In contrast, Europe’s existing infrastructure has proven attractive for Chinese investment. Greece sold a 51 percent stake in its Piraeus Port Authority in 2016 to China’s COSCO shipping, which later increased to 67 percent in 2021. China’s competitive pricing, substantial financial and productive resources, and strategic interests have extended its infrastructure influence to countries with their own expansive foreign infrastructure portfolios. Chinese firms hold stakes in Belgian, Dutch, German, Spanish, and Italian ports, as well as European energy and telecommunications infrastructure. In Australia, the Port of Darwin was leased for 99 years in 2015 to China’s Landbridge Group, with the Australian government resisting pressure to cancel the deal. The State Grid Corporation of China and its subsidiaries, meanwhile, hold large stakes in Australia’s electricity and gas infrastructure, raising national security concerns due to its close ties to Chinese military and intelligence agencies. Furthermore, China’s control over Australian agricultural land has granted it valuable water rights. The geopolitical implications of these foreign investments in infrastructure are undeniable, with national security concerns forcing China to sell its stake in the U.S. Port of Long Beach in 2019. Yet such investments are only becoming more common globally. While they may strengthen economic ties between countries, they reduce accountability, risk undermining sovereignty, and disconnect public services from local oversight, sidelining effective public planning in favor of enriching foreign entities. This trend appears likely to continue, requiring more responsible approaches to maintaining a healthy balance between the necessity for infrastructure investment and public needs. Shorter contracts, profit-sharing models, and performance-based agreements could help countries and companies showcase their development models and expertise—potentially even at lower costs than local providers. However, profit maximization remains the driving force, particularly when financial entities dominate the field. The question that should always be asked when looking at privatizing infrastructure is “can it be allowed to fail?” If it’s a no, then do not privatize or seek third party private investment. Speaking from the UK, where everything not bolted to the floor has been privatized. Brits forgot their history…: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Riots Our “conservatives” of all political parties appeal to tradition but find it convenient to ignore or forget history. Hello Yves, could you please explain this part “another way the pattern of big dogs pursuing easy money is that complex products like mortgage securitizations had disproportionate female representation at high levels of the industry).” did not quite get it. Thank you Female dominated professions and roles are less well paid and prestigious. This is particularly true in finance. Well, it’s a well known fact, isn’t it, that men go into lucrative professions like male lawyers, male engineers, male doctors, and so forth, whereas women go into less remunerative women’s professions like female lawyers, female engineers, and female doctors? FER SHER! The article is useful if one thinks of the problems of allowing capital to flow freely without regulation — which is more or less what is going on. These unbridled movements of capital are one of the sources of the current assertion of oligarchy in the U S of A. Having lived through the give-away in Chicago, I appreciate Yves Smith’s skepticism up top. The problem was *not* that foreigners and the Spanish peril were swooping in to take Chicago’s assets. The problem was that the entrenched Daley / Obama / Rahm Emanuel Democrats were only too happy to give away pieces of the public sphere. It was / is part of their fantasy of “reinventing” government. At the time of the parking-meter scamola, there was no reason given why the city couldn’t manage its own parking meters. Meanwhile, scads of bucks were / are flowing into Chicago’s swamp of tax-increment finance districts, better known as TIFs and slush funds. Here in Italy, there are plenty of U.S. entities showing up to loot the public space at the invitation of Fratelli d’Italia and the Lega (believe it or not). TIM, the Italian phone company, is now owned by KKR investment bank, although there are rumors of a buyout by an EU company. The Italian government keeps threatening to offer pieces of the FFSS, the Italian state railway system. I can hardly wait for U.S. companies to buy a slice of the FFSS and then offer lessons on how to turn the Italian railway system, which is of the highest quality, into AMTRAK. Yes, this idea that foreigners swooped in is nonsense. As you noted, powers that be were only too happy to sell out, citizens be damned. This from the article was quite the handwave – “…Europe’s existing infrastructure has proven attractive for Chinese investment. Greece sold a 51 percent stake in its Piraeus Port Authority in 2016 to China’s COSCO shipping, which later increased to 67 percent in 2021.” The author fails to mention that it was the European Troika who forced the sale of this public asset as a condition of Greece being bailed out. I don’t remember the exact timeline, but at some point Greece held a referendum on austerity policies and citizens voted ‘no’, only to be overruled by technocrats and have austerity measures imposed on them. Yanis Varoufakis explained that the initial deal was very bad for Greece so the Chinese agreed to renegotiate, giving Greece much better terms. Pretty good rundown of that situation here. I think that the author is on the wrong track here. They are obsessed with all those foreign corporations buying up everything but they should be looking at who is running those corporations and not which countries those corporations come from. On that level, those executives do not really care which passport – or passports – they hold and they have much more in common with executives running other foreign corporations rather than with people from the country that they actually come from. Probably the only time they wave the flag of the country that they come from is to impress the hicks in their home country but truth be told, find it more comfortable mixing with executives from other countries even if they are direct competitors. After all, this is truly their people. All roads lead to Rome, as it were. My evil multinational had a serious slice of shares acquired by both Blackrock and Vanguard over the past few years and now it’s one set of RIFs after another and “AI” pushed like it’s magically going to replace HR, Research, Application Development and of course, Legal, because lawyers have always been the biggest bottleneck to doing business. Like DOGE, I see this as a current of immature thinking about superstructure and systems. When it all breaks down, I guess there will be no further bottlenecks to business doing whatever the heck it wants. So long as they’ve got the bagmen and enforcers to keep the princes in line. Thank you, Yves. I recognise the first five and BlackStone from workshops with Labour in opposition. Labour has prioritised these giants in government, much to the private chagrin of UK investors, but no one dares complain in public. US firms pay better than peers from elsewhere. In addition and on current polling, Labour is unlikely to form the next government, so Labour politicians and even officials in Whitehall are prioritising their nest eggs after 2029. It feels terminal in Blighty, so one may as well sell everything to Wall Street. Plus, when BlackRock visits Downing Street, Angela Rayner can get handsy with Larry Fink. The NC community can read these and weep for Blighty: https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2025/02/18/treasury-incompetence/ and https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2025/02/18/streeting-rotten-to-the-core/. Not unrelated: https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/defence-secretarys-speech-on-defence-reform–2. What is it about these politicians, many of whom have not “worked” outside politics, but think the government is a business? Pat McFadden is another. The biggest con in so called privatization deals is the chronic lie that private investors will bring in all sorts of new investment funds and drive efficiency in whatever is being sold off. This is all aided and abetted by the mainstream economics professions which chronically fails to even apply its own basic and foundational principles to properly critique these situations. The driver of this is that mainstream economics has long since abandon the discussion of monopolies or monopoly economics. You see in micro economics 101 we all learn that in a competitive market, price is where the demand curve and the supply curve meet. However, if you venture further up the ladder of economic theory you will learn that the supply curve discussed in econ 101 is the upward sloping portion of a firms marginal cost curve. Here’s where the problem is… every economic study that has tried to understand what the real world shape of real world businesses marginal cost curves are keeps coming back with the same answer… only a small minority of entities actually have a business where their margin costs are rising as output increases. The majority of businesses face a downward sloping margin cost curve. Conveniently the majority of mainstream economics just keeps on ignoring this even though in that same econ 101 class there is probably at least a brief discussion about firms that do face downward sloping marginal cost curves. They are called natural monopolies. The real-world implication of this is that most businesses will act like a real monopoly if they are allowed to. So it should be no surprise to anyone (including economists who shamefully ignore this reality) that when you privatize what is invariably a fairly large entity with few, if any competitors, that they maximize their rent extractions at the expense of their customers and even the business they are supposed to be running. The biggest con in so called privatization deals is the chronic lie that private investors will bring in all sorts of new investment funds and drive efficiency in whatever is being sold off. It’s never better, is it? You and I understand ‘efficiency’ in terms of how well our tools work, how far our car drives per tank. That’s the wrong meaning of the word; when a capitalist says ‘efficiency’, the only thing meant is more profit per $ of revenue, so anything that cuts cost is by definition ‘efficient’. Hi Yves, In response to your question about ISDS cases against the US, they did happen under NAFTA Chapter 11, but never succeeded, which is probably why you never heard about them. Some of the bigger ones (Methanex, 1999, brought against California for phasing out the gasoline additive MTBE, and Glamis Gold, 2003, also brought against California, this time for a law requiring restoration of open-pit mines) related to state environmental laws, as you suggested. A number of them concerned the softwood lumber disputes and were terminated with the new softwood lumber agreement in 2006. By contrast, as of 2018 (before the renegotiation of NAFTA under Trump), Canada had lost 8 cases and Mexico 5. Many of the ISDS provisions under Chapter 11 were removed from the USMCA, which was a win for Canada and Mexico. Sacramento did a similar sell off of parking meter & garages 10ish years ago then used the money to build a new downtown arena for the NBA franchise. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Colorado Bill Would Require Businesses To Disclose Climate Emissions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmcgowan/2025/02/17/colorado-bill-would-require-businesses-to-disclose-climate-emissions/
Time Published: 2025-02-17T23:44:53Z
Full Content:
Denver, Colorado USA:Gold plated roof top of the Capitol Building of Denver Colorado Colorado has joined the wave of states considering requiring businesses to disclose greenhouse gas emissions. This follows the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announcing it will eliminate the reporting requirement that was adopted in 2024, but never went into effect. If passed, businesses with a presence in Colorado and over $1 billion in revenue will be required to start reporting as soon as 2028. Following the Paris Agreement in 2015, a series of global initiatives were pursued to reduce the impacts of climate change and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero” by 2050. A multi-prong approach was used to influence and regulate businesses. Large investment firms, like BlackRock, used their influence to drive sustainability and environmental, social, and governance. By 2021, it was standard practice for businesses to release annual ESG and sustainability reports. However, there was no standardization of the practice. Claims were unregulated and content was unclear. As a result, reports were focused on what the business thought mattered to investors and were little more than marketing pieces. This became problematic in the highly regulated financial industry. Funds that claim to be ESG, green, climate friendly, or sustainable must back up those claims with data. As a result of demand and Paris Agreement based initiatives, international regulators began drafting standards for reporting, marketing, and investments relating to climate change and other green initiatives. In 2021, the International Sustainability Standards Board drafted the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation’s Sustainability Disclosure Standards. IFRS is an independent, nonprofit organization that develops financial reporting standards, including international accounting standards. IFRS is not used in the U.S., who uses generally accepted accounting principles, also known as GAAP, but is used in 132 jurisdictions. The IFRS Standards were adopted in June 2023 as the global standard for sustainability and climate change reporting, including greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., the SEC proposed the development of climate-related reporting standards in March 2022. The final rule, adopted on March 6, 2024, required large publicly traded companies to disclose climate action, GHG emissions, and the financial impacts of severe weather events. The Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was initially set to go into effect in 2026. However, it was immediately met with legal challenges and the SEC delayed implementation indefinitely while the cases worked through the judicial process. In February, the acting chair of the SEC announced that the Climate-Related Disclosure Rule was in the process of being repealed. Focus now shifts to the states. In September 2023, California approved the Climate Accountability Package, a pair of bills aimed at creating sustainability reporting requirements. Senate Bill 253 required companies that do business in California and have an excess of $1 billion in revenue, defined as “reporting entities,” to submit an annual report for Scope 1 and Scope 2 starting in 2026. Scope 3 reporting will begin in 2027. California is still drafting the applicable regulations and the reporting timeline is likely to be delayed. Now, Colorado is following suit. House Bill 25-1119, titled “Requiring Certain Entities to Disclose Information Concerning Greenhouse Gas Emissions,” was introduced on January 28 by state representative Manny Rutinel, a Democrat. The bill mimics the requirements of the California legislation. Reporting entities is defined as “an entity that does business in Colorado and has total revenues exceeding one billion dollars in the preceding calendar year, including revenues received by all of the businesses entity’s subsidiaries that do business in Colorado.” The scope of “does business in” has come into question in California and is causing problems for businesses trying to determine if they fall under the reporting requirement or not. It will be interesting to see how Colorado addresses this issue. The reporting of Scope 1, the direct GHG emissions of the company, and Scope 2, the GHG emissions of their energy provider tied to the business’ energy consumption, will begin reporting by January 1, 2027, for the 2027 annual year. Scope 3 reporting will be phased in using a unique definition. Broadly, the bill defines Scope 3 as GHG emissions “other than Scope 2, that are from sources that a reporting entity does not own or directly control. ‘Scope 3 Emissions’ may include emissions associated with a reporting entity’s supply chain, business travel, employee commutes, procurement, waste, and water usage, regardless of location.” By Jan. 1, 2029, companies will need to disclose Scope 3 emissions from the 2028 calendar year from "purchased goods and services, capital goods, and the use of sold products." By Jan. 1, 2030, companies will need to disclose Scope 3 emissions from the 2029 calendar year from “emissions from fuel and energy activities, which emissions are not classified as Scope 1 emissions or Scope 2 emissions; waste generated in operations; processing of sold products; and the end of life of sold products.” By Jan. 1, 2031, companies will need to disclose Scope 3 emissions from the 2030 calendar year from “upstream transportation and distribution, business travel, employee commuting, upstream leased assets, downstream transportation and distribution, downstream leased assets, and franchises.” Notably, the timing of the reporting requirement is, in my opinion, unobtainable. It is unreasonable to require businesses to report GHG emissions from the preceding calendar year on January 1. Most jurisdictions allow six months for businesses to process the information and compile the reports. I expect this will be change as the bill goes through the legislative process. Unique to Colorado, enforcement is delegated to the district attorney and attorney general. If a business fails to comply with the disclosure requirement, they may be prosecuted and face a penalty of $100,000 per day. I expect that to be reduced or otherwise amended. It is too early in the legislative session to predict the chances the bill will make it through the Colorado General Assembly and become law. Democrats control both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Likewise, Governor Jared Polis is Democrat. This greatly increases the likelihood the bill will make it through the legislative process. However, do not underestimate the business lobby’s efforts to kill the bill or make substantial changes.

Photo Illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images DOGECOIN CHAMPION POSTS BLOWOUT EARNINGS Dogecoin, the $39 billion joke-turned-blue-chip of the meme coin economy, has been on a wild run, up 220% over the past year. That’s a goldmine for Robinhood, whose customers collectively hold 35 billion DOGE, or about 24% of the token’s entire supply. At current prices, that stash is worth $8.8 billion, though it briefly ballooned to $16.4 billion in December. Crypto has become Robinhood’s cash cow. Q4 results show that digital assets were its top revenue driver, up 700% year-over-year to $358 million, making up 35% of net revenue. For all of 2024, the firm brought in $2.95 billion, while net income soared tenfold to $916 million. And it’s not just dog money: Robinhood’s meme coin buffet also includes BONK, Shiba Inu, Dogwifhat, Trump coin, and Pepe. Read more. COINBASE’S COMEBACK Coinbase just pulled off a comeback worthy of a bull market montage. Q4 net revenue nearly doubled to $2.2 billion, blowing past the $1.8 billion analysts expected. Net income rocketed 1,600% from the previous quarter to $1.3 billion, as trading volume surged 176% to $94 billion—proof that retail investors are back and betting big. Not bad for a company that just a year ago was clawing its way out of post-FTX wreckage, with revenue around $3 billion and its stock trading below $200. Now, with Bitcoin ETFs gaining traction and D.C. getting friendlier, Coinbase is inching back toward its 2021 glory days, when revenue was over $7 billion and shares briefly topped $357. CRYPTO PUSHES FOR INFLUENCE IN D.C. Crypto’s power players have stormed Washington, lobbying for influence in the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, led by Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks, and working to shape discussions with the SEC’s newly formed Crypto Task Force under Commissioner Hester Peirce. Some had hoped for a formal role on the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, initially expected to include industry executives. But sources indicate a different approach favoring issue-specific roundtables over direct industry appointments. Read more.

Title: OpenWeb's ousted founder and CEO is back at the tech company in an advisor role after a messy boardroom battle

Full Content:
Nadav Shoval, the founder who was ousted as the CEO of OpenWeb by its board in a messy public battle, is back with the adtech company in an advisor role, Business Insider has learned. In an email to employees sent on Friday morning and obtained by BI, OpenWeb's interim CEO, Tim Harvey, announced that the company and Shoval had "reached a mutually agreed resolution" in which Shoval would remain connected to the company as a senior advisor to its chief executive. Later on Friday, the company published a post on its website confirming the move. OpenWeb didn't respond to requests for comment. "We resolved our differences," Shoval told BI. "The company remains committed to its mission of OpenWeb, and I'm excited to continue to support the mission in my role as senior advisor to the CEO." The settlement caps months of drama at OpenWeb that began in mid-2024. Shoval has said that he and some board members disagreed over a potential investment in the company from BlackRock. Shoval's relationship with the board became further strained after the board changed his reporting line — a move that Shoval argued was in breach of his contract because, in his view, it diminished his role and hindered his management capabilities. Shoval wrote to the board in September, demanding that it reverse the change. Later that month, the board fired him. He took the matter public, saying on LinkedIn in September that he hadn't stepped down as CEO. "I do not accept these actions," he wrote. "I will continue to fight for OpenWeb's mission and purpose alongside our team." Shoval also went the legal route. He sued OpenWeb and many of its board members in a court in Tel Aviv, Israel, in October, alleging that he had been the victim of a boardroom coup. The complaint demanded that he be reinstated as CEO and given the ability to appoint two new board members. In response to Shoval's suit, OpenWeb said in court filings that the case was a classic situation in which the board of directors had lost confidence in its CEO. OpenWeb said that Shoval was trying to extract money that was not owed to him and that he had chosen to give up control of the company when he brought in investors. Shoval confirmed that the case was settled. OpenWeb, which has about 350 employees, provides technology to help publishers boost revenue and engagement on their websites, such as comment-moderation and advertising tools. It says its clients and partners include the publishers CNN, Fox, and Hearst and the advertising companies WPP, Dentsu, and Publicis Groupe. Founded in 2012, OpenWeb has raised more than $392 million and was last valued at $1.5 billion. Its investors include the venture capital firms Insight Partners, Georgian Partners, and Index Ventures; companies like The New York Times and Dentsu; and the New York University Stern professor and podcaster Scott Galloway, who sits on the company's board.

Title: Man gets suspended sentence over bogus 999 calls
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/02/17/man-gets-suspended-sentence-over-bogus-999-calls/
Time Published: 2025-02-17T16:57:40Z
Full Content:
A man who made more than 30 bogus 999 calls over the course of two years has been given a 3½-year suspended sentence. James Kelly (32), of Rochford Green, Blackrock, Co Dublin, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to six sample charges of knowingly making a false report on dates between February 2021 and March 2023. The court heard gardaí responded to each false report, including making house-to-house inquiries and trawling through hours of CCTV footage. In one incident Kelly claimed he had been the victim of an attempted armed robbery. Gardaí responded to his 999 call, and after meeting him followed up by canvasing the local area for CCTV footage. Kelly was seen on the footage but there was no suspect robber. One officer spent 30 days canvasing footage and four months following up on the case before it was concluded there had been no crime. At a previous sentence hearing last June Judge Pauline Codd said Kelly’s behaviour was a complete waste of Garda time and resources. Sentencing Kelly on Monday, she said he had caused a great nuisance to people who have enough to be doing coping with their own workload. Judge Codd said the frequencies with which the calls were made warranted a headline sentence of five years. She took into account that urine analysis showed Kelly has tested negative for various illicit drugs and previously struggled with addiction. She noted from various testimonials that Kelly works in a voluntary capacity at a local football club and has shown he is capable of living in a pro-social manner. She imposed a sentence of 3½ years, which she suspended in full on strict conditions, including that he engage with the Probation Service for one year and with various addiction support services as directed by the Probation Service. Det Garda Gary Burns told barrister John Moher, prosecuting, at an earlier sentence hearing that a call received on January 13th, 2022, prompted the investigation into the case. The 999 call received that day reported that a fight had broken out in a particular pub and males were throwing bottles at each other. Gardaí immediately responded but when they arrived a minute later there were three people in the bar and it was very quickly established there had been no such disturbance. The 999 caller had identified himself as James. Further investigation led to the nomination of Kelly as a suspect. Kelly gave a voluntarily statement to gardaí in March 2023 having previously been arrested, detained and interviewed. He made no admissions during the initial questioning but took responsibility in his voluntary statement. He said he wanted to apologise for wasting people’s time but said he could not say why he made the calls. “I don’t know really. I think I need to see someone professionally,” he said. Kelly has two previous convictions for possession of articles and one for a public order offence. Det Gda Burns agreed with barrister Pieter Le Vert, defending, that Kelly has ongoing issues with drugs. Counsel said Kelly is a self-confessed compulsive liar. Mr Le Vert said Kelly was addicted to cocaine and alcohol. He has been trying to get into drug rehabilitation but so far has not secured a place. Mr Le Vert said on Monday that his client is now drug-free and has applied for work but has not secured a job. He is due to become a father later this year. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Congested urban regions are driving North America. North America held the major share of the eVTOL aircraft market in 2024. Modern transportation alternatives like eVTOL planes are much needed because North America is home to some of the most crowded urban areas in the world. To improve mobility and lessen traffic congestion, cities including Dallas, New York, and Los Angeles are looking at eVTOL flying taxi services. The well-established infrastructure in the region, including heliports, potential urban vertiport locations, and already-existing airports, can also make it easier to deploy eVTOL aircraft. Additionally, work is being done to build vertiports, charging stations, and maintenance facilities—infrastructure made especially for eVTOL operations. Additionally, the military and large corporations are entering into more contracts, which helps the region's economy grow. Rising technology is driving the Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is estimated to achieve a significant growth rate in the eVTOL aircraft market during the predicted timeframe. Urban congestion and increased urbanization, especially in large cities in China, India, Japan, Australia, and South Korea, are the main causes of the region's rapid growth. Emerging markets such as China and India provide substantial prospects for the eVTOL industry because of their sustained robust GDP development. Because of its steady economic growth and official backing in the form of advantageous laws, money, and alliances, China is drawing significant foreign investments. Furthermore, the development of eVTOL is supported by a strong technical ecosystem in Asia Pacific, which includes developments in battery technology, 5G connectivity, and artificial intelligence (AI). These elements work together to create the perfect setting for the growth of the eVTOL business in the area. eVTOL Aircraft Market Report Coverage You can place an order or ask any questions, please feel free to contact at sales@precedenceresearch.com | +1 804 441 9344 eVTOL Aircraft Market Segmentation Analysis: Browse More Insights: eVTOL Aircraft Market Top Companies What is Going Around the Globe?

Title: BUSTED: America First Legal Shows Judge Financially Entangled With His Own Trump Ruling...If this doesn't warrant a recusal, NOTHING does

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/17/2025 6:44:11 AM PST by Red Badger The problem with judge-shopping to push your case through, there’s always the chance that the judges you are counting on to push your agenda have their own skin in the game. That’s the case with a judge who has offered very dubious rulings on whether Trump can suspend his USAID money. We’ve got a thread from America First Legal making the case online that Judge McConnell, the Rhode Island judge who put an end to Trump’s spending freezes, ought never to have heard that case in the first place. The reason? He is *Personally* benefitting financially from his own ruling. If the money gets cut, so does funding from a group whose board he has served on for as long as he’s held federal office — much of that time, serving as chair. The Trump administration has violated a court order by refusing to reverse a freeze of billions in government funds, a judge ruled Monday. The ruling was the latest challenge to sweeping White House plans to cut costs and remake the US government. US District Judge John McConnell Jr previously ruled that the government should continue to fund programmes authorised by Congress. On Monday, he said the White House had defied a preliminary injunction that the judge issued after 23 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to stop the funding freeze. The Trump administration said it would appeal the ruling. — BBC It’s one of many lawsuits the Dems have ginned up against the Trump admin… and one of the more aggressive. But there’s a twist: Judges are expected to recuse themselves from cases in which they have any personal stake in the outcome. When a company on whose board you sit is downstream of the threatened funding to the tune of millions of dollars… that would be an example of a reason to recuse. And yet, he heard the case anyway. Ruled on it, even. And wouldn’t ya know it, the ruling happened to align with his personal interests. But we can trust him, right?

If the money gets cut, so does funding from a group whose board he has served on for as long as he’s held federal office — much of that time, serving as chair.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson The Trump administration has violated a court order by refusing to reverse a freeze of billions in government funds, a judge ruled Monday. The ruling was the latest challenge to sweeping White House plans to cut costs and remake the US government. US District Judge John McConnell Jr previously ruled that the government should continue to fund programmes authorised by Congress. On Monday, he said the White House had defied a preliminary injunction that the judge issued after 23 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to stop the funding freeze. The Trump administration said it would appeal the ruling. — BBC It’s one of many lawsuits the Dems have ginned up against the Trump admin… and one of the more aggressive. But there’s a twist: Judges are expected to recuse themselves from cases in which they have any personal stake in the outcome. When a company on whose board you sit is downstream of the threatened funding to the tune of millions of dollars… that would be an example of a reason to recuse. And yet, he heard the case anyway. Ruled on it, even. And wouldn’t ya know it, the ruling happened to align with his personal interests. But we can trust him, right?

In the case of USAID, many of these programs were not authorized by Congress, and are outside the scope of USAID's mission. 8 posted on 02/17/2025 7:03:55 AM PST by Dr. Sivana ("Whatsoever he shall say to you, do ye."

Title: Blockchain Rewiring TradFi: A Trillion-Dollar Shift
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/02/17/blockchain-rewiring-tradfi-a-trillion-dollar-shift/
Time Published: 2025-02-17T13:08:55Z

blockchain and financial technology. The race to remake global finance is heating up, and the starting gun has already fired on Wall Street. While traditional banks grapple with systems that trap trillions in idle capital, a new financial architecture is emerging from the fusion of blockchain technology and traditional finance (TradFi). The prize isn't just eliminating the friction that costs the industry billions in settlement delays and reconciliation headaches—it's fundamentally rewiring how money moves. Early movers aren't just experimenting anymore; they're driving the financial blockchain market toward a projected $49.2 billion by 2030, up from $2.1 billion in 2023. The shift isn't just theoretical. At Davos 2025, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan likened crypto to established payment systems: "If you go down the street here and buy lunch, you could pay with Visa, Mastercard, a debit card, Apple Pay, and so on. In that sense, cryptocurrency would just be another form of payment." Behind the glass towers of Wall Street, this future is already materializing. The DTCC’s Project Ion, leveraging distributed ledger technology, is rewiring financial infrastructure’s fundamental plumbing by shifting from batch to real-time processing and creating a single, unified transaction record—slashing reconciliation costs and delivering significant savings. Already handling over 100,000 bilateral equity transactions daily, with peaks reaching 160,000 trades, Project Ion operates within today's T+2 settlement framework while blazing the trail toward T+1 and potentially T+0 settlement—a shift that could unlock billions in capital currently trapped in settlement limbo. Banking giants BNY Mellon, Citi, and JP Morgan aren't just watching from the sidelines—they're already all in. Cross-border payments remain the industry's biggest bottleneck—slow, costly, and reliant on an outdated patchwork of intermediaries. Trillions move across borders every year, yet transactions can take days, saddled with 4%+ fees and opaque banking rails. Enter stablecoins—by converting fiat into digital tokens on global blockchain networks, banks unlock 24/7, near-instant money movement at scale. This innovation lets institutions bypass correspondent banking friction entirely, settling transactions in minutes rather than days. JPMorgan Coin already processes $1 billion in daily settlements, and the broader market for tokenized dollars is on track to hit $400 billion by 2025. The economic case is striking: where traditional transfers trap money for days and drain substantial fees, blockchain-powered stablecoins deliver instant settlement at a fraction of the cost. This shift has tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon building Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms, accelerating enterprise blockchain adoption. The transformation spans every corner of finance. Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and Standard Chartered have launched blockchain initiatives to streamline operations, while payment giants Visa and Mastercard are integrating the technology into their global networks. Asset management leaders Fidelity, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan are pushing into real-world assets (RWA), recognizing blockchain's potential to transform asset tokenization and settlement. Franklin Templeton's expansion of its money market fund across Solana, Ethereum, Stellar, and other major blockchain networks signals a new phase—traditional asset managers are no longer experimenting; they're building multi-chain infrastructure for the future. Global crossborder digital payment and tokenization Three key forces are accelerating blockchain's adoption in TradFi: First, legacy banking systems struggle to meet real-time global demands; second, regulatory clarity around digital assets is improving; third, institutional investors—once skeptical—are now integrating blockchain solutions to bridge traditional and digital finance. Unlike early blockchain disruptors who sought to replace traditional finance, today's players are bridging legacy systems with digital innovation—prioritizing functionality over disruption. The road ahead presents a delicate balancing act. As banks and financial institutions embrace blockchain, they must navigate the fine line between pushing innovation forward and staying within regulatory bounds. Enterprise solutions like R3 Corda are emerging as crucial bridges, offering the institutional-grade infrastructure needed for this transition. At the same time, decentralized networks are evolving to put compliance first—pointing toward a future where innovation and regulation coexist in harmony. Among new solutions, Chainlink, Aave, and Compound are pioneering DeFi infrastructure, while Graphite Network is bridging TradFi and DeFi, offering verification and compliance-focused solutions that major institutions can trust. A reputation-based Layer 1 blockchain, it integrates privacy-preserving KYC (ZKPs), institutional compliance, and high-speed transactions (1,400 TPS at low fees). Each account has a behavior-based reputation score, protecting users from untrustworthy members. Verified single-user accounts and Proof-of-Authority Polymer 2.0 deliver compliant, scalable blockchain solutions for large projects. However, institutional players face a fundamental challenge: aligning blockchain's transformative promise with TradFi's relentless demand for speed and reliability. As titans like Nasdaq, CME Group, and ICE explore blockchain integration, they confront a staggering benchmark—traditional financial networks routinely process upwards of 65,000 transactions per second during peak times, a volume that would overwhelm most blockchain systems. While Layer 2 solutions such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon have delivered incremental speed boosts and reduced costs, these fixes simply can't scale to meet the colossal throughput and near-instant finality demanded by modern institutional finance. This staggering performance pressure has sparked a new wave of foundational innovation. Rather than merely patching existing systems, emerging Layer 1 solutions are reengineering the blockchain's very core to tackle scalability and efficiency at an enterprise level. Among these, DevvE integrates enterprise compliance frameworks with Web2 functionality through RESTful APIs. Backed by global patents and a non-custodial instant settlement exchange, DevvE enables real-world asset tokenization with excellent scalability and lightning-fast L1 transaction speeds. Will Stewart, a veteran in global finance, recently joined DevvDigital’s Board to drive institutional adoption, reinforcing DevvE’s position as a key player in financial evolution. With scalability solutions maturing, attention has shifted to perhaps the most transformative application of blockchain in traditional finance: asset tokenization. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is blockchain’s most promising institutional use case. Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and UBS are exploring tokenization, while JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have already run controlled pilots testing digital representations of bonds and private equity. Early security token pioneers like Polymath and Harbor proved feasibility but lacked mass adoption. Today, platforms like Securitize, tZERO, and Templum have taken the lead, effectively bridging traditional finance with blockchain. As tokenization gains traction, AI-driven compliance is emerging as a competitive edge. Rexas Finance is leveraging this approach, allowing users to tokenize a wide range of assets, from real estate to intellectual property, while ensuring automated compliance and global trading capabilities. With $45M+ raised and 47,000+ holders, Rexas provides a secure, scalable infrastructure that streamlines asset management for both institutional and retail investors. Seamless multi-chain integration enables fast, secure, and cost-effective transactions, making asset tokenization more accessible. Moving forward, successful platforms will be those that balance blockchain’s limitless potential with institutional finance’s practical requirements. With DeFi platforms projected to reach a $100 billion valuation, the transformation isn’t theoretical—it’s happening now. While blockchain promises to revolutionize finance, its journey is fraught with significant risks. The $165 million ASX blockchain upgrade failure in 2022 starkly reminds us that even the most well-funded projects can stumble. But it's not just about failed implementations – the stakes are exponentially higher when it comes to security. Picture a smart contract flaw that could instantly freeze millions in assets or a private key breach that makes traditional password hacks look like child's play. This is why financial giants aren't rushing headlong into the blockchain future. Instead, they're adopting what insiders call a "walk-before-run" strategy: JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs maintain their battle-tested legacy systems alongside blockchain pilots, while BNY Mellon is investing heavily in blockchain forensics. Their message is clear: in the race to transform finance, security isn't just another checkbox – it's the foundation upon which everything else builds. Global financial institutions are already committing billions to blockchain integration. The next phase will bring standardization, deeper integration, and hybrid financial models that blend traditional and blockchain infrastructure. By accelerating settlement speeds and eliminating inefficiencies, blockchain isn't just upgrading financial systems—it's fundamentally reimagining them for the digital age.

Monday, 17 Feb 2025 KUALA LUMPUR: A heated shouting match broke out in the Dewan Rakyat after Wan Ahmad Fayhsal Wan Ahmad Kamal (PN-Machang) made critical remarks about Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and the royal addendum. Wan Ahmad Fayhsal accused Anwar of failing to attract investments and create high-quality jobs for Malaysians during the Parliament sitting on Monday. Citing World Bank data, he claimed that many Malaysian graduates had to work as e-hailing drivers, cashiers, and factory workers due to the lack of quality job opportunities. "Under Tambun (Anwar), Malaysia has failed to generate quality jobs. The rich are just cronies and capitalists,” he said, sparking objections from several MPs. Wan Ahmad Fayhsal also called for the Public Accounts Committee to investigate the privatisation of Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB), alleging that the sale of MAHB shares was linked to investment firm BlackRock. Tensions escalated further when he brought up the royal addendum related to former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s house arrest. Deputy Speaker Syahredzan Johan intervened, stopping Wan Ahmad Fayhsal from continuing and referring to Speaker Tan Sri Johari Abdul’s previous ruling that the royal addendum could not be debated in the House. "If you're not satisfied, please submit a motion to challenge the ruling. As of now, I am not allowing it," he said, while also reminding MPs to follow proper procedures when interjecting during debates. He then issued a first warning to Wan Ahmad Fayhsal, who was previously suspended for six months in July last year, causing him to miss the last Dewan Rakyat session. Thank you for your report!

Title: The Rainmakers: Meet the 20 bankers who led last year's M&A rebound, driving billions in fees to their firms

If you were to describe dealmaking in 2024, you might say it's the year Wall Street got its swagger back. US companies announced more than $1.43 trillion in deals last year, the highest amount since 2021, when a dealmaking frenzy resulted in a record $2.51 trillion in US M&A activity, according to the deals tracker LSEG. The uptick — combined with signs of economic growth and a more relaxed approach to regulations under the Trump administration — has led some industry leaders to suggest that the M&A freeze that started in 2022 may finally be coming to an end. "There's a lot of pent-up energy in capital markets, particularly around the financial-sponsor community, and that will be unleashed," David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, said at a financial industry conference in February. "I am very confident we will get back to 10-year averages" in historical dealmaking contexts, he said, adding, "This year could be one of those times." Bankers have good reason to be hopeful: There were 96 megadeals, or deals over $5 billion, announced globally last year — the most since 2021, according to LSEG. Such deals are the lifeblood of the biggest investment banks as they can generate hundreds of billions in fees for firms. Last year's M&A activity generated advisory fees of about $33.4 billion, a 7% increase from roughly $31.3 billion the year before, LSEG said. Some of the multibillion-dollar tie-ups facilitated by the battle-hardened M&A bankers on this year's list included the nearly $36 billion sale of the food manufacturer Kellanova to the snack brand Mars and the $26 billion takeover of Endeavor Energy Resources by its rival Diamondback Energy. To find out which bankers helped their firms benefit from last year's boom, Business Insider partnered with MergerLinks, a UK-based data provider that reviews M&A performance, to present the sixth annual edition of "The Rainmakers," a list of the top 20 investment bankers ranked by overall transaction volume in the US. This is the first year a woman — Anu Aiyengar of JPMorgan — has snagged the No. 1 spot. It's also the first time more than one woman has made the ranking. Aiyengar, JPMorgan's global head of mergers and acquisitions, was joined by Lily Mahdavi, who was recently promoted to cohead of M&A in the Americas at Morgan Stanley. It's Aiyengar's fourth appearance. Other repeat names include Suhail Sikhtian, who leads Goldman's natural-resources practice; Blair Effron, a cofounder of the elite-boutique investment bank Centerview; and Stephan Feldgoise, Goldman Sachs' head of M&A. More notable, perhaps, are the unusually high number of new faces — including Mahdavi and her fellow Morgan Stanley dealmaker Steve Munger. Also new to the list are Centerview's Todd Davison, Jefferies' Conrad Gibbins, and Xavier Loriferne of JPMorgan Chase. In total, nearly 50% of the members on this year's list — nine names — are making their inaugural debut, MergerLinks said. The 2024 list also marks the first time a Jefferies banker has made the top 20. MergerLinks tracks publicly announced deals and calculates deal values on a net basis, including both equity and debt components. To make the individual league table, a banker must have been the lead advisor on either side of a transaction. Deal sizes are sourced from MergerLinks and public press releases and include the target company's net debt. The transaction values are converted from British pounds to US dollars at the average 2024 exchange rate. As a result, some deal prices announced in dollars throughout the year may not match up. Title: Global head of M&A Number of deals: 14 Value of deals: $83.2 billion Aiyengar became JPMorgan's solo head of mergers and acquisitions in 2023 but has been with the bank since 2002. She's routinely cited as one of the financial services industry's most powerful and influential female leaders. She has appeared on the list three times in the past. Her 2024 deals included: Advised Rio Tinto, a global mining organization, its $6.7 billion acquisition of the chemicals firm Arcadium Lithium. Title: Global head of M&A Number of deals: 7 Value of deals: $78.2 billion Feldgoise was named Goldman's global head of mergers and acquisitions following a management reshuffle of its investment banking division in January. Feldgoise was previously a cohead of M&A and has also led the investment bank's consumer and retail coverage group. He joined the firm in 1997 and became a partner in 2008. This is his second time on the list, with his first appearance being two years ago. His 2024 deals included: Advised the data center firm AirTrunk in its roughly $15 billion sale to the private equity firm Blackstone. Title: CEO Number of deals: 7 Value of deals: $76.2 billion Boutros is the CEO of the tech-focused investment bank Qatalyst. Previously, he was a senior banker at Credit Suisse, where he served as chairman of both the global technology and healthcare groups. Qatalyst says he has completed more than 700 transactions of various types over the years. This is his fourth year in a row on the Rainmakers list. His 2024 deals included: Title: Chairman of global M&A Number of deals: 5 Value of deals: $74.2 billion Munger has been a Morgan Stanley banker for nearly 40 years and chairman of its M&A group for two decades. This is Munger's first time on the Rainmakers list. His 2024 deals included: Title: Managing director, head of FIG M&A, cohead of media & communications M&A Number of deals: 10 Value of deals: $70.9 billion Loriferne joined JPMorgan in 2006. This marks Loriferne's first time on the Rainmakers list. His 2024 deals included: Title: Partner Number of deals: 4 Value of deals: $63.2 billion Davison is a partner at Centerview and has been an investment banker for more than 25 years. This is his first time appearing on the list. He joined Centerview in 2013 to cohead its media practice and was previously a cohead of North American media coverage at Morgan Stanley. Centerview says he's been involved in more than $300 billion worth of transactions throughout his career. His 2024 deals included: Title: Cohead of M&A, Americas Number of deals: 9 Value of deals: $59.6 billion Mahdavi, who has spent the entirety of her career focused on mergers and acquisitions, joined Morgan Stanley in 2012; she was previously at Deutsche Bank and Citi. She was promoted to co-lead the M&A business in the Americas in early 2025. This is Mahdavi's first time on the Rainmakers list. Her 2024 deals included: Title: Cochairman of global mergers and acquisitions Number of deals: 8 Value of deals: $59.2 billion Ingrassia was previously head of Americas M&A at Goldman, a role he held since 2004. Previously, he ran the consumer retail group. He has appeared multiple times on the Rainmakers list, including last year and the year prior. His 2024 deals included: Title: Vice chairman of investment banking Number of deals: 7 Value of deals: $51.3 billion This is Gallea's third time on the list. Gallea joined Goldman Sachs from JPMorgan in 2018 after spending nearly two decades there. He has distinguished himself as a leading banker in the industrials sector. His 2024 deals included: Title: Chairman of global M&A Number of deals: 6 Value of deals: $49.8 billion The longtime global M&A leader moved into a new role as chairman last year so he could spend more time advising Barclays' top clients. Posternack joined the firm in 2008 after it bought Lehman Brothers, his previous firm. He led its natural-resources practice and its M&A takeover defense business. He became head of M&A worldwide in 2014. His 2024 deals included: Title: Global head of natural-resources investment banking Number of deals: 3 Value of deals: $45.9 billion Sikhtian became Goldman's sole head of natural-resources investment banking in 2020. He's been with the firm since 1998, when he started in the energy and power group. He has also worked with European energy companies from London. He made his first appearance on the list last year. His 2024 deals included: Title: Global chairman of investment banking and mergers and acquisitions Number of deals: 14 Value of deals: $45.1 billion Ventresca, a three-decade veteran of JPMorgan, has advised on mandates spanning industrials, telecoms, consumer retail, and more. He appeared on the Rainmakers list for the first time last year. His 2024 deals included: Title: Managing director Number of deals: 10 Value of deals: $44.5 billion This year marks Gibbins' first appearance on the list. The banker, who's based in Texas and concentrates on the energy sector, joined Jefferies as an analyst nearly 15 years ago.

Title: ‘We were left on our own’: First-time mothers hit by shortage of public health nurses
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/health/2025/02/17/we-were-left-on-our-own-first-time-mothers-hit-by-shortage-of-public-health-nurses/

First-time mother Siobhán Singleton had her first and only visit from a public health nurse just three days after arriving home with her bundle of joy – that was two years ago. Ms Singleton, the mother of daughter Molly, was delighted to welcome the nurse into her home, safe in the knowledge that she would see her soon again. But for Ms Singleton the security bubble of knowing frequent calls by a public health nurse to monitor her baby’s developmental stages burst when she was told she “might not” have another such visit. The service was pulled due to a lack of nurses. “We were left on our own after that, to be honest. I kept thinking we could get more visits, but we didn’t,” said the 33-year-old, who lives in the Drimnagh, Dublin 12, and is on a sabbatical from her career in paediatrics. “When I needed to weigh my daughter for some medicine when she was almost one-years-old, it became apparent that she was not meeting milestones when it came to her weight. “I contacted the local public health centre where Molly was seen and I was told she needed a referral to see a dietitian, but that they did not have a dietitian and that maybe someday she would be seen. “There were no resources made available to the centre. So we had no other option but to see a dietitian privately, which cost around €170, but we were lucky we could afford to do so.” Thankfully Molly gained weight when her calorie intake was increased. Ms Singleton said that “it’s well known that intervention if it’s needed in a child’s early months and years” was vital. “I’m totally gobsmacked by this. The service provided by public health nurses should not be allowed to be pulled like this. The safety nets are completely gone,” she said. Julie Blakeney (38), whose son Walter McEvoy Blakeney is now almost two, was delighted to have a visit from her public health nurse two days after they had left hospital. “I was so appreciative of her help and guidance, but when she was leaving I was also informed that I might not see her again. And she was right, I haven’t,” she said. “This is such a basic need that should be in place everywhere. I’ve been left to research whether Walter is meeting his milestones on my own.” But what “really annoyed” Ms Blakeney, who runs her own communications business, was a leaflet that came through her door telling her and others, also in Drimnagh, that for public health nursing services they should “scan the QR code” provided to check to see if developmental guidelines were being met. “There seems to be a real disparity of care in areas of Dublin and in the parts that really need them. Areas such as Clontarf, Glasnevin, Fairview, Blackrock or Terenure don’t seem to be affected by the lack of public health nurses. There certainly seems to be levels of inequality.” Dr Tadhg Crowley, who chairs the Irish Medical Organisation’s GP committee, said “replacing primary health nurses with non-specialist nurses or services” was not a solution and was “worrying for parents” and GPs. “At a human level, a primary healthcare nurse enters a home and sees exactly what is happening. They are another set of eyes. By stopping such a service my fear is that it will not come back to what that level was before. It is like kicking a person when they need the help of the primary health nurse the most,” he said. A HSE Dublin and Midlands spokesperson said it was “experiencing challenges in relation to the recruitment and retention” of public health nurses (PHNs) within the Greater Dublin Area. Staff shortages mean that some areas are operating what is called a “Priority 1 (P1) service as per the National Caseload Prioritisation Procedure for the PHN service”. What this means to parents and children is the HSE is now “prioritising essential services in line with immediate clinical needs and national guidelines” and “unfortunately” some services will not be provided. The HSE said those overseeing the Dublin and Midlands region were working to address service provision and said this included the development of partnerships between acute hospitals and community partners to provide graduate nurses with opportunity for a clinical rotation to the community and to initiate a similar opportunity for experienced registered nurses working within hospitals. In addition, the Department of Health has allocated 26.7 such posts with priority allocation to the three areas where there are high pressures, which include Dublin south city, Dublin west and Dublin southwest. The department said efforts were under way to fill the positions as quickly as possible. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Warrior queen meets rock’n’roll: Róisín Gartland pushes the boundaries of traditional art practices

When Kate Moss rocked up to the Dior men’s wear show in Paris recently, her hairy black coat worn over a filmy silk dress had the fashion set swooning. A similarly bushy but floor-length number sported by Claudia Winkleman in The Traitors dubbed “the full yeti” reinforced the current trend for shaggy cover-ups. In Ireland history tells us that heavy woollen capes called shaggy mantles were fashionable for centuries. Being warm, impermeable and practical, they were, in effect, raincoats and once defined Irish identity. Thousands were exported abroad until Irish dress was banned by Henry VIII. All this came to mind seeing some of the most magnificent and stylish Spanish lambskin coats, capes and curly shearling gilets made by Róisín Gartland in her Pearse Street Tower studio in Dublin, testimony to her outstanding skills and craftsmanship. Modelled here by Olwen Fouéré, the look of these outfits, complete with silver jewellery, crocodile and leather armoury, is warrior queen meets rock’n’roll. Gartland’s creativity, fuelled with diplomas and degrees in art history, fine art and sculpture, now extends well beyond virtuoso workmanship, her practice encompassing sculpture, painting, bronze casting and other materials. She is currently one of 12 people selected for pushing the boundaries of traditional practices for a European Marie Curie research project called Somas, which involves her every movement and thought being recorded and filmed as she works. The data collected will be exhibited in Cyprus later this year, “so I am starting on the road of documentation”, she says with a smile. [ Our fashion designers make waves globally, so why don’t we value their cultural contribution here?Opens in new window ] Having founded the business in 1987, with celebrity fans who included Sean Penn, Bono and Brian Friel, she closed commercial work some years ago, having decided to study fine art. “I needed to open new pathways and came back to education in my 40s and 50s because I left school very young,” she says. “Fine art was where I wanted to be because for me it’s more expansive than fashion and had the longevity that fashion didn’t have. Leather is very sculptural and comes in many forms, so I came back to it with a whole other perspective. People don’t realise that every piece must be cut by hand, so I started to see my skills as my passport. As long as I could make something that could sell, it would enable me to do everything else.” Gartland shows me the fur knife she inherited from her father, a Dublin furrier – brass with flexible blades – which like Philip Treacy’s thimble, is the tool of her trade. “I grew up from a young age watching him work at home and that is where I got the knowledge. I use it all the time and when I put it in my hand I remember myself as a little child standing on tiptoe looking at him cutting into the material and the deftness of his movements.” Leather, she explains, works in all sorts of different ways to other materials in the way it stretches. “There are areas where it stretches and areas where it doesn’t, so when I am designing I am thinking of the full potential of the material. It has a multiplicity of possibilities,” she says. She also adds that her leathers and lambskins can be washed. “The secret is to use non-bio powders. Use Woolite for wool or special products like Doterra On Guard, which uses blends of oils on a wool wash – recommended for my leggings. Just never use fabric softener,” she cautions. [ Stop using fabric softener – your clothes will be just as clean, if not even cleanerOpens in new window ] She has two studios; one in which she carries out her work, furnished with hides of all types, paper patterns, tools, machinery and worktables; the other, alongside, combines aspects of an art gallery and a shop with exhibition pieces only for display and one-off pieces that can be bought directly from her. Worth seeing are some of the dramatic outfits she created for the TG4 series on witches in 2022 – one piece, its bodice embellished with silver, was made from white Japanese leather. “We put it into an ancient Irish bog in Connemara and left it there for two years. When I took it out during Covid, it had an earthy colour, creamy beige with [what looked like] three indigo masked figures from plant material – those colours died overnight but from those images I created the stamp [of my brand] of the Triple Goddess.” Another skirt in ultra-luxurious Japanese hand-dyed indigo leather is mud spattered from being dragged along the floor in Morrigan’s Cave (known as the Cave of Cats) for the series. Pieces for sale include glossy leather jackets, shaggy pile coats and capes, gilets in supersoft Spanish merino lambskin, curly Toscana sheepskin and vegetable tanned leather. There are leggings, capes, tees, scarves and hoodies as well as smaller affordable items – functional but stylish keyrings, travel bags, cuffs and fingerless gloves. Newly arrived lambskins come in rich burgundy, brown, flame orange and black “and here I am with all these materials, and I can go anywhere with them. It’s a clean slate,” says Gartland, stroking the deep piles. What she is most enthusiastic about, however, is pirarucu, the skin of a fish native to the Amazon whose large natural scales create a unique, exotic look. “I first came across it at a show in Paris or Milan about seven or eight years ago and fell in love with it. After treatment the soft scale surface of this giant fish is like a honeycomb,” says Gartland. She has made a specially commissioned dramatic shoulder bag from it with matching leggings for the collector and curator Jobst Graeve, with whom she has collaborated on many out of the ordinary piece including a floor-length black leather cape anchored with silver. “He delights in the process, and I delight in the process”, she says of their association. Her work on a fish skin mantle was part of the European project. Fouéré, who displays these pieces with such power, describes Gartland, with whom she has worked on several projects, as “an artist who happens to work with materials and has a practice that is totally part of her. She came into my world and her contribution was extraordinary, full of magic. Her craft, her understanding of materials is deep, and her work, like embossing leather, is so painstaking. She’s like one of those people whose craft goes back to antiquity.” roisingartland.com Prices on request Stockists of Gartland’s accessories include Onyx in Blackrock, Granny’s Bottom Drawer in Kinsale and Havana, Donnybrook © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: AIL round-up: Clontarf beat Cork Con to make it tight at the top

Only one point separates the top four in Division 1A after a weekend in which, despite dropping a place to fourth, Clontarf were probably the biggest winners. Their dramatic 15-13 victory over Cork Constitution at a rain-soaked Castle Avenue completed a double over the reigning champions. Clontarf had most of the possession, territory and visits to the red zone but Con led 7-0 at the break thanks to a try by George Good. After an Aaron Coleman try for Clontarf, the visitors looked well placed to extend their eight-game winning when James Taylor’s superb penalty put them 13-5 ahead. But after a Conor Kelly penalty, Clontarf laid siege and had claims for a penalty try rejected before appearing to have butchered their last chance. However, Con opted to run down the clock off their ensuing scrum, Adam Maher fumbled on his own line and Coleman pounced for his second try. Kelly’s conversion was the last kick of the game. Clontarf can go top if they beat City of Armagh in their game in hand next Saturday. Con stayed top as Terenure’s seven-match unbeaten run ended with 31-29 loss in City of Armagh, who thus completed a double over last year’s runners-up. The home side led 24-8 early in the second half through tries by Andrew Willis, Jonny Morton and Sam Cunningham before a quick-fire double by Jordan Coghlan and Ethan Reilly made it a two-point game. After Cunningham’s second, a try by Alan Bennie earned the visitors two bonus points although they left aggrieved after the referee’s positioning of the game’s last penalty before messing up their last lineout. St Mary’s returned to winning ways with a 36-14 win over UCD at Templeville Road as tries by Daniel Leane, Mark Fogarty, Greg Jones, Richie Fahy and Leandro Ramirez earned them an unrivalled 10th attacking bonus point. Lansdowne are six points outside the top four after a 29-14 home win over Young Munster, a result that severely dents the latter’s semi-final hopes. Andy Marks set Lansdowne on their way with his 11th try of the season, and further tries by Jack Matthews, Hardus van Eeden and Juan Beukes sealed a five-point haul. On a mostly grim day for Limerick clubs Garryowen led 12-7 at half-time in Dooradoyle thanks to two tries by Ronan Quinn. But Zac Ward’s second and the boot of Conor Rankin inflicted a 13th successive loss on the home side and kept Ballynahinch’s play-off hopes alive. Old Belvedere and Instonians took big strides toward the 1B and 2A titles respectively with 13-10 and 31-12 home wins over Old Wesley and Corinthians. Trinity had an important 20-19 win over Shannon at College Park to ease fears of a second successive relegation while increasing the chances of that happening to the nine-time champions - four points adrift in 10th place and 12 behind the students. Such a fate looks inevitable for free-falling Buccaneers, whose 13th defeat in 13 games, by 42-10 at home to Old Crescent, leaves them 18 points adrift in 2A.

Title: Bitcoin ETF: Abu Dhabi Sovereign Wealth Fund Discloses $437 Million BlackRock Holdings

According to a recent filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund currently holds a significant amount in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund). This purchase came in the final quarter of 2024 after asset management firm BlackRock secured the commercial license to operate in Abu Dhabi last November. On Friday, February 14th, a 13F filing with the SEC revealed that Mubadala Investments purchased $436.9 million of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF shares (with the ticker IBIT). Mubadala Investments is one of Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth funds, which makes investments on behalf of the Middle Eastern city’s government. In 2024, the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock — with tens of trillions of dollars under management — disclosed its intentions to expand in the Middle East, focusing on the capital city Abu Dhabi and Riyadh. The recent $437 million purchase of its Bitcoin ETF accentuates BlackRock’s mission to work closely with sovereign wealth funds in the region. Interestingly, this latest acquisition is hardly the first time Abu Dhabi’s government — through its various investment entities — would dabble into cryptocurrencies. In 2023, the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company and Marathon Digital revealed plans to launch digital asset mining operations in the capital city. Interestingly, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has also enjoyed a fair share of domestic attention in the United States. On Friday, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board also reported an increased exposure to the premier cryptocurrency through the exchange-traded fund. According to the filing with the SEC, Wisconsin’s pension fund now holds around $321 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs. This represents an estimated 100% increase from the board’s $164 million BTC ETF holdings (previously reported in May 2024). As of the last filing, the Wisconsin pension fund held approximately 2.4 million (worth approximately $100 million) shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and 1 million shares (valued at $64 million) of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). However, the latest filing shows that the pension fund has allocated all of its BTC exposure into BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund and no longer holds any shares of GBTC. It is worth noting that the price of Bitcoin has grown by nearly 70% since May 2024. As of this writing, the premier cryptocurrency is valued at around $97,250, reflecting a mere 1% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the Bitcoin price is up by roughly 90% in the past year. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Business cannot thrive on radically transparent blockchains

Time Published: 2025-02-16T06:00:33Z

For millennia, businesses have relied on a careful balance of confidentiality and transparency to operate, unless we fix that balance, enterprises won’t adopt blockchains, says Matthew Niemerg of Aleph Zero. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post by Matthew Niemerg, Co-founder of Aleph Zero. In the grand halls of Florence’s Palazzo Medici, during the Renaissance, the legendary banking family conducted their affairs with an intricate dance of transparency and secrecy. While their ledgers tracked every florin with meticulous precision, access to these records was guarded as carefully as the gold in their vaults. This delicate balance between accountability and confidentiality wasn’t just good business—it was essential for survival in the complex web of Renaissance politics and commerce. Five centuries later, as blockchains are innovating both finance and business, we appear at risk of forgetting that fundamental lesson. The idea that all transactions should be permanently visible on public ledgers isn’t just naive—it’s catastrophic for business adoption. Consider a modern manufacturer negotiating with suppliers. In traditional banking, while transactions are verified and recorded, the details remain confidential—known only to the parties involved and their financial institutions. Now, imagine conducting these same negotiations on a public blockchain where every payment, every contract term, and every business relationship is visible to competitors, customers, and market manipulators. It’s equivalent to forcing businesses to publish their entire accounts payable and receivable in real-time, complete with transaction amounts and counterparty identities. Transparency should mean verifying that transactions follow agreed-upon rules, not exposing every business decision to public scrutiny. Just as Netscape’s introduction of SSL in the 1990s made e-commerce viable by securing online transactions, blockchain networks need robust privacy mechanisms to achieve mainstream business adoption. In a 2020 McKinsey survey, healthcare and financial services achieved the highest score for trust from consumers. Both industries are also two of the key adopters of blockchain. Without secure and confidential infrastructure, these sectors risk eroding the very trust they’ve spent decades building. A doctor’s prescription, a patient’s treatment plan, or a company’s financial restructuring can’t be broadcast to the world on a public ledger—no matter how secure the verification mechanism might be. The stakes are even higher today. As businesses consider moving more operations on-chain—from supply chain management to intellectual property licensing—the need for confidentiality becomes acute. A pharmaceutical company developing a breakthrough drug can’t risk exposing its research investments through transparent blockchain transactions. A retail chain shouldn’t broadcast its inventory management strategies to competitors through visible smart contracts. Moreover, the permanent nature of blockchain records amplifies privacy concerns. In traditional systems, historical transaction data eventually becomes less accessible. But on public blockchains, every transaction remains visible forever—creating an indelible record that could reveal business strategies, pricing patterns, and relationship networks to future competitors or adversaries. The solution isn’t to abandon blockchain technology’s promise of improved verification and automation. Instead, we must embed privacy into these systems from the ground up. Zero-knowledge cryptography offers a pathway, allowing transactions to be verified without revealing their contents. This technology could enable businesses to leverage blockchain’s benefits while maintaining essential confidentiality. Some blockchain purists might protest that this approach contradicts the technology’s founding principles of transparency. But they misread history. Bitcoin’s innovation wasn’t in making all transactions public—it was in solving the double-spending problem without requiring trust in a central authority. Privacy-preserving technologies can maintain this trustless verification while protecting sensitive business information. The two are not mutually exclusive. The history of banking privacy, from ancient temples to modern Swiss banks, demonstrates that confidentiality isn’t antithetical to trust—it’s essential for it. Temples’ religious role gave them a reputation for integrity and discretion. Likewise, the Medicis didn’t survive and thrive for centuries by broadcasting their clients’ financial affairs to all of Florence. They succeeded by innovating a double-entry bookkeeping system that kept client information accurate and private, ensuring trust through discretion. As we architect the future of business on blockchain networks, we must learn from this history. The next generation of blockchain protocols must incorporate privacy as a fundamental feature, not an afterthought. Zero-knowledge proofs, confidential smart contracts, and private transaction pools aren’t just technical innovations—they’re essential building blocks for practical business adoption. The stakes extend beyond individual privacy concerns to the very architecture of our future financial systems. Without robust privacy solutions, public blockchains risk pushing enterprises toward private, permissioned networks—a trend we’re already seeing. JPMorgan’s Kinexys platform and the Hyperledger-based networks used by Walmart and Maersk for supply chain management demonstrate how major corporations are choosing controlled environments over public infrastructure. While these private networks serve immediate business needs, they fragment the blockchain ecosystem and limit the network effects that make public chains so powerful. Much like how corporate intranets in the early internet era eventually gave way to the public web once security measures matured, public blockchains need privacy-preserving technologies to avoid being sidelined by enterprise-specific solutions. Thankfully, this remains a limited trend, as major corporations like Ubisoft, BlackRock, and Warner Music Group continue to use public blockchains for their business use cases. However, this progress could reverse unless chains build confidentiality into their core infrastructure. The Renaissance bankers understood that privacy wasn’t about hiding misdeeds—it was about creating the trust and security necessary for commerce to flourish. As value increasingly moves onchain, we would do well to remember their wisdom.

Title: ‘I cried for two days solid’ – Keith Barry on the grief of his father’s death from lung cancer

Keith Barry Magician and entertainer Keith Barry has opened up about his experience with grief following the death of his father, who he described as “my best friend”. Ken Barry died “peacefully” last month at Our Lady's Hospice and Care Services in Blackrock, Dublin following a battle with stage four lung cancer. “He was the best dad and my best friend as well as being my dad. When he passed away it was painful,” he said, speaking on RTÉ’s Sunday with Miriam. Barry described his father as well-known, a “real gregarious character” and the life and soul of the party, who was “always the last man to bed”. His father was one of the co-founders of Tipperary Crystal, as well as Smart Telecom and featured on the Late Late Show a number of of times. He was also a judge in the Rose of Tralee for a number of years. While remembering his father as a “great man for the whole of my life”, the mentalist stressed their relationship growing up “wasn’t without strains”. Keith Barry Today's News in 90 seconds - 16th February 2025 The family, comprising of Keith, his sister Michelle, mother Kitty and father Ken, grew up on a country road in Williamstown, Waterford, living on a third of an acre, with animals, BMX bicycles and the space to enjoy all the delights of rural, country Ireland. "But when I was 15 to 18, my relationship with my dad was a bit strained. Looking back... it was probably all me, and you don't think of that at the time, but it was just probably a teenager acting out and then he reacted to that. “So it was strange for a couple of years, but then something magical happened when I was 18, 19, 20. I was in college, so I would see him every kind of weekend and ultimately our bond just really forged together,” he said. He added that his father was “my confidant, my mentor, my advisor”, who was also “one of the lads”. Up until his father’s passing last month. His father would join Barry and his friends on fishing trips. He said it was almost strange at the funeral. "My friends weren't turning up to console me, they were turning up because they had lost one of their friends in my Dad, you know,” he said. Despite not being a smoker, Barry said his father got lung cancer and was very sick for the last two years, and he and his mother ultimately became his carer. He described that period as “really difficult” as he neither he nor his father really wanted him to be his carer. "He was ready to to pass away and then when he did, ultimately, I was strong through it all. And then I cried for two days solid and that grief kind of overwhelmed me,” he said. However, two days later, that feeling “lifted” and he began to think of his father with a smile, magnifying the positive experiences they had together. “I feel guilty almost some days for not grieving more because I grieved hard and fast. I actually feel quite good at the moment. And and there's certainly a lot of guilt with that. "You wonder. Jesus, should I be crying more? Should I feel sad? I am sure that down the line it'll come back and get me,” he said. He added that the last rugby match for Ireland, was difficult, as his Dad would usually belt out the national anthem when they went to watch it together. However, although difficult to watch his father hooked up to machines in St James Hospital at the end of his life, he is glad he got to say goodbye. “I even got to ask him, ‘Dad, what kind of funeral do you want? Do you want an open casket? A closed casket?’ “That was a hard conversation to have with him and then the hard part is him telling me, ‘look after your mum, look after your sister’. It was tough. "I think it was important for him to know when he was passing. But look, I'll look after mum. She'll be fine. Me and my sister will be fine and it's OK to to pass on to wherever you think you're going,” he told his father. Non-religious, his father asked for three things: no religious service, that everyone wears bright colours and that there is a big party afterwards. “We turned up at Mount Jerome and it was a bit weird. There was a funeral in one of the buildings across from us. They were having a traditional funeral, wearing black and it was quite sombre. And then you look right next to them. “We were all in bright colours, we looked like we were going to a nightclub in Ibiza. So we honoured it,” he said. Since his father’s passing, his mother has comes to stay with Barry’s family two or three nights per week, after losing her partner of 56 years. “I think the most important thing is just surrounding yourself with positive people and people who are willing to give their time and just sit with that person and talk to them. There’s plenty of people around mum that will sit with her and just help her through this difficult time,” he said. “So yeah, look, we'll do our best and I'll be there for her as well as my wife, you know, and our two kids as well will help with the distraction.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Owning its own home pays for Fine Gael when it comes to funding elections

When it comes to financing elections, it pays to be a property owner, rather than a renter. Land registry records show that Fine Gael remortgaged its headquarters at 51 Upper Mount Street last September with Bank of Ireland to raise money for its election war chest. The party previously did the same thing in 2011, reportedly raising about €2.5 million ahead of that year’s general election. This time it raised €1.5 million, it said this weekend. While we have to wait for the Standards in Public Office (Sipo) to tell us how much each party spent on the recent European, local and general elections, we already know because of EU digital transparency rules that Fine Gael spent the most in the run-up to the general election with the various social-media giants. All parties and candidates spent about €870,000 combined, with Simon Harris’s party accounting for about €280,000 of the total, including more than €100,000 in the final two days of the campaign. The next highest spender was Fianna Fáil, which handed over €170,000 to Zuckerberg, Musk et al over the course of the campaign. Fianna Fáil doesn’t have a blue-chip office to remortgage to raise funds for the glut of elections we’ve had in recent months, not to mention a presidential election to come before the end of the year. In 2001 it had to sell its base of 70 years on Upper Mount Street to clear a party debt of €1 million to financial institutions. Since then it has been renting another office at 65-66 Lower Mount Street, paying “dead money” to its landlord, the National Maternity Hospital. Beneath the fake tan and tiaras, the Rose of Tralee is a hot mess – at least financially. Records released under the Freedom of Information Act show the organisers of the pageant are keeping their outfit together with the equivalent of a safety pin. Last year Anthony O’Gara, the festival’s managing director, asked Kerry County Council to secure the future of the pageant by becoming its exclusive lead sponsor. O’Gara said that every year the festival’s goodwill was “divided among competing commercial interests that have little or no connection to Kerry – our proposition is that we should change that”. The council was offered a judge on the jury, the council’s brand on the rose’s sashes and more events taking place in Kerry. But instead of becoming its lead sponsor, the council contributed only €50,000 directly to the festival last year, down from the €120,000 it has traditionally given. It spent the balance on an accompanying street carnival in Tralee, which used to be paid for by the festival. The records released show O’Gara pulled out of hosting the street festival in 2023, saying he had to focus on securing the “core elements” of the annual pageant. Also gone since 2022 is the Rose Ball, a dinner dance featuring the roses and their escorts, which O’Gara said lost more than €100,000 in its last year. In 2023 the festival lost €72,321, according to its most recent accounts, brining its total liabilities to €320,984. It’s also facing two separate legal actions by American shareholder Richard Henggeler, who wants a loan made by him to the festival to be repaid immediately. Yet O’Gara remains confident this year’s event will come up smelling of roses. This weekend he said the pageant “returned a small profit last year and we are confident that the festival will continue to flourish”. Businessman Dermot Desmond gave his blessing to plans for a new clubhouse at Wanderers FC on Merrion Road when the rugby club applied for planning permission for a swanky new two-storey pavilion with a bar, gym, changing rooms and a physio room four years ago. Desmond said the upgrade would “benefit the entire community”. “It is great to have clubs like Old Belvedere RFC and Wanderers – the second-oldest rugby club in Ireland – in such a residential area, providing excellent playing fields for senior, junior and underage teams,” he said in a letter supporting the club’s application. Dublin City Council approved the plans but the tricky conversion has been on hold since. The council asked Wanderers for a €180,000 contribution towards local infrastructure. Wanderers argued it should be exempt given it is a not-for-profit organisation. Last week An Bord Pleanála finally sided with the council, ruling that Wanderers had failed to prove it would not “accrue some profit or gain” from the enhanced facilities. If only Wanderers knew a sympathetic billionaire. Former rugby players Jamie Heaslip, Seán O’Brien, and brothers Rob and Dave Kearney have been expanding their pub empire with businessman Noel Anderson. Last year, for €5.5 million, they added McSorley’s in Ranelagh to their other Dublin watering holes: Lemon & Duke, The Bridge 1859, The Blackrock and Little Lemon. They have christened their pub chain Grand Slam Bars, sticking in a trademark for the name late last year. Unfortunately for the guys, Perry Ellis International, a clothing company that specialises in golf and tennis wear, cried foul, saying they were breaching its European trademark for the name “grand slam”. Anderson said this weekend an agreement had been reached with the company. The pub chain can use the phrase Grand Slam Bars and even sell merchandise – as long as they stick to rugby-themed clobber. Last week we reported how White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt took aim at USAid funding a concert by Other Voices at the US ambassador’s residence in Ireland in 2022 called Dignity: Towards a More Equitable Future, which we mistakenly said was also funded by Rethink Ireland. Word reaches us that then Minister for Equality Roderic O’Gorman attended a separate event before the concert which included panel discussions on topics such as barriers to inclusion. While that event was organised by Rethink Ireland, it was funded by a €32,000 grant from the US embassy. Let’s hope it’s not on the pugnacious Leavitt’s radar. The Seanad has had its fair share of drones over the years. Now it has its first beekeeper. Fine Gael’s PJ Murphy, elected to the Seanad’s Agricultural panel, runs Ardrahan Apiary in Co Galway, which has more than 70 hives. Murphy, who is also a farmer, produces all kinds of natural honey, including soft set ivy honey made using nectar from the flowers of the ivy plant. A previous member of the Seanad, Vincent P Martin, once suggested setting up a beehive on Leinster Lawn. If it happens in this Seanad term, they have the very man for the job. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Before and after: transforming a vacant Blackrock bakery into a luxury downsizer home

Familiar to generations living locally, Bennett’s Bakery shop on Blackrock’s main street garnered a huge amount of attention when it first came to market in 2021 with an AMV of €375,000. It had no heating of any sort, nor was there a screed of insulation. It needed rewiring, replumbing, new windows and a bathroom. Its conversion needed a knowledgeable approach. It first sold to an Irish person overseas, who then realised that the project was too large to undertake from afar, according to the selling agent DNG. The 68sq m (732sq ft) property went back on the market, and it was at this stage a retiree living on his own in a four-bedroom semi off Mount Merrion Avenue spotted it. He was looking to trade down. A building engineer, with the knowledge and experience to tackle the job, the new owner also had a bulging contacts book of talented tradesmen to execute the refurbishment. “I had considered downsizing to an apartment but couldn’t find anything nice,” he says. “It (the bakery) was so central. I knew I could get a second space in for the grandchildren to come and stay.” He was also, as he says, “looking for a bit of wow factor”. And he has found it in spades here; that is, after the serious renovation works. He paid €470,00 for the former bakery in May 2022, according to the property price register, and ploughed in about the same amount again to do it up. The Bennett’s signage remains, but the grey concrete render is gone. Its warm red brick facade is now expertly repointed. Inside, the result is a warm and toasty abode, with everything the village of Blackrock has to offer on his doorstep. He is in the heart of the action, surrounded by 34 coffee shops, restaurants, bars and cafes, according to his count, rather than being on his own in a semi in suburbia. “By making the move I have freed up a family home,” he says. The one-way glass in the front room window allows him to watch what is going on outside without being seen. [ How to establish your own interior design styleOpens in new window ] “Being able to look out and watch the world go by is a beautiful experience,” he says. The odd passerby, however, remains intrigued enough to literally cup their hands against the glass to try to peer in. “I think they think it’s a shop,” he says. It’s happened enough times that he is now considering putting a discreet sign up to say it is a private residence. And intriguing it is. He rejigged the layout in favour of an open-plan approach downstairs. Large format porcelain tiles are warmed by underfloor heating. He doesn’t have a Ber for the building, but says the insulation levels in the walls, floor and ceilings are high. The heating is gas, which he puts on for two hours in the morning and he doesn’t need to switch it on again. An electric flame-effect fire from Buckley’s Fireplaces brings in visual warmth. There’s a bathroom on each floor. It’s a man cave with some retiree add-ons. Marine blue is used on bespoke shelving, the window box that surrounds the triple-glazing and on the full-height cabinet doors that conceal kitchen units to the rear of the room. There’s bold floral wallpaper on two of the walls with a double height mirror wall reflecting the room into antiqued mirror-back shelving. A transparent glass spiral staircase, which feels a lot more solid underfoot than it looks, climbs up through the floors. He first spotted this design at a building exhibition. The space is youthful and fun and very much suited to his personality. He’s a ‘why not?’ kind of guy. But he’s also future-proofed it. “Being able to put a lift in was important,” he says, for he has a bad knee. [ How to plan home improvement projects to avoid delays and keep your timeline on trackOpens in new window ] So, adjacent to the stairs is a pod housing a pneumatic vacuum lift that can transport him to the principal bedroom above, and on up to the attic space on the second floor in a jiffy. It’s an innovative self-supporting structure that requires no excavation to accommodate it or the hoist way and machine room that help it function. Installation is directly on to the existing floor. In the case of a power cut, the moving car automatically descends to the lowest level. He says it cost about €50,000 to import and install and he has it serviced twice a year. While the interior is bold and contemporary, homage is paid to the property’s Victorian origins. The most obvious example is the very decorative cornice, actually three different cornices layered together, supplied by The Old Mould Company, with recessed strip lighting to the rear. It was inspired by a hotel visit. Living over the shop or in a converted shop is a way of life on mainland Europe. Here, it could help repopulate our town and village centres. This is a good thing; however, the conversion work takes time and money. This restoration should become a model for shops and buildings lying derelict in towns and villages across the country. If restored, they could accommodate many homeowners We need mavericks willing to spend both to demonstrate the different ways it can be done. There are lots of people willing to give it a go, but finding the pockets deep enough to execute the dream is more difficult. Would he recommend it as an option to others trading down? In a word, yes. “I was able to do it because it was my job, but for ordinary buyers you need architects and engineers, adding to costs,” he says. Fire regulations also need to be considered. “I was okay as I had a rear access.” But the upside far outweighs the difficulties. “The main benefit is location,” he says. “You’re in the heart of it once you go out your front door, with shops and restaurants all around. “This restoration should become a model for shops and buildings lying derelict in towns and villages across the country. If restored, they could accommodate many homeowners.” As a route to home ownership, acquiring a building that was formerly in commercial use is one that appeals to those looking for something a little different – but oftentimes, the properties need a lot of work. The key issue is access to adequate funds to purchase the property and do the work. [ Luxury apartment life above the shop in the heart of Dún Laoghaire for €675,000Opens in new window ] “The problem for home hunters hoping to buy a commercial property that you want to use for residential is that the bank won’t lend to you,” Orla McMorrow, deputy chief executive of the DNG Group, the agency that sold the bakery property, explains. “It won’t issue a residential mortgage.” As such, vendors of such properties should go for change of use planning permission before bringing the property to the market, she says. “Otherwise, you will restrict your buyer profile to cash buyers.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) appears to have reduced its exposure to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund while adding to its position in Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF. A new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicates SWIB holds 6,060,351 shares of BlackRock’s IBIT. With the fund trading at $55.33 at time of writing, that means SWIB’s IBIT exposure currently stands at more than $335.3 million. In a previous filing back in May, SWIB reported owning only 2,450,400 shares of IBIT. However, the May filing indicated the investment board also held 1,013,000 shares of Grayscale’s BTC ETF (GBTC), which were collectively worth around $57 million at the time. In filings submitted in November and this week, SWIB didn’t disclose any GBTC holdings. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board is a state agency managing investments for public retirement and trust funds. It has diversified investments, including cryptocurrency, Coinbase, Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, Block, Cipher Mining, Cleanspark, Microstrategy and other traditional financial vehicles. IBIT is the largest Bitcoin ETF, with $56.38 billion worth of assets under management (AUM), according to data from Coinglass. Fidelity’s FBTC is second with $20.19 billion in AUM, and GBTC ranks third, with $19.28 billion. The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum (ETH) ETFs for trading in July. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

New filings show that the Abu Dhabi Sovereign Wealth Fund has accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars worth of BlackRock’s Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to new filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the wealth fund has stockpiled about $455 million worth of the asset management giant’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). The United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) wealth fund was established in 1976 to promote economic stability and prosperity for the nation. In December, Reuters reported that the fund became the world’s top wealth fund spender, passing Saudi Arabia. Since its launch in January 2024, IBIT has become the largest ETF by market cap based on the flagship digital asset. In November, it was found that IBIT surpassed its gold counterpart in terms of net assets despite BlackRock’s gold ETF launching nearly two decades earlier. According to a recent Bloomberg report, BlackRock secured its commercial license to operate in Abu Dhabi just last year and said it did so to work more closely with sovereign wealth funds, wealth managers and investment vehicles in the area. As stated by Charles Hatami, head of the Middle East for BlackRock, to Bloomberg, “Abu Dhabi has rapidly transformed into a global financial center. Its strategic location, proactive government policies, and commitment to sustainable growth make it an ideal location for capital markets.” IBIT is trading for $55.41 at time of writing, a 1.2% increase during the last 24 hours.

The Middle East, specifically the Gulf, might be ahead of the United States in terms of adoption. Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investments, is now the 7th largest holder of BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, with a $461M investment in Q4 2024. Since it is one of the Emirates of the UAE, this news has intensified the initial speculation that Abu Dhabi might have as much as $40 billion in Bitcoin holdings. Source: Bloomberg Commenting on this update, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted, “The rumors were not just rumors!” Interestingly, the UAE has never officially shared or notified its BTC stash. According to Binance founder CZ, the reported $461M BTC holding could be just the tip of the iceberg for AD alone. He stated, “This report is just from one of the Sovereign Wealth Funds (Mubadala) in AD. There are a few other SWFs in AD.” According to David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, Abu Dhabi has more holdings than stated and other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members are now jumping on the trend. He stated, “Abu Dhabi has gone in much bigger than today’s filing. There’s a couple other GCC members that are making moves too. Was hoping this would be announced at BitcoinMENA but they weren’t ready.” The update has increased calls for the U.S to establish or include a National BTC Reserve in President Trump’s recently announced sovereign wealth fund (SWF). In fact, Bailey also speculated that President Trump’s Commerce Secretary pick, Howard Lutnick, could follow the UAE’s steps and include BTC in the United States’ SWF. Source: X A similar call was made by the Bitcoin Policy Institute, an advocacy group for the cryptocurrency. Part of the group’s report read, “The U.S could use the ~200,000 BTC already in U.S. federal custody from law enforcement seizures to allocate these holdings as seed capital for the SWF without requiring new taxpayer funding.” Worth pointing out, however, that such a move is still massively underpriced by the market, going by Polymarket’s latest odds. In fact, at the time of writing, the predictions site was pricing the possibility at a mere 14% by summer 2025. Source: Polymarket That being said, despite the bullish updates and apparent ‘nation-state’ moves on Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency remained muted at press time. It has struggled below $100k for ten days now, with the crypto valued at $97k or 12% from its ATH at press time.

Title: State Of Wisconsin Goes All-In On BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF With $335 Million Investment

The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) has significantly added to its Bitcoin bet by purchasing more shares in a popular crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF). SWIB doubled its holdings in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust to over 6 million. A Feb. 14 13F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reveals that the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, the entity overseeing the state’s pension fund, now owns over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) fund, worth $335.9 million as of press time. The SWIB in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a Bitcoin ETF purchase, disclosing it had bought shares from both the BlackRock and Grayscale Bitcoin exchange-traded funds collectively worth $164 million at the time. However, Friday’s filing shows that the fund no longer holds any position in Grayscale’s BTC ETF. IBIT has swiftly become one of the fastest-growing spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, accumulating a staggering $40 billion in net inflows since it went live in January 2024. The fund’s assets under management reached $56 billion as of Friday. Although Bitcoin is infamous for its high volatility, institutional investors have a long time horizon for their investments, which allows them to enjoy long-term price gains while disregarding short-term bearish price action. Notably, Bitcoin is emerging as a notable contender to traditional reserve assets like gold and the U.S. dollar, with the potential to transform the global monetary order. Under the new Donald Trump regime, the conversation around Bitcoin has shifted dramatically. Once skeptical, President-elect Donald Trump has expressed support for Bitcoin as a strategic asset, outlining plans for the creation of a U.S. digital asset stockpile to boost economic stability. It’s worth mentioning that other U.S. pension funds are also purchasing crypto exposure. Last year, for example, the State of Michigan Retirement System reported that it had acquired shares in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. And earlier this week, Goldman Sachs disclosed its holdings of more than $1.5 billion in US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including around $1.2 billion in BlackRock’s IBIT.

The cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider Blockchain.com has taken new steps toward a potential initial public offering (IPO) by appointing two seasoned executives with financial and operational expertise. Blockchain.com hired Justin Evans, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs, as its new chief financial officer, Bloomberg reported. It also appointed Mike Wilcox, previously CFO of Velocity Global and former Point72 portfolio manager, as its chief operating officer. Evans said that the exchange is “taking the steps necessary to be a public company, if and when the public markets are available.” The move comes amid a flurry of other cryptocurrency firms reported to be considering going public, including Circle, Kraken, Bullish Global (Parent company of CoinDesk), Gemini, Ripple and BitGo. Growing institutional adoption after major firms, including BlackRock and Fidelity, launched exchange-traded fund (ETF) offerings in the cryptocurrency space and the more balanced approach the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to take toward digital assets are creating a potentially more favorable environment for these firms to go public. Blockchain.com has seen its valuation fluctuate over time. In March 2021, it raised $300 million at a $5.2 billion post-money valuation in its Series C funding round. In 2022, it closed a funding round that increased its valuation to $14 billion, while in Nov. 2023, it closed a $110 million funding round valuing the company at $7 billion.

Title: Trader Says Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokens Looking Better Than Most of the Crypto Market – Here Are His Top Picks

A crypto strategist known for accurately calling the 2021 digital asset cycle top says the real-world asset (RWA) sector is showing a lot of market strength. The analyst pseudonymously known as Pentoshi tells his 854,800 followers on the social media platform X that Chintai (CHEX), Ondo Finance (ONDO) and Clearpool (CPOOL) are three RWA altcoins poised for rallies. RWA crypto projects aim to tokenize traditional assets so that they can be traded on blockchains, enabling efficiency and accessibility, fractional ownership and other benefits. Says Pentoshi, “CHEX, ONDO, CPOOL: RWA play updates. CHEX actually made new highs after the big sell-off two weeks ago, and RWAs had the strongest recoveries of any sector. All structurally look better than most of the market currently with retests of nice high time frame levels.” CHEX is trading for $0.44 at time of writing, flat on the day. ONDO is trading for $1.32 at time of writing, down marginally in the last 24 hours. CPOOL is trading for $0.26 at time of writing, up 10% on the day. The analyst also says that he is bullish on the Ethereum (ETH)-based automated staking service Lido DAO (LDO), and he believes the token may get a boost from potential approvals of ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with staking. “LDO update: big move off the lows, probably a little local resistance here so potentially some consolidation but a great move so far… Next guess is that more staked ETF filings will come through. Then these ETFs will have to decide on infrastructure. So people will have to think about who the infrastructure will be. And companies like BlackRock will choose LDO (will be another too) and some of these will probably have to reprice a bit in theory of course because with markets you never know.” LDO is trading for $1.85 at time of writing, up 10% in the last 24 hours.

Investors can now buy shares that track the price of Bitcoin and not have to worry about storing the asset themselves. Since their approval, investor capital has flooded the space and Bitcoin has broken new all-time price highs, most recently marking a peak just shy of $109,000 in January. Institutional investors are now able to access the crypto space via the regulated funds. Other American pension funds are also buying exposure to crypto. Last year, for example, the State of Michigan Retirement System disclosed that it had bought shares in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

Title: How Does Crypto Help Hedge Against Inflation?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/how-does-crypto-help-hedge-against-inflation/
Time Published: 2025-02-15T14:00:00Z

Rising food prices are a harmful result of inflation. Can you use crypto to protect your pocketbook? Inflation is the systematic erosion of the purchasing power of money. Governments and central banks often attribute inflation to supply shocks, rising production costs or geopolitical instability. These factors may drive temporary fluctuations in inflation under specific circumstances, but they all stem from a deeper, underlying cause: the relentless expansion of the money supply. Persistent inflation occurs when the growth of the money supply outpaces economic output, reducing the purchasing power of each dollar. In simple terms, when more dollars are printed, each dollar buys less. Fiat currencies like the dollar are vulnerable to inflation because governments can create money at will, and often do so for political expediency. Even in times of economic stability, central banks deliberately try to balance inflation at a rate of 2% annually. This figure traces back to a short-lived policy adopted by the Central Bank of New Zealand in 1989. Somehow it took hold, and the entirely arbitrary 2% target has since been enshrined as economic orthodoxy. The stated reason that 2% inflation is desirable is because it “spurs growth,” though no clear mechanism for how inflation drives economic expansion has been identified. Meanwhile, expanding the money supply devalues government debt, enables unchecked deficit spending and imposes a silent tax on the public, all without the need for legislative approval. Inflation is a certainty, like death and taxes. The purchasing power of your dollars will decline over time; the only question is by how much and how fast. The rational response is to store wealth in assets that rise in price as new money enters the system. Stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities and even some cryptocurrencies serve this function, each with its own risk-reward profile. Investing, at its core, is about front-running inflation. But with every investment comes risk. The wrong bet could leave you worse off than if you had simply held cash. As Warren Buffett warned, “Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1.” If the goal is to hedge against inflation—not gamble on speculative upside—the priority should be asset stability. Historically, the “gold standard” of inflation protection has been, well, gold. It won’t make you rich, but its purchasing power has remained remarkably consistent. An ounce of gold today buys roughly the same amount of land as it did hundreds of years ago. Very few assets can claim that kind of track record. For the first time in history, there is a digital alternative, one that combines gold’s scarcity with superior portability, divisibility and censorship resistance. That asset is bitcoin (and to some extent other cryptocurrencies), and its role in inflation hedging is growing. Unlike fiat money, some cryptocurrencies have fixed supplies and are not controlled by central authorities, making them resistant to inflation. Bitcoin, viewed by some as “digital gold,” is the most prominent example. However, other cryptocurrencies are also sometimes used as inflation hedges. Let’s examine some of the ways crypto can serve as a hedge against inflation. Bitcoin’s monetary policy enforces scarcity. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities, bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. This scarcity is enforced by its code and network consensus, making it immune to inflation. Historically, assets with limited supply have been effective inflation hedges. Bitcoin and gold share this quality, but bitcoin has several advantages: it’s more portable, easily verifiable and resistant to confiscation. When inflation accelerates, more investors seek hard assets, and bitcoin will continue to attract investment. Bitcoin operates outside of government and central bank control. No single entity can manipulate its supply or freeze transactions. This independence makes bitcoin especially appealing in economies suffering from currency devaluation or even hyperinflation, where people seek an escape from failing fiat systems. In countries like Turkey and Lebanon where local currencies have collapsed, bitcoin offers a crucial lifeline. Crypto’s borderless nature allows it to function as a global store of value, unbound by the inefficiencies of the traditional banking system. Unlike fiat currencies, which rely on fragmented financial infrastructure and jurisdictional restrictions, cryptocurrency moves seamlessly across the internet, unrestricted by national borders. As inflation accelerates and trust in fiat currencies erodes, people seek alternatives to safeguard their wealth. Gold has long served this purpose, but bitcoin presents unique advantages: it is digital, highly portable and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. For those looking to hedge against monetary debasement, bitcoin stands as a resilient defense against both inflation and currency devaluation. While some altcoins may offer short-term storage of value, their long-term reliability is questionable, making them far too risky to serve as a stable hedge over any meaningful time horizon. A major shift has occurred in recent years as institutional investors recognize bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. With the approval of bitcoin ETFs and firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and BNY Mellon integrating bitcoin into their offerings, institutional participation has surged. This growing demand from institutions adds credibility to bitcoin as a financial asset and strengthens its role as an inflation hedge. Large-scale adoption by hedge funds, corporations, and governments will dampen price volatility and reinforce bitcoin’s value proposition as a long-term store of wealth. Gold and real estate have long been considered inflation hedges, but they have limitations. Gold is difficult to transport and verify, while real estate requires significant capital and lacks liquidity. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer an alternative that combines the scarcity of gold with the accessibility of digital assets. While bitcoin is the primary inflation hedge, it is not impossible that other cryptos may one day offer alternative strategies to hedging inflation risk. While crypto presents a compelling alternative to fiat, it is not without risks. Investors must consider the following challenges before relying on digital assets as an inflation hedge. Cryptocurrency markets are known for extreme price swings. While bitcoin has appreciated significantly over the long term, it has also experienced sharp drawdowns, sometimes losing 50% or more of its purchasing power in short periods. For investors seeking stability, bitcoin’s volatility can a drawback. However, volatility is not equivalent to risk. One would expect prices to stabilize as bitcoin is widely adopted and liquidity deepens. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s most critical property—monetary integrity—is already established. Unlike fiat currencies, where inflation is a certainty, bitcoin’s fixed supply ensures that its inflation risk is effectively zero. Governments and regulatory agencies continue to grapple with how to classify and control cryptocurrencies. While some countries embrace bitcoin as legal tender or an investment asset, others impose restrictions or outright bans. Regulatory uncertainty can affect price stability and investor confidence. While bitcoin’s decentralized design makes it resistant to outright bans, policies affecting on-ramps (such as exchanges) can still restrict access to it. Bitcoin has, at times, shown correlation with equities, particularly during market selloffs. However, this correlation is situational rather than structural, driven by short-term liquidity crises. When investors need cash quickly, they sell what they can, and bitcoin, as a 24/7 liquid asset, is often included in that category. A study of bitcoin’s correlation with major financial assets from 2013 to 2021 found that it is correlated with risk assets over long time periods, with significant short-term deviations. Recently, this has begun to change. In 2024, bitcoin’s correlation with tech stocks was found to be moderate-to-strong on only 10 out of 262 trading days. Bottom Line Crypto, and particularly bitcoin, offers a unique hedge against inflation due to its fixed supply, decentralization and lack of correlation with other assets. While traditional assets like gold remain relevant, bitcoin is also used as an inflation hedge in the 21st century economy. As inflation continues to erode fiat currencies, bitcoin’s role as an inflation hedge is likely to grow, reinforcing its value proposition as "digital gold." Bitcoin is often compared to gold because it shares key characteristics: it is a bearer asset with widespread recognizeability and a limited supply. However, bitcoin also offers advantages over gold. It is more portable, easy to verify and resistant to censorship. Stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, meaning they do not hedge against the inflation of whichever currency they are pegged to. However, in economies with failing local currencies, people may choose to preserve their wealth using stablecoins pegged to stronger currencies, usually the U.S. dollar. Both assets serve as inflation hedges, but bitcoin offers advantages such as digital portability, ease of transfer and predictable supply. Gold has a longer history, but bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a store of value for the digital age. Bitcoin can be a useful hedge against inflation, but its price volatility means it should be part of a diversified strategy. Investors should conduct thorough research, assess their risk tolerance and may choose to invest carefully over time using dollar-cost averaging.

[+] sovereign wealth fund reveals a huge bet on bitcoin. Abu Dhabi’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund purchased $436 million worth of BlackRock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) during the final quarter of last year, according to a regulatory filing. BlackRock led a campaign to get a spot bitcoin ETF approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, led by BlackRock’s $60 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), giving those holding it exposure to its near-600,000 bitcoin. In recent months, rumor and speculation has swirled that countries and their wealth funds are secretly buying bitcoin, helped by explosive comments from BlackRock’s chief executive in January. “Only scratching the surface, buckle up,” David Bailey, the chief executive of Bitcoin Magazine publisher Bitcoin Inc who advised the Trump election campaign on bitcoin strategy and organzied Trump’s July appearance at a bitcoin conference where he first promised to create a bitcoin strategic reserve, posted to X. “Abu Dhabi has gone in much bigger than today’s filing,” Bailey added. “There’s a couple other GCC members that are making moves too,” referring to the Gulf Cooperation Council that includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Abu Dhabi’s United Arab Emirates. “I told you the race was on,” bitcoin-backing U.S. senator Cynthia Lummis posted to X in response to Abu Dhabi 's filing. “It’s time for America to win.” Lummis, a Republican senator from Wyoming, last year introduced The Bitcoin Act to Congress, calling for the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve to reduce the U.S.'s spiraling, near-$36 trillion national debt by buying 1 million bitcoin over five years.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks has teased “important announcements are coming soon" after confirming the Trump administration is exploring the feasibility of a national reserve of bitcoin, similar to the U.S.’s oil and gold reserves. "That is one of the first things we’re going to look at as part of the internal working group in the administration," Sacks said of a potential bitcoin reserve at a press conference earlier this month. Sacks has posted to X that “the inter-agency working group on digital assets is working well together to implement the president’s agenda.”

It costs hurlers, and footballers, to play for their counties. Photo: Sportsfile The startling report by Frank Roche (‘Net zero cost for players is the GPA goal… or else GAA’s amateur status is at risk’, Irish Independent, February 13) is most alarming. An independent report commiss­ioned by the Gaelic Players Association (GPA) and produced by Indecon on their behalf found individual GAA players incur an average net expense loss of €4,602 a year to participate at inter-county level. GPA chief executive, former Mayo midfielder Tom Parsons, predicted that unless the Government and Croke Park step up to ensure inter-county players, male and female, no longer have to pay for the privilege, a growing number will turn their backs on the county game. It’s hard to blame them when they take such a serious hit to the pocket. Many counties are contracting ever-growing management teams on lucrative financial deals, while the GAA players run the risk of injury every time they tog out. When these county players see large management teams being richly rewarded for their time in an amateur sport while they lose thousands of euro on an annual basis, is it any wonder they are inclined to revolt. And who can blame them for looking for their fair share of the national cake? Tom Towey, Cloonacool, Co Sligo When news of the “Blackrock scandal” appeared, I wrote letters to three national newspapers asking a simple question: “What type of applicants for the priesthood were rejected?” Only one paper, the Irish Independent, published my letter and nobody provided an answer. I’m now asking again. Mattie Lennon, Blessington, Co Wicklow The provision of an adequate supply of new houses and apartments is going to be critical to this Government over the next five years. This administration has projected that 300,000 new units will be built over the next five years. There are many commentators who think this number will not be enough or that we will never get to that level of construction. I found the recent report from Mitchell McDermott Construction Consultants to be rather damning. In essence, this consultancy firm is asking what the chances are of getting to 300,000 builds over the next five years, especially if one were to base the number on what has been happening in the last couple of years. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Labour leader Ivana Bacik has come under fire from some quarters for her reasonable demand to solve the housing crisis by incurring debt. The fact is, since independence, this is how public housing has been provided and many more government services to the people. The Republic of Ireland has a very good record in international finan­ces, in particular with the IMF. It is totally misleading and erroneous to state each Irish citizen owes even one cent of national debt. The national debt of €224bn is minuscule compared with the UK at £2.7tn and US at $36tn. A government cannot be run like a household – if it was, many nations would not have clean water, proper sewage disposal, health services and much more. Empirical evidence trumps propaganda any day. Declan Foley, Melbourne, Australia If Ireland’s universities continue down a profit-driven path, students may soon graduate with more experience in corporate finance than in their actual fields of study (‘As colleges become cash cows, students get milked dry’, Irish Independent, February 14). The creeping commercialisation of higher education means degrees now come with price tags that overshadow their true value, while teaching staff are treated as disposable. At this rate, the best lesson students will learn is how to fend for themselves in an institution that increasingly resembles a business park rather than a place of learning. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran, Armagh On August 15, 1998, a beautiful day, I went for my usual daily swim off Tramore beach, Rosbeg, Co Donegal. On my way home to Glenties at around 3pm, I remember well listening to the radio and hearing the sickening news of bombs going off on Omagh’s main street. Now, 26 years later, I’m listening every day to the horrific stories from various people who were caught up in that evil act. How impossible it is to hold back the tears. What more can one say? Man’s inhumanity to man. Brian McDevitt, Glenties, Co Donegal I agree with your editorial that the Taoiseach’s visit to Washington and, presumably, to the White House, should be an opportunity to promote peace (‘Taoiseach can use St Patrick’s visit to US to promote peace’ – Irish Independent, February 13). I would avoid all mention of Trump’s beautiful word, “tariffs”, and focus on peace and how Ireland itself is the beneficiary of the great contribution of the US in achieving peace and prosperity. The G word, “great”, should be the trigger at every opportunity for our Taoiseach, should he meet with President Trump. First and foremost, it is an opportunity to congratulate Trump on his “great” victory. Micheál Martin should repeat that word “great” as often as possible, including his great efforts with the ceasefire in Gaza and his great efforts in pushing Putin and Zelensky to negotiate, even if Trump is trying to tie Ukraine’s hands. I sense a slight disappointment in Europe that Trump is acting the big man in all things Gaza and Ukraine. We should never forget that the US also needs Europe to secure its own prosperity and security. Ending the bloodshed is worth giving peace a chance. A great price has already been paid by both Ukraine and Russia. Should we not be happy if Trump can help achieve a way out for both parties?

Title: Meet The Peter Thiel Acolytes in Donald Trump’s 2nd Administration

Editor Tech Derrick Broze, Independent media alliance, The Last American Vagabond As we approach the third week of Donald Trump’s 2nd presidential term, it is once again clear that Peter Thiel is having an outsized influence on the administration. Peter Thiel is the infamous co-founder of Palantir, the “private” surveillance firm with a long history of involvement and collaboration with the CIA. Thiel is also a Steering Committee Member of the Bilderberg Group, the infamously secretive group which represents the interests of the hidden ruling class. Now, in the second Trump administration, Thiel’s influence is more visible than ever as numerous associates and acolytes of his are set to play various influential roles. I’ve previously reported how Thiel and others in the right-wing of Big Tech decided to go all-in on Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. They argued that this was a defensive move to protect their industries from the encroachment of the Biden/Harris administration. However, despite the hesitance of many of the Silicon Valley CEO’s to embrace Trump in 2016 and 2020, Thiel has a long history of supporting the two-time president. In 2016, Thiel donated $1.25 million to Donald Trump’s first presidential campaign. Despite claiming to have tired of politics and not publicly supporting Trump in 2020 and 2024, Thiel was absolutely a behind-the-scenes advocate for a 2nd Trump term. While speaking at the All In Summit in early October 2024, Thiel claimed that while he was not donating money to any political candidate, he was still supporting Donald Trump and now-Vice President JD Vance “in every other way possible”. “I am still very strongly pro-Trump, pro-J.D.,” Thiel said. Peter Thiel States He Is Still Supporting Donald Trump and JD VanceWhile speaking at the All In Summit, Peter Thiel claimed that he is not donating money to any political candidate in 2024, but is still supporting Donald Trump and JD Vance "in every other way possible". pic.twitter.com/Gt4ak1OIag Despite his years long embrace of Donald Trump, it is also worth noting that Thiel collaborated with the Biden administration. In 2021, I reported on how the Biden administration was receiving criticism for continuing Trump’s plans for a border wall in the form of a “virtual” or biometric wall. One of the contractors for the virtual wall was Anduril Industries, founded by Trump donor Palmer Luckey with funding from Peter Thiel. The message was clear — whether with Trump, Biden, or Harris the U.S. is getting a biometric surveillance state with Digital IDs. Fast forward to 2025, and now that Trump and Vance are occupying the White House, numerous Thiel-affiliated companies are expected to see a big boost in financial revenue. For example, recently Thiel’s Palantir and Anduril, as well as SpaceX and OpenAI, announced a partnership on U.S. military contracts. The move marks the latest efforts by the Technocrats to replace the old guard of the Military Industrial Complex — companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing. This article is a brief look at the many Thiel-connected members of President Donald Trump’s 2nd cabinet. This list is not exhaustive and should be updated with time as more disciples of the Thielverse come into play. Despite not giving directly to the 2024 Trump campaign, Thiel has gained well-deserved scrutiny for his role in financing the rise of Vice President J.D. Vance. Vance, the 40-year-old former Ohio Senator, was in attendance at David Sacks’ June 2024 fundraiser for Trump. Sacks is the partner of Craft Ventures, the former Chief Operating Officer of PayPal. According to “two people with knowledge of the exchange”, during the June event Trump “informally polled the room” regarding who he should choose for his Vice Presidential running mate. David Sacks, Chamath Palihapitiya, and others all told Trump he should choose Vance. Elon Musk also reportedly encouraged Trump to pick Vance. A few weeks later at the Republican National Convention that’s exactly what Donald Trump did. Thiel and Vance have an extensive relationship. Vance claims that after hearing Peter Thiel deliver a speech at Yale Law School in 2011 he was inspired to pursue a career in big tech firms. He started as a junior investor with the Thiel-backed Mithril Capital in 2016. Vance briefly worked at biotechnology firm Circuit Therapeutics, a move which then-CEO Frederic Moll told the NY Times was a “favor to Peter.” In 2019, Vance would found his own venture firm, Narya Capital, with financial backing from the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, the billionaire investor Marc Andreessen, and, of course, Peter Thiel. When Vance announced his run for Ohio Senator, Peter Thiel was there and gave $15 million to the campaign. With this money Vance was able to secure a victory and within two years he was on the way to the White House with the full support of Thiel and other technocrats. While Musk is a powerful and influential technocrat in his own right — choosing to maintain a more public personality than that of Thiel — he and Thiel have their own history of collaboration. Elon Musk and Peter Thiel have been friends for more than two decades and both men received massive financial wealth from their co-founding of PayPal. Thiel has also been a prominent investor in Musk’s various ventures, including Neuralink. People keep saying that X is a "Free Speech" space.Everyone should know that Elon and X are completely inundated within the Peter Thiel Capital Web. Elon Musk, first involved with Peter Thiel when his online banking site https://t.co/01wzux4BwW (not this platform!) was… pic.twitter.com/QzmZXUh2Xz Musk and Peter Thiel also co-founded “America PAC” as their vehicle to support Trump’s return to the White House. In July 2024 it was initially reported that Musk would invest $45 million a month into the Trump campaign. In the end, Musk would give nearly $75 million to the PAC. As promised, Trump nominated Musk to lead the “Department of Government Efficiency”. While the idea of reducing government waste and increasing efficiency is an appealing proposition, it should also be noted that Musk’s talk of efficiency is reminiscent of the little known Efficiency Movement which predated the more well-known Technocracy movement. The Efficiency Movement sought to identify and eliminate waste in all areas of the economy and society, and to develop and implement “best practices”. Supporters of the movement included Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller was a proponent of efficiency, stating, “To help an inefficient, ill-located, unnecessary school is a waste …it is highly probable that enough money has been squandered on unwise educational projects to have built up a national system of higher education adequate to our needs, if the money had been properly directed to that end.” Is the goal of Trump and Elon to make government more efficient to serve the people? Or, is the goal to finally fulfill the dream of the original technocrats and eliminate the political and business classes in favor of “machines” (Artificial Intelligence), centrally planning, and managing society? Time will tell. David Sacks is most well-known for his involvement in the early days of PayPal, serving as the COO with Thiel as the CEO. He is considered a member of the so-called “PayPal Mafia”, a name given to the founders of PayPal who later founded numerous tech companies, including Tesla, LinkedIn, Palantir Technologies, SpaceX, YouTube, and Yelp. In 1998, Thiel and Sacks co-authored the book, The Diversity Myth: Multiculturalism and Political Intolerance on Campus, arguing that political correctness has harmed the college education system and academia in general. The book expanded on the pair’s writings in The Stanford Review, a student-run newspaper founded by Thiel and Sacks in 1987. Peter Thiel and Sacks would later apologize for statements made in the book which belittled rape. In June 2024, Sacks and Chamath Palihapitiya hosted a fundraiser for Trump at Sacks’ home in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. The meeting netted the Trump campaign $12 million after Trump reportedly said he would be “the crypto president”. It was this dinner where the billionaires told Trump he should choose Vance as his running mate. Shortly after his victory in the 2024 election, Trump rewarded Sacks for his loyalty by appointing him as the “AI and Crypto Czar”. In this position Sacks is expected to greatly influence the U.S. government’s policies on cryptocurrency, and the advancement of AI. Howard Lutnick is the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald investment firm and has become a vocal proponent for Bitcoin in the last couple years. Lutnick is also an investor in anti-ESG Strive Asset Management, which was founded by Vivek Ramaswamy. Peter Thiel, the Founders Fund, and J.D. Vance’s Narya Capital also contributed to Strive’s $30 million funding round. Lutnick is also a part owner of video platform Rumble, founded by Chris Pavlovski. In December 2021, Pavlovski announced his intention to take Rumble public by combining forces with CF Acquisition Corp, a division of the Lutnick’s Cantor Fitzgerald. The deal was completed by September 2022 with CF Acquisition Corp providing “approximately $400 million in gross proceeds” to help “build out Rumble’s independent infrastructure”. “With its massive growth in users and engagement, this is an exciting time for Rumble to become public. I am excited to see ‘RUM’ shares trading in the marketplace,” Lutnick said at the time of the deal. Following Rumble becoming a publicly traded company, the top institutional share holders include Cantor Fitzgerald, Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Rockefeller Capital Management, among others. In August 2024 I reported on Howard Lutnick’s appearance at the 2024 Bitcoin Nashville event and his involvement in the Bitcoin community more broadly. During his own speech at Bitcoin Nashville, Trump called Lutnick “one of the truly brilliant men of Wall Street”. That Trump sees Lutnick — one of the most high profile traders of U.S. debt and a Wall Street regular — as a brilliant man is likely a sign that Wall Street banks will continue to influence U.S. financial policy under Trump’s 2nd administration. Lutnick was also formerly a neighbor to Jeffrey Epstein in NYC and raised millions for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 Presidential campaign. Lutnick has spoken at the World Economic Forum’s various meetings as far back as 2016 and as recently as January 2023. At the 2023 WEF meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Lutnick participated in a panel titled, Real Estate at a Turning Point. Another interesting facet of Lutnick’s personal story is that Cantor Fitzgerald’s offices were located in the 101st to the 105th floors of One World Trade Center. The firm lost 658 of its 960 employees due to the terrorist attack. However, Lutnick happened to be accompanying his wife as she took their son to his first day of kindergarten. Donald Trump has appointed Jim O’Neill as deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). O’Neill has extensive connections and collaborations with Peter Thiel. O’Neill worked at two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Clarium Capital and Mithril Capital Management from 2012 to 2019. In 2010, he co-founded Peter Thiel‘s Thiel Fellowship. He also worked as the CEO of the Thiel Foundation from 2009 to 2012. From 2019 to July 2021, O’Neill was the CEO of SENS Research Foundation, an organization focused on “rejuvenation”. The SENS received its initial funding from Peter Thiel in 2006 and 2008, a fact that should come as no surprise given Thiel’s own interest in fighting aging using the blood of the young. Whitney Webb recently wrote a detailed investigation further outlining O’Neill’s connections to Thiel and how his appointment might be used to stifle Robert F. Kennedy Jr. if his nomination is confirmed in the coming weeks. Trump named Ken Howery as his pick for U.S. ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark. Howery previously served as a U.S. ambassador to Sweden, and Trump wrote that he “served our Nation brilliantly” in that role. The connections between Howery, Peter Thiel, and the World Economic Forum run deep. Apparently, Trump sees those connections as a net positive. Howery was another PayPal co-founder with Thiel. The pair also co-founded the venture capital fund Founders Fund. In March 2012, the WEF named Howery a member of the Young Global Leader program. He is also a member of the Selection Committee for the World Economic Forum Technology Pioneers Program. Howery may have been selected for the role of ambassador to Denmark to help Trump fulfill his goal of annexing Greenland. Denmark has administrative control over Greenland as part of its kingdom. Interestingly, Trump’s calls for purchasing Greenland and making it part of the United States mirrors the original Technocrats plan for the “Technate of America”, including Canada and Panama as well. Jacob Helberg was appointed to be undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment. Helberg donated $2 million to Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign. He is an ardent supporter of Israel and a former supporter of Democrats who has said his shift to Trump was a result of Democrats becoming “anti-Israel”. While the Democrats also support Israel and generally vote to give the nation unlimited funding and weapons stockpiles, Helberg believes they are not sufficiently obedient. Helberg is also a senior adviser to Palantir Technologies, the private surveillance firm co-founded by Peter Thiel. Helberg also is also senior advisor to Alex Karp, Thiel’s co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. Donald Trump has named Michael Kratsios to serve as science adviser and director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios also served in the role in the first Trump White House and the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. Kratsios led the 1st Trump admin’s policy specialist on artificial intelligence, drones, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. Kratsios worked for two of Peter Thiel’s funds, Thiel Capital and Clarium Capital. Although Vivek Ramaswamy is no longer involved in DOGE, he is still in Trump’s orbit and has announced a run for Governor of Ohio. It would not be surprising to see Peter Thiel invest in his political campaign. Thiel previously invested in Ramaswamy’s fund, Strive Asset Management. Trae Stephens is a partner at venture capital firm Founders Fund, which was organized by Peter Thiel, Ken Howery, and Luke Nosek in early 2005. Stephens is also the co-founder and chair of Anduril Industries, which was funded by Peter Thiel. Finally, Stephens worked for Thiel’s Palantir Technologies. According to Bloomberg,Trump and his team have consulted with Trae Stephens. Politico has also previously reported that Shyam Sankar, current Palantir chief technology officer, has been considered for the Pentagon’s top research and engineering job. Finally, Blake Masters, who worked for Thiel Capital and for the Thiel Foundation, was reportedly up for nomination as Trump’s head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) at one point. Alex Karp is the co-founder of Palantir Technologies Inc. Karp co-founded Palantir with fellow technocrat Peter Thiel with the assistance of two rounds of investment from CIA’s venture capital firm In-Q-Tel. Karp is also a steering committee member of the Bilderberg Group. While Karp has mostly stayed out of politics in the public sphere, in 2024 he told the NYT that he was now supporting Kamala Harris. While Karp has traditionally supported Progressive politicians and described himself as a radical leftist, and Thiel has supported Conservative politicians, both men are now united in the support of the Trump administration. While there may be real political differences between Karp and Thiel, there is not daylight between the two when it comes to Technocratic solutions. Karp recently told Fox Business how Palantir is ready and willing to help make the U.S. government “more efficient”. Karp is also an open advocate for supporting the Zionist movement. Researcher James Corbett recently noted that, “in November of last year, Palantir issued a letter to shareholders that stressed the company’s support for Israel’s quest to ethnically cleanse Palestinians.” “We are one of a few companies in the world to stand up and announce our support for Israel, which remains steadfast,” Karp wrote in the letter. “Palantir stands with Israel.” Thiel has also made it clear he will not interfere in Israel’s crimes and has no qualms supplying technology which leads to civilian deaths. First, in January 2024 Palantir announced that it had signed a “strategic partnership” with the Israeli Defense Ministry to supply technology for the genocide. In May 2024, protesters accused Thiel of complicity in ‘genocide’, blocking his vehicles for over an hour while he was speaking at the Cambridge Union. Over two hundred students gathered outside the Cambridge Union attempting to “drown out” Thiel’s talk. When Thiel was directly questioned about his support of Israel and their use of AI technology to murder humans, he gave a rambling non-answer. “Look again . . . I’m not . . . I’m not . . . you know, you know . . . with . . . without, without going into all the . . . you know I’m not on top of all the details of what’s going on in Israel, because my bias is to defer to Israel. It’s not for us to to second-guess every, everything. And I believe that broadly the IDF gets to decide what it wants to do, and that they’re broadly in the right and that’s, that’s sort of the perspective I come back to.” When Thiel was asked about #Palantir using its artificial intelligence to help the IDF commit genocide: https://t.co/UCnXCNIu4h pic.twitter.com/BhPh9LVBca Given that Karp and Thiel are willing to turn a blind eye to the crimes of Israel, it should come as no surprise that Trump’s 2nd cabinet is stacked with former and current associates of Thiel’s who also share this zeal for Zionism and Technocracy. Now that we understand the depths at which Peter Thiel’s influence can be seen and felt in the Trump administration, we must ask — who exactly is influencing Peter Thiel’s actions and thinking? In my next article I will dive deeper into the role that Curtis Yarvin aka Mencius Moldbug has played in influencing Peter Thiel and the MAGA movement in general. While the majority of Trump supporters and mainstream Republicans might not be aware of the philosophy of this man, his thinking continues to inspire and inform the actions of the Technocrats like Peter Thiel, J.D. Vance, and Marc Andreesen. Tech Tech Tech Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

During the fourth quarter of last year, Mubadala scooped up $436 million worth of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, according to a quarterly report disclosing U.S. equity ownership filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Totaling 8.2 million in shares of the Nasdaq-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, it appeared that Friday’s disclosure represented a fresh investment by Mubadala in the product. A filing from the previous quarter did not disclose holdings in BlackRock’s $56.3 billion spot Bitcoin ETF. Mubadala did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt. As President Donald Trump’s administration mulls the prospect of a so-called strategic crypto reserve, which may include Bitcoin alongside other cryptocurrencies, some market participants described Mubadala’s move as indicative of an emerging race on a global scale. “Other countries have started moving,” Swan’s Head of Private Clients and Family Offices Steven Lubka said on X (formerly Twitter). Several governments already hold Bitcoin, including the U.S., China, the United Kingdom, and El Salvador, according to CoinGecko. However, the crypto data aggregator noted in an August report that the $32.7 billion sum largely stems from seizures related to criminal activity. As one of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi is part of a growing crypto sector in the Middle East. Last summer, the Blockchain Center in Abu Dhabi launched, saying it “will focus on creating a thriving ecosystem that supports startups, enterprises, and academic institutions through a range of comprehensive services and initiatives.” Though the U.S. may assert itself as a Bitcoin backer through Trump’s proposed stockpile, plenty of states have pushed for investing in cryptocurrencies on their own. While two states have rejected Bitcoin reserve bills, similar legislation is either pending or actively being considered in 21 states, according to Bitcoin Reserve Monitor.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Get $2 Million Boost From National Bank Of Canada
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-get-2-million-boost-from-national-bank-of-canada/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T20:00:13Z

The National Bank of Canada has ventured boldly into the realm of cryptocurrencies. The bank has made $2 million investments in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), changing the way conventional finance views digital assets. This choice emphasizes the evolving scene of controlled crypto investments and the increasing institutional curiosity in Bitcoin. The National Bank of Canada decided on ETFs instead of directly purchasing Bitcoin, following a pattern among financial institutions looking for controlled access to the digital asset. By means of Bitcoin ETFs, one can invest in Bitcoin free from the complications of direct ownership, including security of private keys or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. This investment also coincides with a period of erratic BTC prices, which have lately ranged between $95,000-$97k. 🚨 National Bank of Canada Invests $2M in Bitcoin ETFs 🇨🇦💰 Canada’s sixth-largest commercial bank ($462B in assets) just made a bold move into Bitcoin, purchasing $2M worth of Bitcoin ETFs. 🏦 Institutional adoption is accelerating, with traditional financial giants deepening… pic.twitter.com/aLuBGjUbed — Blockchain North (@BlockchaiNorth) February 13, 2025 Regarding the reception of Bitcoin ETF, Canada is setting the benchmark. The action of the National Bank of Canada is in line with those of other big multinational companies like as BlackRock, which lately started the iShares BTC Trust in the US. The growing participation of conventional banks and asset managers suggests that Bitcoin is starting to acquire popularity as a choice of investment. Despite the surrounding buzz, detractors of ETFs contend they do not provide the advantages of direct Bitcoin ownership. Although ETFs depend on outside custodians, direct ownership of the cryptocurrencies gives investors total control over their money. ETF investments often come with management fees that could cut possible returns. Still, the National Bank of Canada seems to consider ETFs as a safer, more readily available way to expose to Bitcoin free from direct ownership and related legal concerns. Bitcoin’s increasing engagement with the financial sector suggests that digital assets are gradually becoming a part of traditional finance. If additional businesses follow suit, crypto acceptance might increase even more, which would improve its price and market dynamics. The National Bank of Canada’s $2 million investment, albeit tiny at the moment, reflects a broader trend of mainstream financial actors adopting Bitcoin as a long-term asset. As interest in Bitcoin ETFs grows, it is uncertain whether other banks will follow suit, potentially bridging the gap between traditional banking and the cryptocurrency market.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Target co-founder’s daughters ‘shocked and dismayed’ over retailer’s decision to ditch DEI
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/business/target-co-founders-daughters-shocked-and-dismayed-over-dei-decision/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T19:16:22Z
Full Content:
Two daughters of the man who helped build Target into a national retail powerhouse criticized the company’s decision to do away with its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies in the wake of the election of President Donald Trump. Anne and Lucy Dayton, whose father Bruce Dayton and his four brothers expanded their family-owned Minneapolis-based department store and turned it into what is today known as Target, penned a letter to the editor of both the Los Angeles Times and Financial Times on Thursday decrying the change. “As members of the Dayton family, we are shocked and dismayed by Target’s rollback of its Racial Equity Action and Change and Supplier Diversity programs,” the Dayton daughters wrote. The Daytons, who have zero influence in how the company is run, wrote that their father and uncles “transformed a family department store into the national retailer it is today” with work that was “based on a clear set of principles.” “They were excellence, a ‘customer is always right’ mantra and a commitment to the well-being of their community,” they wrote. The two sisters wrote that they were “alarmed how quickly the business community has given in to the current administration’s retaliatory threats.” “It is not ‘illegal’ for a company to create a business model based on what it believes to be important ethical and business standards,” they wrote. Accusing the company of “cowering,” the Daytons wrote that Target was “undermining the very principles that have made their companies a success.” The Post has sought comment from Target. Last month, Target said it is “concluding its three-year diversity, equity and inclusion goals” and will stop its reports to the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index, according to an internal memo obtained by The Post. The Minneapolis-based retailer also said it was ending a program that promoted products from black- and minority-owned businesses. The company, which has gained a reputation in recent years for its corporate “wokeness,” has been scaling back its LGBTQ Pride collections after a backlash from outraged customers over gay-themed kids’ clothing hurt sales. Target was founded in May 1962 as the discount retail division of the Dayton Company, a Minneapolis-based department store chain started up decades earlier by George Draper Dayton. After Dayton’s passing in 1938, his son, George Nelson Dayton, took on a leadership role in the company until his death in 1950. George Nelson Dayton’s five sons — Bruce, Donald, Wallace, Kenneth and Douglas — then took control of the company. Under their stewardship, they created Target, the discount retail division of the Dayton Company. Seven years later, Dayton Company merged with the Hudson Corporation — the Detroit-based department store — to form a retail conglomerate that dominated the Midwest. While the Dayton Company played a crucial role in shaping Target’s early success, the family’s influence gradually diminished as the company grew and transitioned into a publicly traded corporation. By the time the Dayton-Hudson Corporation rebranded as Target Corporation in 2000, the family had already stepped away from executive leadership. Although some members of the Dayton family may still hold shares in Target, they do not have any substantial influence over corporate decisions. Today, institutional investors such as Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street are the largest stakeholders in the company. The Dayton family remains a well-known name in Minnesota, primarily due to their philanthropic efforts and business legacy, but they are no longer tied to Target’s leadership or decision-making processes. Mark Dayton, the brother of Anne and Lucy Dayton, served as the 40th governor of Minnesota from 2011 to 2019. Before becoming governor, he was also a US senator for Minnesota from 2001 to 2007. Bruce Dayton died in 2015. He was 97. Advertisement

Title: AIL previews: Clontarf and Cork Con clash could affect course of season
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/02/14/ail-previews-clontarf-and-cork-con-clash-could-affect-course-of-season/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T19:13:00Z
Full Content:
Turning into the homeward straight of this season’s AIL, the meeting of third-placed Clontarf and leaders Cork Con at Castle Avenue is a meeting of two heavyweights that will probably have a significant impact on the playoff picture. Clontarf (43 points) trail Con (47 points) by four points with a game in hand and rarely lose two in a row. They’re also strengthened by the return of two frontrow stalwarts of recent years in loosehead Ivan Soroka and prolific hooker Dylan Donnellan, both of whom missed last week’s defeat in Young Munster, as well as the Connacht and ex-Ireland Sevens flyer Andrew Smith at fullback. However, the champions are unbeaten in eight. They also welcome back experienced centre Niall Kenneally after his seasonal reappearance off the bench last week. Rob Jermyn shifts to the wing, and Matthew Bowen returns at fullback, while lock Eoin Quilter and flanker Seán Duffy are recalled. Another game of major significance is between sixth and seventh, namely Lansdowne and Young Munster (each on 36 points) on the Aviva back pitch in what looks like a must-win tie for both to retain their playoff hopes. Lansdowne, who’ve won three of their last four, are unchanged, whereas Young Munster are without three of their Munster contingent – Shay McCarthy, Jake O’Riordan and Evan O’Connell – and Adam McBurney. That said, they do have Ruadhán Quinn, who scored two tries last week. The Terenure exodus continues, with Conor Phillips rejoining the Ireland Sevens and Chris Cosgrave going to Japan as a medical joker. Spanish under-20 centre Yago Fernandez makes his first start, with Jules Fenelon recalled on the wing, while Adam La Grue reverts to fullback and Aran Egan to outhalf as Caspar Gabriel is on Leinster duty this weekend. Sitting second on 45 points and unbeaten in seven, Terenure travel to City of Armagh, who are without two casualties from last week in goal-kicking fullback Kyle Faloon and centre Matthew Hookes. Armagh’s results haven’t reflected their competitiveness. Last week’s 31-19 loss away to Con was actually their heaviest of the season and they haven’t lost a home game by more than four points and beat Terenure away in October A very settled St Mary’s will look to return to winning ways at home to UCD, who will be without the Leinster trio of Ben Brownlee, Diarmuid Mangan and James Culhane this week. Mikey Yarr starts at hooker as Bobby Sheehan, with nine tries this season, moves to number eight. Garryowen have picked Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks at fullback, while Kelvin Langan starts at No 10 at home to playoff chasing Ballynahinch, who welcome back Ulster and Ireland Sevens winger Zac Ward. Old Belvedere (59 points) can take a giant stride towards the 1B title and automatic promotion at home to third-placed Old Wesley (43). Similarly, an experienced Instonians (53 points) can tighten their grip on 2A and a fourth successive promotion at home to the youthful Corinthians (49), who have played a game more in second. Last October Corinthians inflicted one of only four defeats on Instonians in their last 48 AIL matches, in which they have registered 46 offensive bonus points. Saturday (kick-off 2.30 unless stated) Energia All-Ireland League Men Division 1A: City of Armagh v Terenure College, Palace Grounds; Clontarf v Cork Constitution, Castle Avenue; Garryowen v Ballynahinch, Dooradoyle; Lansdowne v Young Munster, Aviva Stadium back pitch; St. Mary’s College v UCD, Templeville Road.

Title: ‘AI may become judge, jury and executioner’ – global risks expert to RT
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/612575-ai-may-become-judge/
Time Published: 2025-02-14T18:55:24Z
Full Content:
Last week, Google revised its artificial intelligence principles, removing the company’s stance against using AI to develop weapons or technologies or directly facilitate injury to people, or for surveillance that violates internationally accepted norms. Google’s AI head Demis Hassabis said the guidelines were being overhauled in a changing world and that AI should protect “national security”. RT has interviewed Dr. Mathew Maavak, a senior consultant for Malaysia’s National Artificial Intelligence Roadmap 2021-2025 (AI-Rmap), scholar on global risks, geopolitics, strategic foresight, governance and AI, on the potential consequences of Google’s new policies. RT: Does this mean that Google and other corporations will now start making AI-powered weapons? Dr. Mathew Maavak: First and foremost, Google was largely the creation of the US national security apparatus or simply, the “deep state”.The origins of many, if not all, Big Tech entities today can be traced to ground-breaking research undertaken by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and its predecessor the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). So, the quasi-private entity called Google is inextricably beholden to its “national security” origins, as are other Big Tech entities. Weaponizing AI and creating AI-powered weapons is a natural progression for these entities. Microsoft has long established its own “military empire”. Furthermore, Big Tech platforms have been extensively used for data and intelligence-gathering activities worldwide. This is a reason why China has banned many US Big Tech software and apps. A nation cannot be sovereign if it is beholden to Big Tech! As for Google changing its guidelines on AI, this should not come as a surprise. Big Tech was actively promoting universal AI governance models through various high-profile institutional shills, United Nations agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), think tanks and national governments. Through my recent work in this field, it became abundantly clear that the US government sought to stifle the development of indigenous AI worldwide by promoting half-baked and turgid AI Governance models that are riddled with contradictions. The gap between lofty aspirations and longstanding realities are simply unbridgeable. The same playbook was deployed to push Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) schemes worldwide – imposing heavy costs on developing nations and corporations alike. Now, the US and Big Capital are ditching the very ESG schemes they had devised. Unfortunately, many nations fell for these ploys, investing significant money and resources into building fanciful ESG and AI frameworks. These nations risk becoming permanently dependent on Big Tech under what I call “AI neo-colonialism”. Alphabet’s Google and YouTube, Microsoft’s Bing and Elon Musk’s X have long weaponized their platforms before this recent change in AI policy. Big Tech’s search algorithms have been weaponized to erase dissenters and contrarian platforms from the digital landscape, effectively imposing a modern-day damnatio memoriae.I have to use the Russian search engine Yandex in order to retrieve my old articles. RT: Why is this change being made now? Dr. Mathew Maavak: All weapons systems increasingly rely on AI. The Russia-Ukrainian conflict alone has seen AI being used in the battlefield. The extensive use of drones, with possible swarm intelligence capabilities, is just one out of many anecdotal examples of AI usage in Ukraine. You cannot create next-generation weapons and countermeasures without AI. You cannot bring a knife to a gunfight, as the old saying goes. It must be noted that one of the most profitable and future-proof sectors, with guaranteed returns on investments, is the Military-Industrial Complex. Weaponizing AI and making AI-powered weapons is just a natural course of action for Big Tech. It is also quite telling that the leaders of the two AI superpowers — the United States and China — skipped the recent Paris AI Summit. The event devolved into a scripted talk shop orchestrated by Big Tech. Alongside the United Kingdom, the United States also refused to sign the declaration on making AI “safe for all.” Clearly, this event was staged to suppress AI innovation in developing nations while legitimizing the weaponization of AI by major powers. RT: Google’s ‘principles’, to begin with, are set by Google itself, are voluntary and non-binding under any law. So theoretically nothing was preventing the company from just going ahead with any kind of AI research it wanted. Why did it feel the need to make it “official”? Dr. Mathew Maavak: Google’s so-called “principles” were never determined by the company alone. They were a mere sop for public consumption, perfectly encapsulated by its laughably cynical motto: “Don’t be evil.” Its parent company Alphabet is owned by the usual suspects from Big Capital such as Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street etc. – all of whom are private arms of the US deep state. An entity like Google cannot conduct “any kind of AI research” as its activities have to conform to the diktats of its primary stakeholders. Google formalized its new weaponization policy because the public’s stake in its ownership pie is virtually nonexistent. RT: Is it time to come up with international laws regarding military AI – like Google’s principles before the recent change, but enforceable? Dr. Mathew Maavak: As I have alluded to earlier, various international AI Governance models – all of whom are pretty much a facsimile of each other – were surreptitiously-formulated by the likes of Google, Microsoft, Amazon and other members of the so-called Tech Bros. Nations were just given the illusion of having a stake in this global AI legal and ethics matrix. Bureaucrats merely rubber-stamped whatever Big Tech promoted through various actors and avenues. At the same time, dissenters to this travesty were systematically ostracised. They may however end up having the last laugh in a coming AI-linked SHTF event. (I will save this line of inquiry for another day). There are other vexing issues to consider here: How does one define “AI war crime” within an international legal framework? Is it even possible to come up with a universal consensus? The operator of an armed drone responsible for wiping out scores of civilians might pin the disaster on an AI glitch. The software running the drone itself may have algorithms sourced from various private entities across the world. Who should shoulder the blame in the event of a war crime? The operator, the vendor responsible for software integration or the entity whose algorithm was used or adapted for targeting? Realistically, it should be the antagonist nation but never bet the farm on restitution if the culprit happens to be the United States or a close ally like Israel. Last but not least, governments worldwide acted as co-conspirators in Google’s use of AI to censor dissenting scientific viewpoints and contrarian research findings during the so-called COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, they have effectively handed Big Tech permanent leverage to blackmail them. Furthermore, what do you think facilitates a welter of bioweapons research across 400-odd US military-linked laboratories worldwide? Gain-of-function microbial experimentation is not possible without AI. RT: AI tools in non-military areas of life, such as generation of texts or images, are still far from perfect. Isn’t it a bit early to rely on them in warfare? Dr. Mathew Maavak: The generation of AI texts and images can absolutely be used for warfare, and this is already becoming a significant concern in modern conflict scenarios. AI-generated content can be weaponized via AI-generated texts (propaganda, disinformation etc); AI-generated images/deepfakes (e.g. to subvert national leaderships/consensus); fake intelligence (e.g.create casus belli) and spoofing communications (e.g. subverting chain of command), among others. The possibilities here are simply endless! AI is evolving at an exponential rate. Yesterday’s science fiction is tomorrow’s reality! RT: As reported recently by the Washington Post, Google appears to have been providing AI tools for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since the start of their Gaza campaign. Could the change in the company’s AI principles be linked to that? Dr. Mathew Maavak: I highly doubt it. The IDF’s use of Google’s cloud computing services and related tools (Amazon was teased as an alternative) may arguably be portrayed as the canonical starting point for the weaponization of AI. But why would the IDF want a multinational civilian workforce based in the United States to have access to its military operations? If Google provided AI tools to the IDF, it would have done so under directives from the US deep state. A nominally civilian entity cannot unilaterally supply sensitive AI tools for wartime use to any foreign power, allied or otherwise. Logically speaking, Google’s participation in the Gazan carnage should result in a massive boycott by member states of the Organization of Islamic States (OIC). But this will never happen as too many politicians, “technocrats” and academics in the OIC are beholden to US patronage. (The ongoing USAID scandal is just the tip of the iceberg, revealing the extent of international subversion at play). The rail guards of merit, bias and non-discrimination are also virtually non-existent in the OIC bloc, although they form the pillars of AI governance. All in all, AI principles as they currently stand, whether in civilian or military spheres, are nothing more than a paper tiger. RT: Again concerning the IDF, it has beenrevealed that a lot of the civilian deaths in Gaza were apparently not a result of poor AI tools, but of negligent human oversight. Perhaps military AI, when employed properly, could actually lead to more humane warfare? Dr. Mathew Maavak: Honestly, I don’t think AI had played a significant role in the genocidal war in Gaza. The use of AI would have led to a targeted military campaign; not a mad, blood-stained blunderbuss of terror. This was no “oversight”; this was intentional! Compare Israel’s recent actions in Gaza to the relatively-professional military campaign it conducted in the same area in 2014 – when human intelligence (HUMINT) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) played a bigger role vis-a-vis AI. Did AI dumb down the IDF or is AI being used as a scapegoat for Israel’s war crimes? The bigger question however is this: Why did the IDF’s AI-coordinated border security system fail to detect Hamas’ military activities in the lead-up to the October 7 2024, cross-border attacks? The system is equipped with multiple sensors and detection tools across land, sea, air, and underground — making the failure even more perplexing. In the final analysis, AI is being weaponized across all facets of human life, including religion, and US Big Tech is leading the way. Ultimately, under certain circumstances in the future, AI may be used to act as the judge, jury and executioner. It may decide who is worthy to live, and who is not. We are indeed living in interesting times. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

Wisconsin’s investment board saw fit to significantly add to its bitcoin (BTC) bet in the last three months of the year. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) disclosed ownership of just over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of the Dec. 31, per a 13F filing on Friday, up from roughly 2.9 million shares three months prior. The position is valued at $340 million at IBIT's current price of $56.10 and would be worth about $588 million at bitcoin's current price near $98,000. The fund in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a bitcoin ETF purchase, initially buying 94,562 shares of IBIT and some shares of Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which it later sold. The State of Michigan Retirement System later also reported owning shares of bitcoin ETFs, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and two of Grayscale's bitcoin products. SWIB, established in 1951, oversees more than $156 billion in assets including funds from the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and the State Investment Fund (SIF). The board manages investments on behalf of state employees and other trust funds. Today marks the deadline for institutional investors managing at least $100 million in assets to report quarterly holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The market is closely monitoring these filings to gauge whether large traditional finance firms have been adding bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios since their launch last year. UPDATE (Feb. 14, 18:49 UTC): Updates current valuation of State of Wisconsin's stake in IBIT.

Title: Will Markets Go Up Now That Trump Is President?

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/14/2025 8:30:11 AM PST by SeekAndFind Donald Trump was the first president in modern U.S. history to take office without holding a prior public office or serving in the military. This non-traditional path to the White House came with a distinctly corporate approach to economic and fiscal policy, one that both excited and unnerved investors in equal measure.Key PointsTrump’s focus on tax cuts, deregulation, and tariffs boosted domestic industries but disrupted global trade, benefiting sectors like energy, infrastructure, and defense.Rising national debt and aggressive fiscal policies under Trump could fuel short-term market gains but increase long-term risks and volatility.Trump’s pivot toward crypto and rapid-fire policy changes could create opportunities in digital assets and industries favored by his administration.A Business-Oriented White HouseFrom the moment he entered the political arena, Donald Trump presented himself as a businessman whose background in real estate and media would translate into a savvy dealmaking approach in Washington. During his first presidency (2017–2021), that style permeated discussions on tax reform, international trade, and budget negotiations.Trump’s administration sought to pair substantial corporate tax cuts with extensive deregulation to stimulate economic growth. These policies were credited by some for boosting corporate earnings, although detractors questioned whether they would deliver long-term, sustainable gains.Investors observing a potential second Trump presidency, or even the memory of the first, note the lasting influence of Trump’s worldview on business and trade.The belief that renegotiating trade deals and encouraging domestic manufacturing could strengthen the U.S. economy shaped Trump’s policies. For instance, the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum briefly boosted certain domestic industries but also invited retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, complicating global supply chains.Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond.

If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. From the moment he entered the political arena, Donald Trump presented himself as a businessman whose background in real estate and media would translate into a savvy dealmaking approach in Washington. During his first presidency (2017–2021), that style permeated discussions on tax reform, international trade, and budget negotiations.Trump’s administration sought to pair substantial corporate tax cuts with extensive deregulation to stimulate economic growth. These policies were credited by some for boosting corporate earnings, although detractors questioned whether they would deliver long-term, sustainable gains.Investors observing a potential second Trump presidency, or even the memory of the first, note the lasting influence of Trump’s worldview on business and trade.The belief that renegotiating trade deals and encouraging domestic manufacturing could strengthen the U.S. economy shaped Trump’s policies. For instance, the 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum briefly boosted certain domestic industries but also invited retaliatory tariffs from major trade partners, complicating global supply chains.Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow.

The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from roughly 19,800 at Trump’s 2017 inauguration to over 29,000 by early 2020.If the last merri-go-round is a good benchmark for what’s to come, expect the Trump presidency to be accompanied by sharp policy announcements, whether that’s in the form of tariff threats on social media to sudden changes in stance on international alliances.The volatility on the horizon is precisely what short-term traders can capitalize upon, however long-term investors need to stay focused more on policies that move the needle over time, such as corporate tax cuts or infrastructure bills.Cyclical industries, like energy, financials, and industrials, are more likely to benefit from tax and regulatory rollbacks under Trump. Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. Future implementations or expansions of such policies under a renewed Trump mandate could create opportunities in industries he deems “strategic,” particularly manufacturing, steel, aluminum, and energy.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, exports of goods and services from the United States reached nearly $2.5 trillion by 2019, but tariff adjustments under the Trump administration reshuffled major trade partnerships.During the late 2010s, manufacturing employment rose by approximately 500,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, partly attributed to Trump’s emphasis on domestic production. Investors who tracked these shifts found that industrial and materials sector ETFs saw fluctuating inflows during the period as markets adjusted to tariff policies.US Debt Levels and Fiscal PrioritiesOne of the least discussed topics during election season was the impact of US debt. When Trump first took office in January 2017, the national debt stood around $19.9 trillion. By the time he left in January 2021, that figure had ballooned to nearly $27 trillion and today it sits at $36 trillion.Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity.

Tech companies are potentially a more risky sector with threats of trade wars impacting supply chains, or antitrust considerations.Looking to the past, the S&P 500 posted an annualized return of about 15% between January 2017 and January 2021, according to FactSet but volatility spiked many times following announcements about trade tariffs. For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. Part of this rise was fueled by 2020-21 era stimulus, but it also stemmed from tax cuts and mushrooming federal spending. Few would argue that the pace of borrowing is untenable, but supporters counter that the administration’s pro-growth policies will help offset deficits in the long run through higher GDP.A renewed Trump presidency may double down on this growth-oriented approach, potentially implementing additional tax cuts or infrastructure spending to stimulate economic activity. There is also a lot of talk of an External Revenue Service that tariffs other nations to drum up capital versus an Internal Revenue Service to tax those living within US borders.In the short term, these measures may boost investor confidence but the long-term cost of servicing higher debt may shape future policy choices, potentially leading to debates on entitlement reform or cuts to federal programs. The tangled web connecting rising debt and interest rates is likely to become more pressing, especially if investors demand higher yields on U.S. Treasuries, as some like Cem Karsan are forecasting by year-end.Federal Reserve Policy & Inflation PressuresThe President has theoretically no oversight or control over monetary policy but in the last Presidential cycle, Trump was famously outspoken about the Fed’s decisions and often urged lower interest rates to spur economic growth.A second Trump presidency is likely to renew that pressure and will probably create tension if inflation persists and the Fed seeks to tighten policy. The Fed is between a rock and a hard place in this regard, because lower interest rates are only going to exacerbate a future decline and already the long-end of the curve is signaling that it disagrees with lower rate policy.Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation.

For instance, in May 2019, the Dow dipped more than 6% in a single month when investors had to come to terms with new tariffs on Chinese imports.Cryptocurrency in the Trump EraTrump had been vocal about his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, at one point tweeting that Bitcoin and other digital currencies were “not money” and “based on thin air.”During his administration, there were no sweeping federal regulations specifically designed to govern digital assets, though the SEC began to increase oversight.Since then he has completed a full U-turn and indeed launched his own memecoin hours before his inauguration. In anticipation of a much more favorable cryptocurrency policy, Bitcoin and altcoins soared.The tide shifted tremendously in favor of crypto investors when Blackrock launched its ETF and today, institutions, banks, and even government entities in other nations are exploring blockchain use-cases.If the administration pivots toward the creation of a digital dollar or harness blockchain for certain government functions, it is likely to lend legitimacy to the technology. Ethereum, Chainlink and Bitcoin all sit as prime contenders to benefit, if the purchases of Trump’s World Liberty are a sign of what’s to come.The Incoming Administration’s WorldviewIt’s well-known that a Trump White House will place the U.S. at the center of all negotiations—be it trade, security, or energy. For investors, the focus needs to now be on Trump administration’s return to imposing tariffs.So too any renegotiating of agreements, whether with nations or multinational corporations that can have a knock-on effect to impact supply chains needs to be watched like a hawk. If they do occur, expect consumer goods companies to face higher input costs.Trump’s tendency for rapid-fire policy shifts creates both risks and opportunities, whether benefiting domestic industries on the one hand in infrastructure, defense, or construction or hurting companies heavily reliant on global networks on the other hand.The president’s personal take on global conflicts and energy independence are also likely to shape commodity prices, particularly if new sanctions, export bans, or strategic reserves come into play.A Pew Research Center survey indicated that by 2019, key U.S. allies, including Germany and Japan, had begun adjusting certain trade flows in response to tariff threats. U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve. Each policy decision is likely to spark investment opportunities for investors who pay close attention to changing market currents.Whether you choose to embrace the volatility, hedge against it, or simply observe from the sidelines, expect a Trump presidency to leave a distinct mark on the investing world and ripple through all sectors from defense to crypto and beyond. Inflation is also a genie that might be out of the box, not least due to increased government spending so if the Fed is forced to raise rates in response, both corporate and consumer borrowing are likely to slow. Stocks as a whole and in particular growth stocks are most likely to feel the brunt of these Fed actions.During Trump’s last tenure, the federal funds rate ranged from near-zero to 2.5%, and peaked in late 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. If he were to return to office and again criticize rate hikes, expect sharper market swings whenever the Fed signaled policy shifts.The Stock Market’s ReactionThe stock market under Trump’s first term initially surged, buoyed by tax cuts and optimism about deregulation.

U.S. imports from China fell by over $100 billion between 2018 and 2019 alone, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, largely attributed to tariffs and trade disputes.Navigating the Possible FutureA Trump presidency is most likely to blend an entrepreneurial verve, nationalist trade policies, and a willingness to remake government structures in pursuit of economic objectives.The most likely outcome is a combination of volatility and short-term opportunities, though longer term the risks are high of U.S. debt levels ballooning under a growth-centered agenda that amplifies pressure on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.Cryptocurrency regulations, particularly a strategic Bitcoin reserve, are likely to be transformative for holders of digital assets if the speculation comes to fruition.A key to investing success going forward will be how nimbly investors respond to rapid policy shifts and how swiftly they identify industries favored by a Trump administration.Energy, manufacturing, defense, and infrastructure are top of the list of those likely to catch a tailwind from federal initiatives while global supply chain disruptions might hinder multinational players. Ultimately, the Trump brand of politics that is direct, deal-focused, and controversy-laden is likely to generate market swings that reward those who follow policy developments closely.Looking in the rearview mirror, GDP growth averaged around 2.5% in the first three years of Trump’s initial term, only to drop sharply in 2020 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.Unemployment dipped to a 50-year low of 3.5% in late 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics but the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet ballooned past $7 trillion by mid-2020 as monetary intervention scaled.The takeaway is that market conditions during a Trump presidency may be as much about global events and the Fed’s actions as they are about the administration’s policies themselves.A Trump-led White House can be interpreted to mean aggressive fiscal maneuvers and potential standoffs with the Federal Reserve.

When Reagan got elected, we entered a recession—as it took some time to get inflation down and the economy growing. After a few years, when his policies took the stock market and the economy boomed. But in 1987, there was a short market crash that no one could really explain. Sometimes groupthink in the markets make no sense. Sometimes groupthink in the markets make no sense. ....policies took effect... But in 1987, there was a short market crash that no one could really explain. ************* I still can’t explain the 1987 crash. The market is historically very expensive now based on PE’s (lagging and forward) so it will take some time for earnings to catch up. It will certainly take some time for Trump’s policies to take hold. I’ve predicted the market will crash, and the media pundits will blame that on Trump and his policies, such as tariffs. *********************** Wall Street will try to blame tariffs, but their support of sanctions because of the Russia Ukraine War, were far more damaging to trade & the international economy. The Federal government collected $77 billion in tariffs in 2024, they might collect $90 billion in 2025. “Big Whoop.” Perhaps the left-wing loonies in the financial sector were hoping to crash the economy to sabotage Reagan; just like they are trying to do with Trump. Food prices are rising every week. Restaurants are even adding a surcharge for each egg ordered. Expect the North Virginia real estate market to take a hit. With 75,000 federal employees accepting a buy out, there could be an unusually large number of homes hitting the market in a fairly short time-frame. Yes there isn’t anywhere else to go. Lots of money chasing overvalued assets RE: Food prices are rising every week. Restaurants are even adding a surcharge for each egg ordered. So, what does that do for the Stock market? No idea. I was just calling attention to some economic data. The S&P went up 100% over the last 4 years. No it didn’t. The markets have been going up for the past 4 years. I guess they can keep going up. Gold is taking a major hit today! My poor portfolio! It’s not feelin’ the love this Valentine’s Day. Kemp and Reagan reluctantly accepted a compromise deal on the tax cuts, phasing them in over 3 years. This was a huge mistake, because businesses held off major capital transactions and investments until the final phase of the cut was in effect. Instead of a supply side stimulus, the economy ground to a halt for three years. Below is a piece of interesting trivia I’m putting here since it is economy-related: “In the 25 days since Trump’s inauguration, CNN has mentioned “egg prices” 45 times. But in the 25 days before the inauguration, CNN NEVER mentioned “egg prices.” Over on MSNBC, in the 25 days since Trump’s inauguration, they mentioned “egg prices” 80 times. But in the 25 days before the inauguration, MSNBC mentioned “egg prices” just 1 time.” They are absolutely SHAMELESS! When the Trump tax cuts are extended in the near future, they need to be made PERMANENT this time!
