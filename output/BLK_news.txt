Economist and market commentator Peter Schiff is cautioning against President Donald Trump's latest tax and spending package, saying it could do more harm than good for the U.S. economy. A day after Trump signed the bill into law during a July 4 picnic at the White House, Schiff took to social media to argue that Trump's approach is flawed. "Trump’s tax cuts, which add to budget deficits, won’t grow the economy," Schiff posted on X. "Instead they’ll result in higher long-term interest rates and inflation." Don't Miss: According to Schiff, real growth comes from policies that boost supply, not just demand. "To grow an economy, tax cuts need to stimulate supply, not demand. They need to increase savings and investment, not consumer spending," he wrote. When one X user replied, "Consumer spending is what drives the economy," Schiff fired back, "Wrong, a productive economy enables consumers to spend." Schiff's warnings follow a wave of criticism from economists who believe the bill's impact on the federal deficit and inflation could be significant. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. The Congressional Budget Office estimates Trump's newly signed bill will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. Some economists, including Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, say the U.S. was already on an “exploding debt path” even before this legislation. "It's like the house is burning down and we're throwing in some accelerant instead of some fire extinguisher," Smetters told ABC News on Friday. "We're not too big to fail." Former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf told ABC News that the bill “will make interest rates higher and makes the risks of falling into a doom loop higher than it would be otherwise.” See Also: If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now In addition to deficit concerns, the bill includes $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food assistance. The CBO estimates it will result in 11.8 million Americans losing health coverage. AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler called it "the worst job-killing bill in American history," saying it gives “a $5 trillion gift to the wealthy while stripping support from working families.” Despite the pushback, Trump has argued that stronger economic growth and tariff revenues will offset the cost of the legislation. “Our country is going to explode with massive growth … This bill sets us on course for enormous prosperity in the new and wonderful Golden Age of America,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on July 1. But many economists remain unconvinced. “Bond markets can be really, really disciplinary,” Smetters told ABC News. “If we fall into a doom loop, then the U.S. has to make dramatic cutbacks in federal benefit programs like Social Security and Medicaid and sharply raise taxes. That will be really bad for people’s standard of living.” Read Next: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.

Title: Should You Invest In Bitcoin, ETFs, Or Bitcoin Treasury Companies?

ByAlexander S. Blume ByAlexander S. Blume, Contributor. Bitcoin investors have a variety of options for gaining exposure. There Are No Solutions, Only Trade-Offs” - Thomas Sowell After many years of regulatory resistance to Bitcoin, the asset has now gained approval to enter into mainstream capital markets. Starting with the approval of spot BTC ETFs to trade on January 11, 2024, various legal wrappers for BTC exposure have emerged. Recently, a notable trend has emerged as public companies add BTC to their balance sheets. Many investors likely wonder how to get best involved with this complex set of options. There are no black-and-white answers to this, only trade-offs. In this article, we will break down the pros and cons of each. Real BTC Owning actual Bitcoin, held in a personally controlled wallet of your own custody, is the original form of owning Bitcoin. Much like owning a bar of gold in your house, this offers complete control over the asset. This was the original intent of Bitcoin, an asset independent of government control or centralized authority. If custodied properly, it can not be seized or hacked or, potentially, even known that you own it. Self-custody offers a double-edged sword for many. Properly custodying Bitcoin in cold storage can result in a complete loss of your investment if not done carefully. First, the private key can be lost and unrecoverable. This famously occurred to James Howells, who accidentally disposed of the private key to access 8000 BTC, worth over $850MM today. There is no back-up for self-custody. Just as if you lost a bar of gold, it can be lost forever with no recourse. With great power comes great responsibility. In addition, ease of access to cold storage Bitcoin means that transacting may be slow. The process of accessing, transferring, or selling Bitcoin can take hours or days, which may pose a problem for some. There are alternatives to this, but they essentially remove the benefit of owning BTC directly. This includes keeping your Bitcoin on an exchange, storing your private keys in a bank or with a lawyer, or using a private key device like a Ledger to store them. This decreases the odds of you losing your Bitcoin; it also removes the self-sovereign properties that make owning Bitcoin attractive and unique. You have to trust some other party or company to keep you secure. ETFs Bitcoin ETFs are legal wrappers that allow people to gain exposure to the price of Bitcoin. They create a legal entity that holds the Bitcoin in custody on your behalf. The ETFs are regulated by the SEC and must abide by strict compliance, reporting, and security standards to be approved. This allows regular investors to make an investment in Bitcoin without having to deal with the technological peculiarities the asset poses. These ETFs are trading on major stock exchanges and can also be accessed by retirement accounts and large financial institutions that must abide by strict investment and regulatory policies. Though ETFs simplify ownership, they also neuter much of the unique protections Bitcoin can provide. You are depending on a large set of human beings to protect you. This includes the ETF creator, a firm like BlackRock or Fidelity, for example, the custodian, which is almost always Coinbase, the regulators, and market-making firms. Though all of these groups are regulated and legitimate, their incentives are not exactly aligned with every individual who wants to own bitcoin. Changes to policy, technical errors, hacks, and fraud can all arise when so many counterparties get involved. BTC Treasury Companies The latest wave of BTC exposure has come in the form of so-called Bitcoin Treasury Companies. These are public companies that hold Bitcoin rather than only USD. These vehicles offer many of the regulated protections and mainstream accessibility of an ETF and can be traded on exchanges, but add a variety of strategies and financial engineering approaches to aim to generate greater returns. These approaches can vary widely depending on the company. It can include selling more shares of stock into the market to raise more money, selling convertible debt, offering exposure across different jurisdictions in order to tap into untouched markets, trading the bitcoin using derivatives, taking out loans with the bitcoin to buy more bitcoin, and much more. For some jurisdictions, no ETF exists, and so a simple company that just buys and holds Bitcoin for shareholders may be the best option available. All of this adds another layer of human involvement to the risk of the investment. It can also mean much greater upside if chosen properly. Some of these companies trade at 10 times the value of the actual Bitcoin they hold. Though investors may be able to make more upside with BTC treasury companies, gaining exposure to intelligent strategies and retail buying momentum, they also have more risk. The same factors that can create outsized gains can create outsized losses. These are very sophisticated financial products that leverage aspects of retail speculation, debt instruments, marketing, and legal and jurisdictional arbitrage to, hopefully, outperform Bitcoin. Some of these strategies suffer from black swan-type risk, in which they will look to be doing very well until they suddenly fail. Others will be successful far out into the future. One important aspect to consider with BTC Treasury Companies is whether they are pure-play Bitcoin holding companies or does the Bitcoin complement other business activity and income. Companies that have real income may be better positioned in the long run for stability and risk management during times when the price of BTC falters, since they have other ways to pay bills and stay in business. Companies that are pure-play vehicles may have greater upside and volatility. In the end, all of these vehicles can make sense for different types of investors, from long-term individual holders to pension funds to day traders. It’s important to truly understand what the company does to generate a return for you so that you can evaluate risk with a clear perspective.

Sunak’s appointment comes after resigning from the PM role last year after a loss to Keir Starmer’s Labour Party Goldman Sachs has named former United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as a senior adviser, adding a veteran policymaker to its roster as banks navigate rising geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty. The investment bank announced Sunak’s appointment on Tuesday. Sunak, who remains a Conservative member of parliament from a seat in northern England, previously worked at Goldman as an analyst in the early 2000s before joining a series of hedge funds. Through a combination of his past career in financial services and the family wealth of his wife, whose father co-founded the Indian IT services company Infosys, Sunak became the wealthiest British prime minister, drawing criticism of being out of touch with most UK voters. He has remained largely out of the spotlight since resigning as leader of the Conservatives after the party’s worst defeat in more than a century in July last year. He took up posts at Oxford and Stanford universities earlier this year. Goldman’s hiring of Sunak, who had also served as the UK’s finance minister, adds to a long list of senior politicians taking up positions in finance, where their policy backgrounds and global networks are viewed as strategic assets. “I am excited to welcome Rishi back to Goldman Sachs,” Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a statement. “In his role, he will work with leaders across the firm to advise our clients globally on a range of important topics, sharing his unique perspectives and insights on the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape,” Solomon said. Former British finance ministers George Osborne and Sajid Javid have also made the move to finance with Osborne holding positions at asset manager BlackRock and advisory firm Robey Warshaw and Javid becoming a partner at investment firm Centricus.

Current growth trajectory suggests IBIT may reach 1.2 million BTC in the next year. BlackRock’s IBIT Spot Bitcoin ETF has officially crossed 700,000 BTC in assets under management, valued at approximately $76 billion as of July 17. The milestone comes just 18 months after the fund’s launch in January 2024, marking a rapid accumulation pace that has drawn industry-wide attention. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the achievement on July 8, noting that IBIT is now 62% of the way toward surpassing Satoshi Nakamoto as the largest known single holder of Bitcoin. According to Balchunas, the fund has been adding roughly 40,000 BTC per month, or about 1,300 BTC per day, and could reach 1.2 million BTC by May 2026 if the current trend holds. In addition to its growing Bitcoin holdings, IBIT has also become a top-performing revenue generator for BlackRock. Of the asset management firm’s 1,197 ETFs, IBIT now ranks third in revenue generation at $191 billion, and it is less than $9 billion away from claiming the top spot.

"Volatility may be on summer break, but Q3 and Q4 could still deliver fireworks," the analysts wrote in a recent blog post. The current low volatility is a sign that markets have priced in a Goldilocks scenario with delayed tariffs, rate cuts from the Federal Open Markets Committee later this year, and sustained fiscal deficits, the analysts wrote. "While whales, OGs, and miners largely sidelined, Bitcoin remains just 2 to 3 percent below all-time highs," they said. "This is supported by steady inflows from ETFs and public corporate treasuries." BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which trades on the Nasdaq under the IBIT ticker, has netted nearly $53 billion in inflows since its debut 18 months ago and just reached 700,306.7922 Bitcoin in its holdings. It has been the fastest-growing exchange-traded fund in the industry's 32-year history. That means that BlackRock holds 3.52% of the 19.8 million circulating supply of Bitcoin. And Jamie Elkaleh, chief marketing officer at Bitget Wallet, noted that the company's iShares Ethereum Trust now holds 1.5% of all ETH. "If ETF inflows continue, we could be entering the early stages of a structural supply squeeze," he said. "That means less ETH circulating on the open market, more volatility, and stronger upward pressure on price." The QCP analysts also noted that equities are "extending their melt-up rally." At the time of writing, the S&P 500 was trading at $6,226.78—up 3.6% over the past month. And the Nasdaq 100 index has gained 4.2% over the same period. Both indexes have recently hit all-time highs. QCP analysts also noted that "credit spreads are the tightest they've been since the March-April correction." Credit spreads refer to the extra yield investors demand to hold riskier corporate bonds over safer government debt. For the spread to be especially narrow is a sign of investor confidence because they're not demanding much compensation for the credit risk. The real macro signal to watch will be whether President Donald Trump can get more trade deals signed before his new August 1 deadline. Risk assets, like Bitcoin, have largely taken the new tariff deadline in stride, QCP wrote, having come to expect blustery tariff rhetoric without action. "Should Trump decide to follow through, however, the impact would be materially anti-growth," the analysts said. "It would mark a true test for global risk resilience."

Title: Truth Social Goes Full Crypto—SEC Considers Trump-Linked ETF Filing

Time Published: 2025-07-08T15:00:55Z

US regulators have kicked off the formal review of a new spot‑crypto fund. Investors won’t know for sure if it clears the hurdles until the US Securities and Exchange Commission makes a final call. But the filing itself signals growing acceptance of directly held crypto products. According to the SEC filing, Trump Media’s Truth Social unit wants an ETF listed on NYSE Arca with 75% in Bitcoin and 25% in Ether. Yorkville America Digital would sponsor the fund, while Foris DAX Trust Company—Crypto.com’s custody arm—would hold the coins. US President Donald Trump’s team submitted the S‑1 form on June 16, starting what is likely a 45‑day review clock. Based on reports, the fund would value Bitcoin each trading day using the CME CF Bitcoin reference rate. Ether would use the CME CF Ether rate, unless the sponsor chooses another source. Private keys for both assets would sit in a cold wallet, kept separate from customer accounts. That setup aims to address long‑standing worries over hacks, theft and tangled custody failures. Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have filed pure‑Bitcoin ETF applications. Some firms are eyeing Ether‑only funds. Now a dual‑asset product is in the mix. If the SEC finalizes its planned “automated” listing framework, reviews could shrink from many months to a few. That rule would standardize disclosures, custody standards and market‑integrity checks for all spot‑crypto ETFs. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s spot‑Solana ETF hit another delay. The SEC pushed back its March 25 application and opened a new public‑comment window—21 days for feedback, 35 days for replies. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart called this hold‑up “expected,” noting it shows the agency is still fine‑tuning data and disclosures before any approvals. Now the ball is in the SEC’s court. Regulators can sign off, send back comments or reject the bid. If leadership keeps up the push for faster, automated reviews, spot‑crypto ETFs might reach market this year. Until then, every move—from amendment requests to public comments—will matter for funds backed by Bitcoin, Ether and beyond. At stake is more than branding. Fees, trading speed and trust in custody will shape which funds win big money. And sponsors will need muscle to stand out in a growing field of nearly 10 proposals. Investors should keep a close eye on filings and deadlines to know when to act. The race launched with Trump Media’s Truth Social filing, and it may well end—with approval or denial—under its banner. Truth Social’s entry has put a fresh spin on the push for regulated crypto products. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

The fund raising would be by group companies Adani Green Energy and Adani Energy Solutions, they said. The companies will be tapping private equity firms and sovereign funds from the Middle East, the US and Canada and some of the investors could be existing bond holders in the group, the sources said. Separately, the group is also negotiating a loan amount of around ₹16,000 crore with Indian banks for its airport arm. This will most likely be finalised towards the end of the year, the sources said. It will be used for the next phase of expansion of the Navi Mumbai International Airport, which is being built in phases. The airport, which is tentatively scheduled to start operations around September this year, will be able to handle 20 million passengers and 0.5 million tonne cargo annually in the launch phase. When the project is complete it will be able to handle 90 million passengers and 3.2 million tonnes of cargo. Over the last six months the Gautam Adani-controlled conglomerate has raised funds from global asset managers and funds such as Blackrock and Apollo and also from its joint venture partner TotalEnergies. In January Adani Green raised $1.425 billion, through $1.125 billion infusion by the promoter group and $300 million from TotalEnergies. The purpose of this was for early redemption of bonds and for capital optimisation. In March Adani Green again refinanced a $1.06-billion construction facility for its renewable energy projects in Rajasthan. In June it raised $750 million in a private bond issuance to fund its cement expansion. The group, which is in a perpetual expansion, growth and acquisitive mode, regularly taps the global markets for its funding needs. The group has a target to spend around $100 billion over the next 6-7 years. Published on July 8, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Ukraine Transformed into Underdeveloped Country: Why BlackRock Suddenly Gave Up on Zelensky and the Kiev Regime
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/blackrock-gave-up-neo-nazi-junta/5894166
Time Published: 2025-07-08T14:52:43Z
Full Content:
When the NATO-orchestrated Ukrainian conflict started in 2014, American and multinational conglomerates rushed to ensure they got their “piece of the pie” in the unfortunate country. In around a decade or so, the Kiev regime changed laws and enabled the total or near-total takeover of every remotely valuable asset built by generations in the Soviet Union. While the socialist superstate certainly had its flaws, the legacy it left in former Ukraine has never been matched by any government since the latter’s “independence” in 1991. Namely, while the country had a massive industrial sector until then and a population of 52 million, mostly well-educated and working in various specialist fields (Soviet Ukraine was a scientific and industrial powerhouse no less than Russia itself), after 1991, all this collapsed for good. By the early 1990s, relatively prosperous Ukraine turned into an underdeveloped country with only a fraction of its Soviet-era scientific and industrial potential, selling mostly agricultural products and essentially serving as a cheap resource for the political West’s brutal (neo)colonial exploitation. By the mid-2010s, NATO fully hijacked the unfortunate country and turned it over to the Neo-Nazi junta that’s now effectively conducting genocide against Ukrainians themselves. Namely, the demographic collapse is so catastrophic that it’s highly likely there’s only half of Ukraine’s 1991 population in the country at this point. The suicidal war with Russia (its closest kin) continues, while the United States is now openly demanding whatever’s left of Ukrainian resources (with even this lost to Russian all-out advance across the frontlines). In fact, the situation is so bad that the infamous BlackRock, the world’s most exploitative (neo)colonial conglomerate, has actually given up on NATO-occupied Ukraine. According to Bloomberg, it suspended work on “a multibillion-dollar Ukraine recovery fund”, supposedly following President Donald Trump’s election win. Apparently, this prompted France to work on a replacement deal, with initial support from Germany, Poland and Italy. The report, published on July 5, further states that BlackRock ceased all efforts to “search for institutional investors in January”, effectively ending the planned $500 million fund that was intended to be secured from various Western governments, development grants and investment banks. In turn, another $2 billion from other private investors was also lost after they withdrew. The report also points out that the investment stopped due to “a lack of interest amid perceived uncertainty in Ukraine”. In other words, nobody wants to sink billions of dollars into an endemically corrupt mafia state run by Neo-Nazi goons in the middle of an unwinnable war with a military superpower nextdoor. Truly shocking. However, jokes aside, it doesn’t take an economic expert to understand that the most basic logic implies that nobody remotely sane would make that kind of investment. Worse yet, the notion of “perceived uncertainty” is even more laughable. Namely, as previously mentioned, the Russian military is now advancing on multiple fronts, meaning that this “uncertainty” is not a matter of perception, but an objective reality that any thinking investor would take into account. The Bloomberg report further states that the investment fund was scheduled to be unveiled at the “Ukraine Recovery Conference” on July 10-11 in Rome. A BlackRock spokesperson said that the conglomerate “completed advisory work for the recovery fund pro bono in 2024, but no longer has any active mandate”. Worse yet, although France promised to “step up”, it seems this is also falling through. Citing “people familiar with the matter” Bloomberg reports that “it remains uncertain how effective the plan will be without American backing”. In other words, investors from the European Union are just as skeptical as their US counterparts, which tends to happen when people are getting their information from sources other than the mainstream propaganda machine which still insists that the Kiev regime is “defeating Russia”. Numerous independent authors from around the world (particularly at InfoBRICS), have been reporting that the so-called minerals deal that the Trump administration was trying to push for since it came to power would fall through. We repeatedly argued that the minerals promised by the Neo-Nazi junta weren’t even under its control, while areas with any known resources lack the mining industry to support extraction. It would take years and tens (if not hundreds) of billions in investment just to establish it. In other words, the investors would need to give lots of money to the losing side. Expectedly, such business deals are wholly unattractive to people who don’t like losing massive financial assets. The Kiev regime tried to do everything in its power (effectively selling the entire country) to change their opinions, but to no avail. For instance, the Neo-Nazi junta frontman Volodymyr Zelensky pompously announced his $1 trillion “reconstruction plan” years ago, even promising each corporation what can only be described as free rei(g)n in oblasts (regions) they invested in. The results have been catastrophic for NATO-occupied Ukraine, with around 30% of its arable land handed over to (neo)colonialists. In addition, cheap Ukrainian agricultural products flooded European markets (after they were initially promised to starving Africans and for which Russia was blamed by the mainstream propaganda machine), resulting in massive protests by farmers across the “old continent” as their market share collapsed virtually overnight. However, even this turned out to be a bad investment, particularly after the Russian military entered the Dnepropetrovsk oblast. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Goldman Sachs has today named former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak its senior adviser, adding a veteran policymaker to its roster as banks navigate rising geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty. For Sunak, the appointment marks a return to the bank where he first worked as a summer intern in investment banking in 2000 and later as an analyst between 2001 and 2004. "In his role, he will advise our clients globally on a range of important topics, sharing his unique perspectives and insights on the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape," Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a statement. The move underscores a well-established career trajectory in which former government officials often transition to finance, where their policy background and global network are seen as strategic assets. Former Chancellors of the Exchequer George Osborne and Sajid Javid also moved into the industry, with Osborne joining BlackRock as an adviser and Javid becoming a partner at investment firm Centricus. Currently, banks are placing even greater value on such experience as they seek to guide clients through an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. Sunak was the UK's prime minister between October 2022 and July 2024, and Chancellor of the Exchequer from February 2020 to July 2022. He resigned as prime minister and Conservative Party leader last year after a heavy loss to Keir Starmer's Labour Party. He is currently the MP for Richmond and Northallerton.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo ReserveOne, a new crypto venture with ties to industry veterans and a former U.S. commerce secretary, will list on the Nasdaq through a merger with blank-check firm M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp and is expected to raise more than $1 billion. The company will manage a portfolio of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ethereum and Solana, while aligning its holdings with the U.S. strategic crypto reserve, it said on Tuesday. The deal, expected to close in the October-December quarter, is the latest in a series of efforts to wrap crypto assets into equity and make them more appealing for traditional investors. The exponential stock price growth of Michael Saylor's Strategy, which pivoted to a bitcoin-focused business model in 2020, has also popularized the playbook.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum’s smart-contract platform has crossed a major line. According to data shared by Token Terminal on X, the total value of tokenized assets on Ethereum now tops $6 billion. That figure covers products from asset managers, fund houses and blockchain firms. It proves institutions are treating on‑chain finance as more than a tech demo. BlackRock leads the pack. The world’s largest asset manager holds the biggest share of tokenized AUM on Ethereum. Close behind are Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, Superstate, Apollo and Ondo Finance. Franklin Templeton focused on parts of its US Government Money Fund. WisdomTree launched funds you can buy through a mobile app. Superstate and Apollo each add smaller but steady sums. Based on reports, these six names together make up most of the $6 billion milestone. Tokenized AUM on @ethereum is at an all-time high World’s biggest financial services firms & asset managers are tokenizing assets on Ethereum pic.twitter.com/5Xl4XXYQ3O — Token Terminal 📊 (@tokenterminal) July 6, 2025 The climb didn’t happen in a day. Adoption started slowly around mid‑2023. It rose further in early 2024. Then by January 2025, the line on the stacked chart shot straight up. That jump comes as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton pour in fresh tokens. Faster trades and fewer middlemen are big draws. Trades that once took days can now settle in minutes or seconds. That kind of speed appeals to big investors, who want clarity and a clear audit trail. This push into tokenized finance shows a shift in how big firms manage money. Ethereum still faces questions about scaling. If gas fees jump again, trading costs could rise sharply. Regulators in the US, Europe and Asia have yet to set clear rules. A clampdown in one region might push firms toward other chains or private blockchains. Competition from Solana, Avalanche and new networks is already heating up.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Government approves establishment of commission of inquiry into historic sexual abuse in schools

The Government will “pursue all levers available” to compel the religious orders to pay redress to victims of historic sex abuse in schools, the Minister for Education Helen McEntee has stated. A commission of inquiry into allegations of historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools has been established by the Government with a time frame to report within five years. Speaking after the commission was approved by the Cabinet, Ms McEntee said any redress due to the victims arising out of the commission should be paid for by the religious orders. The compensation will be a “measure of accountability” for what happened to victims. This will include looking at changes to the statute of limitations on civil claims and changes to the status of unincorporated associations, as well as looking at the assets that religious orders have. An examination of how to get compensation from religious orders will run in parallel with the commission of investigation. The Attorney General Rossa Fanning and his office has been involved in drawing up proposals to pursue the religious orders for money. Successive governments have had little success in pursuing religious orders for compensation. A deal made in 2002 that capped contributions from the religious orders at €128 million – less than 10 per cent of the eventual compensation liability – was widely criticised. The religious orders fell short of the 50:50 split in relation to the 2009 Ryan Report and only two religious orders out of eight offered redress to survivors of mother and baby homes. On foot of that failure, the Minister for Children Norma Foley asked the Attorney General to examine ways that might lead to the sequestration of assets or the seizing or freezing of bank accounts of religious orders. When asked how the Government plans to improve on collecting money from the religious orders, she said: “There is more work that needs to be done to find out exactly what is owned and is in the possession of the religious orders or institutions. “It is clear that any redress scheme approved by Government will have to be funded by these religious organisations.” Under the terms of reference of the report, which were published on Tuesday, Mr Justice Michael MacGrath must report within five years – and write to the Minister for Education within two years, updating her as to the likelihood of meeting that target. The commission will begin its work in October and Ms McEntee said the cost of it is likely to “run into tens of millions of euro”. [ Schools sexual abuse inquiry: It was open season on children’s bodies. These men did what they likedOpens in new window ] Labour has brought forward a Bill that would remove legal obstacles to the Government forcing the religious orders to pay redress. “These orders cannot be allowed to hide behind trusts and legal mechanisms to avoid accountability,” Labour leader Ivana Bacik said. “This legislation provides a clear and immediate pathway to justice, and Government should support its passage without delay . . . Survivors have waited long enough.” Abuse survivors’ support organisation One in Four said it welcomed Tuesday’s news. Chief executive Deirdre Kenny said the commission’s scale “reflects the thousands of lives affected and the deep impact on families and communities for generations”. However, the group said it is “concerned that the issue of redress will be further delayed. While we appreciate this is complex, survivors have shown immense resilience and patience; therefore, we are concerned about any further delay. Delays disadvantage survivors and may allow institutions to avoid accountability and responsibility.” Last September, the then government formally agreed to establish a statutory inquiry into the sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools, following recommendations in the 700-page scoping inquiry report, led by Mary O’Toole SC. The report disclosed 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse at 308 schools run by religious congregations, involving 884 alleged abusers. A high number of allegations were concentrated in special education schools, where 590 allegations were recorded in 17 institutions involving 190 alleged abusers. [ ‘Their childhood stopped the day the abuse started’: Almost 2,400 allegations of abuse in religious run-schoolsOpens in new window ] The inquiry was set up following revelations of widespread sexual abuse of boys at Willow Park and Blackrock College in south Co Dublin. It followed the broadcast of RTÉ radio documentary Blackrock Boys in November 2022 and the launch that month also of a restorative justice programme involving abuse survivors and the Spiritan congregation, which runs the schools. There will be a sampling approach used – whereby cases will be chosen that have sufficient witnesses and documentary evidence available to allow the commission to fulfil its functions. An initial survey will be undertaken to identify the potential number of survivors.

Title: The Democratization Of Wall Street: AI Trading For All

Time Published: 2025-07-08T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByDouglas B. Laney ByDouglas B. Laney, Contributor. AI and man superimposed looking at a stock chart It’s 1988, and somewhere in New York, a young financial analyst named Larry Fink is nursing a bruised ego and a $100 million loss. That catastrophic trade at First Boston would haunt him, but also sparked an obsession that would quietly reshape global finance. Fink's solution was to build a sophisticated AI system to prevent such disasters. He called it Aladdin. Fast-forward nearly four decades, and that same system now manages over $20 trillion in assets, roughly 7% of the world's financial wealth. BlackRock's Aladdin has become the invisible hand guiding institutional investment decisions worldwide. Today, BlackRock expects the AI boom to continue boosting U.S. stocks throughout the year, despite concerns about debt and global uncertainty clouding the outlook. The firm is betting big on AI-driven market rallies, and now individual investors can finally join that bet with tools that were unattainable, if entirely unimaginable, just a decade ago. Today, however, AI-driven approaches are finally reaching retail traders and testing Wall Street's hegemony. Some entrepreneurs saw this democratization coming years before others. TechBerry, a Germany-based trading company, began developing AI-driven trading models in 2014, launching commercially in 2015 just as the enterprise AI revolution was in its infancy. Its concept and timing both proved prescient. While institutional giants were tuning their systems for trillion-dollar portfolios, TechBerry's founders saw gaping market whitespace for individual investors. "Our biggest challenge was assembling a top-tier team of experts to build a unique AI model back in 2014, when the industry was just emerging," said Techberry CEO, Bruno Baily. "We had to do it with limited personal investment since investors showed little interest in our startup back then. Quite a contrast to the attention we receive today." As early movers in this space, they demonstrated that AI trading could be effective at scale beyond institutional walls. While institutions focused on managing trillions of pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, an enormous underserved market of individual traders was left wanting for similar sets of tools. Unlike the perfunctory AI solutions that many fintech companies were peddling (basically repackaged algorithms with flashy interfaces), TechBerry invested in building what it claims is the world’s largest dataset of historical trades. Its platform now counts over 110,000 active traders, creating network effects that improve performance for everyone involved. This trader dataset creates genuine competitive moats in ways that traditional Wall Street firms struggle to replicate. Techberry CEO, Bruno Bailey Two years after TechBerry launched, Larry Fink saw the writing on the wall. "We have to change the ecosystem. That means relying more on big data, artificial intelligence, factors, and models within quant and traditional investment strategies," he declared to The New York Times in 2017. He doubled down: "BlackRock must bet big on the power of machines, be it Aladdin, the firm's risk management platform, robo-advisers, big data, and artificial intelligence." Fink wasn't just describing BlackRock's future. He was validating what TechBerry had already understood: AI would fundamentally rewire investment management. But while TechBerry was building for individual traders, the institutional world had been operating with this advantage for decades. Aladdin's Monte Carlo simulations can stress-test portfolios against a range of scenarios, from government collapses to global pandemics. For the longest time, this kind of technological firepower remained locked away in institutional vaults. During the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, while retail investors scrambled with basic tools and gut instincts, big corporations and government agencies had Aladdin whispering market secrets in their ears. The exclusivity wasn't accidental. Building these systems required the kind of capital and expertise that only the largest financial institutions could muster. The barriers to entry seemed insurmountable for anyone operating outside the institutional ecosystem. What sets TechBerry apart from the typical Silicon Valley AI narrative is its European perspective on technology and regulation. Operating from Germany within the EU's strict financial services framework while serving a global user base, they've built compliance into their DNA rather than treating it as an afterthought. This regulatory-first approach has paid dividends in credibility. TechBerry's performance has been verified by independent third-party auditing services, including FXAudit and Myfxtools, which have shown verified monthly returns of 11%. This transparency was virtually unheard of in retail AI trading just a few years ago. For decades, retail traders have been burned by systems that worked boffo in backtests but crumbled under real market conditions. Thankfully, third-party auditing provided the kind of institutional-grade accountability that retail trading has desperately needed. Democratization genuinely levels the playing field. TechBerry's approach shows how real-time information from a broad base of investors can create entirely new competitive advantages, rather than simply copying institutional playbooks. Its expansive trader network generates fresh data continuously, potentially offering insights that even established institutions might lack. While systems like Aladdin excel at institutional portfolio management, platforms like TechBerry can tap into the collective intelligence of thousands of individual traders putting their own money on the line. That's a fundamentally different and potentially equally valuable dataset. Instead of top-down institutional wisdom, you get bottom-up market intelligence from people with skin in the game. The trend toward sophisticated trading algorithms becoming accessible to individual investors shows no signs of slowing. TechBerry plans to expand its AI model into cryptocurrency trading, potentially bringing institutional-grade analysis to one of the most volatile and retail-dominated markets. Their goal of growing its trader base to 200,000 suggests confidence that AI democratization can scale without compromising performance. The broader implications are staggering. If AI trading becomes truly democratized, will it level the playing field or simply create new advantages for early adopters? The evidence so far suggests both outcomes are possible, but companies like TechBerry are proving that individual investors no longer need to accept second-class citizenship in the world of algorithmic trading. What seems certain is that the exclusive club of AI-powered trading is rapidly expanding. The same sophisticated analysis that once required institutional resources is becoming available to anyone with internet access and modest capital. When a European AI-driven startup can deliver serious returns through democratized data and analytics, it signals that the barriers may be crumbling faster than anticipated. As Larry Fink predicted back in 2017, the ecosystem is evolving rapidly. While BlackRock continues to bet on AI-driven market growth, individual investors can place similar bets using similar tools. The question isn’t whether AI will transform trading for individual investors, it’s how quickly they’ll adapt to this new ascendancy.

The joint venture between Jio Financial Services, backed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and BlackRock, enters India's 72.2 trillion rupee ($844 billion) funds market with a business structure that threatens to shake up the sector, as it leverages its large digital network to bypass traditional distributors used by the rest of the industry. Jio BlackRock plans to leverage Jio, India's largest telecom network, and BlackRock's investment management platform Aladdin, to offer differentiated products in the crowded market, two of the three sources said. The asset manager has applied to the market regulator to launch eight funds, the two sources said, adding to the first three funds it launched last month. The funds will allow for investments as low as 500 rupees ($5.83), the two sources said. The asset manager said on Monday that it has raised more than $2.1 billion across three debt mutual fund schemes and that 90 institutional investors and 67,000 retail investors have invested in these funds so far. On average, the cost associated across plans will be lower for Jio BlackRock funds compared with the industry average, one of the sources said, declining to specify a level. "By being direct only, Jio BlackRock plans to do away with the cost of distribution," this person added. Jio BlackRock declined to comment on Reuters' inquiries regarding its fund launches and pricing strategy, which have not been previously reported. At present, active funds offered through distribution on an average have a total expense ratio of about 1.78%. They can charge a maximum 2.5% of the investment amount. Direct funds generally reduce costs by 0.5% to 0.6%. Jio BlackRock intends to bypass the dominant channel of distributors, offering funds directly to institutional and retail investors, the sources said. That will reduce fee or expense ratios associated with the funds, they said. Ambani's Jio has been known to disrupt markets with its pricing and reach. Jio, India's largest telecom carrier by subscriber count, launched in 2016, became the largest by offering mobile phones and voice and data packages at well below prices prevailing in the industry. Jio BlackRock will use the distribution reach of its partner and target the existing 8 million active users of financial services on its digital platforms such as MyJio and Jio Finance, a second source familiar with the matter said. BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager at $11.6 trillion as of December 2024, is known for its passive funds, which track established indexes. It manages $7.8 trillion through exchange traded and index funds. However, Jio BlackRock plans to offer a mix of active and passive funds in India, where active funds still dominate. "Passive funds are growing in India every year and there is a potential for BlackRock to further build this segment," said the first source. Passive funds accounted for 12.11 trillion rupees, or 16.78% of total assets in India as of May, marking a 25% growth from a year earlier. The fund house plans to leverage Aladdin, an investment and risk management system, to deliver consistent returns, said the first source. Aladdin is an end-to-end investment management system that collates all analytics in one place to enable portfolio managers to take investment calls. "Relevant portions of Aladdin will be made available to Jio BlackRock's investors as well," the first source said. ($1 = 85.3730 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Jayshree P.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now holds 700,000 bitcoin BTC$109,542.45, according to Glassnode data, and has amassed $76 billion in assets under management in just 18 months, outstripping both the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which tracks the U.S. equity benchmark, and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap U.S. stocks. The figures beats the 600,000 BTC held by Strategy (MSTR), which started purchases in 2020, and compares with Fidelity FBTC's 203,000 BTC and Grayscale GBTC's 184,000 BTC. “New milestone, iShares Bitcoin ETF now holds over 700,000 BTC. 700,000 Did this in 18 months. Ridiculous,” Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, commented in a post on X. The U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) debuted in January 2024 and have become the most successful ETF introductions of all time. Since inception, they have attracted $50 billion in net inflows. IBIT is now the third highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock across all its ETF products. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that BlackRock operates a total of 1,197 funds.

Set in the former O’Brien’s Pub building, which was subsequently home to The Chop House, this is now a serious diningroom with a long counter for walk-ins and a smaller room at the back. The menu sticks to local and seasonal produce – seafood chowder, deep-fried calamari, pan-fried halibut with leek and mussel sauce, duck leg confit with spring onion champ and buttered carrots. There’s also an 18-seat garden terrace – uncovered, unheated, and fully weather dependent. Corinna Hardgrave When the sun is shining there is no better place to be than outdoors at Fisk with a selection of their original seafood dishes lined up in front of you and a cold drink in hand. Think gochujang glazed trout, buttery brioche roll stuffed with prawn cocktail or spicy Bloody Mary topped with oyster and shrimp. It turns out that chef Tony Davidson is also rather handy with Mexican food too, so dig in. Joanne Cronin A Green Egg barbecue runs hot here, chargrilling vegetables such as asparagus for brunch, served under a heated 80-seat yurt-style tent. Rose O’Toole (formerly of Misunderstood Heron, Aimsir) runs the kitchen, serving up Irish crab and smoked black pudding benedict, Doyle’s sausage brunch burger and house-made sourdough with romesco. The wood-fired oven slow-cooks meats for sandwiches and will fire up again for Grangecon Kitchen pizzas on summer weekends. Sunday pop-ups offer a set menu (€45-€55) built around local produce. CH It’s a bit of a drive to Helen’s Bar, but the reward is a table outside overlooking Kenmare Bay – boats bobbing below, mountains stacked behind. The menu keeps it simple: bowls of mussels, plates of crab claws, fresh fish pulled from the bay and straight on to the plate. Good value, easy-going service and seafood that repays the detour in full. CH Lobster grilled with garlic butter and chips sets the tone here, backed by wild Irish fish and chips, mussels with cream, garlic and white wine and crab claws caught aboard the Atlantic Freedom, served swimming in garlic butter. There’s also wild Irish smoked ling – “smokies” – baked with crème fraîche. A heated terrace with a permanent roof and three beach huts makes outdoor eating possible whatever the weather. CH In Clifden’s former post office, Michael and Hannah Nagle serve a seafood menu that gets straight to the point. Fish and chips (€21), half lobster and chips (€28), mussels with sourdough (€15), and crab claws (€16) are the backbone, while daily specials like mackerel with apple and cucumber (€12) keep things fresh. The live-fire konro grill adds a smoky edge, and outdoor seating with heaters and blankets makes it a great spot, rain or shine. Larger groups can book a two-set menu (€30-€65). CH Diarmuid Ó Mathúna runs one of the best daytime spots around – breakfast, brunch and lunch built on proper seasonal produce. The taco with deep-fried Ros an Mhíl haddock, Aran Islands crab salad with Velvet Cloud yoghurt, and the toastie with Feeney’s pulled bacon collar are all worth the trip. Outside, there’s now a 40-seat garden, half covered, backed by 22 solar panels. They even make their own condiments, from honey mustard mayo to berry compote. CH Casual by day with small plates and sandwiches, more focused at night, William Browne’s Blackrock spot has James Strathern (ex-Dede, Orwell Road, Roe Wines) in the kitchen. There’s a short a la carte and a six-course tasting menu at €64. Cod and nduja arancini, red mullet crudo, wild garlic gnocchi and sausage and ricotta ravioli keep it tight. A sea-view heated deck with 12 uncovered seats makes the most of the setting. DJ nights and summer events are planned. CH Keith Coleman – formerly of Roots, Fumbally and Fia – is behind some of the best casual food in Dublin. The evening menu runs Thursday to Saturday: roast Iona Farm carrots with labneh and chermoula, cauliflower with smoky cashew sauce, free-range chicken thigh with tzatziki and hot honey. The sheltered 42-seat garden, planted and properly thought through, is one of the best places in the city to sit and eat when the weather behaves. A new bakery and test kitchen are on the way later this year. CH In a restored 1820s coach house, Ciaran Kiely (ex-Oliveto) is cooking over a bespoke ember pit, working with Ballincarey Organic Farm, An Tairseach and Higgins butchers. The menu runs from Sheelagh’s beetroot with St Tola’s goat’s cheese to Kilmore Quay monkfish, pork belly, and a Wagyu cheeseburger that means business. Outside, a 40-seat terrace – half covered, marble tables, wood stove and heaters – makes outdoor eating worth a gamble. Thursday nights run a two- or three-course neighbourhood menu.

Title: Revenue veto ‘caps use of Scarp small business rescue scheme’
URL: https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/revenue-veto-caps-use-of-scarp-small-business-rescue-scheme/a955052136.html

Expert warns the potential opt-out stops some firms using the project Dessie Morrow, of Azets Ireland. Photo: Brian Claffey An effective veto the Revenue Commissioners have over allowing debtors to use the small company administrative rescue process (Scarp) is weighing on wider adoption of the scheme, despite increasing signs of distress on firms, according to Dessie Morrow, a specialist in company rescues. The latest Scarp Index from accountancy firm Azets, where Mr Morrow is a partner, shows construction, hospitality and alcohol producing sectors accounted for the highest proportion of businesses using the scheme so far this year. It also shows a 15pc increase in the number of businesses being restructured using the Scarp, compared to the first half last year, an increase that is consistent with higher numbers of insolvencies and other forms of distress. The latest index shows a total of 100 business have now used the Scarp process since scheme launched in 2021. Mr Morrow says 1,314 jobs have saved thanks to use of the rescue process. Scarp was introduced following lengthy consultation with industry as an alternative to the more expensive and lengthy examinership regime. The idea is to provide a simplified restructuring mechanism for viable small companies facing financial distress, with only a relatively light court involvement. A Scarp process is initiated by companies themselves and can begin without any court approval being required, helping to slash overall costs. The first step is the appointment of a specialist adviser – generally an accountant specialising in insolvency who must then notify creditors the process is under way and they have 50 days to come up with a rescue plan acceptable to the various affected parties. Including a 21-day cooling-off period, the process must be concluded within 70 days. Creditors who stand to lose under a rescue deal can object. Crucially however, state agencies including Revenue and the Department of Social Protection, can opt out of a Scarp arrangement, meaning even if a deal is done with other creditors and landlords, for example, a business may be left with what is regards as unsustainable tax debts including warehoused Covid era liabilities. Mr Morrow says Revenue has in practice been willing to engage with rescue efforts, but the risk it will not row in behind a scheme is a disincentive to businesses operators from attempting to restructure. “The Revenue opt out does deter businesses,” he said. It is one of a number of issues identified by Azets following an analysis of the 100 Scarp cases. It is calling for the existing Revenue opt-out at the start of the process to be removed. It also argues the short time frame of the process can create resource constraints in particular for micro companies where an individual may be responsible for a number of areas within the business – everything from staffing the counter to bookkeeping. The proposed solution is to bring the process to a pre-populated form-filling stage as a first phase. Meanwhile, the Scarp Index for the first half of the year shows 15 processes have started to date in 2025: hospitality (20pc) accounted for the highest proportion of cases, followed by the construction (13pc) and alcohol producing (13pc) sectors, an indicator that uncertainty around trade tariffs may already be impacting the export orientated boutique spirits sector. Among the businesses to have successfully undergone Scarp with the support of Azets advisers this year are Big Mike’s Restaurant in Blackrock and New Century Engineering.

Title: EU regulators probing Robinhood’s tokenized equity plans after OpenAI raises concerns

OpenAI's disavowal prompts EU inquiry into Robinhood's compliance on tokenized equity plans. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Robinhood’s private equity tokens, offering exposure to tech stocks like SpaceX and OpenAI, have triggered regulatory scrutiny in Europe after OpenAI raised concerns and said that the digital assets do not represent equity ownership in the company, CNBC reported on July 7. The Bank of Lithuania, which serves as Robinhood’s primary regulator in the European Union, confirmed it is seeking detailed clarifications before assessing the products’ legality. A spokesperson for the central bank told CNBC: “Only after receiving and evaluating this information will we be able to assess the legality and compliance of these specific instruments.” The controversy centers on Robinhood’s recent announcement of an expansion into tokenized securities, including plans to issue over 200 tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs for European investors. The brokerage announced plans to launch its private equity tokens and a new layer-2 blockchain on June 30, positioning itself as a major player in the rapidly growing tokenization sector. However, OpenAI has distanced itself from the tokens, warning investors that Robinhood’s so-called OpenAI tokens do not provide any equity stake or direct ownership rights in the company. The scrutiny comes as financial institutions ramp up efforts to capture a slice of the tokenization market, which is valued at over $24 billion as of June 30. Although tokenized private credit and U.S. Treasury debt currently dominate the sector, accounting for the majority of value, tokenized equities remain a small but potentially fast-growing segment, with just $188 million in current market share. Major players such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have also entered the tokenization space, issuing tokenized money market funds and exploring blockchain-based settlements to improve efficiency and transparency. However, despite the optimism, legal and regulatory uncertainties remain significant. Regulators and lawyers continue to debate whether tokenized equity instruments require full securities registration or if derivative-like structures are sufficient to meet compliance standards in Europe and the U.S. For Robinhood, the regulatory probe in Lithuania could set an important precedent as the brokerage seeks to roll out its tokenization framework globally. Its recent presentation at the EthCC conference in Brussels outlined plans to tokenize a wide range of financial instruments, but the backlash highlights the fine line between innovation and investor protection in the fast-evolving digital asset market.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy At CRED iQ, our mission is to provide commercial real estate professionals with the data and insights needed to navigate an ever-evolving market. This week, our research team took a deep dive into loan delinquency trends, expanding our lens from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) to the present day. By focusing on FDIC-insured commercial banking and savings institutions, which includes community banks, we’ve uncovered critical patterns in CRE loan performance, offering a clearer perspective on today’s marketplace. Two key segments and what they tell us Our analysis spans from March 2007 to March 2025, shifting focus from securitized and agency markets to FDIC-insured institutions. We examined two key segments: multifamily properties and “core” CRE, which includes office, retail, hotel, industrial, self-storage and other property types. This approach builds on our earlier research, providing a comprehensive view of delinquency trends and their implications for the CRE industry. Key findings from Q1 2025 Our analysis revealed several trends in loan performance: • Core CRE lending growth slows: The long-term average annual growth rate for core CRE lending balances is 4.55 percent. The first quarter of 2025, however, saw an annualized growth rate of just 1.22 percent, the lowest since 2012, signaling a cautious lending environment. • Core CRE delinquencies rise: Total delinquencies across core property types reached $31.4 billion in Q1 2025, equating to a 1.7 percent overall delinquency rate. Of this, $25.1 billion are loans 90-plus days delinquent, while $6.3 billion are 30 to 89 days delinquent. • Net losses decline for core CRE: Net losses in the core sector totaled $3.9 billion in Q1 2025, down from $5.9 billion in the prior quarter, suggesting some stabilization. • Multifamily losses peak: Multifamily properties reported net losses of $767 million in Q1 2025, the highest quarterly total since 2012, highlighting growing challenges in this sector. Comparing March 2020 to March 2025 To contextualize recent trends, we compared delinquency metrics from March 2020 to March 2025: • Multifamily delinquencies surge: Delinquent loan balances in the multifamily sector grew from $1.5 billion (0.3 percent delinquency rate) in 2020 to $9.4 billion (1.5 percent) in 2025. Loans 90-plus days delinquent increased dramatically, from $560 million to $6.71 billion. • Core CRE delinquencies double: Delinquent loan balances in the core segment rose from $15.4 billion (1 percent) in 2020 to $31.4 billion (1.7 percent) in 2025, with 90-plus day delinquencies climbing from $9.7 billion to $25.1 billion. These shifts underscore the increasing pressures on CRE loan performance, particularly in the multifamily sector, where rising delinquencies and losses signal heightened risk.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Multinational investment firm BlackRock is making big moves in the asset management business. BlackRock has entered an agreement to acquire ElmTree Funds, a real estate investment firm focusing on single-tenant, built-to-suit commercial properties with $7.3 billion in assets under management, according to a Monday announcement. A spokesperson for BlackRock declined to provide the acquisition price for the ElmTree deal, but the announcement said payment for the purchase will be primarily in stock, with the potential of “additional consideration” depending on ElmTree’s performance over the next five years. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of this year. ElmTree has investments in 122 properties across 31 U.S. states. Once the deal closes, the firm will be integrated into BlackRock’s Private Financing Solutions (PFS) platform, the announcement said. BlackRock created PFS through its $12 billion purchase of credit firm HPS Investment Partners last year, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the news. The platform has “broad capabilities across senior and junior credit solutions, asset-based finance, real estate, private placements and CLOs,” according to a December release. “Structural shifts in the real estate sector are creating new opportunities for private capital,” Scott Kapnick, chairman of PFS’s executive office and CEO of HPS, said in a statement. “The combination of a premier triple-net investor with our leading private financing solutions platform will position us to capture these opportunities for our clients,” Kapnick added. “ElmTree has the team, expertise and relationships that will help drive growth and deliver differentiated investment solutions.” Founded in 2011, ElmTree has six offices across the U.S. in St. Louis, New York City, Chicago, Austin, Phoenix and Newport Beach, Calif., according to its website. As part of the acquisition, ElmTree will position PFS to scale its real estate offering, expand into new markets as an owner-operator, and accelerate its long-term growth, according to the release. In addition, the platform will be “positioned to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns with favorable structures” and offer clients the “long-term, stable income investment solutions they seek for their portfolios,” the release said. “Our specialized bricks-and-mortar expertise will be augmented by HPS’s ability to provide financing and other solutions that fuel the corporations and developers driving the economy forward,” said ElmTree CEO and founder James Koman, who will continue to lead ElmTree’s investment strategies as part of the new deal. “By joining HPS and BlackRock, we are better positioned to meet market demand and serve our partners by growing alongside them for the long term,” Koman added. The deal also comes as part of BlackRock’s larger acquisition spree, after purchasing both HPS and Global Infrastructure Partners last year, Bloomberg reported. Also last year, BlackRock expanded its current 1 million-square-foot New York City headquarters at Related Companies’ 50 Hudson Yards by more than 50,000 square feet, as Commercial Observer previously reported.

NEXT | The Queue: Far from home The Collector’s Bounty buff is currently active in World of Warcraft until July 29 at 8AM pacific time that boosts the drop rates of rare mounts and transmogs from all raids and dungeons in legacy WoW content, aka, everything before Dragonflight. Mount drop rates have been increased by up to 10 times, and in one specific (yet unknown) case, 25 times, and the transmog drop rates have been doubled. While all of the raids have transmog rewards, only some of them reward mounts and other rare items, like the Warglaives of Azzinoth which are also affected by this buff. You still have to run the correct version of the activity to get the rare items but fortunately most of the legacy raid content can be done solo you still have to run the correct version of the raid to get the rare items. To access the LFR difficulty, you have to speak to certain NPCs in order to get in. For raids on any of the other difficulties (Normal, Heroic, Mythic), choose the version you want by right-clicking your character’s profile picture under “Raid Difficulty” and then entering the raid at its location on the map. The raid section of the adventure guide has a “Show on Map” feature that will point you to where you need to go but we’ve also got you covered on where to find these raids if you haven’t run them in awhile, or if you’ve never run them before.

Title: Chris Hedges: Profiting From Genocide
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/chris-hedges-profiting-from-genocide/
Time Published: 2025-07-07T20:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Activism Chris Hedges, ScheerPost War is a business. So is genocide. The latest report submitted by Francesca Albanese, Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as Blackrock, insurers, real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international law are making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians. The report, which includes a database of over 1,000 corporate entities that collaborate with Israel, demands these firms and institutions sever ties with Israel or be held accountable for complicity in war crimes. It describes “Israel’s “forever-occuption” as “the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech – providing significant supply and demand, little oversight, and zero accountability – while investors and private and public institutions profit freely.” The post-Holocaust industrialists’ trials and the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission laid the legal framework for recognizing the criminal responsibility of institutions and businesses that participate in international crimes. This new report makes clear that decisions made by the International Court of Justice place an obligation on entities “to not engage and/or to withdraw totally and unconditionally from any associated dealings, and to ensure that any engagement with Palestinians enables their self-determination.” “The genocide in Gaza has not stopped because it’s lucrative, it’s profitable for far too many,” Albanese told me. “It’s a business. There are corporate entities, including from Palestine-friendly states, who have for decades made businesses and made profits out of the economy of the occupation. Israel has always exploited Palestinian land, resources and Palestinian life. The profits have continued and even increased as the economy of the occupation transformed into an economy of genocide.” In addition, she said, Palestinians have provided “boundless training fields to test the technologies, test weapons, to test surveillance techniques that now are being used against people everywhere from the Global South to the Global North.” You can see my interview with Albanese here. The report lambasts corporations for “providing Israel with the weapons and machinery required to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places of leisure and worship, livelihoods and productive assets, such as olive groves and orchards.” The Palestinian territory, the report notes, is a “captive market” because of Israeli-imposed restrictions on trade and investment, tree planting, fishing and water for colonies. Corporations have profiteered from this “captive market” by “exploiting Palestinian labour and resources, degrading and diverting natural resources, building and powering colonies and selling and marketing derived goods and services in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territory and globally.” “Israel gains from this exploitation, while it costs the Palestinian economy at least 35 per cent of its GDP,” the report notes. Banks, asset management firms, pension funds and insurers have “channeled finance into the illegal occupation,” the report charges. In addition, “universities — centres of intellectual growth and power — have sustained the political ideology underpinning the colonization of Palestinian land, developed weaponry and overlooked or even endorsed systemic violence, while global research collaborations have obscured Palestinian erasure behind a veil of academic neutrality.” Surveillance and incarceration technologies have “evolved into tools for indiscriminate targeting of the Palestinian population,” the report notes. “Heavy machinery previously used for house demolitions, infrastructure destruction and resource seizure in the West Bank have been repurposed to obliterate the urban landscape of Gaza, preventing displaced populations from returning and reconstituting as a community.” The military assault on the Palestinians has also “provided testing grounds for cutting-edge military capabilities: air defense platforms, drones, targeting tools powered by artificial intelligence and even the F-35 programme led by the United States of America. These technologies are then marketed as ‘battle proven.’” Since 2020, Israel has been the eighth largest arms exporter in the world. Its two biggest weapons companies are Elbit Systems Ltd and the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd (IAI). It has a series of international partnerships with foreign weapons firms, including “for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United States-based Lockheed Martin.” “Components and parts constructed globally contribute to the Israeli F-35 fleet, which Israel customizes and maintains in partnership with Lockheed Martin and domestic companies.” the report reads. Since October 2023, F-35s and F-16s jets have been “integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure more than 179,411 Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.” “Drones, hexacopters and quadcopters have also been omnipresent killing machines in the skies of Gaza,” the report reads. “Drones largely developed and supplied by Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries have long flown alongside fighter jets, surveilling Palestinians and delivering target intelligence. In the past two decades, with support from these companies and collaborations with institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drones used by Israel acquired automated weapons systems and the ability to fly in swarm formation.” Japan’s FANUC companies sell automation products and “provide robotic machinery for weapons production lines, including for IAI, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin.” “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller — Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post-October 2023.” There was a “65 per cent surge in Israeli military spending from 2023 to 2024 – amounting to $46.5 billion, one of the highest per capita worldwide.” This “generated a sharp surge in their annual profits,” while “Foreign arms companies, especially producers of munitions and ordnance, also profit.” At the same time, tech companies have profited from the genocide by “providing dual-use infrastructure to integrate mass data collection and surveillance, while profiting from the unique testing ground for military technology offered by the occupied Palestinian territory.” They enhance “carceral and surveillance services, from closed-circuit television (CCTV) networks, biometric surveillance, advanced tech checkpoint networks, ‘smart walls’ and drone surveillance, to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and data analytics supporting on-the-ground military personnel.” “Israeli tech firms often grow out of military infrastructure and strategy,” the report reads, “as the NSO Group, founded by ex-Unit 8200 members, did. Its Pegasus spyware, designed for covert smartphone surveillance, has been used against Palestinian activists and licensed globally to target leaders, journalists and human rights defenders. Exported under the Defense Export Control Law, NSO group surveillance technology enables ‘spyware diplomacy’ while reinforcing State impunity.” IBM, whose technology facilitated Nazi Germany’s generation and tabulation of punched cards for national census data, military logistics, ghetto statistics, train traffic management and concentration camp capacity, is once again a partner in this current genocide. It has operated in Israel since 1972. It provides training for Israeli military and intelligence agencies, especially Unit 8200, which is responsible for clandestine operations, the collection of signal intelligence and code decryption, along with counterintelligence, cyberwarfare, military intelligence and surveillance. “Since 2019, IBM Israel has operated and upgraded the central database of the Population and Immigration Authority, enabling collection, storage and governmental use of biometric data on Palestinians, and supporting the discriminatory permit regime of Israel,” the report notes. Microsoft, active in Israel since 1989, is “embedded in the prison service, police, universities and schools — including in colonies. Microsoft has been integrating its systems and civilian tech across the Israeli military since 2003, while acquiring Israeli cybersecurity and surveillance start-ups.” “As Israeli apartheid, military and population-control systems generate increasing volumes of data, its reliance on cloud storage and computing has grown,” the report reads. “In 2021, Israel awarded Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Amazon.com, Inc. a $1.2 billion contract (Project Nimbus) — largely funded through Ministry of Defense expenditure — to provide core tech infrastructure.” Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon “grant Israel virtually government-wide access to their cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, enhancing data processing, decision-making and surveillance and analysis capacities.” The Israeli military, the report points out, “has developed artificial intelligence systems such as‘Lavender,’ ‘Gospel’ and ‘Where’s Daddy?’ to process data and generate lists of targets, reshaping modern warfare and illustrating the dual-use nature of artificial intelligence.” There are “reasonable grounds,” the report reads, to believe that Palantir Technology Inc., which has a long relationship with Israel, “has provided automatic predictive policing technology, core defence infrastructure for rapid and scaled-up construction and deployment of military software, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which allows real-time battlefield data integration for automated decision-making.” Palantir’s CEO in April 2025 responded to accusations that Palantir kills Palestinians in Gaza by saying, “mostly terrorists, that’s true.” “Civilian technologies have long served as dual-use tools of settler-colonial occupation,” the report reads. “Israeli military operations rely heavily on equipment from leading global manufacturers to ‘unground’ Palestinians from their land, demolishing homes, public buildings, farmland, roads and other vital infrastructure. Since October 2023, this machinery has been integral to damaging and destroying 70 per cent of structures and 81 per cent of cropland in Gaza.” Caterpillar Inc. has for decades provided the Israeli military with equipment used to demolish Palestinian homes, mosques, hospitals as well as “burying alive wounded Palestinians,” and killed activists, such as Rachel Corrie. “Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded core weaponry of the Israeli military, deployed in almost every military activity since 2000, clearing incursion lines, ‘neutralizing’ the territory and killing Palestinians,” the report reads. This year, Caterpillar “secured a further multi-millionaire dollar contract with Israel.” “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially-owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been linked to destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through exclusively licensed Israeli dealers,” the report reads. “As corporate actors have contributed to the destruction of Palestinian life in the occupied Palestinian territory, they have also helped construction of what replaces it: building colonies and their infrastructure, extracting and trading materials, energy and agricultural products, and bringing visitors to colonies as if to a regular holiday destination.” “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population in the occupied Palestinian territory,” the report concludes. These building projects have used Caterpillar, HD Hyundai and Volvo excavators and heavy equipment. Hanson Israel, a subsidiary of the German Heidelberg Materials AG, “has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank.” The quarried dolomite is used to construct Jewish colonies in the West Bank. Foreign firms have also “contributed to developing roads and public transport infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians.” Global real estate companies sell properties in colonial settlements to Israeli and international buyers. These real estate firms include Keller Williams Realty LLC, which has “had branches based in the colonies” through its Israeli franchisee KW Israel. Last year through another franchisee called Home in Israel, Keller Williams “ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments in colonies.” Rental platforms, including Booking.com and Airbnb, list properties and hotel rooms in illegal Jewish colonies in the West Bank. Chinese Bright Dairy & Food is a majority owner of Tnuva, Israel’s largest food conglomerate, which utilizes land seized from Palestinians in the West Bank. In the energy sector, “Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMedEnergy (a subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas from the Leviathan and Tamar fields; it paid the Government of Israel $453 million in royalties and taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 per cent of Israeli energy consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership of the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime territory, and from gas export sales to Egypt and Jordan.” BP and Chevron also serve as “the largest contributors to Israeli imports of crude oil, as major owners of the strategic Azeri Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the Kazakh Caspian Pipeline Consortium, respectively, and of their associated oil fields. Each conglomerate effectively supplied 8 per cent of Israeli crude oil between October 2023 and July 2024, supplemented by crude oil shipments from Brazilian oil fields, in which Petrobras holds the largest stakes, and military jet fuel. Oil from these companies supplies two refineries in Israel.” “By supplying Israel with coal, gas, oil and fuel, companies are contributing to civilian infrastructures that Israel uses to entrench permanent annexation and now weaponizes in the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza,” the report reads. “The same infrastructure that these companies supply resources into has serviced the Israeli military and its energy-intensive tech-driven obliteration of Gaza. ” International banks and financial firms have also sustained the genocide through the purchase of Israeli treasury bonds. “As the main source of finance for the Israeli State budget, treasury bonds have played a critical role in funding the ongoing assault on Gaza,” the report reads. “From 2022 to 2024, the Israeli military budget grew from 4.2 per cent to 8.3 per cent of GDP, driving the public budget into a 6.8 per cent deficit. Israel funded this ballooning budget by increasing its bond issuance, including $8 billion in March 2024 and $5 billion in February 2025, alongside issuances on its domestic new shekel market.” The report notes that some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas and Barclays, “stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium, despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms — including Blackrock ($68 million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO ($960 million) — were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased them.” Faith-based charities have “also become key financial enablers of illegal projects, including in the occupied Palestinian territory, often receiving tax deductions abroad despite strict regulatory charitable frameworks,” the report reads. “The Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) and its over 20 affiliates fund settler expansion and military-linked projects,” the report reads. “Since October 2023, platforms such as Israel Gives have enabled tax-deductible crowdfunding in 32 countries for Israeli military units and settlers. The United States-based Christian Friends of Israeli Communities, Dutch Christians for Israel and global affiliates, sent over $12.25 million in 2023 to various projects that support colonies, including some that train extremist settlers.” The report criticizes universities that partner with Israeli universities and institutions. It notes that labs at MIT “conduct weapons and surveillance research funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense.” These projects include “drone swarm control — a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023 — pursuit algorithms, and underwater surveillance.” You can see my interview with the MIT students who exposed the collaboration between the university Israeli military here. Genocide requires a vast network and billions of dollars to sustain it. Israel could not carry out its mass slaughter of the Palestinians without this ecosystem. These entities, which profit from industrial violence against the Palestinians and mass displacement, are as guilty of genocide as the Israeli militray units decimating the people in Gaza. They too are war criminals, They too must be held accountable. Activism Activism Activism Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Title: What to know about private equity in your 401(k)

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week BlackRock is making private investments available in employer-sponsored retirement plans Historically, private equity has not been among the investment options available for 401(k) plans. But that could soon change, providing a new opportunity for retirement savers — though also one that may carry substantial risk. In evidence of this potential shift toward private investments, at the end of June, BlackRock, the "world's largest asset manager," announced that it "plans to offer a 401(k) target-date fund with a 5%-to-20% allocation to private investments," said The Wall Street Journal. BlackRock is the "biggest such provider yet to announce that it will make private investments available" in employer-sponsored retirement plans. Still, it "will be up to employers to decide whether they want to add them," said the outlet. Investors, too, should evaluate the opportunity carefully. Private equity is a "form of investment in privately held companies that are not publicly traded on stock exchanges," said SmartAsset, a personal finance blog. Usually, private equity investment is "made through funds pooled from institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals" who are "aiming to acquire ownership stakes in businesses with growth potential." Participation often requires "significant capital" and a certain level of investment knowledge or wealth. Escape your echo chamber.

The potential incorporation of private equity into 401(k) investment options would follow an "increasing push to provide more private capital investment opportunities for retail investors and participants in workplace retirement plans," said CNN Business. Private equity firms "see the $12.2 trillion market for 401(k)-type retirement plans as a way to reach the everyday investors that are crucial to their growth," said the Journal. They also make the case that investors deserve access to these opportunities. According to Jaime Magyera, the co-head of BlackRock's U.S. wealth advisory business, "private assets play an increasingly important role in the global economy," which is "why the company believes it is important to give 401(k) investors access to them," said the outlet. President Trump has also indicated an openness to allowing the shift. In Trump's first term, the Labor Department "issued an information letter to plan fiduciaries, telling them that private equity may be part of a 'prudent investment mix' in a professionally managed asset allocation fund in a 401(k) plan," said CNBC. Private equity investments "would offer more choices and potentially higher returns" for those investing for retirement, but they also have "significant drawbacks," said Investopedia. "These investments typically carry higher risks, charge steeper fees and offer limited liquidity." They are also "less transparent, making them more difficult to assess than traditional retirement investments." Further, evidence of the returns is "mixed," according to "academic and industry studies on it," said CNN Business, citing Jason Kephart, the senior principal for multi-asset strategy ratings at Morningstar. This means there is "no guarantee that you will enjoy meaningfully better returns in your portfolio" in exchange for the downsides.

Title: BlackBerry Limited (BB): A Bull Case Theory
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-limited-bb-bull-case-183346134.html

Oops, something went wrong We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on BlackBerry Limited by Polymath Investor on Substack. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on BB. BlackBerry Limited's share was trading at $4.3200 as of 18th June. BB’s forward P/E was 42.92 according to Yahoo Finance. BlackBerry, long known for its legacy in mobile devices, is undergoing a transformation that has recently attracted renewed bullish interest, particularly centered around its Internet of Things (IoT) division. The company’s Q4 results highlight the strength of its QNX-powered IoT segment, which delivered record revenue of $66 million with exceptional 83% gross margins. This business powers embedded software in over 235 million vehicles globally and continues to benefit from the accelerating adoption of connected and autonomous vehicle technologies. Despite this robust performance, BlackBerry’s overall financials remain underwhelming due to the ongoing struggles of its cybersecurity segment, which has seen stagnating growth and margin compression. This discrepancy between segment performance and overall valuation presents a sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) opportunity, where the high-margin, high-growth IoT unit is overshadowed by the underperforming cybersecurity division. There is growing speculation that BlackBerry could initiate a strategic separation of these two businesses to unlock shareholder value, especially with activist pressure mounting and the board now seemingly more aligned with such restructuring initiatives. The company has already hinted at such a move in prior strategic reviews, and a formal separation or sale of the IoT business could yield a significantly higher valuation than the market currently reflects. Even in a base-case scenario where no separation occurs, the IoT division’s growth trajectory and margin profile provide a strong underpinning for a re-rating of BlackBerry shares. For equity investors, the downside appears limited given the embedded value of the IoT business, while any corporate action could serve as a meaningful catalyst for upside. Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on BlackBerry Limited by NYCandrun in February 2025, which highlighted the company’s underappreciated positioning in embedded automotive software through QNX, the SaaS-like potential of its IVY platform, and the stabilization of its cybersecurity segment. The company’s stock price has depreciated by approximately 23% since our coverage. This is because the re-rating thesis has not yet played out due to muted IVY traction and macro headwinds. The thesis still stands as QNX continues to grow, and IVY has real adoption potential. Polymath shares a similar view but emphasizes the strategic unlock potential of a formal separation between the IoT and cybersecurity businesses.

Oops, something went wrong We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on Amazon.com, Inc. on Disruptive Analytics’ Substack by Magnus Ofstad. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on AMZN. Amazon.com, Inc.'s share was trading at $208.47 as of June 23rd. AMZN’s trailing and forward P/E were 33.95 and 32.26, respectively, according to Yahoo Finance. A network of interconnected data points representing cloud-based software solutions. Amazon (AMZN) is a complex business that, at first glance, appears to operate like a traditional logistics company, with millions of employees packing and delivering merchandise. Yet despite this scale, its e-commerce segment contributes relatively little to operating profits. The real engine lies elsewhere—Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising together account for nearly 80% of profits while representing only 30% of total revenue. AWS, Amazon’s cloud division, dominates with a 50% market share and stands as critical infrastructure in the AI revolution, offering recurring, high-margin revenue amid competition from Microsoft and Alphabet. As AI adoption accelerates, Amazon’s massive data streams from its retail, logistics, and cloud businesses provide unmatched fuel for model training and deployment. This strategic advantage enables Amazon to lead in AI personalization, supply chain optimization, and automated customer service. Amazon is capitalizing on this through heavy investment—over $100 billion in 2025—to expand its AI infrastructure and reinforce its leadership. Despite being among the most scrutinized stocks on Wall Street, with analyst price targets clustering around $240–$250, a DCF analysis aligns with this consensus, suggesting limited market mispricing. The main hesitation lies not in valuation or fundamentals but in the psychological barrier of owning a heavily indexed stock individually. However, this concern may be misplaced. Amazon’s centrality in AI and cloud, and its sheer operational scale, make it an exceptional vehicle for long-term compounding. Even if widely owned, it remains a structurally advantaged asset likely to outperform as AI adoption deepens across industries. Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) by Charly AI in January 2025, which highlighted Amazon’s AI edge through custom chips and cost-efficient infrastructure. The stock has depreciated by ~12.4% since then, as the thesis didn’t play out short term. The thesis still stands. Magnus Ofstad shares a similar view but emphasizes Amazon’s broader AI monetization engine. Amazon.com, Inc. is on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 328 hedge fund portfolios held AMZN at the end of the first quarter, which was 339 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.
