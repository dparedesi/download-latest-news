Bitcoin ETF inflows top $4.4 billion as market sentiment remains bullish. Spot bitcoin ETFs recorded more than $4 billion in combined inflows from Dec. 2 through Dec. 12, according to Farside data. The figures include flows into BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, Ark, Invesco, Franklin, Valkyrie, VanEck, WTree, and Grayscale products. These entries tallied across several funds, moved through the market shortly after Bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 mark on Dec. 5 and continued amid steady price action. Cumulative totals from Dec. 2 reached $353.6 million, with Dec. 3 adding $676 million, followed by several other days posting hundreds of millions each. Activity slowed on Dec. 11, registering $223.1 million, before rising to $597.5 million on Dec. 12. The aggregate figure across the reporting period exceeded $4.4 billion. BlackRock and Fidelity contributed strongly to total flows with no outflows and persistent inflows over $100 million. The pattern suggests steady demand during a period when bitcoin traded near record territory. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is a reporter, podcast producer, and Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate.

Title: Analysis-China's bond market sees more economic pain ahead

By Jiaxing Li, Summer Zhen and Li Gu HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Investors in Chinese bonds head for 2025 betting there will be no miraculous recovery in the economy, putting them at odds with an equities market that has wagered on a revival in consumption. Although China's closed capital account diminishes the 33 trillion yuan ($4.6 trillion) market's worth as an economic forecaster, the signal from ten-year bond yields scraping record lows almost daily and long bonds falling below Japanese yields still shows a deep-set negativity about the outlook. "The bonds are basically saying that, yes, there is a (stock market) rally out there, but we don't buy this rally for the long term," said Bhanu Baweja, chief strategist for UBS Investment Bank in London. "Bonds are saying that this is not an earnings-based rally, this is not a reflation-based rally." A benchmark ten-year yield down more than 80 basis points this year to a record low of 1.78% reflects a banking system overflowing with cash and a market broadly expecting slow growth and hardly any inflation. Bond prices move inversely to yields and, because sovereign debt is regarded as a safe asset, they are affected by a combination of inflation expectations, interest rates, creditworthiness and appetite for risk in other asset classes. Since September, as China has cut interest rates and made numerous promises to stabilise financial and property markets, boost economic growth and revive consumption, equity markets have rallied and pushed price-to-earnings ratios sharply higher. Bonds have made an almost opposite move, particularly at the long end where 30-year yields have been driven below 2%. Thirty-year yields in Japan, an economy which has become a byword for deflation and slow growth, are 2.24%. "I think the Chinese bond yields should be lower if they were to reflect the current economic situation in the country," said Edmund Goh, investment director of fixed income at abrdn in Singapore. "We think it's difficult to see meaningful inflation given the property situation in China now and the government is determined not to create another property bubble." In March, China's government set a growth target of "around 5%" for this year, but the world's second-biggest economy has struggled for momentum and grew just 4.6% in the third quarter. Goldman Sachs sees growth slowing to 4.5% next year. LITTLE RESISTANCE Part of the backdrop to the bond rally is a lack of alternatives. Chinese banks are bursting with more than 300 trillion yuan in deposits and with loan growth in the doldrums, much of that ends up flowing to money markets and bonds - pushing down yields. The yield on the popular Tianhong Yu'Ebao money fund, which is China's largest with more than 600 million investors, hit a record low at 1.266% this week. "Onshore lenders are facing the question of whether to give out loans to businesses, or to play it safe with risk-free Chinese government bonds," said Clarissa Teng, fixed income allocation strategist at the chief investment office of UBS global wealth management in Hong Kong. "Many are doing the latter, especially given that credit demand from households and corporates has been soft as well." Risks to the bond market are some of the same factors supporting equities - that China unveils a large fiscal spending plan which requires extra borrowing and leads to higher inflation, both of which are negative for bonds. China's central bank has also sounded uncomfortable with the scale of the rally and has actively sold bonds to slow it down. Foreign investors, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), have also been sellers in part to take some profits after the long rally. Still, most investors say the path of least resistance is for the rally to continue with Li Kai, chief investment officer of Beijing Shengao Fund Management, expecting a 10-year yield of 1.6% next year and others confident in their positions. "We're struggling to find much reason to be pessimistic about the sovereign bond market," said analysts at Shanghai-based Shoupu Asset Management in a November letter to investors. "The facts of economic fundamentals are out there, and without strong, targeted growth-stabilising policies, there is little resistance to the decline in bond yields."

Title: Bitcoin price today: dips below $100k as rate jitters mount before the Fed

Investing.com-- Bitcoin fell marginally on Friday as a recent rally past key levels cooled, with traders remaining largely risk-averse before a Federal Reserve rate decision due next week. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency rose sharply on Thursday after President-elect Donald Trump reiterated his pledge to make the U.S. a global crypto leader. But this bounce was short-lived, given that he did not provide any major cues on policy. Bitcoin fell 0.5% to $100,340.0 by 08:57 ET (14:57 GMT). Focus was now squarely on the Fed’s rate decision next week, where the central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. But markets turned uncertain over the Fed’s long-term outlook on rates, especially as producer inflation data for November read higher than expected, while consumer inflation remained sticky. The dollar firmed on this notion, pressuring risk-driven assets across the board. Traders were now awaiting the Fed’s outlook on rates, and are bracing for a slower pace of easing in 2025. High rates limit the appeal of speculative assets such as crypto. Recent crypto market data showed spot exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin and Ether saw sustained inflows through early December, amid sustained optimism over friendlier regulations under Trump. Bitcoin ETFs saw an eleventh consecutive day of inflows as of December 12, with Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) commanding the biggest share of inflows. Spot Ether ETFs marked 14 straight days of inflows, with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) and Grayscale ETFs seeing the most inflows. ETF inflows signal increased institutional interest in crypto, given that they offer investors a safer way to gain crypto exposure. The launch of spot ETFs in U.S. markets earlier this year was viewed as largely positive for crypto, with inflows picking up rapidly after Trump’s election victory in early-November. Most major altcoins rescinded some of their gains made this week in tandem with Bitcoin. But they had also largely outpaced Bitcoin in recent weeks, as markets bet that friendly U.S. regulations will allow cryptos beyond Bitcoin to flourish. Ether fell 0.3% to $3,929.05, while XRP fell 1% to $2.39. Solana, Cardano and Polygon fell between 2% and 4%, while among meme tokens, Dogecoin fell 1.3%. Meanwhile, Chainlink climbed more than 2% on the day, extending its sharp gains from a day earlier. LINK surged more than 20% Thursday after World Liberty Financial, a platform backed by Donald Trump, expanded its investment in Chainlink’s token. The organization purchased an additional $1 million worth of LINK on the day, marking its second consecutive day of acquisitions and bringing its total LINK holdings to $2 million. The token was trading at $28.3 apiece, representing levels not seen since late 2021. The platform also acquired $246,000 worth of Aave’s AAVE token, increasing its total AAVE holdings to $1.2 million. LINK now ranks as World Liberty Financial’s fourth-largest holding, trailing ether, bitcoin, and tether. Supported by the Trump family, World Liberty Financial offers a comprehensive platform for borrowing and lending cryptocurrencies, creating liquidity pools, and conducting stablecoin transactions.

Title: British government mandates methane-reducing Bovaer feed additive for cows â but at what cost?

The British government has mandated that all suitable British cattle will be given Bovaer, a methane-reducing feed additive, by 2030, in an effort to tackle climate change. Bovaer, a feed additive used in 55 countries, inhibits an enzyme called methyl-coenzyme M reductase to reduce methane production in ruminants. Despite the British Food Standards Agency (FSA) declaring it safe for both animals and humans, concerns persist about its potential long-term health effects. The mandate has sparked consumer fears and concerns about product safety, leading to boycotts of dairy products from major brands like Arla Foods and Lurpak. Critics argue that the long-term impact on human health and the environment remains insufficiently studied. The safety data sheet for Bovaer advises handlers to wear masks and gloves, raising questions about its safety when consumed indirectly through milk. This has further fueled consumer distrust and calls for more rigorous safety testing. While the FSA claims that Bovaer does not enter milk and is safe for consumption, the lack of long-term human studies leaves important questions unanswered. As public trust wanes, it is essential for authorities to provide clear communication about the safety and potential risks of Bovaer.

While the FSA claims that Bovaer does not enter milk and is safe for consumption, the lack of long-term human studies leaves important questions unanswered. As public trust wanes, it is essential for authorities to provide clear communication about the safety and potential risks of Bovaer. The British government has announced a mandate that all suitable British cattle will be given Bovaer, a methane-reducing feed additive, by 2030. This decision, aimed at tackling climate change, has sparked controversy and concern among consumers, particularly about the long-term effects on human health. According to Wikifarmer, methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas. Livestock, especially dairy and beef cattle, produce CH4 as a by-product of digestion. To address this issue, scientists have developed feed additives like Bovaer, also known as 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP). The additive works by inhibiting an enzyme called methyl-coenzyme M reductase, thus reducing CH4 production in the stomach of ruminants. Bovaer has been used in 55 countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Downing Street's mandate follows a similar initiative by Denmark-based Arla Foods, which introduced Bovaer in a trial involving 30 British farms. The British Food Standards Agency (FSA) has declared Bovaer safe for use, stating that when used at the correct dosage, it does not cause cancer or any other health issues in animals or humans. Critics argue that the impact of Bovaer on both animals and the environment has not been sufficiently studied, and that long-term effects on human health are still unknown. The move to mandate Bovaer for British cows has not been without its challengers. One of the key concerns centers around the product safety sheet for Bovaer, which advises handlers to wear masks and gloves to avoid risks from small dust particles. Critics argue that if such precautions are necessary for handlers, why should the additive be considered safe for consumption indirectly through milk? The FSA's claims have not quelled consumer fears. Environmental and public health concerns have led to a boycott of dairy products, particularly from Arla Foods, which has been accused of "re-engineering the cow" with its use of Bovaer. Dairy BOYCOTT spreads as consumers question safety of Bovaer The safety concerns have also led to a widespread boycott of dairy products from major brands, including Lurpak and Arla, as consumers fear potential contamination and health risks. This has left many supermarkets struggling to maintain consumer trust, with shoppers taking to TikTok to share videos of pouring milk down the drain and boycotting products. (Related: Consumers in Great Britain BOYCOTT milk products that contain 3-NOP â a chemical fed to cows to reduce methane gas.) Perhaps the most pressing concern is the potential long-term impact of consuming dairy products from cows treated with Bovaer. While the FSA claims that Bovaer does not enter into milk and therefore does not reach consumers, this assertion is still being scrutinized. Studies have shown that in high-dose scenarios, Bovaer can increase the risk of cancer in female rats, though further analysis found that these risks were not statistically significant. However, the lack of long-term human studies leaves a significant gap in our understanding of the additive's effects on human health. Given the sensitive nature of the issue, further research is essential to establish the safety profile of Bovaer and similar CH4-reducing additives. The British government's mandate to use Bovaer to reduce CH4 emissions from cattle is a significant step in addressing climate change. However, it also raises important questions about the long-term impact of such interventions on human health and the environment. As public trust in authorities wanes in the wake of the pandemic, it is crucial for regulators to provide clear, transparent communication about the safety and potential risks associated with Bovaer. In the meantime, consumers will undoubtedly remain vigilant, seeking assurance that their food remains safe and free from untested additives. Watch this clip about the various side effects of Bovaer.

To address this issue, scientists have developed feed additives like Bovaer, also known as 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP). The additive works by inhibiting an enzyme called methyl-coenzyme M reductase, thus reducing CH4 production in the stomach of ruminants. Bovaer has been used in 55 countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Downing Street's mandate follows a similar initiative by Denmark-based Arla Foods, which introduced Bovaer in a trial involving 30 British farms. The British Food Standards Agency (FSA) has declared Bovaer safe for use, stating that when used at the correct dosage, it does not cause cancer or any other health issues in animals or humans. Critics argue that the impact of Bovaer on both animals and the environment has not been sufficiently studied, and that long-term effects on human health are still unknown. The move to mandate Bovaer for British cows has not been without its challengers. One of the key concerns centers around the product safety sheet for Bovaer, which advises handlers to wear masks and gloves to avoid risks from small dust particles. Critics argue that if such precautions are necessary for handlers, why should the additive be considered safe for consumption indirectly through milk? The FSA's claims have not quelled consumer fears. Environmental and public health concerns have led to a boycott of dairy products, particularly from Arla Foods, which has been accused of "re-engineering the cow" with its use of Bovaer. Dairy BOYCOTT spreads as consumers question safety of Bovaer The safety concerns have also led to a widespread boycott of dairy products from major brands, including Lurpak and Arla, as consumers fear potential contamination and health risks. This has left many supermarkets struggling to maintain consumer trust, with shoppers taking to TikTok to share videos of pouring milk down the drain and boycotting products. (Related: Consumers in Great Britain BOYCOTT milk products that contain 3-NOP â a chemical fed to cows to reduce methane gas.) Perhaps the most pressing concern is the potential long-term impact of consuming dairy products from cows treated with Bovaer. While the FSA claims that Bovaer does not enter into milk and therefore does not reach consumers, this assertion is still being scrutinized. Studies have shown that in high-dose scenarios, Bovaer can increase the risk of cancer in female rats, though further analysis found that these risks were not statistically significant. However, the lack of long-term human studies leaves a significant gap in our understanding of the additive's effects on human health. Given the sensitive nature of the issue, further research is essential to establish the safety profile of Bovaer and similar CH4-reducing additives. The British government's mandate to use Bovaer to reduce CH4 emissions from cattle is a significant step in addressing climate change. However, it also raises important questions about the long-term impact of such interventions on human health and the environment. As public trust in authorities wanes in the wake of the pandemic, it is crucial for regulators to provide clear, transparent communication about the safety and potential risks associated with Bovaer. In the meantime, consumers will undoubtedly remain vigilant, seeking assurance that their food remains safe and free from untested additives. Watch this clip about the various side effects of Bovaer.

Given the sensitive nature of the issue, further research is essential to establish the safety profile of Bovaer and similar CH4-reducing additives. The British government's mandate to use Bovaer to reduce CH4 emissions from cattle is a significant step in addressing climate change. However, it also raises important questions about the long-term impact of such interventions on human health and the environment. As public trust in authorities wanes in the wake of the pandemic, it is crucial for regulators to provide clear, transparent communication about the safety and potential risks associated with Bovaer. In the meantime, consumers will undoubtedly remain vigilant, seeking assurance that their food remains safe and free from untested additives. Watch this clip about the various side effects of Bovaer.

Title: Shed Distillery founder Pat Rigney: ‘We’re very focused on a premium position but also on giving value for money to consumers’

Time Published: 2024-12-13T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
In Pat Rigney’s business, distilling premium spirits, cash is king. “It’s more important than profit,” he says, as we sip coffees in the restaurant at his Shed Distillery in Drumshanbo, Co Leitrim. “Interest rates are high, money is expensive and you’ve got to pay it back.” The modern and smartly-appointed distillery makes the hugely popular Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin and Drumshanbo Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey. There is also a vodka product and plans for a rum drink next year. Rigney has just invested €2 million into new kit to expand the distillery’s capacity, with its bottling facility being relocated to make room for the shiny new equipment. Working capital needs over the next five years will be “at least” €10 million, he adds, as it seeks to build up its stocks of Irish whiskey. Next week it will celebrate its 10th anniversary in a former Methodist church a short walk from the distillery that Rigney and his family bought, renovated and plan to make available for community use. They have also invested in an 80-acre farm nearby, which they are transforming into a nature reserve. The Dubliner, who went to school at Sandford Park in Ranelagh, to college just up the road in UCD and who lives in the capital by the coast in Blackrock, is putting down firm roots in the sleepy Leitrim village. Unlike some of its domestic peers, the family-owned Drumshanbo distillery has been consistently profitable and is debt free. In the year to the end of September 2023, it made a pretax profit of €3.8 million on turnover of €18.3 million. It closed the year with accumulated profits of €15.2 million and just under €5 million in cash. For the most recent financial year, which closed at the end of September, Rigney says its income and profits will be slightly under those figures, reflecting some discounts that it had to put through in the period to reflect the challenges involved in its markets. In July, global drinks giant Diageo, which owns Smirnoff vodka, Johnnie Walker whisky and other brands, reported its first global sales drop since 2020, citing weak consumer sentiment. PJ Rigney Distillery & International Brands Ltd, which owns the Leitrim distillery, was profitable in 2020 and 2021 in spite of the devastating impact of Covid-19 on the hospitality trade globally and on travel retail due to public health lockdown restrictions in many countries. Strong sales in the off-licence trade helped to keep the show on the road, along with the production of hand sanitiser for Tesco for a short period in 2020 to help satisfy the huge demand that existed at the time for products to keep the virus at bay. Notably, this strong trading performance over the years has been achieved without a price increase since launching. No increase has been baked into its budget for next year and Rigney doesn’t expect to impose one in 2026 either. “We’re very focused on a premium position but also on giving value for money,” he says. How did it manage to keep prices at the same level during the huge spike in inflation and energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022? “We’ve become more efficient, we’ve grown our volumes,” he says matter-of-factly. “And we’re a family-owned business taking the long-term view. We don’t have to report to the stock market. We have not taken a price increase [for 2025] we will not be taking one in 2026. We need to ensure that we become more efficient and deliver real value for our customers.” Rigney argues that the company offers premium products at “accessible” prices. A bottle of its Irish whiskey goes for €50-€60 or $60-$70, depending on taxes charged in its markets. “Consumers right now are looking for value but value isn’t always about price. It’s about the quality, the authenticity of the story behind it, the people behind it,” he says. There certainly is a unique story behind the Shed Distillery. Rigney is a veteran of the spirits industry. On leaving college he secured a marketing graduate role with Bulmer’s cider in Clonmel. He then went to Gilbey’s Gin and then on to Carolan’s Irish Cream. From there, he worked on the Bailey’s brand where he dreamed up the twin-bottle Sheridan’s Irish Cream that, according to a profile of him by stockbroker Davy, “made the market sit up and take notice”. He later worked with Ború vodka. The Shed Distillery was set up with €3 million of family money, he says. He is also a major shareholder and chairman of Dalcassian, the Dublin-based wine and spirits distributor, and an investor in Changing Times Brewery, the newly launched beer-maker in Glasnevin, backed by the families behind some of Dublin’s best known pubs. For the Shed Distillery, he wanted a location that was “wild and unmanicured, in the heart of rural Ireland”. He found it in Drumshanbo where a unit that had years earlier housed a jam factory was available to lease on a competitive deal. Being family owned (he founded the business with his wife Denise while his daughter Roisin has relocated to Leitrim and is involved in “marketing projects” at the business) is also a part of the story that resonates with customers, he says. Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin has been a huge success since its launch and is now available in more than 80 markets and is a top eight global brand. What makes it different from other gins? “It’s the oriental botanicals, it’s gunpowder tea, sourced by people at the distillery and curated here ... beautifully presented. We only sell whiskey here that we distil ourselves and we want to be the best in the world at single pot still. It’s distilled here with Irish oats and it’s really outstanding quality. And we have a great distiller in Brian Taft,” he says. How big can Gunpowder Irish Gin become? “I think we can get to half a million cases. We’re about 270,000 now. We’ve a long way to go. It’s a big leap but I think we will get there. We might do it in the next three to four years. It’s all about sales now.” Selling Irish whiskey into the United States might become more challenging post January 20th when Donald Trump returns to the White House. Trump has threatened to impose blanket tariffs on goods coming from Europe once back in office. Rigney is relaxed at the prospect. “Whether that will happen or not is hard to know because it would add to inflation in the US. So it may not materialise. “We can’t affect that, we have to play our own game and make sure that we work hard to deliver a great experience and not get distracted by all the noise out there, preserve our cash and don’t overextend ourselves and look after our team. We have to keep the business exciting and surprising. We need to stay relevant.” The US market is “performing well” for its brands, he says. “Ireland is performing well, too. UK is okay. Our biggest challenge in a number of markets is ensuring that distributors continue to believe in our brand. “The has been a lot of instability of the marketplace this year. High interest rates, wars, political elections and navigating through all of that. You have to focus even more on delivering a great brand experience for customers.” Rigney insists the family will be long-term holders of the business. Some of the best local spirit producers here have been taken over by large international brands in recent years, including Teeling Whiskey, which is majority owned now by Bacardi, Tullamore Dew, which is owned by William Grant & Sons, and the Cooley Distillery portfolio of brands, now owned by Suntory Global Spirits of Japan. Pernod Ricard owns Irish Distillers, makers of Jameson whiskey, while Diageo owns Bailey’s Irish Cream liqueur. MMA fighter Conor McGregor sold his Proper No 12 whiskey brand in 2021 to Proximo Spirits for a reported $600 million. Not that every Irish distillery has been a success. In November, receivers were appointed over Waterford Whisky, the distillery business founded by industry veteran Mark Reynier, after it failed to raise fresh funds. There is word in the industry of other distillers pausing production due to excess stocks in the market and softening consumer demand. At 63, you might think that Rigney would entertain a suitor waiving a big cheque and he admits there have been inquiries. But he insists that the “ultimate goal” is that this business would be here in a hundred years’ time and pass through the family. “This brand lends itself to being a family business,” he says. “Our distribution partners are all family businesses. They have all managed to negotiate intergenerational transfers. I would hate for this place to become an after-thought for a big company. “We are not for sale. Money doesn’t switch me on in that sense. We love what we do, we have a good standard of living, this is a lifestyle and we live it. You need to be successful but this was never about the money. We’re not thinking about flipping the business. It’s very much about making sure the brand is strong. We are emotionally connected with the business and with the town and the people here.” For Rigney, cash, it seems, is not always king.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) stands against the other REIT dividend stocks. In the United States, real estate investment trusts (REITs) play a significant role in the real estate sector and the overall financial system. Equity REITs pool funds from numerous investors to purchase and manage income-generating properties, such as residential, commercial, and industrial real estate. These REITs are publicly traded on major stock exchanges, allowing investors to earn steady income—primarily from rental revenues—without the need to personally manage or fund the properties. However, REIT share prices can fluctuate and are highly responsive to shifts in interest rates. The introduction of the REIT structure transformed real estate investing. Over time, REIT indices have adapted to reflect the sector's evolution. With the growth and increasing significance of new segments, the broader REIT landscape has changed considerably, yet it continues to provide attractive income opportunities. The real estate market has become more diverse, with different segments offering distinct risk and return dynamics. Also read: 11 Best REIT Stocks To Buy Under $10 It is frequently seen that many investors remain cautious about real estate and REITs, partly due to challenges faced by the retail and office subsectors. Additionally, the sector's reliance on significant leverage makes it vulnerable to rising interest rates. However, recent performance trends have caught investors' attention. Over the past three months ending November 2024, investors in the US have allocated around $4.5 billion to REIT and real estate-focused ETFs, surpassing investments in any other sector, according to a report by Bloomberg. This growing interest may be attributed to unique features of the REIT market and broader macroeconomic developments. According to a report by Nareit, as the third quarter of 2024 begins, it signals nearly two years of disparity between REIT valuations and those of private real estate. Although the gap between the two is gradually narrowing, the prolonged adjustment period still presents a compelling opportunity for institutional investors to incorporate REITs into their real estate investment strategies. The report further highlighted the performance of REITs in recent years. Since 2022, REIT performance has generally moved inversely to changes in the 10-year Treasury yield. In the third quarter of 2024, REITs delivered strong total returns as the 10-year Treasury yield declined, leading to significant reductions in the REIT implied cap rate and narrowing the public-private cap rate spread. However, since the end of the third quarter, a notable rise in the 10-year Treasury yield has caused REIT total returns to decline, likely widening the cap rate spread again. If this inverse relationship continues, interest rates will remain a key factor in the valuation adjustment process. Narrowing the public-private cap rate gap is crucial for reigniting property transactions and offers real estate investors an opportunity, as it could drive REIT outperformance into 2025. If REITs sustain their momentum and private property investors maintain their gradual increases in appraisal cap rates, the commercial real estate market may finally resolve its valuation disparity between public and private assets. REITs are an attractive option for income-focused investors. By law, they must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends. Unlike many other companies, REITs typically do not retain earnings, which often results in higher yields compared to other equity investments. According to Tower Financial Group of Wells Fargo Advisors, in 2023, equity REITs offered an average yield of 3.9%, significantly outpacing the 1.4% average yield of stocks in the broader market. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the REIT sector. Our Methodology: For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked REIT companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders. Next, we narrowed down 12 companies that are popular among elite funds at the end of Q4 and ranked them in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A large logistic facility within the industrial real estate sector. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is a California-based real estate investment trust company that invests in logistics facilities. The stock is down by over 17% since the start of 2024. Although the company faced some demand challenges in recent quarters, it is set to achieve solid growth this year, driven by the sustained strength of the industrial real estate market in recent years. As these challenges diminish and demand stays strong, the company's growth is starting to gain momentum again. This could be seen in its recent quarterly earnings. Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) reported revenue of $2.03 billion in the third quarter of 2024, which saw a 6.3% growth on a YoY basis. The revenue also exceeded analysts' estimates by $130 million. At the end of the quarter, the company reported approximately $6.6 billion in available liquidity. Its debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.1x, with debt accounting for 23.1% of its total market capitalization. Projected earnings for 2024, 2025, and 2026 are largely safeguarded, with 99%, 99%, and 98%, respectively, expected in USD or secured through hedging via derivative contracts. Additionally, 96.2% of the company’s equity is denominated in USD. Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), one of the best dividend stocks, currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.96 per share, having raised it by 10.3% earlier this year. The company's dividend growth streak spans over 11 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The stock's dividend yield on December 12 came in at 3.44%, as of December 12. Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) was included in 49 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, compared with 56 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey's database. The stakes held by these hedge funds have a collective value of over $780.7 million. Among these hedge funds, AEW Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall PLD ranks 2nd on our list of the best REIT dividend stocks to buy for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of PLD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Most of the company's long-term leases are tied to the consumer price index (CPI), allowing it to regularly increase rents in line with inflation. VICI Properties Inc.

(NYSE:NNN) is an American real estate investment trust company, based in Florida. The company follows a straightforward investment approach that has contributed to its consistent performance. The REIT focuses exclusively on single-tenant net lease retail properties, where tenants are responsible for all operating costs, such as maintenance, property taxes, and insurance. This lease structure allows the company to generate stable rental income that increases annually, either at a fixed rate or in line with inflation. Moreover, it targets properties in strong markets, ensuring they remain attractive to potential replacement tenants if the current tenant does not renew their lease. Additionally, it maintains a diversified portfolio across different regions, industries, and tenants. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by nearly 5%. In the third quarter of 2024, National Retail Properties, Inc. (NYSE:NNN) reported revenue of $218.6 million, which showed a 6.55% growth from the same period last year. Its funds from operations (FFO) also jumped to over $154 million, from $147.2 million in the prior year period.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Copper Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) stands against the other copper stocks. Copper is recognized as a critical metal due to its extensive applications, particularly in electrical wiring and renewable energy infrastructure. Prices of copper reached a record high during the first half of 2024, selling at $5.11 per pound on May 21, 2024. However, the price dropped slightly during the third quarter but remained elevated to its historic rates from the past two years. READ ALSO: 10 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready To Explode and 10 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Now. At the start of Q3, copper was priced at $4.42 per pound. It peaked at $4.65 on July 5 but then declined to a low of $3.95 by August 7. The third quarter ended with prices recovering to $4.50 on September 30. There are several factors affecting the prices of copper. Firstly, the demand for this metal remains high, largely driven by sectors related to the energy transition, including renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs). However, this demand coincides with a slowdown in the Chinese real estate sector, which is traditionally a major consumer of refined copper. Regardless of the challenges in the real estate market in China, the global demand for copper saw a slight increase of 2.5% in the first half of 2024. The growth was driven by notable demand from China of around 2.7% while other regions also witnessed demand growth of around 2%. However, despite high consumption, the supply side outpaced the demand. According to a report by the International Copper Study Group (ICSG), there was a surplus of 535,000 metric tons (MT) through the first eight months of 2024. The global copper mine production remained elevated, increasing by 2% to reach 14.86 million MT from January to August 2024. Chile’s Escondida and Collahuasi mines remained key contributors while operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia reported 11% and 22% production growth, respectively. In addition to raw copper refined metal production also witnessed a 5% increase driven by expansion in China and the launching of new facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to a report by Investing News Network, analysts believe that the primary reason behind higher prices during the first half of 2024 was not the fundamental supply-demand play, but was led by speculative investment. Analysts back this sentiment on the assumption that market participants would have taken a cautious approach following substantial gains in Q2 resulting in fluctuating prices of copper. Looking ahead, the ongoing struggles in China’s real estate sector have dampened overall demand for copper. The government's efforts to stimulate the market through various initiatives to boost housing projects are expected to revive global demand further. Moreover, energy transition efforts also continue to fuel demand for copper, the International Energy Forum estimates that approximately 1.1 new mines will need to come online annually until 2050 just to maintain current demand levels. Our Methodology To compile the list of the 8 best copper stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and our previous articles. Using the two sources we curated an aggregated list of copper stocks sorted by market capitalization. Next, we ranked these companies based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A large open-pit copper mine with heavy machinery extracting minerals from the earth. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) is the best copper stock to buy according to hedge funds. It is a major international mining company based in Phoenix, Arizona. It primarily focuses on extracting and producing copper, gold, and molybdenum, which are essential metals used in various industries. Some of the significant mines owned by the company include Grasberg in Indonesia, which is one of the largest copper and gold deposits globally, Morenci, and Cerro Verde. Two main factors make Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) an attractive investment opportunity. Firstly, its leaching technology is a critical differentiating factor that enables the company to enhance copper production from low-grade ores and previously unrecoverable materials. During the first nine months of 2024, the incremental copper production from its leach initiative was nearly 70% higher than the comparable period last year. This technology stands out as it allows the company to produce substantial amounts of copper without investing in new mining sites. Management estimates that the technology requires an investment of less than $1 billion, which is considerably less than the multibillion-dollar capital investment that a mining expansion project takes. Secondly, the company has strategically positioned itself to benefit from secular demand trends for copper driven by electrification. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) reported robust demand from the United States and China as well despite its weak property sector. As a result, its copper sales for the quarter came in 2% above the guidance taking its adjusted EBITDA to $2.7 billion. Overall FCX ranks 1st on our list of the best copper stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of FCX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Bitcoin May Face ‘Demand Shocks’ In 2025 Due To Growing Institutional Interest: Report
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-may-face-demand-shocks-in-2025-due-to-growing-institutional-interest-report/
Time Published: 2024-12-13T02:30:07Z
Full Content:
According to a report by crypto asset management firm Sygnum, institutional investor-led ‘demand shocks’ could propel Bitcoin (BTC) prices to new highs in 2025. However, altcoins may underperform due to factors such as reduced capital rotation from BTC to other cryptocurrencies. In a report titled Crypto Market Outlook 2025, asset manager Sygnum outlined multiple factors that are likely to further push BTC price upwards next year. The report highlights new capital inflows into the market – particularly institutional inflows – as the primary driver for the crypto bull market in 2025. The analysis highlights a ‘multiplier effect’ caused by institutional inflows combined with Bitcoin’s limited liquid supply. For instance, every $1 billion of net inflows into spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reportedly triggers a 3-6% price increase. Additionally, the report notes that Bitcoin’s price momentum is amplified by the concept of reflexivity – demand for BTC grows as its price rises, creating a feedback loop. Together, institutional inflows, the multiplier effect, and Bitcoin’s reflexivity are expected to make 2025 a pivotal year for the cryptocurrency. The report also emphasizes the importance of a pro-crypto regulatory climate in the US, following the confirmation of Donald Trump’s victory in the November presidential election. The outcome is widely seen as favorable for crypto legislation, with expectations of a comprehensive regulatory framework that could provide much needed clarity for the industry. The election outcome bodes well for crypto legislation, with widespread expectation of the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework, which includes clarifying the status of crypto assets and defining the roles of the regulatory bodies. It is expected that the CFTC’s role in crypto oversight will be extended, and the chances of the various crypto bills passing and being written into law have increased substantially. Some of the major crypto bills that will be in focus are The Payment Stablecoin Act, The Bitcoin Act – which compels the US government to build a strategic BTC reserve – The CBDC Anti-Surveillance Act, and several other bills that support crypto self-custody, crypto mining, and decentralized finance. The report predicts that institutional giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley will continue increasing their exposure to crypto. Notably, some portfolios now allow allocations of up to 25% for crypto investments, though typical allocations remain in the 1-3% range. Further, BTC may benefit from central banks and local governments considering setting aside some part of their funds for BTC reserves. Notably, countries like El Salvador and Bhutan are already actively mining and accumulating BTC as part of the wider national economic strategy. The report adds that 2025 inflows into crypto ETFs are likely to be ‘substantially higher’ than the net inflows to date. As of December 11, the total net assets in US-based spot BTC ETFs stands at $113.72 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. Despite the optimistic forecasts, the report acknowledges several potential risks that could dampen Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory. These include inflationary pressures, geopolitical uncertainties, and the increasing dominance of Tether in the stablecoin market. At press time, BTC trades at $100,940, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14 Ero Copper Corp (NYSE:ERO) is a Canadian company focused on producing copper, with its main operations located in Brazil. Its main asset is a 99.6% stake in Mineracao Caraiba S.A., which operates the Caraiba Operations in Bahia, Brazil. This includes several mining sites like the Pilar and Vermelhos underground mines and the Surubim open pit mine.

In July, Ero Copper Corp (NYSE:ERO) finalized a definitive earn-in agreement with Vale Base Metals, allowing it to acquire a 60% interest in the Furnas Project, located in Brazil's Carajas Mineral Province. This agreement aligns with management's goals and positions the company for substantial growth in copper production. Moreover, its Tucuma Operation also reached a significant milestone. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Tucuma Operation contributed 839 tonnes of copper to the company’s total consolidated production of 10,759 tonnes. While this is impressive, what’s more encouraging is the prospect of this site. The project is expected to produce a total of 326,000 tonnes of copper over an initial mine life of 12 years. In addition to the Tucuma Operation, Ero Copper Corp (NYSE:ERO) also reported an 11.9% increase in copper production at its Caraiba operations, producing nearly 9,920 tonnes of copper concentrate. The increase was attributed to better mine grades at its Pilar and Vermelhos mines. CEO David Strang remains confident for the future prospects and projected that 2025 could be their best year yet, as they capitalize on their operational strengths.

Title: Kroger and Albertsons are spending billions to reward shareholders after their blocked merger

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Within a day of their $25 billion merger’s falling apart in court, Kroger and Albertsons were each planning to move forward with share repurchases to boost their stock prices and reward investors. America’s two largest grocery store operators had argued that they’d be better able to lower prices for shoppers by joining forces. Doing so, they said, would boost their negotiating power with suppliers and make it easier to take on much bigger retailers that compete with them in grocery sales, such as Walmart, Costco and Amazon. The Biden administration disagreed, with the Federal Trade Commission saying in a lawsuit countering the merger that the deal threatened to drive down workers’ wages and bargaining power and reduce industry competition, potentially pushing food prices higher. With the deal now dead, it’s impossible to know whether any of that would have happened. But U.S. District Judge Adrienne Nelson of Oregon sounded a note of skepticism, writing in her decision Tuesday that the chains’ promises to invest in lower prices were “neither merger-specific nor verifiable, so there is no guarantee” that shoppers would benefit. “The promise to make a price investment is not legally binding, and the Court must give limited weight to a non-binding promise made during these proceedings,” she said. A Superior Court judge in Seattle agreed with Nelson’s ruling and issued an injunction against the merger Tuesday. On Wednesday, Albertsons terminated the deal and sued Kroger, alleging its erstwhile partner didn’t do enough to secure regulators’ blessing. The drama unfolded just as the federal government released new inflation data for November showing grocery prices continue to inch higher. The costs of food eaten at home were 1.6% higher last month than they were the same time last year — a smaller uptick than the 2.7% annual inflation rate overall but accelerating 0.5% from the previous month after a 0.1% rise from September to October. Food prices tend to be volatile, but a broad range of items from produce to poultry notched increases in a wholesale inflation report that came in hotter than expected Thursday. Kroger on Wednesday reiterated its “commitment to lower prices,” saying it has invested billions in cost reductions over the past two decades. The chain also said it has spent $2.4 billion on pay hikes since 2018 and up to $3.8 billion in annual store improvements. Albertsons similarly promised to stay focused on “improving our value proposition with customers.” Neither company offered more details about their price-cutting plans, and Albertsons declined to comment further. Kroger said only that it provides value to customers “through competitive pricing, loyalty discounts, personalized offers, fuel rewards and a unique private label portfolio.” At the same time, both grocery chains said this week that they’d be pouring billions of dollars into moves that will benefit their shareholders. Kroger said it would repurchase $7.5 billion of its shares after a more than two-year pause, with $5 billion of that to be repurchased in an accelerated fashion — the same sum that Kroger estimated Wednesday it has spent to lowering prices over the past 21 years. Albertsons said it would repurchase $2 billion of its shares and increase the dividend it pays to owners of its stock by 25%. Stock repurchases — which reduce the number of shares available, driving up the value of those that remain — and dividend payments benefit all investors but especially those with the biggest stakes. Top shareholders typically include large Wall Street firms with the financial firepower to buy and hold millions of shares of publicly traded companies. Wall Street investment firm Cerberus Capital Management is by far the largest shareholder in Albertsons, followed by the Vanguard Group, which is the country’s largest mutual fund provider, and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11.5 trillion under its supervision. Vanguard, BlackRock and billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate are the top owners of Kroger shares. “With both of these companies, there was a lot of hope [put] into the merger — that it was a way of generating growth. Those things aren’t happening now,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail consultancy GlobalData. Repurchasing shares could help inject more “optimistic sentiment” among investors, effectively reassuring them “‘we’ll generate good returns for you,’” he said. Kroger’s stock has been trading roughly 3% higher since Wednesday, while Albertsons’ had clawed back roughly all its losses following the ruling by late Thursday. In the meantime, consumer groups and labor advocates are hailing the blocked merger as a victory for shoppers and workers and as a vindication of the Biden administration’s antitrust efforts during its final weeks in office. The judges in the case “correctly saw the merger as a huge threat to the jobs and benefits of thousands of their members working for those chains and the communities in which they live,” said Seth Harris, a law and policy professor at Northeastern University and a former top labor adviser in the Biden White House. Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, said, “Combining two of the four largest food retailers would have also reduced consumer choice, leading to fewer alternatives to low-quality, ultra-processed foods.” “Unfortunately, the Trump administration seems unlikely to build on this important step towards restoring competition in food retail,” Gremillion said, citing President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Andrew Ferguson to replace Lina Khan atop the FTC. That’s a sign that “Big Food will only be getting bigger over the next four years,” he predicted. In a September campaign stop at a grocery store in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, Trump slammed the Biden-Harris administration over the costs of everything from eggs and cereal to ground beef. “Bacon is through the roof,” he said. Trump said Thursday at the New York Stock Exchange that increasing oil and natural gas drilling would help lower inflation, including for food prices, a promise energy analysts have viewed skeptically. But in a Time magazine profile published Thursday, he said of groceries: “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard.” CORRECTION (Dec. 13, 8:40 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misidentified Kroger’s and Albertsons’ largest shareholders. Cerberus Capital Management, not the Vanguard Group, has the biggest stake in Albertsons; Vanguard, not Cerberus, owns the most shares in Kroger.

By Blizzard Entertainment 1 day ago Who's ready to handle the heat? Players on new WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition Realms can now leap into the fire and face off against the Firelord, Ragnaros, in Molten Core and Onyxia in her lair. As a reminder, Anniversary Realms have no buff and debuff limits, so you can feel free to use every spell you can cast in a raid. Zone: Burning Steppes Level: 60 Bosses: 10 The Molten Core lies at the very bottom of Blackrock Depths. It is the heart of Blackrock Mountain and the exact spot where, long ago, in a desperate bid to turn the tide of the dwarven civil war, Emperor Thaurissan summoned the elemental Firelord, Ragnaros, into the world. Though the Firelord is incapable of straying far from the blazing Core, it is believed that his elemental minions command the Dark Iron dwarves, who are in the midst of creating armies out of living stone. The burning lake where Ragnaros lies sleeping acts as a rift connecting to the plane of fire, allowing the malicious elementals to pass through. Chief among Ragnaros’ agents is Majordomo Executus - for this cunning elemental is the only one capable of calling the Firelord from his slumber. To bring down Ragnaros in this 40-player Raid, you’ll want to be level 60 and attuned to the Core, saving you a long run through Blackrock Depths to reach the entrance. Here’s a handy guide for more details on Molten Core attunement. “Behold Ragnaros - the Firelord! He who was ancient when this world was young! Bow before him, mortals! Bow before your ending!” Facing the challenge of Molten Core is not without its rewards—this is the place to begin building your Tier 1 Raid set, and also where Hunter, Paladin, Rogue, and Warrior heroes have a chance to receive the left or right half of the Bindings of the Windseeker to start them on their quest for Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker. Zone: Dustwallow Marsh Level: 60 Onyxia’s Lair is home to a dragon of the Black Dragonflight, Onyxia. She is the younger sister of Nefarian and, with his help, seeks to finish the work of their missing father, Deathwing by manipulating the mortal races of Azeroth. Enter Onyxia’s Lair at your own peril. This 40-player Raid is the resting place for her brood of new eggs and home to the remaining members of the insidious Black Dragonflight. Should anyone ever threaten Onyxia or her precious eggs within her lair, her wrath is terrible beyond comprehension. To enter Onyxia’s Lair, you must get the Drakefire Amulet and have it in your bags to battle against everything that Onyxia hurls at you in this three-phase fight with harrowing odds that will test your fortitude. More details on getting attuned can be found in the Onyxia’s Lair attunement guide. Read through Onyxia’s Lair Raid Strategy Guide to give you and your Raid the best chance of survival. For the bravest of efforts, Onyxia drops several loot items that help with your adventure in Azeroth. Heroes of the Horde can complete their Victory for the Horde quest when they deliver the Head of Onyxia to the Warchief for great honor (and experience). Additional rewards for all raid members include an 18-slot Onyxia Hide Backpack, gems, and gold. Drops from Onyxia’s Lair are also required to complete class quests for Hunters, Paladins, and Warriors. Hunters can receive a Mature Black Dragon Sinew to build Rhok’delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers. At the same time, Paladins and Warriors can forge the ancient dragon blade, Quel’Serrar, by placing the Unfired Ancient Blade on the ground before Onyxia, ensuring it gets hit by her breath attack during her final phase, and using it to finish her off. We look forward to seeing how you fare as you face the heat. Lok’tar Ogar!

Title: Why Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM) Is Among the Most Profitable Gold Stocks to Buy Now

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 6 Most Profitable Gold Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to look at where Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM) stands against other most profitable gold stocks to buy now. Gold futures experienced a significant uptick on December 10, marking the highest close in more than two weeks. This movement was primarily driven by China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), which resumed gold purchases for the first time in six months, alongside the Chinese government’s commitment to implementing a “moderately loose” monetary policy and a more proactive fiscal stance in the coming year. ETFs tracking as gold, such as the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ), iShares Gold Trust (IAU), and iShares Silver Trust (SLV), among others, have also seen increased activity in response to the market movements. The PBOC’s acquisition of approximately five metric tons of gold in November, which is modest compared to previous purchases that sometimes reached 30 tons per month, was a critical factor in the recent gold rally. Analysts at Commerzbank noted that the resumption of gold buying by the PBOC could be a strategic response to the election of Donald Trump, who has threatened to impose tariffs on China. Additionally, the recent dip in gold prices after a series of record highs may have sparked renewed interest in the precious metal. For gold prices to maintain and potentially extend their gains, it is essential that central bank purchases continue in the coming months, Commerzbank analysts emphasized. Another factor supporting the rise in gold prices is the growing expectation among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut U.S. interest rates at its upcoming meeting. According to ActivTrades analyst Ricardo Evangelista, a rate cut would enhance the appeal of non-interest-bearing assets such as gold. In an interview with CNBC on December 10, Max Layton, Global Head of Commodities Research at Citi, discussed the impressive performance of gold in the current year and its potential outlook for 2025. Layton noted that this year has been exceptionally strong for gold, with a significant bull market that can be observed over a 50-year chart. He expressed confidence that this trend is likely to continue, citing several key factors. Citi’s analysts have introduced a fundamental physical flows-based framework for gold pricing, which provides insight into the underlying drivers of the bull market. These drivers include substantial investment from central banks and wealthy over-the-counter (OTC) investors, as well as broader investor concerns about high interest rates and high debt levels in the United States. Additionally, investors are using gold as a hedge against the potential medium-term impact of a U.S. economic slowdown, which has been ongoing for the past two and a half years. The labor market has also been slowing down during this period, and real interest rates remain at 15-year highs, further fueling these concerns. Layton emphasized that as long as these economic issues persist, there will be continued investment in gold as a hedge. Gold has been shining as a robust investment, driven by renewed buying from central banks, and growing expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut. To compile our list of the 6 most profitable gold stocks to buy now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the companies that are involved in the production, extraction, processing, or sale of gold. We shortlisted companies with a positive 5-year net income compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and a positive net income in the trailing twelve months (TTM) as informed by SeekingAlpha. Then we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 6 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 23 5-Year Net Income CAGR: 108.56% TTM Net Income: $609.4 Million Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM) is a leading precious metals streaming company, known for its robust portfolio of long-life, low-cost assets. The streaming model allows the company to purchase a percentage of the metals produced by a mine, for an upfront payment plus an additional payment when the metal is delivered. Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM) is focusing on growing its portfolio through strategic partnerships and accretive transactions. In Q3, the company announced the expansion to the existing stream on Rio2’s Phoenix project, with an additional investment of $100 million, and the new $625 million gold stream on Montage’s Kona project, located in Cote d’Ivoire, is one of the highest-quality gold projects on the continent, with a long 16-year mine life. On December 5, Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM) also secured a $175 million streaming deal with Allied Gold for the Kurmuk project in Ethiopia. This agreement involves the company paying upfront cash in four equal installments during the construction phase. In return, Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM) will receive 6.7% of the payable gold until a total of 220,000 ounces have been delivered. After this threshold, the company will buy 4.8% of the payable gold for the remainder of the project’s life. This deal will add 180,000 ounces of proven and probable mineral gold reserves, 30,000 ounces of measured and indicated mineral gold resources, and 20,000 ounces of inferred gold resources to the company’s portfolio. The company is also investing in several development projects that are expected to produce gold in the coming years. These include Blackwater, Goose, PlatReef, and Mineral Park, all of which are expected to be operational within the next 12 months. The development of these projects is forecast to increase the company’s gold production at an industry-leading rate of approximately 40% to over 800,000 ounces by 2028. This growth trajectory is supported by the company’s strong balance sheet, with approximately $700 million in cash and a $2 billion revolving credit facility, which provides the financial flexibility to fund all outstanding commitments and pursue additional opportunities. Overall, WPM ranks 3rd on our list of one of the most profitable gold stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of WPM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WPM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Here's how much bitcoin the world's largest asset manager recommends you have in your portfolio

Bitcoin deserves a spot in traditional multi-asset portfolios for interested investors, but only to a "reasonable" extent, BlackRock said on Thursday. The world's largest asset manager said that investors interested in bitcoin should allocate 1%-2% of their portfolio toward the cryptocurrency. Such weighting would result in a similar level of risk to holding the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks in a traditional portfolio. "In a traditional portfolio with a mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, those seven stocks each account for, on average, about the same share of overall portfolio risk as a 1-2% allocation to bitcoin," analysts in a recent research note from Blackrock Investment Institute. "We think that's a reasonable range for a bitcoin exposure," they added. A share over 2%, though, would make the risk associated with the crypto much higher, it added. "Going beyond that would sharply increase bitcoin's share of the overall portfolio risk," the analysts said. The firm said that the framework is helpful for considering the potential risks of including bitcoin in a portfolio given its reputation for volatility. The cryptocurrency has soared in recent weeks, up 48% since Donald Trump won the US presidential election last month/ Trump has since picked several crypto supporters for posts in his administration, including Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. That announcement last week helped push bitcoin above the key $100,000 threshold for the first time ever. The cryptocurrency has gained about 136% this yea. "On top of having higher average volatility over time, bitcoin has also suffered sharp selloffs. In an extreme case, should there no longer be any prospect of broad bitcoin adoption, the loss could be the entire 1-2% allocation," they said. However, the analysts said allocating up to 2% to bitcoin would provide a diverse source of risk compared to pouring into mega-cap tech stocks while still managing risk exposure. "Even though bitcoin's correlation to other assets is relatively low, it's more volatile, making its effect on total risk contribution similar overall. A bitcoin allocation would have the advantage of providing a diverse source of risk, while an overweight to the magnificent 7 would add to existing risk and to portfolio concentration," the analysts said. They added that wider adoption and trading of the cryptocurrency could reduce its volatility, bringing down its share of portfolio risk and potentially allowing investors to increase their allocation. On the flip side, broader adoption could also mean it loses the structural catalyst for big price gains, they said. "The case for a permanent holding may then be less clear-cut and investors may prefer to use it tactically to hedge against specific risks, similar to gold," they said. Broader adoption and trading appear likely, given easier avenues for gaining exposure to bitcoin, like the dozen spot bitcoin ETFs from firms including BlackRock. Since they were launched in January, the ETFs have garnered over $113 billion in assets.

Title: Financial Giant BlackRock Endorses Up to 2% Bitcoin (BTC) Allocation in Multi-Asset Portfolios: Report

Asset management giant BlackRock is reportedly promoting Bitcoin (BTC) as a part of a balanced portfolio. According to a new report by Bloomberg, BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under its management – released a new research paper saying that a 2% allocation of the top crypto asset by market cap in multi-asset portfolios is “reasonable.” Furthermore, BlackRock says investors weighing their portfolios with 1% or 2% BTC would “produce a similar risk profile to the so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks in a standard 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds.” However, the asset management firm also warns that portfolios with over 2% of the crypto king would “sharply increase” their risk. As stated by Samara Cowen and the paper’s other authors, according to Bloomberg, “Even though Bitcoin’s correlation to other assets is relatively low, it’s more volatile, making its effect on total risk contribution similar overall. A Bitcoin allocation would have the advantage of providing a diverse source of risk, while an overweight to the Magnificent 7 would add to existing risk and to portfolio concentration.” The Magnificent Seven includes tech giants that have seen massive gains over the last decade, including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, and Nvidia. According to the paper’s authors, Bitcoin will eventually become less volatile once blue-chip institutions adopt it. However, this could also slow down its explosive upswings. “Looking ahead, should Bitcoin indeed achieve broad adoption, it could potentially also become less risky – but at that point it might no longer have a structural catalyst for further sizable price increases.” Bitcoin is trading for $101,573 at time of writing, a 1.1% decrease during the last day.

Title: Wall Street hopes rate cuts will force clients out of cash in 2025

(Reuters) - Wall Street executives at the Reuters Next (LON:NXT) conference in New York expect a $7-trillion cash pile that proved invulnerable to falling interest rates in 2024 to start melting next year as easier monetary policy tempts clients out of the ultra-conservative asset class. So far, such hopes have been in vain. Cash in money markets rose by about $824 billion this year, according to Crane Data, dashing expectations it would find a home in stocks or bonds as the Federal Reserve began cutting rates. Proponents of the asset class have said they are happy earning rates of around 4% - far above the near-zero return cash was paying only a few years ago - with comparatively little risk. But sitting on the sidelines has come at a cost: the S&P 500 is up around 27% this year, gold is up about 30% and the Russell 2000 Index of smallcap companies is up more than 17%. Cash in money markets stood at $7.124 trillion as of Dec. 5, according to Crane Data. Some on Wall Street believe a portion could be redeployed in 2025 as rate cuts shrink money-market yields and the opportunity cost of staying out of stocks and bond grows. "The amount of cash, the amount of bank deposits and money markets, that exists right now is shocking," said Rob Goldstein, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s chief operating officer, in an interview at Reuters NEXT on Tuesday. "Money is going to come into the capital markets, both public and private." Futures tied to the Fed funds rate show investors pricing 85 basis points in cuts by December 2025. A U.S. inflation report on Wednesday cemented expectations that the Fed will cut rates at its monetary policy meeting next week, sending stocks to fresh records. OPPORTUNITY COST For holders of cash, “there is an opportunity cost at some stage,” said Kate El-Hillow, global chief investment officer at Russell Investments, during a Reuters Next panel. El-Hillow cited securitized assets as one example of an income-generating investment that could be preferable to cash, in part because of the potential to earn higher rates than money markets. Stocks have beaten cash 86% of the time over all 10-year periods tracked by strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management, while the probability of bonds outperforming cash in the same periods was 85%, a study by the bank showed. Meghan Graper, global head of debt capital markets at Barclays (LON:BARC), said Fed cuts could help push money-market investors into longer-duration bonds if short-term yields fall below longer-term ones. “That's a sizable amount of cash,” she said. “It could start to extend out into the front-end maturities, and also the belly of the curve.” Of course, there is little guarantee inflation will ease enough for the Fed to cut rates as much as the market currently expects. While November consumer price data reported this week was in line with economists’ expectations, it nevertheless showed that progress in lowering inflation has stalled. More broadly, many investors expect interest rates to remain elevated compared to the previous decade, bolstering the long-term attractiveness of cash. "I almost think it's a satisfying thing that you could own cash and you could be getting a return that would have been unimaginable a few years ago," BlackRock's Goldstein conceded. "It's an opportunity for the people holding the cash," Goldstein said, "and I think it's an opportunity for those who could come up with and demonstrate better uses of cash."

Title: BlackRock recommends bitcoin portfolio weighting of up to 2% for interested investors

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) -BlackRock recommends that interested investors consider allocating as much as 2% of their portfolio to bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, the giant asset manager said in a report on Thursday. "We see a case for investors with suitable governance and risk tolerance to include bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio," a team of four senior BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) executives including Samara Cohen, chief investment officer of ETFs and Paul Henderson, senior portfolio strategist of BlackRock Investment Institute, said in the short report. The arguments in favor of those with an interest in bitcoin to include it in an asset allocation model include the fact that it is likely to be less correlated with other major asset classes and could offer a diversified source of return. "Investors should also be alert to bitcoin's risks," the report cautioned. "It may not ultimately achieve broader adoption. And it remains highly volatile and vulnerable to sharp selloffs." In addition, there have been times when its returns have been more closely tied to those of stocks and other risk assets, meaning investors might not be able to count on it serving as a hedge. BlackRock was one of 10 companies to launch new exchange-traded products tied to bitcoin in January in what has been the most successful ETF launch in the history of those products, with more than $100 billion in assets, according to data from VettaFi. The lion's share of those assets have flowed to BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which now has $51.1 billion in assets. BlackRock said it based its allocation recommendation on gauging how much the addition of bitcoin to a portfolio would raise its overall risk. While the report's authors said that bitcoin is a unique asset, it is in some ways similar to the group of giant technology companies, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), that have come to be known as the Magnificent 7. Those companies, whose big gains on Wednesday played a major role in propelling the Nasdaq Composite Index to a new record above 20,000, have an average market capitalization of $2.5 trillion, close to the $2 trillion or so for bitcoin, BlackRock said. Having significant exposure to these companies can be similar to owning bitcoin in terms of overall portfolio risk, the firm said. But BlackRock cautioned that above the 2% maximum recommended weight, "bitcoin’s share of total portfolio risk becomes outsized compared with the average magnificent 7 stock." BlackRock's report also flagged the need by investors to regularly review "bitcoin's changing nature", including the pace at which it is adopted by institutional investors, its correlation to stocks and its volatility. News of BlackRock's recommended allocation was first reported by Bloomberg News. Bitcoin's price is largely flat at about $101,390.

But the world’s biggest asset manager still has a conservative view of the cryptocurrency—and recommends that investors who want to invest in Bitcoin should only put a maximum of 2% of the orange coin in their portfolio. In a Thursday report, the Wall Street titan said that putting Bitcoin in a portfolio was like investing in top tech stocks: potentially beneficial, but also risky. “Over its short history, Bitcoin has seen both major surges and selloffs,” the report notes. “This volatility, plus Bitcoin’s unique characteristics, raises the question of what role it should play in portfolios.” It added that “a reasonable range for Bitcoin exposure” was 1-2% of a portfolio’s total value. It added that the asset was still risky, and with no underlying cash flows, adoption was the only thing driving its price. The report—authored by Samara Cohen, Paul Henderson, Robert Mitchnick, and Vivek Paul—noted that more adoption in the future could lead Bitcoin to be less risky. But if this were to happen, it could “no longer have a structural catalyst for further sizable price increases.” BlackRock's report is targeted towards users who wish to include Bitcoin in their multi-asset portfolios; the Wall Street giant isn't necessarily advising all investors to buy the cryptocurrency. BlackRock sent shockwaves through the markets last year when it filed to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Then, in January, Wall Street’s top regulator approved the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust—along with 10 other ETFs—and it started trading. Of all the crypto ETFs, BlackRock’s has been the most successful, attracting the most investment and trading volume. BlackRock has previously said that Bitcoin is in an asset class of its own, and that investors are buying it to hedge against any potential debt crises.

Title: $11.5 Trillion Asset Manager BlackRock Advocates for 1-2% Bitcoin Allocation in Traditional 60/40 Portfolio

Full Content:
The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, with $11.5 trillion in total assets under management, has unveiled a new report from the BlackRock Investment Institute advocating for a 1% to 2% allocation in Bitcoin on the traditional 60/40 portfolio, composed of a larger portion of equities than bonds. According to a report from Forbes, BlackRock’s analyst was spearheaded by its Chief Investment Officer for ETFs and Index Investments, Samara Cohen, and draws parallels between the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin and the “magnificent seven” stocks, referring to tech giants including Amazon and Apple. These companies’ average market capitalization is around $2.5 trillion, and they collectively account for roughly 35% of the stock market’s benchmark index, the S&P 500. The allocation BlackRock recommended, if applied to its equities assets, would lead to between $50 to $100 billion in net new demand for Bitcoin. The report adds that the “magnificent seven” provide an “example of single portfolio holdings that account for a comparatively large share of portfolio risk” and while they differ from BTC, these factors “make them a useful starting point for assessing the risk of a single holding.” BlackRock also highlights Bitcoin’s historically low correlation with traditional markets and its potential as a valuable diversifier. The low correlation has been evident since June 2022 and is attributed to factors that include declining confidence in traditional banking systems and growing geopolitical tensions. New report from BlackRock today that recommends 1-2% exposure to Bitcoin ETF, first time they gave specific number (they put this out bc they had so much incoming on this q of how much?). pic.twitter.com/X7iF06xXFa Cohen noted in the report that in 2022 there was a “huge negative event,” and interest rates rose in 2023, allowing investors to “maintain a highly defensive posture with minimal risk primarily by holding cash-like instruments” in their portfolios, but this year they have to “face the reality of investment risk, lower rates, and needing a long-term asset allocation.” Per BlackRock’s research, a 1% allocation contributes approximately 2% to overall portfolio risk, while a 2% allocation to Bitcoin increases it to 5%. Higher allocations, the firm warns, significantly simplify risk. Cohen warned that future price appreciation may become more difficult as the return characteristics of BTC are “likely to change significantly once we reach a target state where potentially the portfolio allocation is much more tactical like gold.” Gold, nevertheless, saw a 30% appreciation this year amid rising geopolitical tensions and as inflation has kept on affecting investors’ portfolios.

Business FILE PHOTO: A representation of cryptocurrency Bitcoin is seen in this illustration taken November 25, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo :BlackRock recommends that interested investors consider allocating as much as 2 per cent of their portfolio to bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, the giant asset manager said in a report on Thursday. "We see a case for investors with suitable governance and risk tolerance to include bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio," a team of four senior BlackRock executives including Samara Cohen, chief investment officer of ETFs and Paul Henderson, senior portfolio strategist of BlackRock Investment Institute, said in the short report. The arguments in favor of those with an interest in bitcoin to include it in an asset allocation model include the fact that it is likely to be less correlated with other major asset classes and could offer a diversified source of return. "Investors should also be alert to bitcoin's risks," the report cautioned. "It may not ultimately achieve broader adoption. And it remains highly volatile and vulnerable to sharp selloffs." In addition, there have been times when its returns have been more closely tied to those of stocks and other risk assets, meaning investors might not be able to count on it serving as a hedge. BlackRock was one of 10 companies to launch new exchange-traded products tied to bitcoin in January in what has been the most successful ETF launch in the history of those products, with more than $100 billion in assets, according to data from VettaFi. The lion's share of those assets have flowed to BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which now has $51.1 billion in assets. BlackRock said it based its allocation recommendation on gauging how much the addition of bitcoin to a portfolio would raise its overall risk. While the report's authors said that bitcoin is a unique asset, it is in some ways similar to the group of giant technology companies, including Nvidia and Microsoft, that have come to be known as the Magnificent 7. Those companies, whose big gains on Wednesday played a major role in propelling the Nasdaq Composite Index to a new record above 20,000, have an average market capitalization of $2.5 trillion, close to the $2 trillion or so for bitcoin, BlackRock said. Having significant exposure to these companies can be similar to owning bitcoin in terms of overall portfolio risk, the firm said. But BlackRock cautioned that above the 2 per cent maximum recommended weight, "bitcoin’s share of total portfolio risk becomes outsized compared with the average magnificent 7 stock." BlackRock's report also flagged the need by investors to regularly review "bitcoin's changing nature", including the pace at which it is adopted by institutional investors, its correlation to stocks and its volatility. News of BlackRock's recommended allocation was first reported by Bloomberg News. Bitcoin's price is largely flat at about $101,390.

The Avalanche Foundation announced raising $250 million through a private token sale to support its blockchain platform, according to a Dec. 12 statement. The funding round had around 40 participants, including leading firms such as Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly, and ParaFi Capital. The announcement spurred a 10% surge in Avalanche’s AVAX token, pushing its price to $52. This continues a bullish trend, with the token gaining 52% over the past month. The Avalanche9000 upgrade, set for Dec. 16, aims to revolutionize blockchain costs and scalability. It will cut Layer-1 deployment costs on Avalanche by 99.9% and lower transaction fees on its C-Chain by 25 times. The upgrade supports Avalanche’s multi-chain vision, enabling horizontal scalability across various industries such as gaming, payments, loyalty programs, and real-world asset tokenization. Over 500 Layer-1 chains are in development, and institutional giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are leveraging Avalanche for their tokenized funds. Haseeb Qureshi, Managing Partner at Dragonfly, called the upgrade a transformative moment for blockchain development. He stated: “Avalanche’s upcoming Avalanche9000 upgrade represents a pivotal step toward advancing the decentralized finance ecosystem, and we believe Avalanche is uniquely positioned to capture the growing momentum in Web3 and blockchain scalability.” In preparation, the Avalanche9000 testnet introduced Retro9000, which includes a $40 million retroactive grant program. This initiative offers $2 million in referral rewards to developers building on the platform. Kevin Sekniqi, co-founder of Ava Labs, highlighted the network’s potential to outpace Ethereum, Solana, and other chains combined in transaction volume, emphasizing Avalanche’s unique multi-chain model.

Real-world asset tokenization firm Securitize appointed Michael Sonnenshein, formerly CEO of asset management company Grayscale Investments, as chief operating officer. "There is massive demand for tokenization, and I am thrilled to join Securitize at such a pivotal moment for the company and the industry," Sonnenshein said in a Thursday statement. His appointment started on Dec. 9. Tokenization is a booming sector at the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. The process involves representing financial instruments like bonds, credit, commodities and other real-world assets on the blockchain in pursuit of operational efficiency, speedier settlements and cheaper transactions. Securitize is a key service provider and marketplace in the field, with over $1 billion worth of tokenized instruments on its platform. The company jointly manages asset management behemoth BlackRock's tokenized money market fund BUIDL. BlackRock also invested in Securitize. "Michael is a trailblazer whose strategic vision and ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes have helped pave the way for establishing digital assets as a mainstream investment class," Carlos Domingo, CEO and co-founder of Securitize, said in a statement. Sonnenshein's appointment followed his departure earlier this year from Grayscale, where he had served as CEO since 2021. During his tenure, the company was one of the firms to have a spot-based bitcoin ETF approved to list in the U.S. in January. Grayscale had taken the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to court over the regulator's repeated refusal to allow it to convert its flagship, closed-end fund Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), then a closed-end fund, into an ETF. Sonnenshein also joined Aptos Labs, developer organization of layer-1 blockchain Aptos (APT), as an adviser last month. Krisztian Sandor recently graduated from NYU's business and economic reporter program as a Fulbright fellow and worked with Reuters and Forbes previously. Originally from Budapest, Hungary, he is now based in New York. He holds BTC and ETH. ABOUT CONTACT POLICIES

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), a quintessential memecoin with no utility whatsoever, has stunned the world by claiming a market-based capitalization in excess of $500 million. This development is all the more striking when one considers the well-founded hypothesis that the current memecoin season is still in its infancy, with much more insanity presumably in the offing. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Fartcoin does not lay claim to any intrinsic value. Instead, the memecoin draws the entirety of its worth from a vibrant community devoted to sharing flatulence-related jokes and memes. Even so, literally no one expected the memecoin to eclipse a $500 million market-based capitalization. BREAKING: Fartcoin's market cap is now greater than 38% of all American publicly-traded companies. pic.twitter.com/obLQK8LNTe — Hedgeye (@Hedgeye) December 12, 2024 For context, consider the fact that Fartcoin is now more valuable than a stunning 38 percent of all publicly-traded American companies! “Nobody ever went broke overestimating the flatulence of the American public.” - H.L. Mencken https://t.co/Dbkxz1Jxmx — Clifford Asness (@CliffordAsness) December 12, 2024 This development has predictably spawned a ton of humorous takes, including a play on H.L. Mencken's quote: Of course, as per historical precedents, the memecoin season is still in its infancy. In the previous crypto bull cycles, Bitcoin typically took the initial lead, followed by Ethereum's Ether, and then the memecoins started recording rip-roaring gains, capping off the peak mania phase of the cycle. Currently, however, Bitcoin is still in its lead phase, which lends credence to the hypothesis that the market will likely see many iterations of Fartcoin before the present cycle ends. Most coins are about a 2-3x away from former ATH Do with that information what you will $FTM $FET pic.twitter.com/r72c21nWFH — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) December 12, 2024 Consider the fact that many altcoins are still quite far away from their all-time highs recorded in the previous bull cycle. When the 6-month and below #Bitcoin Realized Cap HODL Waves bands surpass ~80%, it's a good indication the market is over-heated, and a major price peak is likely... 🔥 Currently we're at around 55%, plenty of upside to go for #BTC!👆 pic.twitter.com/ZL5P7USMo9 — Bitcoin Magazine Pro (@BitcoinMagPro) December 12, 2024 And, as per Bitcoin's Realized Cap HODL Waves bands, the world's preeminent cryptocurrency still has room to run. New report from BlackRock today that recommends 1-2% exposure to Bitcoin ETF, first time they gave specific number (they put this out bc they had so much incoming on this q of how much?). pic.twitter.com/X7iF06xXFa — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) December 12, 2024 Interestingly, BlackRock provided another bullish jolt to Bitcoin today by formally recommending a portfolio allocation of 1 to 2 percent to spot Bitcoin ETFs. In the meantime, Fartcoin can feasibly clock-in additional gains. Just don't expect those gains to last. Consider the recent pump-and-dump in the Hawk Tuah memecoin as a cautionary reference point.

Title: Private credit firms are hot acquisition targets. As M&A ramps up next year, here are the firms likely to be bought.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/private-market-asset-management-deal-outlook-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-12T15:10:34Z

The trend in asset management is pretty clear — private markets are the new black. "If you're not in private markets or private credit, you'll need to move in that direction, or you'll get left behind," PwC financial services deal leader Greg McGahan told Business Insider. Asset managers who have traditionally relied on ETFs and mutual funds to make money are itching to expand into alternative assets to diversify their offerings and boost fee revenue, a new PwC report said. That demand and expectations that interest rates will continue to drop and incoming light-touch regulators mean asset managers are ready to dust off their dealmaking playbooks. Private credit firms specifically are in demand, as shown by the blockbuster BlackRock deal announced last week. The asset management giant agreed to buy the private credit firm HPS Investment Partners for $12 billion. And it's not just the traditional money managers. Private equity firms are also using acquisitions to strengthen their private credit capabilities and market presence. PwC sees increasing competition in private credit contributing to the consolidation of alternative asset managers. McGahan said private credit firms with between $30 billion and $70 billion in assets under management will be the ones to watch. They will either need to make a deal to grow bigger or be snapped up themselves. "Those types of shops potentially could be absorbed into other shops that are looking to grow their portfolios," he said. "It's either acquire or be acquired." Deals in alternatives will also be driven by aging founders in the private markets space who are trying to figure out succession planning and capitalizing on the ability to monetize their investments. For his part, McGahan is seeing his deals practice's work ticking up and "getting up to full capacity. We'll be at supersaturation levels pretty shortly. So, I think you're seeing that pent-up demand now manifest itself." While the marriage of firms operating in one investing discipline with another makes sense for diversification reasons, the actual integration of the two could be trickier. Culture and compensation are very different between traditional firms and alternatives. A portfolio manager at a publicly traded mutual fund might receive cash compensation and equity stakes. If you're a private equity manager, you're paid with carried interest, or a percentage of profits generated from the firm's investments. "Could you have within a large traditional manager basically an alternative platform where the PMs are earning multiples of the existing PMs on the traditional side? That's going to be a cultural challenge,' McGahan said. He added there are also operational differences and gave the example of a private credit firm using treasury functions daily versus a private equity firm that uses a couple times a month. The question of cultural fit is top of mind at BlackRock when the asset manager makes acquisitions, according to the firm's CFO Martin Small. BlackRock has made several high-profile acquisitions this year, snapping up Global Infrastructure Partners in January in addition to HPS. Small, who was part of many meetings with HPS's executive team to test the waters, said the cofounders shared important values with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and firm president Rob Kapito. "We all speak the same language," Small said at the Goldman Sachs Financial Conference in New York. "They're founders. Larry Fink and Rob Kapito are founders. We're client-centered firms. We believe in scale, we believe in global." Integrating two firms successfully requires lots of important — if technical— work behind the scenes, Small added. "People, platform, process — think about all the pedestrian things of the employee experience. You've got to be on the same email system, you've got to make sure people's laptops work, you've got to make their key cards work at the door, " he said. "All of that's done so we can just get to business on realizing the synergies and delivering for clients. Jump to

Title: Is Target Corp (TGT) the Best Department Store Stock to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Department Store Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) stands against the other best department store stocks to buy now. The holiday shopping season is in full swing in the United States. On December 2, Jessica Moulton, senior partner at McKinsey & Company, appeared on CNBC to discuss Black Friday spending and its effects on consumer sentiment. She said that while 2024 was a challenging year for retailers, the numbers rolling in from the holiday season seem promising. High hopes were especially placed on Black Friday sales, and while the numbers aren't all in, they look pretty good. This trend holds particularly true online, where sales seem to be up by 15% or so compared to last year in many markets. According to CNBC, the total Black Friday e-commerce spending was around $10.8 billion. However, Moulton said that footfall in stores wasn't so good, and continued to be flat year-over-year. She said the trends in the sector are changing, with around 75% of shopping journeys starting online at the outset. Although some of them end up with consumers paying visits to the brick-and-mortar stores, much of the shopping journeys end with sales happening online. Furthermore, the retail sector is showing consumer behavior that tends to undertake a multiple retailer journey these days. If it is a bigger purchase, most consumers prefer checking out four to five retailers, either online or offline. This poses a significant change in the sector as compared to around two decades ago. Moulton said that consumers have consistently shown the industry in many ways that they are experiencing the effects of the cost of living crisis. However, recent survey data by McKinsey shows that consumers have started to feel more confident, which is expected to be reflected in the busier Christmas period this year compared to the last couple of years. She is optimistic about the future, saying that although we are still in a tricky place, there is light at the end of the tunnel. McKinsey's estimates show that around 63% of consumers are expected to have an increased e-commerce spending forecast this holiday shopping season. The e-commerce spending forecast for around 27% of consumers is expected to remain the same, while it may decrease for 4% due to cutbacks. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are increasingly becoming more significant in the holiday shopping season, especially compared to Christmas shopping. Mouton said that the retail industry is seeing more and more concentration of sales in the days around Black Friday. That is tough for retailers, as it puts a significant amount of weight on the fairly narrow set of items that retailers work hard to put great deals against. The retail results for the 29th November weekend mark the culmination of nine months of work by most retailers. This includes sourcing good value, marketing their items, watching the trends in the days before the weekend itself, detecting the items getting more traffic, and more. Since the changing trends keep concentrating more and more sales in the precious Black Friday weekend, the stakes are high for retailers. Talking about the increasing role of generative AI in retail, Moulton said considerable experimentation is going on in the industry. However, she considers the present time to be too early to see it at scale. She said that several leaders are leveraging generative AI the right way, which means that the strongest are getting stronger. They are taking early advantage of such new capabilities. This holds special importance since cookies are now much less easy to use because of their increased regulation. This makes Gen-AI a substitute that leaders are leaning into. A woman purchasing groceries at a Target store, with a cart full of products. We sifted through stock screeners and financial media reports to compile a list of 10 department store stocks. We then selected the 7 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) operates general merchandise department stores that offer its customers a wide range of products. It has approximately 2,000 stores across the US. The company saw an increase in its traffic growth in fiscal Q3 2024. This growth was attributed to its focus on newness and delivering strong value in a retail environment where consumers are focusing on value and discounts over brand loyalty. The company thus introduced over 2,000 discounts entering the holiday season after it received positive customer response to the thousands of discounts and deals it offered at the beginning of 2024. Therefore, this initiative is expected to drive similar sales growth in the crucial holiday season. Target Corp's (NYSE:TGT) comparable sales grew in fiscal Q3 2024, and this growth was attributed to a 2.4% growth in traffic. This translates to over 10 million incremental transactions compared to 2023. The company's digital channel also grew by nearly 11% in fiscal Q3 2024, reflecting increasing consumer behavior trends in online shopping. Its delivery services are also boosting growth, with the company's same-day delivery, powered by Target Circle 360, experiencing approximately 20% growth. Its Drive Up service also saw positive double-digit growth, accounting for over $2 billion in fiscal Q3 2024 sales. These trends show the strength of Target Corp's (NYSE:TGT) digital services as more and more consumers are interacting with them. Overall, TGT ranks 4th among the 7 best department store stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of department store stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TGT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock recommends 2% starting allocation to Bitcoin in investment portfolios

BlackRock compares Bitcoin's volatility to tech stocks, urging a cautious introduction in multi-asset portfolios. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. According to a paper released Dec. 12, BlackRock suggests that a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation in multi-asset portfolios matches the risk levels found in portfolios holding technology stocks. The asset manager, which oversees trillions of dollars, frames this range as a strategic starting point for investors seeking diverse sources of risk. Bitcoin is proposed as an element that does not entirely mirror the movement of equities. As Bloomberg reported, BlackRock’s analysis shows that even though Bitcoin exhibits a lower correlation to other assets, its volatility amplifies overall risk in a manner not unlike portfolios heavily concentrated in a handful of large technology names. BlackRock’s CIO of ETF and index investments, Samara Cohen, notes that a small Bitcoin weighting may operate as a separate risk driver in a balanced allocation. Beyond 2%, the firm warns that Bitcoin’s inherent volatility would contribute an outsized share of total risk, potentially overshadowing other components. Per Bloomberg, BlackRock considers the 1% to 2% range sufficient to approximate the influence of major tech holdings, a well-known scenario among investors grappling with top-heavy equity benchmarks. This perspective appears amid Bitcoin’s sustained gains following November’s US presidential election. Trump’s victory, combined with public endorsements and ongoing institutional inflows, saw Bitcoin surpass $100,000 in December. Market observers attribute part of Bitcoin’s growth to demand from institutional players, and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has captured attention as a key vehicle. The Bitcoin ETF has achieved rapid asset growth and attracted substantial inflows. Its expansion represents a trend that has bolstered Bitcoin’s acceptance among traditional investors and reshaped debates about prudent exposure. As Forbes reported, BlackRock’s research parallels the Magnificent Seven technology stocks that have dominated a large share of the S&P 500’s value. The firm notes that Bitcoin’s market capitalization is smaller, its utility differs, and its fundamental drivers do not resemble corporate revenue streams. Still, the allocation’s overall risk contributions resemble those of a portfolio that leans heavily into a single prominent equity holding. While past cycles saw Bitcoin’s correlation to equities tighten, recent conditions have shown more distinct patterns influenced by policy shifts, macroeconomic shifts, and evolving investor sentiment. The paper hints that as Bitcoin becomes more integrated into mainstream portfolios, its volatility profile may shift.

Title: Bitcoin ETF inflows hit weekly lows: Has the bullish streak ended?

Investors are caught in a tug-of-war, balancing potential and risk as they await key developments. The past 40 days have been “highly volatile,” truly testing the patience of Bitcoin [BTC] stakeholders. The highs propelled BTC to its ATH of $104K, but the lows dragged it back to around $94K, leaving investors on edge. And the real challenge? It’s just beginning. Just two days ago, BlackRock’s (IBIT) support sparked nearly $300 million in net ETF inflows, sending Bitcoin surging 4% in one day. This institutional push helped BTC close above the $100K mark. But here’s the catch—the rally feels fragile. BlackRock’s inflows have since dwindled to net zero, signaling the end of a week-long surge streak. Even overall ETF inflows have halved. Meanwhile, whispers of a potential 25 bps rate cut by the Fed are keeping hopes alive, but Bitcoin’s biggest asset remains institutional backing. So, as early investors cash out as millionaires, all eyes are on the institutional heavyweights. Will they be the ones to push BTC toward the ambitious $200K target, or will their fading support trigger a new wave of doubt? Early investors seem to be cashing out at the pivotal $100K resistance level, signaling a retreat from greed and a pullback in risk appetite. Yet, the recent surge that catapulted Bitcoin above $101K—after weeks of fierce back-and-forth between the $94K and $100K price band—has sparked fresh optimism. According to AMBCrypto, this optimism remains somewhat cautious, driven more by “anticipation” than the actual “execution” of a Fed rate cut. While the U.S. job market shows promise with a decline in the unemployment rate, inflation has made a noticeable comeback. The CPI has risen to 2.7% on a yearly basis, with a slight 0.3% increase in just one month. With these mixed signals, all eyes are now on the upcoming FOMC meeting scheduled for next week. Will the Fed take a more conservative stance in response to the uptick in inflation, possibly opting for higher interest rates? Or will it lean more liberal, considering a rate cut to support the economy? Regardless, the short-term impact on Bitcoin’s price is already evident. Source : CryptoQuant U.S. investors have eagerly seized the opportunity to buy BTC, particularly through their Coinbase cohorts, after a period of distribution that dominated much of the second week of December. While this uptick is undeniably bullish, it could prove to be a temporary blip unless Bitcoin’s fundamentals, including strong Bitcoin ETF inflows, spark sustained interest from both retail and institutional investors. Since launching in January, Bitcoin ETFs have become a popular way for retail investors to access Bitcoin’s volatility, with strong support from institutions. After the “Trump pump” sparked excitement, Bitcoin ETFs reached a record $1.3 billion in inflows, with BlackRock contributing $1.2 billion. Source : FarsideInvestors However, recent trends suggest a shift. BlackRock’s inflows have plateaued, ending a streak of consecutive gains. While this doesn’t signal a full bearish outlook for Bitcoin, it does highlight a dip in enthusiasm for Bitcoin ETFs, with overall inflows hitting a weekly low. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 This reinforces AMBCrypto’s view of a more ‘cautious’ optimism in the market – enough to potentially set $100K as a bottom for Bitcoin, but not quite enough to drive it toward a new all-time high. Thus, the market is in a delicate balance, where hope remains, but the road to fresh highs seems uncertain.

Title: Wholesale inflation jumps more than expected as 'extended and bumpy journey' continues to Fed's target

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wholesale prices rose more than expected in November, adding to a string of sticky inflation prints. Thursday's report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that its producer price index (PPI) — which tracks the price changes companies see — rose 3% from the year prior, up from the 2.4% in October and above the 2.6% increase economists had projected. This marked the highest year-over-year increase since February 2023. On a monthly basis, prices increased 0.4%, compared to the 0.2% seen in October. Excluding food and energy, "core" prices increased 3.4% year-over-year, above October's 3.1% increase. Economists had expected an increase of 3.2%. Meanwhile, month-over-month core prices increased 0.2%, in line with last month's rise and economist projections. “PPI isn’t so scary once you get past the headline," Nationwide financial markets economist Oren Klachkin said of this morning’s November Producer Price Index report. "While the underlying data quell fears of a new inflation surge, they don’t suggest a quick fall to 2% either. Producer prices, and the broader inflation complex, are on an extended and bumpy journey to the Fed’s goal.” Thursday's PPI reading comes one day after the release of the November Consumer Price Index showed core inflation rose 3.3% for the fourth straight month. The consumer price reading was largely in line with expectations, though, and did little to shake investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its meeting next week. The sticky nature of the CPI print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Still, a combination of recent months of data has shown that inflation isn't quickly falling toward the Fed's 2% target. That has prompted investors to anticipate fewer Fed rate cuts in 2025 than initially hoped. "The Federal Reserve can feel largely pleased with the progress made on lowering high levels of inflation over the last couple years," BlackRock global CIO of fixed income Rick Rieder wrote in a note on Wednesday. "But the bulk of this progress is behind us now and inflation may remain stubbornly sticky near current levels for a time."

Title: $11.5 Trillion BlackRock Recommends A 2% Bitcoin Allocation Comparing It To The Mag 7

New research from the world’s largest asset manager argues that Bitcoin offers unique benefits as a portfolio diversifier while sharing similar risk levels to S&P 500 juggernauts like Google, Amazon, Meta and Apple. BlackRock has been a big bitcoin ambassador to traditional finance (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) With bitcoin crossing the $100,000 mark, the largest money manager on the planet, New York City-based BlackRock appears to be falling down a crypto rabbit hole. In a new release from Blackrock Investment Institute called “Sizing Bitcoin In Portfolios” its analysts are making the case that the cryptocurrency, long shunned by mainstream investors, should now account for 1% to 2% of traditional “60/40” investment portfolios. This would position the asset similarly to companies like Nvidia, Amazon, or Apple even though bitcoin has little utility other than as a speculative asset, and it derives no revenues from products like corporate titans. More than $5.2 trillion of Blackrock’s $11.5 trillion in assets under management are equities, which includes ETFs like iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) with $576 billion in assets. Allocating a mere 1% of Blackrock’s equity assets to bitcoin would equate to about $50 billion in net new demand for the digital asset. In the last 12 months bitcoin’s price has gained more than 130% compared to a gain of 32% for the S&P 500. BlackRock CIO for ETFs and Index Investments Samara Cohen In the research report, analysts led by the Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index products Samara Cohen, write that the $2 trillion cryptocurrency offers a similar risk to the Magnificent 7 firms, whose average market capitalization is $2.5 trillion and have accounted for nearly 35% of the S&P 500’s $46 trillion market capitalization. “[Those stocks] provide an example of single portfolio holdings that account for a comparatively large share of portfolio risk. They differ from bitcoin in many ways, but these two factors make them a useful starting point for assessing the risk of a single holding.” Bitcoin has a total market capitalization of about $2 trillion. The BlackRock report also points out bitcoin’s historically low-correlation to traditional markets. Notes Cohen, “All equity managers who use a benchmark with the Magnificent 7 have this concentration risk, and they face a question of what to do about it. We are proposing this framework to think about an allocation that strikes the right balance, given the huge price volatility of Bitcoin, to maximize its potential as a diversifier while minimizing its contribution to overall portfolio risk.” While bitcoin was highly correlated to other asset classes, technology stocks, during the covid boom and bust, a divergence began in June 2023. The report suggests that this pattern will continue because of factors impacting bitcoin like the global fragmentation of the financial system, growing geopolitical tensions, a lack of confidence in banks, and growth in deficits. Bitcoin's correlation with equities has dropped post-Covid “You had 2022, a huge negative event, and then given the [high] level of interest rates in 2023, you could maintain a highly defensive posture with minimal risk primarily by holding cash-like instruments in your portfolio,” says Cohen. “In 2024, you have to face the reality of reinvestment risk, lower rates, and needing a long-term asset allocation.” In their analysis, Cohen and her team found that a 1-2% allocation in a 60/40 portfolio yields a risk similar to that of a Magnificent 7 stock. Bitcoin’s excessive volatility, however, which has caused it to drop as much as 70% in a year, makes higher weighting imprudent. A 1% weighting would contribute 2% of risk, while a 2% allocation increases the risk weighting to 5%. Another doubling in the weighting to 4% would account for an exponentially higher 14% of overall risk, according to the report. A 1-2% bitcoin allocation offers a similar risk to the average Mag 7 stock Though Blackrock only recommends a maximum of 2% for investors interested in diversifying with bitcoin, it does hint that future price gains may be more difficult. “The return characteristics are likely to change significantly once we reach a target state where potentially the portfolio allocation is much more tactical like gold and is used for hedging with a very different set of characteristics,” says Cohen. Increasing investor demand and rising bitcoin prices are already good business at Blackrock. In 2022, it partnered with Coinbase to enable institutional clients to buy bitcoin, and today, it operates the world’s largest bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with $50.8 billion in assets under management.
