The move reduces fees on 87 different funds, and 168 total share classes of those funds. The average fee cut is 20% per share class. Vanguard said this is its biggest fee cut ever and will save investors about $350 million this year, based on current asset levels. "We're proud to build on Vanguard's legacy of lowering the costs of investing—which we have done more than 2,000 times since our founding—by announcing our largest ever set of expense ratio reductions. Lower costs enable investors to keep more of their returns, and those savings compound over time," Vanguard CEO Salim Ramji said in a press release. The list of cuts includes actively managed and index-based products, with many of the funds representing billions of dollars. Stocks, bonds and commodities products are all included in the reductions. Some of the funds on the Vanguard list include: Fund fees for mutual funds and ETFs are assessed as an annual percentage of total assets under management for the share class. The fee cuts to VEGBX and some other actively managed bond funds is notable because active fixed income is emerging as a growth area for the exchange-traded fund industry. The booming popularity of ETFs, which can be purchased more easily than many mutual funds, is often cited as a key factor in driving down management fees for stock funds in recent decades. Vanguard said its actively managed fixed income funds and ETFs have a weighted average expense ratio of 0.10% versus an industry average of 0.53%. Vanguard has long been a leader in lowering fees among asset managers, a tradition dating back to its founder, Jack Bogle. Monday's announcement is a sign that the trend could continue under Ramji, who took over as CEO in 2024 and previously worked at rival BlackRock. The fee cuts come less than a month after Vanguard agreed to pay more than $100 million to settle charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to disclosures around some of its retirement products.

Title: Why more retirement-age Americans keep working
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/retirement-age-americans-keep-working-rcna190469
Time Published: 2025-02-03T17:31:15Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time When it came time for Diane Wetherington to consider retirement, reality quickly set in. The 72-year-old debated devoting her time to crafting and doting over her grandkids and even gave full-time retirement a try. But she soon realized her Social Security checks, which were smaller than her peers’ due to time she spent out of the workforce while raising children, wouldn’t be enough to cover travel or rising insurance costs on top of basic needs. Now, the Central Florida resident works part time as a remote contracting agent in local government. While she sometimes has to miss out on plans with fully retired friends, she said, continuing to work has kept her budget sound and her mind active. “It’s just getting very hard to make ends meet,” Wetherington said. “The way the world is right now, everything’s going up, up, up.” Wetherington is part of a growing body of Americans staying in the workforce past 65, once a traditional marker for retirement. This trend has buoyed the national labor market after years defined by pandemic-induced worker shortages and high quitting rates. It’s also changed the financial outlook for those who remain employed in some capacity, whether for personal satisfaction or monetary need. This trend should be more apparent than ever in 2025, when more Americans are expected to turn 65 than in any past year, according to a widely read study from the Alliance for Lifetime Income. It dubbed a multiyear period in the late 2020s as the “Peak 65 zone.” The number of employed Americans 65 and older ballooned more than 33% between 2015 and 2024, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By comparison, the labor force for all workers 16 or older has increased less than 9% during the same time period. That growth has meant workers ages 65 and older accounted for 7% of the total workforce in 2024. That share is up from around 5.7% a decade ago. “It’s really hard for many employers in many sectors to fill key workforce needs right now,” said Jim Malatras, strategy chief at FedCap, a nonprofit that helps train and place people in jobs. Tapping this age group “can help build key capacity where it’s desperately needed.” While the swelling number of workers in this age bracket — more than 11 million in 2024 — has gained attention in recent years, the reasons for this outsized growth date back decades. Chief among the drivers is the fact that America’s population is aging, according to Laura Quinby, an associate director at Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research. But structural shifts in the retirement system have also encouraged working later in life, Quinby said. The transition in the private sector from employer-funded pensions to 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans created a need for many workers to remain employed longer. Social Security reforms in the 1980s pushed the program’s “full retirement age” from 65 to 67. “People really do use the Social Security full retirement age as an anchor in terms of when they should retire and claim benefits,” Quinby said. “That shift triggered a trend in people working longer.” Longer life spans have pushed a growing chorus of voices to call for the age of retirement to move back even further, especially as financial uncertainties swirl around Social Security. BlackRock Chair Larry Fink, for instance, said in an annual letter that it’s “a bit crazy” that the expectation of retiring at 65 “originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire.” Yet there are vastly different reasons and experiences for people of retirement age to continue working in some capacity, said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of The New School’s Retirement Equity Lab. Some do retire, and some continue to work in jobs that they love out of passion alone. But she said about two-thirds of those still working do it “because they have to.” They can be in jobs with high physical or mental requirements, she said, but they see few alternatives, given that their Social Security checks can’t sustain them. “I call it the tale of two retirements,” Ghilarducci said. Employers of all kinds have tried to win and retain this growing base of talent. Booking.com parent Booking Holdings offers 10 days off annually for so-called grandparent leave, which is separate from time offered to new parents and other paid days off. Grocery store chain Wegmans has a section of its part-time jobs page specifically targeted to seniors, advertising the opportunity to stay active and earn income during retirement. Retirement-age workers can be seen working in gift shops or greeting restaurant guests for Xanterra, a travel company that owns properties in and around national parks. The company has a program called Helping Hands, which allows Xanterra to staff up during the peak tourist season by offering gigs that typically last a month and a half with 30-hour workweeks. “The retirement community, or that older workforce, is really an integral part of our overall workforce planning strategy,” said Shannon Dierenbach, Xanterra’s human resources chief. “They certainly bring a level of expertise, wisdom, life skills, perspective that really enhances the overall experience.” Despite these anecdotes, advocates say a pervasive culture of ageism has continued to hurt these Americans in the workforce. “They’re like vintage cars to us,” said FedCap’s Malatras. “They’re built to last, they’re full of value, but they’re treated often like high-mileage Pintos, and they don’t really have an opportunity to serve anymore.” Employers hoping to better advertise to this community should look at job descriptions and pictures on their jobs pages to ensure there aren’t any subtle signs they favor younger applicants, according to Heather Tinsley-Fix, senior advisor for employer engagement at AARP. She often encourages employers looking for older workers to sign AARP’s pledge, in which businesses commit to measures supporting age equality. Removing college degree requirements can also help gain the attention of this pool, she said, given that a smaller share completed higher education compared with younger generations. Working from home is a key component of flexibility that these older workers may need, Tinsley-Fix said. Part of Tinsley-Fix’s argument for employers is the impending “tsunami” of retirements expected within the next decade. If companies don’t tap into groups they previously overlooked, she warned, they’ll struggle to stay at full staffing, as not enough people enter the workforce each year to replace those who left. Her pitch isn’t all doom-and-gloom, however. Tinsley-Fix said there’s a silver lining: These workers tend to excel at soft skills and can provide mentorship to younger staffers. At Xanterra’s sites, for example, retirement-age workers interact particularly well with customers and stay calm under pressure, Dierenbach said. “People talk about all kinds of spillover dividends from having older workers on their teams,” Tinsley-Fix said. “They really benefit from having those folks.” Those who remain employed do so for a variety of reasons. Multiple workers from this age group told CNBC that no matter the initial rationale — whether financial needs or personal preference — that got them to stay or return to the workforce, they’ve benefited physically and mentally. “It was the best thing that ever happened to me,” said Shari Nelson, who began working for nonprofit Vantage Aging through its government-supported job placement program and was hired to stay on after completing it. The Ohio resident, who works part-time, said the paycheck allows her the financial security to be the kind of grandmother past generations in her family have been. Nelson’s role was previously full-time, but Vantage broke it up into two positions with fewer hours to better accommodate older workers. Nonprofits were the most popular industry for workers in this age bracket at the end of 2024, with more than 1 out of every 12 in the sector, according to data from payroll platform Gusto. Among the small businesses using Gusto, the firm found the share of workers 65 or older has surged more than 50% since January 2019. Government is another popular area, according to Gusto. That’s where Florida resident Anne Sallee, who was once a public official, found herself after she decided a full retirement wasn’t for her. Sallee, who had a long career as a paralegal and now works as an economic development coordinator, said the return to in-person office work was a “shock” after more than a decade away. However, she said the personal benefits of having deadlines and a routine, as well as a passion for the role, keep her coming back. “I don’t enjoy not having things I have to do,” Sallee said. “I never envisioned the ‘sit on the beach with your feet up and a cocktail’ kind of lifestyle.” Still, Sallee said she’s taken some liberties that she may not have early in her career or when starting a new position. For instance, the 68-year-old avoids working overtime and takes a three-week vacation annually. “If that ever becomes a problem,” she said of her yearly stretch of time off, “the vacation will take priority.” © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Texas Stock Exchange Raises $161 Million, Sees 2026 Trading Start

TXSE Group Inc., parent company of the proposed Texas Stock Exchange, closed its initial fundraising round at $161 million and said the TXSE has filed for registration as a bourse with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. If the registration is granted, trading would start in early 2026, the company said in a statement Friday. It had previously said trading would begin by the end of this year. The exchange – whose backers include BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities – is still targeting its first listings for next year. The upstart TXSE is seeking to join a handful of smaller bourses that are trying to bite off market share from the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, which dominate US public-equity trading. The challengers are battling for a piece of a shrinking pie: Listings have declined precipitously since the 1990s as the rise of private equity has made it easier for companies to avoid the costs of going public for longer. Additionally, the majority of US stock trades is now consistently occurring outside of public exchanges. The proposed Texas bourse says it wants to lower the cost of going public while “revitalizing competition for listings and enhancing trading in the US capital markets,” TXSE Chief Executive Officer James Lee said in the statement. The company was able to boost its capital raise by about $40 million since it disclosed in June that it had brought in $120 million. Other investors include Charles Schwab Corp. and Michael Dell’s family investment office. In addition to equities, the Dallas-based bourse plans to host auctions and sell exchange-traded products and data. It’s still looking for a space to house its permanent headquarters, which will contain offices, a conference center and a television studio complete with an opening bell. Topics Texas

Title: Betrayed by Green Capitalism, Here’s How We Can Build a Livable Future
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/green-capitalism-climate-framework-failure-rooted-networks-better-future
Time Published: 2025-02-03T16:00:00Z

In one way of measuring it, the mainstream framework to address the climate crisis has been a huge success. Promoting green energy, electric vehicles, conservation zones, carbon credits, carbon capture, and other new technologies has made billions of dollars for companies like Tesla, Google, NextEra Energy, British Petroleum, Saudi Aramco, Tongwei Solar, McKinsey & Company, and BlackRock. Governments have gained power through increased interventions in economic planning, and authoritarian regimes from China and India to Canada and the U.S. now have a new justification to carry out land theft against Indigenous and rural populations. And millions more NGO directors, aid workers, diplomats, accountants, entrepreneurs, engineers, academics, and scientists get a hand-out in the form of high salary employment managing the crisis. Where the mainstream climate framework has been less successful: Doing anything to actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions driving the climate crisis. Nor has the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledged the reasons for this failure or presented a plan based in reality. Here are some truths the mainstream climate framework downplays, ignores, or covers up: There are tremendous short-term benefits to legitimizing the failed climate framework: jobs, money, attention, power, the comforting belief that those in charge are going to keep us safe. Likewise, there are immense obstacles to developing realistic alternatives: Lack of rewards, marginalization and silencing, state and corporate repression. The result is a sort of self-reinforcing confirmation bias. People aren’t exposed to the gaping holes in the official framework or to examples of the kind of changes we actually need, alternatives remain easy to marginalize as ​“fringe,” and the failed framework maintains its fatal monopoly. Our survival depends on escaping the dead-end cataclysm of the official response. But, we can’t enact solutions we’re unable to imagine — so let’s start imagining a real solution. It won’t be an easy exercise: We’ll have to jettison the entire institutional complex that has caused and is managing the problem. We’ll also have to envision change occurring through a completely different paradigm than the one we’re brought up believing in. There isn’t really an alternative, since the official framework doesn’t constitute a viable plan. And everything we do toward an ecological revolution makes our own lives better, makes our own ecosystem more resilient, and increases everyone’s chances for collective survival. (Editor’s Note: For more discussion of the research and reasoning behind these arguments, read the companion piece here.) A paradigm and a practice that could successfully confront the ecological crisis is one based on what I would call rooted networks. Rooted networks are ecosystemic and interdependent. They allow for everyone to define their own needs, to build their own relationships with their specific habitat, and to share resources and feedback throughout their habitat and across the entire system. The basic operating principles of rooted networks are: This paradigm allows each of us to maximize our potential for action and our unique knowledge, and to amplify both through relationships of mutual aid. Rather than small groups of experts and owners imposing blueprints on a disempowered society and muted landscape, we would all increase our connectivity to our neighbors and the land, understand their needs and their history, and build from there. Can you already hear that voice in your head braying out that such an approach is naïve? It’s strange how that’s the orthodox position in our politics. In the fields of urban science and computer science, AI or machine learning, neuroscience, encyclopedias, comparative cognition, the study of mycelial networks and ecosystems and other complex systems, the social organization of insects with large population groups, the data is practically endless: Decentralized networks have a high capacity for communication, learning, and innovation; they often have a sophisticated capacity for self-organization; and they tend to be more resilient in adverse circumstances where centralized, hierarchical systems are likely to catastrophically collapse. There are also countless examples of decentralized, complex, resilient societies throughout human history, continuing into the present. These include the hundreds of interlaced peoples of Zomia—the southeast Asian highlands— who are surrounded but still unconquered by some of the strongest and longest lasting states in history; the Amazigh of northern Africa; the Mayan peoples of the Yucatan Peninsula and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; the Mapuche of the Andes and the Pacific coast; the four hundred Indigenous peoples of the Amazon. These are societies who have defeated empires and colonizers, who have survived and adapted to earlier collapses, or who overthrew their own ruling classes. They are peoples who find abundance and safety in ecosystems where states only see desert, who have cultivated the richest rain forests on the planet, and who even in the 20th and 21st centuries have launched major rebellions against oppression. Their traditional social structures provide them with decentralized networks and federations that are a major source of their resilience. An important strategy of colonialism has been to erase these histories and destroy or marginalize these cultures so we have to depend on those in power, believing hierarchies to be natural, believing states to be inevitable. But the truth of the matter is that decentralized networks are practical, they’re intelligent, and they work. The first few years after an ecological revolution will be hard, despite the intelligence and resilience of rooted networks, though many benefits will appear immediately. And we’ll avoid the worst of the suffering that lies ahead should we stick with the mainstream climate framework. The top priorities are food, housing, and healthcare for everybody. Capitalist property laws, car- and airplane-based transportation systems, industrial mono-cropping, and borders are threats to our health, so we abolish, destroy, or transform them. Climate refugees and unhoused people seize mansions and vacation homes, and the rest of us support them because universal housing is more important than the property titles of the rich. With climate disasters like wildfires and hurricanes, everyone’s homes are at risk, so empathy comes easier to most of us. We distribute all the food we find in supermarkets and warehouses, then turn lawns, golf courses, parking lots, and highways into orchards, gardens, forests, meadows, and wetlands. As we transition away from industrial mono-cropping, we gain some breathing room by harvesting fields that are already planted, planting the next seasons’ seed stores, and eating the livestock bred to satisfy the machinery of capitalist meat production. Without money, wages are no longer an incentive. The acceptance and goodwill of one’s neighbors isn’t just a mental health benefit: It becomes the basis for our survival, motivating us to learn cooperative practices. Workers in high pollution industries — once the bosses have no more power and there’s no rent to pay — will decide to protect their own water supplies, their own neighbors and families. They’ll cap oil and gas wells and phase out nuclear power plants on the safest timeline. The communities that inhabit affected watersheds will decide whether and how to dismantle hydroelectric dams. Fossil fuel emissions will begin declining immediately, reaching zero within a few years. As energy supplies diminish, priority will be given to healthcare facilities, food production facilities, factories that produce necessary tools and resources, and for seasonal heating or cooling in regions with extreme temperatures. Medical research will continue around the world, with the material support of regional community networks rather than the pharmaceutical industry. Those historically abused or silenced by the medical industry will be able to assert their own experiences, knowledge, and needs. Together, we will generate an informed prediction of the most frequent health problems that are likely to affect us over the coming years despite improved diets, healthier lifestyles, and drastic reductions in environmental toxins. This will help determine which high-tech production facilities for drugs and equipment are still necessary, and what resources they need to continue operation. Global networks will carry out similar assessments in other vital sectors like housing, travel, transport, communication, and food. Communities across the world will scrap and recycle unnecessary machinery and capitalism’s abundant trash, shut down or repurpose the factories, and build towards the material autonomy of every regional network of communities. The general organizational principles are these: Especially in the first few years of the revolution, one of the key activities is to shift resources globally to undo the forced dependence and vulnerability caused by colonialism. No country should ever have been turned into a plantation or mining pit for global capitalism, and no revolution will be complete if it forgets about the legacies of colonialism. Using cargo ships, airplanes, and remaining fuel reserves, a global network of former shipping industry workers, revolutionaries, community organizers, and engineers transport whatever is required for historically colonized regions to attain regional self-sufficiency, producing the tools they need for whatever technological culture they choose, so long as it does not damage the health and freedom of others. After about twelve years of major upheavals, life has settled into a much more comforting pattern. Communities source the vast majority of their food locally. Coastal communities might travel farther for food, when fishing, but they’re using sustainable, ancestral techniques: no trawling, drift nets, purse-seine nets, or dynamite. Food self-sufficiency means that if anything impedes the movement of food across a continent, the situation is uncomfortable for a season or two, but no one’s survival is threatened. And, if some disaster wreaks havoc on a community’s fields, herds, or orchards, they can use the relationships and infrastructure linking them to other communities to get their food from elsewhere. Nearly all the fruit and nut trees we planted in the early years are providing us with abundant harvests for a small amount of labor every year. The trees provide habitat and nourishment for other species in our ecosystem. The yearly piles of pruned branches provide an additional carbon-neutral fuel source. Together with companion planting and ecological grazing, we’re regenerating the soil and nourishing ourselves with the healthiest diets possible. In the first years, every community identified the least polluted land in their area for planting orchards, gardens, and pastures. Moderately polluted lands are reforested and the trees harvested there are used as building material. The most polluted lands can be slowly recovered with bioremediation and other techniques. Every community tends to wetlands, estuaries, meadows, and forests along its margins. In these spaces, we hunt species like deer that rely on us for a healthy rate of predation. We practice regenerative grazing with goats, sheep, chickens, cows, and llamas, reducing the intensity of wildfires and re-fertilizing soil. We collect medicinal herbs and harvest building materials like clay or wood, always in a respectful way, attentive to our impact, focused on helping our ecosystems grow stronger. On abandoned urban blocks, people tend to the jungles sprouting from the empty structures. Fungal networks, trees, insects, and hardy grasses are breaking down the concrete or asphalt covering the earth, slowly remediating the toxins, and turning a wasteland into a vibrant habitat. Housing patterns shift considerably. Most people prefer to adapt and repurpose what is in front of them, though thousands of idealistic, innovative communes also spring up on depleted agricultural land or in abandoned strip malls. Cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants generally shrink by about half in the first dozen years, whereas rural populations double or triple. A huge amount of work has to go into scrapping or renovating the wretched housing stock left over from capitalism. The new standard is for structures to last a hundred years or more without major repairs, to use techniques like passive solar and good air circulation for self-heating and self-cooling, and to have efficient, small-scale energy production built into the very design of our towns and neighborhoods. In cities, the best housing blocks are taken over and improved, while other blocks are used for workshops, factories, storage, or knocked down and gradually converted into habitat and, if the soil allows, gardens and orchards. In the countryside, people reform existing large structures or build new ones to create multiple houses, workshops, barns, and storage places clustered together. These clusters share walls and heat. They facilitate communal cooking on a larger scale and simplify the logistics for things like clean water, water remediation, composting, methane harvesting from compost and livestock, and efficient electricity generation. Ultimately, the divide between urban and rural has eroded, as nearly a quarter of the world’s population moves seasonally between rural villages and city neighborhoods, according to weather or labor-intensive agricultural activities like a harvest. Most villages and urban neighborhoods exist in pairs, with a declared bond and a circulation of inhabitants between a specific city block and a village that might be 50-100 miles away. People moving between the sites a couple times a year gain perspective and experience, and their mixed loyalties facilitate mutual aid and prevent the historical domination of urban centers over agricultural zones. Nomadic peoples, from Travellers to Bedouin, have made a huge comeback, aided by the abolition of borders and nation-states. So too have some of the major biomes worst impacted by capitalism. The commercial ​“forests” that took up land, depleted soil, and fueled wildfires from Canada to Chile have been transformed into real forests again, complex ecosystems that give life to thousands of species and provide a range of renewable resources to human communities. Likewise, the Great Plains and similar ecosystems from Siberia to the Serengeti are freed from the depravities of a capitalist market, whether in the form of industrial-scale beef and dairy production, gas and oil extraction or colonial conservationism and eco-tourism. On the Great Plains, for example, once dominant cattle ranchers, with no more industrial market to sell to and few protections against poachers and fence cutters, have either turned to smaller scale, intensive grazing practices that helped restore the prairies, or they moved out. Indigenous peoples and trusted friends and accomplices they invited along recovered most of their lands and are helping restore them by dismantling dams and pipelines and adapting traditional technologies, food cultures, and spirituality. Desertification has slowed significantly, and by the end of the century it’s predicted there will be at least four million wild bison, roaming free again. The abolition of borders and the recovery of large biomes have made a critical difference in one adaptive response that everyone should have access to for survival: migration. Humans living in regions that mining companies have turned into wastelands or that militaries have filled with depleted uranium need support as they leave their homes behind. And whoever migrates needs a warm welcome, some place to put down roots again. Ecosystems also migrate, and some species and habitats have to migrate rapidly away from the tropics or to higher elevations. A revolutionary response to the ecological crisis does much to mitigate the harm and turbulence, but the climate is already changing thanks to the last two hundred years of capitalist greed. Borders, highways, and the biodiversity deserts of asphalted cities, the lawns and parking lots of suburbia, were all huge impediments to migration. Now, attentive, ecologically-minded human communities aid migration — the migration of fellow humans, of other species, and of entire ecosystems. With universal healthcare and housing, an immediate decrease of toxins in our air, water, and food, and the recovery of Indigenous or locally-adapted food cultures, our health and happiness improve dramatically. Social decentralization and the abolition of borders allow us much greater resilience to the disasters caused by capitalism. With the end of fossil fuel production, commercial forestry, cement production, and capitalist food production, greenhouse gas emissions flip from the catastrophic levels permitted by the mainstream climate framework and move into negative numbers. Within about a decade, hundreds of millions of new trees and soil recovery across all the billions of acres of agricultural land on the planet has absorbed significant quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere. Energy production has hit net zero, with the shift towards clean-burning biofuels, mostly passive wind and solar, and maintenance of about half of the pre-existing hydroelectric infrastructure. Catastrophic floods and wildfires which release huge amounts of methane and carbon — and are usually left off the emissions balance sheets — decline sharply or are eliminated. And without states, the frequency and intensity of warfare, and its massive and uncounted carbon emissions, diminishes drastically. Coming back to the depressing reality of 2025: the IPCC is pushing for the global economy to reach net zero in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. They also have a perfect track record of failure and no realistic methodology for reaching their target. The approach I’m describing here can effectively do better than net zero. It even has the possibility to quickly remove enough CO2 and methane from the atmosphere to stop the cascade of tipping points that capitalism has already begun to trigger, a cascade that would lock in 3-5ºC of warming and cause death, extinction, and suffering on an unprecedented scale. This approach benefits from being complex and intersectional. It improves quality of life, universalizes access to quality healthcare and housing, and takes major steps to heal the enduring legacies of white supremacy and colonialism. The mainstream approach, on the contrary, exacerbates many preexisting inequalities and rewards the corporations and institutions responsible for the disaster. No matter when we adopt a realistic response to the ecological crisis, it will be better for our own lives, for future generations, and for all life on this planet. It removes the filters that prevent us from seeing the problem. It empowers us to take action for our shared survival. And it gives us greater resilience to adapt and overcome.

Title: As World War III Winds Down, a Brief Prognosis

I believe the Anglo-American-Zionist Empire has lost the quarter-century-long World War III that began with 9/11, i.e., the Neocons’ “New Pearl Harbor.” The U.S is now beginning its own solitary “long retreat” to “Fortress America.” Future wars are likely to be peripheral skirmishes. The U.S. can’t even get along with Canada and Mexico, is under siege by criminal gangs, and China is buying up Latin America. Even the Monroe Doctrine is barely breathing any more. In Europe, Ukraine has lost the war which the Neocons started, NATO is “the night of the living dead,” and Russia will integrate economically with Germany. The people of Europe are too smart and too scared to go down with the ship. Britain is in the midst of full-scale collapse. 500-years of British occult empire is done—stick a fork in it. The Black Nobility that heads the globalist financial elite—The “City,” the WEF, Bilderberg, the WHO, the “Woke,” etc.—is also seeing its world collapse. The parasite has been killing the host, and the host is in full rebellion. No more genocidal “jabs” for us, thank you. In the U.S., Trump’s main economic goal is to keep the stock market soaring so his donors can continue to ride the IT wave, which is the only U.S. asset class remaining other than farmland saturated with chemicals. The poor and middle class will continue to drown in the waves. BRICS will win any trade wars the U.S. starts. The great U.S. trade market is built on debt and is going under. Gurgle, gurgle, BlackRock. Israel and the Israel lobby will continue to be the albatross around Trump’s neck, so the Palestinian two-state solution has to re-emerge. Trump knows, or should know, that with a big Middle East war all bets are off. He may do it anyway. No one can say one more really big smack in the face is not coming. My advice to individuals in the Western world: look to your own survival, along with those of family and friends. Believe me, in today’s world survival is enough.

Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has surged to almost $110,000 per bitcoin, helped by Elon Musk’s leaked plans for crypto in the White House. Now, as one legendary bitcoin trader warns of a looming “financial crisis,” Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has flung the door open for Wall Street to further adopt bitcoin and crypto. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has told banks they are permitted to offer bitcoin and ... [+] crypto to clients as fears emerge the bitcoin price could be on the verge of a crash. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks,” Powell said at a press conference this week after the Fed paused its interest rate cutting cycle. Wall Street banks “have to be pretty sure” their bitcoin and crypto activities are “safe and sound," Powell added. 02/03 update: Crypto prices have taken a huge step lower, wiping around $300 billion from the combined market that has been hard hit by the rapidly escalating trade war sparked by U.S. president Donald Trump’s volley of tariffs on goods entering the U.S. from China, Canada and Mexico. The tariffs, due to come into effect Tuesday morning, have also hit global stock markets, with investors balking at the prospect of tighter trading conditions. “A tidal wave of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) has been unleashed across the cryptocurrency market after U.S. president Donald Trump’s Friday tariff announcement,” Petr Kozyakov, chief executive crypto payment platform Mercuryo, said in emailed comments. “The prospect of prolonged higher interest rates has rattled all global markets. While bitcoin has dropped below the $100,000 mark the King of Crypto is once again proving itself to be in a class of its own in marked contrast to altcoins bleeding dark red across the board.” Bitcoin plummeted overnight to just over $91,000, down almost 10% at its lowest, before rebounding to around $95,000. Other major cryptocurrencies have seen far steeper declines, with ethereum down around 20% before recovering slightly and Ripple's XRP and ethereum rival cardano trading around similar levels. Solana, ethereum's biggest rival, has fared better, off by just 6% and exacerbating fears among ethereum holders that it could seize the altcoin crown. However, crypto traders have cheered analysis from Bitwise's investment guru Jeff Park, posted to X, who has outlined his thesis on why the coming trade war could be good for bitcoin. “Tariffs might be just a temporary tool, but the permanent conclusion is that bitcoin is not only going higher—but faster,” Park wrote, adding: “While both sides of the trade imbalance equation will want bitcoin for two different reasons, the end result is the same: higher, violently faster—for we are at war.” Wall Street giants, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, have leaned into bitcoin and crypto over the last year with a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helping to normalize bitcoin and crypto among the financial establishment. Powell’s comments mark a major shift in sentiment under Trump from the previous Biden administration that was hostile toward crypto. Under Biden, bitcoin and crypto companies complained of an unofficial policy to “debank” them, cutting off basic financial services and making it impossible to operate—which became known as “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” a reference to a previous U.S. government policy to cut off industries believed to be at high risk of fraud and money laundering.

[+] the crypto market to around $4 trillion as Donald Trump bets on bitcoin and crypto. Trump’s adoption of bitcoin and crypto—starting with his non-fungible token (NFT) collections, growing to support for a U.S. bitcoin national stockpile and culminating with the launch of a controversial Trump-branded memecoin—has led to regulators and government agencies reversing their opposition to the technology. Meanwhile, Trump has followed through with his campaign promise to put steep tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, and China, setting the stage for a trade war that could spread around the world. Trump’s executive order will impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, with a 10% tariff on Canadian energy and oil, and an additional 10% tariff on China, due to go into effect on Tuesday morning. “Gold, silver, bitcoin may crash,” Robert Kiyosaki, investor and author of advice book Rich Dad Poor Dad, posted to X, pointing to Trump’s tariffs as the catalyst. “Good. Will buy more after prices crash. Real problem is debt, which will only get worse. Crashes mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer.” One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Bessent Takes the Helm on US Debt Sales After Blasting Yellen

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- After repeatedly blasting Janet Yellen last year over her department’s strategy for issuing federal debt, it’s now up to Scott Bessent to make the call on sales of Treasuries, with bond dealers conflicted over what he’ll do in a pivotal release due Wednesday. Most Read from Bloomberg New York’s First ‘Passive House’ School Is a Model of Downtown Density When French Communists Went on a Brutalist Building Boom Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour’s Housing Push In the past four straight so-called quarterly refunding plans, the Treasury has advised that it didn’t expect to increase issuance of longer-dated securities “for at least the next several quarters,” after a final bump up at the start of last year. Many dealers see that changing, in part because of past comments from Bessent, potentially watering it down to “a few” or “a couple” of quarters. The former hedge fund manager, before he was picked by President Donald Trump as Yellen’s successor, was one of a number of Republicans who charged Yellen with having artificially held down sales of longer-maturity Treasuries — which affect things like mortgage rates — to boost the pre-election economy. He also in August criticized the advance notice in the refunding statement as “the first time ever” the Treasury had offered forward guidance. “This is going to be the key point of the statement on Wednesday,” said Mark Cabana, head of US rates strategy at Bank of America Corp. “I can’t help but think it’s a new administration, they want to have their own guidance.” Should Bessent, who has yet to build out his team at the Treasury after being sworn in to the job just last Tuesday, remove the guidance entirely, dealers cautioned longer-term Treasuries may drop in anticipation of increased supply. Several still see the previous language being retained for now, although a number of them viewed it as a close call. One challenge is that longer-term Treasury yields have jumped the better part of a percentage point since September — in part due to concerns about fiscal deficits and inflation in light of Trump’s plans for more tax cuts and tariff hikes. With higher levies set to kick in across-the-board on Canada, Mexico and China starting Tuesday, the refunding this week takes place at a time of particular uncertainty about the rates outlook. As of late Friday, 10-year notes yielded well over 20 basis points more than bills, which mature in up to a year, making them more costly to the Treasury, and raising the stakes for any move to boost longer-dated sales. “It’s a very different world now than back in 2023, when Yellen decided to lean more on bills,” said Jason Williams, a strategist at Citigroup Inc. “Bill yields back then were higher than those on coupon-bearing debt, but that’s not the case now and the absolute level of yields is also higher. Even if Bessent does want to extend the weighted average maturity of US debt, he’d want to do it in a slow and orderly fashion.” After a string of increases beginning in August 2023, the Treasury has kept its quarterly refunding auctions, which span 3-, 10- and 30-year maturities, at $125 billion. Even relatively modest shifts in size can have a market impact. Yields climbed after the August 2023 boost, and they dropped in the wake of a November 2023 move to temper the ramping up of issuance of longer-dated debt. Given outsize US fiscal deficits, the amount of debt the Treasury has to sell over time continues to climb, and dealers say increased sales of longer maturities is inevitable at some point. The Treasury on Monday is set to release an update on broader borrowing needs and cash-balance estimates. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup, Santander and Societe Generale are among firms that expect Bessent to leave his predecessor’s guidance intact for now. Still, the consensus among dealers is that long-term debt issuance doesn’t actually move higher until the November refunding, with some seeing potential for a bump as soon as August. Cabana at Bank of America thinks it’s possible the guidance will disappear completely — something that could lead some investors to see an increase in sales as soon as the May refunding. BofA’s Katie Craig, along with Cabana, wrote in a note to clients last week to expect Bessent to ask the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a panel of bond market participants, to undertake a study of investor demand for a potential boost in long-term debt sales. The Fed The politics of the issue came to the fore in mid-2024, with a paper by economists Stephen Miran — whom Trump has nominated to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers — and Nouriel Roubini accusing Yellen’s Treasury of manipulating the issuance of Treasuries. Yellen firmly rejected that idea, and one of her top lieutenants delivered a detailed speech to counter “misconceptions.” Meantime, there are other considerations, including uncertainty over when the Federal Reserve will halt its steady reduction in holdings of Treasuries — currently running at up to $25 billion a month. While Chair Jerome Powell last week offered no hint on when that might end, when it is phased out, that will reduce the amounts the Treasury needs to borrow from the public. The Treasury specifically asked dealers in a quarterly survey this month for their views on Fed balance-sheet policy changes ahead. Along with a high degree of uncertainty about the fiscal outlook, “these are the two main factors that make the decision-making process a little bit more complicated moving forward, which on its own argues for maybe being a little bit less committal” in Wednesday’s statement, said William Marshall, Goldman’s head of US rates strategy. “There’s a cost to giving guidance and then not following through.” Keeping the status quo for issuance sizes would put next week’s refunding auctions on course for the following: $58 billion of 3-year notes on Feb. 11 $42 billion of 10-year notes on Feb. 12 $25 billion of 30-year bonds on Feb. 13 The Treasury on Wednesday is also seen keeping issuance of floating-rate debt unchanged, while continuing to nudge sales of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, higher. Yet another complication for Bessent is managing the world’s biggest bond market under the constraints of the federal debt limit, which kicked back in at the start of January. Any drawn-out episode in Congress over raising or suspending the limit will force the Treasury to slash bill issuance and spend down its cash buffer. “Once Bessent is kind of settled and we are through the debt-limit issue, then maybe they start poking around at longer-term issuance,” said Blake Gwinn at RBC Capital Markets. “So this meeting could be kind of a wash.” Unless the Trump administration is able to rein in the deficit, now seen running at an historically high 6% or more of GDP for years to come, bigger auction sizes are looming — with consequences for yields, according to Marc Seidner, chief investment officer of non-traditional strategies at Pacific Investment Management Co. “That suggests to us that there should be a greater risk premium, a greater term premium in long-term debt and a steeper yield curve.” Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, sees 10-year yields headed back to 5% or above, from around 4.5% currently. While there’s high uncertainty around the administration’s specific plans, “tax cuts and other things will definitely continue the deficit’s trajectory.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Elon Musk Inside the Treasury Department Payment System The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America’s Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

The London-based startup, which helps businesses collect recurring payments such as subscriptions, reported a net loss of £35.1 million ($43.8 million) in the full year ending June 30, 2024. That was a 55% improvement from the £78 million GoCardless lost the year prior. The firm noted that "restructuring activity" at the end of the full year ending June 2023 contributed to a reduction in operating losses in 2024. In June 2023, GoCardless announced it was cutting 15% of its global workforce. That took GoCardless' salary expenses down 13% to £79.2 million in the company's 2024 fiscal year. Still, while this improved the company's financial picture, GoCardless' CEO Hiroki Takeuchi told CNBC that revenue growth also helped significantly. "We're much more focused on the cost side ... We want to be getting very efficient as we scale," Takeuchi said in an interview last week. "But we also need to continue growing. We need both of those things to get to where we want to be." GoCardless grew revenue by 41% to £132 million in full-year 2024. Of that total, £91.9 million came from customer revenue. Last year also saw GoCardless record its first-ever month in profit in March 2024. Takeuchi said its his aim for GoCardless to post its first full-year profit in 12 to 18 months' time, adding it's "well on track" to do so. Back in September, GoCardless acquired a firm called Nuapay, which helps businesses collect and send payments via bank transfer. Asked whether GoCardless is considering further mergers and acquisitions in future, Takeuchi said the firm is "actively looking," adding: "We're seeing lots of opportunities come up." Following its acquisition of Nuapay, Takeuchi said GoCardless is currently testing a new feature that allows clients to distribute funds to their own customers. "If you take something like energy, the vast majority of the payments are about collecting money," he told CNBC. "But then you might have some of your customers that have solar panels on their roof and they're sending energy back to the grid, and they need to get paid for that energy that they're generating." GoCardless, which is backed by Alphabet's venture arm GV, Accel and BlackRock, was last privately valued by investors at $2.1 billion in February 2022. Takeuchi said the firm had no need for external capital and that there are "no plans" for an initial public offering in the near term. Fintechs have been watching Swedish fintech Klarna's plan to go public closely — but many are waiting to see how it goes before deciding on their own plans. With technology IPOs at historic lows, several startups have instead opted to provide employees and early shareholders liquidity by selling shares in the secondary market. In November, Bloomberg reported that GoCardless had chosen investment bank Lazard to advise it on a $200 million secondary share sale. GoCardless declined to comment on the report.

Title: Blue zones, where people live to 100, are a lovely idea. It’s a shame they don’t exist

Blue zones are places where people reportedly live in good health to over 100 years of age. These locations seem to hold the secrets of exceptional longevity wrapped up in the warm glow of red wine with family. Blue zones are a lovely idea, but they likely don’t exist. In fact, the extreme age of people who live in these areas may be more due to poor record keeping than healthy lifestyle habits. Examples of blue zones include Okinawa in Japan, Loma Linda in California, Sardinia in Italy and Ikaria in Greece. These areas have been studied in detail to understand why their people live such long and healthy lives and, more importantly, what we can do to emulate their longevity successes. The common factors include daily activity, drinking red wine, prioritising family, eating vegetables, having faith in something, taking time off, and celebrating life. These are (mostly) all very sensible things most people could integrate into their lives. But while all the blue zones mentioned have these factors in spades, it doesn’t take long to realise that endless small towns around the world, particularly in the Mediterranean, share these traits, yet lack exceptional longevity. Why do these blue zones have populations that are routinely dying at over 100 years of age if it’s not down to the factors listed above? It’s worth looking more closely at these areas and the factors that unite them. Some other factors common to blue zones include poor birth and death registration, poverty, specifically old-age poverty, high crime rates, worse health metrics, and remote regions of birth. In some blue zones, rates of smoking are often as high as 50 per cent, and rates of illiteracy reach as high as 80 per cent. This is not exactly what you would expect from an area where people are supposed to have exceptionally long and healthy lives. As a centenarian or supercentenarian who has lived to over 110 years, you would have been born when the record-keeping of births and deaths was either not present or less robust. The number of supercentenarians plummeted after the rollout of mandatory birth registration and census keeping in the United States. This suggests that when formal record-keeping was mandated, self-estimations of age, which were common practice at the time, were no longer accepted. But the strange birth registration issues don’t end there. Supercentenarians born in the US are 1.5 times more likely to be born on the first day of the month. In Japan, that figure rises to 2.7 times. This, to put it mildly, seems a little odd. When countries attempt to count their true number of centenarians, they are frequently surprised to learn that many of them are already dead. A 2010 Japanese investigation discovered that almost a quarter of a million of their centenarian population was already deceased. A similar investigation in the US found that 35 per cent of all supercentenarians were already dead. Of all the supercentenarians in the US and France, not one has an authentic birth certificate. Record-keeping for those born in the early 1900s in areas of the world that have struggled with poverty has been subpar. In reality, blue zones may be more of an artefact of poor record keeping rather than lifestyle. But that doesn’t mean we should ignore the lifestyle patterns identified in blue zones. They probably won’t be the determining factor that gets you to 110 years of age; they are, however, a great place to start if you want to add ten years to your life and live to 90. Rather than focusing on blue zones, it is better to examine lifestyle factors in longer-term studies and see how they impact lifespan. When people get the basics right by age 50 – not smoking, maintaining a normal weight, being active daily, maintaining modest alcohol intake, and maintaining a good diet – they can extend their lives by over a decade. That is more than a 10 per cent life extension. This means that the average male who gets these factors in check by age 50 will die on average at 87, and the average female who gets them right will live on average to 93. Getting them right is unlikely to get you to 110, as the blue zones would suggest, but you’re likely to live significantly longer than those who don’t get them right. What is even more important is that getting these healthy factors right can delay the onset of many serious medical conditions, including heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes, by 10 years. An additional 10 years without a major illness means the life years gained will be much higher quality. Adhering to these healthy patterns does not guarantee longevity, but it seriously increases the odds. If following a “blue zone” diet or way of life seems attractive to you, the data shows that it will likely extend your life by over a decade – just don’t plan on it extending your life to over 110 years of age. For that, you might need to work on your birth certificate forgery skills.

Title: Here’s the few foreign markets set to win on Trump’s return

Not every country’s financial market is suffering fallout from Donald Trump’s return to the White House — and money managers say relations with the United States are playing a growing role in deciding where to invest. As the likes of Colombia and Mexico are rattled by tariff fears, assets of nations seen as benefiting from close ties with the US leader, like Argentina and Ecuador, are getting an extra lift. While that’s particularly true in Latin America, where most countries count the world’s largest economy as a key trade partner, the Trump “friend-or-foe” factor is impacting emerging-markets across the globe, from India to Vietnam. “Winners here are not the traditional ones that we’d think about — there’s a new set of countries that will emerge as winners,” Amer Bisat, a managing director and head of emerging markets fixed income at BlackRock Inc, said at a recent industry panel. In today’s world, a country that “aligns itself politically to the US ends up being the winner — and that becomes much more of a transactional relationship.” Gramercy Fund Management, which was set up by veteran investor Robert Koenigsberger in 1998, echoed the view in its quarterly strategy outlook, saying the beginning of the new US administration should be characterised by a stronger emphasis on bilateral relations at the expense of multilateral ones. Bonds from countries including Argentina and El Salvador could enjoy “some market premium” at the start of the year thanks to their leaders having a good relationship with Trump, according to Gramercy. Turkey, India and Hungary could also benefit. Since Trump secured his return to the White House, dollar bonds of Argentina, Ecuador and El Salvador have handed investors gains of at least 11%, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a 2.3% return for a benchmark index of developing-nation credits. Fears that Trump’s economic measures might boost the dollar and fan inflation in the world’s largest economy, cutting the room the Federal Reserve has to lower interest rates, have muddied the waters for developing economies. A lack of clarity around Trump’s tariff plans, which could have devastating impacts in emerging nations, have also dimmed the outlook for the asset class, which has been grappling with back-to-back annual outflows. Asian economies fare worse than emerging peers, with high trade surpluses against the US and secondary effects from measures on Chinese trade that risk stifling the region’s growth. Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand are some of the most at-risk nations should Trump enact across the board tariffs, with exports to the US as a percent of GDP in the double digits, according to US government data compiled by Bloomberg. “Identifying Trump’s friends and enemies is very important. The obvious challenge with the US is for China and everything that follows on from that,” said Arnab Das, a global market strategist at Invesco Asset Management Ltd. in London. “The tariffs are going to be levelled at different countries for all kinds of transgressions and bad behavior.” As part of a larger strategy to avoid any confrontation with Trump, India is already considering options to narrow its trade surplus with the US, possibly through a trade deal, cutting tariffs or importing more goods from the US. The country is also prepared to work with the Trump administration to identify and take back all of its residents residing illegally in the US. Investors in Europe have the additional complication of disentangling Trump’s views on individual countries and their leaders from his general approach to the European Union. Hungary, whose leader Viktor Orban is frequently praised by Trump and other US conservatives for a governance style Orban has called “illiberal democracy,” is a prime example for traders. ‘Winning’ In Latin America, El Salvador, Argentina and Ecuador are expected to receive strong US support during Trump’s term, according to Ricardo Penfold, a managing director at Seaport Global. Argentina’s dollar bonds have been on a tear due to Milei’s harsh austerity plan, and his affinity with Trump — he was one of the few foreign leaders to attend the US President’s swearing in — may help the country skirt tariffs, avoiding additional pressure for its beleaguered currency, said Jeff Grills, head of US cross-asset and emerging-markets debt at Aegon Asset Management. El Salvador has already started taking in US military planes filled with deported migrants and is working with Trump to develop an asylum agreement. Daniel Noboa’s tough policies against transnational gangs and his support for foreign military bases in Ecuador — should he win the upcoming election — will also appeal to Trump, said Nathalie Marshik, a managing director at HSBC in New York. Whiplash Meantime, countries that Trump had gone after so far have seen their asset prices getting whiplashed. Traders soured on Colombia earlier this week after a migration dispute resulted in a brief, but unexpected tariff spat, sending the currency down as much as 2% in one day. Panama, whose leader rebuked Trump’s threat to reassert control of the Panama Canal, saw JPMorgan Chase & Co downgrade its recommendation on the country’s bonds. Markets should take the risk more seriously and there’s “little clarity on the endgame,” strategists including Gorka Lalaguna wrote in a note last week. In Mexico, investors are waiting to see if Trump will enact the planned 25% tariffs on the country’s goods on Saturday. The White House said on Friday that Trump intends to move ahead with the idea, denying a report that he planned on delaying the implementation by a month. Unlike Mexico, Turkey has a balanced relationship with the US as the $29 billion trade volume is almost equally split between exports and imports, according to the US government data for 2024. However, this did not spare the country in 2018, when Trump sanctioned senior Turkish officials and raised tariffs on some imports in response to the extended detention of an American citizen, sending local markets into turmoil. While a good relationship with the US might help, it’s no guarantee of outperformance. Local factors — from elections in Ecuador to an IMF deal in Argentina — are still key to sustain gains. “The lesson learned is that Trump is willing to push very aggressively to use sanctions and tariff threats to achieve his policy objectives,” said Eurasia Group analyst Risa Grais-Targow. “There are a number of countries in the region that will end up capitulating.”

Title: Musk rips 'fraudulent' Treasury handouts as reports mount DOGE has access to federal payment system

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/02/2025 5:12:37 PM PST by Libloather Tech billionaire Elon Musk ripped alleged "fraudulent" Treasury payments on Saturday as reports circulated that the Department of Government Efficiency has gained acces to the federal government's payment system as the second Trump administration continues cutting what they say is government fat and overspending. "The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once," Musk, the chair of DOGE, posted early Saturday morning to X. Musk's post came just ahead of the New York Times reporting Saturday afternoon that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent granted DOGE personnel access to the payment system. The Treasury spends roughly $6 trillion per year on payments for federal agencies. The ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, posted to social media on Saturday that he has also been informed that DOGE was granted access to the system. "Sources tell my office that Treasury Secretary Bessent has granted DOGE *full* access to this system. Social Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies. All of it," Wyden posted to social media site BlueSky on Saturday evening. DOGE's reported access to the payment system comes after the Washington Post reported on Friday that the former acting director of the Treasury, David A. Lebryk, was planning to exit the finance department of the federal government following a clash over granting DOGE access to its payment system. Lebryk oversaw the Treasury Department in the days between President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and Bessent's confirmation to lead the department on Jan. 27.

The Treasury spends roughly $6 trillion per year on payments for federal agencies. The ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, posted to social media on Saturday that he has also been informed that DOGE was granted access to the system. "Sources tell my office that Treasury Secretary Bessent has granted DOGE *full* access to this system. Social Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies. All of it," Wyden posted to social media site BlueSky on Saturday evening. DOGE's reported access to the payment system comes after the Washington Post reported on Friday that the former acting director of the Treasury, David A. Lebryk, was planning to exit the finance department of the federal government following a clash over granting DOGE access to its payment system. Lebryk oversaw the Treasury Department in the days between President Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and Bessent's confirmation to lead the department on Jan. 27.

This means the order from that leftist judge enjoining the stop payment order doesn’t matter now. Now, that judge will need to order a cabinet level officer to make a payment. That will get interesting when the defense is fraudulent payments. I WONDER IF PEOPLE WILL REALLY GRASP WHAT THIS HAS COST THE USA??? “...They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once,” IOW, the US Treasury was the Democrats’ Personal Piggy Bank.......... What the heck is going on here? I’m dense so I need it spelled out for me. Otherwise it kind of looks like a weird Elon Musk takeover of the federal government. Didn’t question it : Well they had to get 10% for themselves and family.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/02/2025 3:33:00 PM PST by governsleastgovernsbest On Sunday's edition of The Weekend on MSNBC, weeknight host Chris Hayes questioned Trump's machismo for imposing higher tariffs on Canada and Mexico than on China. He's tougher on allies than on adversaries, because that's easier, less risky. He even claimed Trump has been "extremely generous to adversaries" like Russia and China. HAYES: He likes the conflict, he likes to project strength, but he's sort of a coward fundamentally. And the stakes of actual conflict and fights with adversaries is much higher. And so this is a way of kind of, a little bit of bullying, and cake and eat it too, where he can, like, play tough against Justin Trudeau, which is a very different thing than playing tough against Xi. Co-host Symone Sanders analogized it to Trump's treatment of Gavin Newsom. While blasting Newsom in public, Trump, according to Sanders, is very polite to him in person. Sanders put on a soft voice, supposedly imitating Trump: "Hey, how are you doing? Good to see you." That's when Steele stepped in: "And he says it like that [puts on effeminate voice]: "Hey, how are you doing? [laughs]. It's kind of a little Mike Tyson voice."Get the rest of the story and view the video here. (Excerpt) Read more at newsbusters.org ...

Before he became Chairman of the DNC, Republicans held both Houses of Congress. Once he took over the Chair, Democrats got control and kept control of both Houses of Congress throughout his term. He only held the position for two years from 2009 to 2011, but oversaw a RAT takeover. The network is averaging 45,000 viewers from the demo. Less a thousand per state. If Blackrock and Vangaurd weren’t propping them up for the cause they would be gone. I’ve heard Patton’s voice described as flute-like. Bet I wouldn’t be smiling or smirking if he was chewing my ass. A man nobody likes on a network nobody watches. Thanks for keeping us informed. MS deserves to be hated by by the GOP. Stinking rat traitor. He was a fraud and knew he didn’t belong. Must be h hard trying to pass for a qualified man, huh, Steele? I remember Rush pimping this guy. Even the great one got it wrong occasionally. Steele was our ORIGINAL DEI HIRE!! BAD MOVE!!

Title: Robinhood CEO Warns Lack of U.S. Regulation Stifles Security Tokenization Efforts

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Krisztian Sandor Vlad Tenev joined BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in calling for clear regulations for tokenized securities in the U.S. Current U.S. regulations are blocking a major financial shift that could open up private-market investments to everyday investors through tokenization, CEO of digital brokerage Robinhood Vlad Tenev said. In a Wednesday opinion piece for the Washington Post, Tenev said that many high-growth companies like OpenAI, SpaceX and Stripe are increasingly avoiding going public, limiting investment access to a small circle of wealthy investors, widening the investment gap between retail investors. Tokenizing private equity through blockchain technology that underpins crypto markets would allow retail to access companies early in their growth phase, lowering barriers while keeping proper disclosures and investor protections, Tenev argued. “The world is tokenizing, and the United States should not get left behind,” Tenev wrote. “It’s time to update our conversation about crypto from bitcoin and meme coins to what blockchain is really making possible: A new era of ultra-inclusive and customizable investing fit for this century.” However, U.S. regulators, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have yet to provide a clear framework and rules for registering security tokens, while other key markets such as the EU, Singapore and Abu Dhabi are already advancing in this area, he said. He proposed creating a security token registration framework as an alternative to IPOs, providing clear guidelines for exchanges and broker-dealers to support tokenized assets and updating accredited investor rules to allow access based on financial knowledge instead of wealth. Tokenization is a booming sector at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance that could become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade, per forecasts by McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein . Institutions and even governments are increasingly exploring placing real-world assets like bonds, funds and commodities and real estate on blockchain rails in a digital token form to achieve speedier settlements and broader investor accessibility. Tenev is the latest high-profile leader in the financial world touting tokenization and calling for clear rules for tokenized securities. Larry Fink, CEO of $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, recently said that tokenization is the next frontier that will change markets, and urged the SEC in a CNBC interview to “rapidly approve” tokenization of stocks and bonds.

BlackRock spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF saw massive inflows following the broader market rebound. Bitcoin ETFs have continued to dominate institutional demand for crypto assets since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the funds. Inflows spiked the total digital assets market cap above $3.3 trillion, gaining over 4% in the US trading hours. BlackRock’s iShares BTC Trust (IBIT) recorded 5,250 Bitcoins in the last 24 hours. This shows growing institutional demand for BTC and other crypto assets, swinging the price past the $100K mark. BlackRock’s inflow outpaced the total daily production, signaling high institutional demand as bulls resume accumulation. Data from Farside shows that the total inflows on Jan 16 stood at $626 million, with IBIT and ArkInvests ARKB controlling the charts. IBIT captured 85% of demand, while the latter saw a huge $155 million in the same time frame. IBIT volumes outpaced both institutional investors and BTC production. The fund recorded 12 times more than the daily 450 Bitcoin production. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC notched $4.4 million,n while Bitwise’s fund attracted $2.7 million. BlackRock has remained a popular option for most institutional investors since its launch. The fund has over $55.6 billion in assets under management (AUM), exposing traditional investors to Bitcoin. BlackRock’s bid for an ETF in 2023 spiked interest from other traditional firms that filed similar applications. After the approval, the surge in applications and demand ignited the bull cycle, taking the asset price to an all-time high above $73K in Q1 2024. Meanwhile, crypto enthusiast Solana Legend tipped a higher target for the wider market due to surging ETF demand and other factors. “We have the richest man in the world joining forces with the president to kick off a golden age for emergent technology BTC ETF is the most successful ETF launch of all time Strategic Crypto Reserve being floated. Adjust your targets higher.” The success of Bitcoin products increased investor appetite, leading to a demand for altcoin products. After the launch of spot Ethereum ETF, several firms have filed for Solana and XRP products. Skyrocketing optimism has also led to huge inflows in these assets ahead of anticipated pro-crypto legislation. While the present administration was hostile to the market, Donald Trump has pledged a pro-market approach, giving investors confidence. Demand for spot XRP products in the United States is a major factor for the sharp increase in price.

Title: 3 High-Yield Closed End Funds To Buy Tech Stocks For Less

Photo taken in Kuching, Malaysia This week’s AI panic has opened up a rare bargain window in big tech names that were disposed of with the DeepSeek bathwater. Nosebleed Nvidia (NVDA) is a “stay away.” But there are tech dividends worth exploring, with some paying us up to 13% a year. Investors have been herded into the same AI and technology names that have been at the forefront for years, and—shockingly—those shares have largely been priced for perfection. Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek has shown that deep pockets are not needed to build smart AI models. This should have come as no surprise, as China is home to many smart technologists. Alas, the NVDA fanboys were stunned and sold immediately. These panics happen most often when specific stocks are overpriced. The tech sector has long been one of the market’s priciest, trading at forward P/Es last seen before the 2022 bear market—which were only previously matched in 1999-2004 as the dot-com bubble expanded and burst! Forward P/E Ratios This recent mini-dip has not made the sector-at-large cheap by any means. Instead we should consider lesser-known closed-end funds (CEFs), which allow us to buy many of these same bleeding-edge stocks for less than they’re actually worth. Better still? They allow us to own them differently, in a way that emphasizes big regular distributions, sometimes as frequently as every month. In the case of these three tech-focused CEFs, that’s roughly 6% to 13% in annual distributions. Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)Distribution Rate: 5.8% If you didn’t look too closely, it’d be easy to mistake Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) with a traditional mutual fund. A management team featuring Paul Wick, with a whopping 30 years of tech-sector experience under his belt, selects stocks based on “rigorous bottom-up fundamental analysis and valuation analysis, using a growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) style to aim for more consistent performance and lower risk than its peers.” The portfolio is a slim 55 stocks—70% of them are from within the technology sector, and the rest are “tech-esque” firms from the communication services, industrial, consumer discretionary and financial sectors. The GARP strategy shows, too, with the portfolio boasting P/E, P/B, and P/S ratios that are significantly cheaper than the category average. And unlike many CEFs that use debt leverage to add some oomph to their picks, STK doesn’t use a dime of it—the assets they have are the assets they’re putting to work. But you can’t own stocks like Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX) and magically spout out a 6% yield. In STK’s case, that distribution rate is a mix of income, return of capital, and capital gains, with some of that generated by a covered call options strategy. But you get what you might expect from this Columbia CEF’s covered call strategy: On the one hand, it limits upside (STK trails the S&P 500’s technology sector by a decent measure over the same time frame), but on the other, you’re also getting a little better performance during downswings, market-beating performance, and substantial quarterly distributions. However, while STK’s portfolio is cheaper than your average tech fund, we’re not getting much of a deal on the fund itself—it trades at just a 1% discount to NAV. That’s better than the 3% premium investors have paid on average over the past five years, but hardly a steal. BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ)Distribution Rate: 13.0% I recently highlighted this fund in a look at the market’s highest-yielding CEFs. The BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ) hones in on “innovative” mid- and small-cap companies that management determines have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Current top holdings include Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but most noteworthy is that BIGZ can also own private investments you can’t own elsewhere (which it folds under cryptic names such as “Project Picasso”). BIGZ does use leverage, but minimally—debt leverage is at less than 2% right now. Instead, this BlackRock CEF’s big yield comes courtesy of covered calls. Distributions have historically been entirely made of return of capital. And the fund actually mandates these distributions—its managed distribution plan requires BIGZ to dole out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. My colleague, CEF expert Michael Foster, wrote just yesterday that BIGZ was subject to a discount management program where the fund will offer to repurchase shares if its discount to NAV exceeds a certain threshold. However, amid a battle with activist investor Saba Capital Management, the company’s board of trustees has extended new tender offers to buy back 50% of BIGZ’s shares at 99.5% of NAV. This is an aggressive move that could help with the fund’s persistent discount, which has narrowed to roughly 6%. That’s certainly helpful—but it’s a wide-open question as to whether that will be enough to make up for what has been an extremely disappointing strategy so far. Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG)Distribution Rate: 9.2% Thematic funds are typically found in ETF-land, but the Neuberger Berman Next Generation Connectivity Fund (NBXG) is a compelling rarity among CEFs. NBXG holds stocks that fund management believes to “demonstrate significant growth potential from the development, advancement, use or sale of products, processes or services related to the fifth generation mobile network and future generations of mobile network connectivity and technology.” But a quick look at the portfolio shows that, at least as of right now, NBXG is a de facto AI play, too. Nvidia (NVDA). Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Amazon (AMZN). Meta Platforms (META). These are just some of the top holdings that have their hand in the AI cookie jar. More broadly speaking, the portfolio is tech-heavy, with some telecoms, consumer discretionary, and other sectors sprinkled in. NBXG, like BIGZ, offers something that most mutual funds and ETFs don’t: exposure to private companies, which make up about 13% of assets right now. And also like both the other CEFs here, a covered-call strategy helps keep an outstanding distribution afloat. Performance? Well, Neuberger Berman’s CEF mirrors the previous two in that it has trailed the tech sector since inception. However, this strategy has shown a lot of promise over the past year, actually exceeding the XLK by an impressive clip. What makes this all the more alluring is that you can buy NBXG’s assets for 87 cents on the dollar. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

02/03 update below. This post was originally published on February 2 Bitcoin and crypto prices have stalled after soaring higher following Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential victory—with fears suddenly emerging the $4 trillion crypto bubble could be about to pop. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has surged to almost $110,000 per bitcoin, helped by Elon Musk’s leaked plans for crypto in the White House. Now, as one legendary bitcoin trader warns of a looming “financial crisis,” Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has flung the door open for Wall Street to further adopt bitcoin and crypto. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has told banks they are permitted to offer bitcoin and ... [+] crypto to clients as fears emerge the bitcoin price could be on the verge of a crash. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks,” Powell said at a press conference this week after the Fed paused its interest rate cutting cycle. Wall Street banks “have to be pretty sure” their bitcoin and crypto activities are “safe and sound," Powell added. 02/03 update: Crypto prices have taken a huge step lower, wiping around $300 billion from the combined market that has been hard hit by the rapidly escalating trade war sparked by U.S. president Donald Trump’s volley of tariffs on goods entering the U.S. from China, Canada and Mexico. The tariffs, due to come into effect Tuesday morning, have also hit global stock markets, with investors balking at the prospect of tighter trading conditions. “A tidal wave of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) has been unleashed across the cryptocurrency market after U.S. president Donald Trump’s Friday tariff announcement,” Petr Kozyakov, chief executive crypto payment platform Mercuryo, said in emailed comments. “The prospect of prolonged higher interest rates has rattled all global markets. While bitcoin has dropped below the $100,000 mark the King of Crypto is once again proving itself to be in a class of its own in marked contrast to altcoins bleeding dark red across the board.” Bitcoin plummeted overnight to just over $91,000, down almost 10% at its lowest, before rebounding to around $95,000. Other major cryptocurrencies have seen far steeper declines, with ethereum down around 20% before recovering slightly and Ripple's XRP and ethereum rival cardano trading around similar levels. Solana, ethereum's biggest rival, has fared better, off by just 6% and exacerbating fears among ethereum holders that it could seize the altcoin crown. However, crypto traders have cheered analysis from Bitwise's investment guru Jeff Park, posted to X, who has outlined his thesis on why the coming trade war could be good for bitcoin. “Tariffs might be just a temporary tool, but the permanent conclusion is that bitcoin is not only going higher—but faster,” Park wrote, adding: “While both sides of the trade imbalance equation will want bitcoin for two different reasons, the end result is the same: higher, violently faster—for we are at war.” Wall Street giants, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, have leaned into bitcoin and crypto over the last year with a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) helping to normalize bitcoin and crypto among the financial establishment. Powell’s comments mark a major shift in sentiment under Trump from the previous Biden administration that was hostile toward crypto. Under Biden, bitcoin and crypto companies complained of an unofficial policy to “debank” them, cutting off basic financial services and making it impossible to operate—which became known as “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” a reference to a previous U.S. government policy to cut off industries believed to be at high risk of fraud and money laundering. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, topping $100,000 per bitcoin and driving ... [+] the crypto market to around $4 trillion as Donald Trump bets on bitcoin and crypto. Trump’s adoption of bitcoin and crypto—starting with his non-fungible token (NFT) collections, growing to support for a U.S. bitcoin national stockpile and culminating with the launch of a controversial Trump-branded memecoin—has led to regulators and government agencies reversing their opposition to the technology. Meanwhile, Trump has followed through with his campaign promise to put steep tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, and China, setting the stage for a trade war that could spread around the world. Trump’s executive order will impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, with a 10% tariff on Canadian energy and oil, and an additional 10% tariff on China, due to go into effect on Tuesday morning. “Gold, silver, bitcoin may crash,” Robert Kiyosaki, investor and author of advice book Rich Dad Poor Dad, posted to X, pointing to Trump’s tariffs as the catalyst. “Good. Will buy more after prices crash. Real problem is debt, which will only get worse. Crashes mean assets are on sale. Time to get richer.” One Community. Many Voices.

The 72-year-old debated devoting her time to crafting and doting over her grandkids and even gave full-time retirement a try. But she soon realized her Social Security checks, which were smaller than her peers' due to time she spent out of the workforce while raising children, wouldn't be enough to cover travel or rising insurance costs on top of basic needs. Now, the Central Florida resident works part time as a remote contracting agent in local government. While she sometimes has to miss out on plans with fully retired friends, she said, continuing to work has kept her budget sound and her mind active. "It's just getting very hard to make ends meet," Wetherington said. "The way the world is right now, everything's going up, up, up." Wetherington is part of a growing body of Americans staying in the workforce past 65, once a traditional marker for retirement. This trend has buoyed the national labor market after years defined by pandemic-induced worker shortages and high quitting rates. It's also changed the financial outlook for those who remain employed in some capacity, whether for personal satisfaction or monetary need. This trend should be more apparent than ever in 2025, when more Americans are expected to turn 65 than in any past year, according to a widely read study from the Alliance for Lifetime Income. It dubbed a multiyear period in the late 2020s as the "Peak 65 zone." The number of employed Americans 65 and older ballooned more than 33% between 2015 and 2024, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By comparison, the labor force for all workers 16 or older has increased less than 9% during the same time period. That growth has meant workers ages 65 and older accounted for 7% of the total workforce in 2024. That share is up from around 5.7% a decade ago. "It's really hard for many employers in many sectors to fill key workforce needs right now," said Jim Malatras, strategy chief at FedCap, a nonprofit that helps train and place people in jobs. Tapping this age group "can help build key capacity where it's desperately needed." While the swelling number of workers in this age bracket — more than 11 million in 2024 — has gained attention in recent years, the reasons for this outsized growth date back decades. Chief among the drivers is the fact that America's population is aging, according to Laura Quinby, an associate director at Boston College's Center for Retirement Research. But structural shifts in the retirement system have also encouraged working later in life, Quinby said. The transition in the private sector from employer-funded pensions to 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans created a need for many workers to remain employed longer. Social Security reforms in the 1980s pushed the program's "full retirement age" from 65 to 67. "People really do use the Social Security full retirement age as an anchor in terms of when they should retire and claim benefits," Quinby said. "That shift triggered a trend in people working longer." Longer life spans have pushed a growing chorus of voices to call for the age of retirement to move back even further, especially as financial uncertainties swirl around Social Security. BlackRock Chair Larry Fink, for instance, said in an annual letter that it's "a bit crazy" that the expectation of retiring at 65 "originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire." Yet there are vastly different reasons and experiences for people of retirement age to continue working in some capacity, said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of The New School's Retirement Equity Lab. Some do retire, and some continue to work in jobs that they love out of passion alone. But she said about two-thirds of those still working do it "because they have to." They can be in jobs with high physical or mental requirements, she said, but they see few alternatives, given that their Social Security checks can't sustain them. "I call it the tale of two retirements," Ghilarducci said. Employers of all kinds have tried to win and retain this growing base of talent. Booking.com parent Booking Holdings offers 10 days off annually for so-called grandparent leave, which is separate from time offered to new parents and other paid days off. Grocery store chain Wegmans has a section of its part-time jobs page specifically targeted to seniors, advertising the opportunity to stay active and earn income during retirement. Retirement-age workers can be seen working in gift shops or greeting restaurant guests for Xanterra, a travel company that owns properties in and around national parks. The company has a program called Helping Hands, which allows Xanterra to staff up during the peak tourist season by offering gigs that typically last a month and a half with 30-hour workweeks. "The retirement community, or that older workforce, is really an integral part of our overall workforce planning strategy," said Shannon Dierenbach, Xanterra's human resources chief. "They certainly bring a level of expertise, wisdom, life skills, perspective that really enhances the overall experience." Despite these anecdotes, advocates say a pervasive culture of ageism has continued to hurt these Americans in the workforce. "They're like vintage cars to us," said FedCap's Malatras. "They're built to last, they're full of value, but they're treated often like high-mileage Pintos, and they don't really have an opportunity to serve anymore." Employers hoping to better advertise to this community should look at job descriptions and pictures on their jobs pages to ensure there aren't any subtle signs they favor younger applicants, according to Heather Tinsley-Fix, senior advisor for employer engagement at AARP. She often encourages employers looking for older workers to sign AARP's pledge, in which businesses commit to measures supporting age equality. Removing college degree requirements can also help gain the attention of this pool, she said, given that a smaller share completed higher education compared with younger generations. Working from home is a key component of flexibility that these older workers may need, Tinsley-Fix said. Part of Tinsley-Fix's argument for employers is the impending "tsunami" of retirements expected within the next decade. If companies don't tap into groups they previously overlooked, she warned, they'll struggle to stay at full staffing, as not enough people enter the workforce each year to replace those who left. Her pitch isn't all doom-and-gloom, however. Tinsley-Fix said there's a silver lining: These workers tend to excel at soft skills and can provide mentorship to younger staffers. At Xanterra's sites, for example, retirement-age workers interact particularly well with customers and stay calm under pressure, Dierenbach said. "People talk about all kinds of spillover dividends from having older workers on their teams," Tinsley-Fix said. "They really benefit from having those folks." Those who remain employed do so for a variety of reasons. Multiple workers from this age group told CNBC that no matter the initial rationale — whether financial needs or personal preference — that got them to stay or return to the workforce, they've benefited physically and mentally. "It was the best thing that ever happened to me," said Shari Nelson, who began working for nonprofit Vantage Aging through its government-supported job placement program and was hired to stay on after completing it. The Ohio resident, who works part-time, said the paycheck allows her the financial security to be the kind of grandmother past generations in her family have been. Nelson's role was previously full-time, but Vantage broke it up into two positions with fewer hours to better accommodate older workers. Nonprofits were the most popular industry for workers in this age bracket at the end of 2024, with more than 1 out of every 12 in the sector, according to data from payroll platform Gusto. Among the small businesses using Gusto, the firm found the share of workers 65 or older has surged more than 50% since January 2019. Government is another popular area, according to Gusto. That's where Florida resident Anne Sallee, who was once a public official, found herself after she decided a full retirement wasn't for her. Sallee, who had a long career as a paralegal and now works as an economic development coordinator, said the return to in-person office work was a "shock" after more than a decade away. However, she said the personal benefits of having deadlines and a routine, as well as a passion for the role, keep her coming back. "I don't enjoy not having things I have to do," Sallee said. "I never envisioned the 'sit on the beach with your feet up and a cocktail' kind of lifestyle." Still, Sallee said she's taken some liberties that she may not have early in her career or when starting a new position. For instance, the 68-year-old avoids working overtime and takes a three-week vacation annually. "If that ever becomes a problem," she said of her yearly stretch of time off, "the vacation will take priority." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now. A notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China’s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market’s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare.

For example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company’s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.

Title: After DEI, the next frontier is ESG

DEI is hiding in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and must be exposed and eliminated. DEI is on its way out, but there is a fetid, hidden cavern where it still thrives unmolested: ESG. Among other things, ESG is a system that assesses and regulates a company's "sustainability", ethics and practices. The Environmental aspect of a company rates and evaluates their levels of pollution, energy and water usage, waste disposal, and greenhouse gas emissions to discern the alleged impact on the environment. This assumes, of course, a deleterious effect on the environment, which cannot be proved. The planet has a way of cleaning itself up. It is within the Social aspect of ESG where the DEI may still hide. That area addresses the relationships between its employees and executives with DEI at the core. The Social aspects also include employee health and safety, customer satisfaction, and (take note) "community engagement", the latter being another way to inject DEI. You can hide an awful lot of DEI in "customer satisfaction" and "community engagement." The Governance aspect of ESG is yet another hiding place for DEI: It monitors and rates an organization's leadership and pay, inner workings, and how shareholders are treated and managed. DEI can invade the "leadership" aspect as well. Why ESG at all? Some investors want to know if a company is responsibly "green" and if they are good stewards and managers of the company. And some investors know that the greener and more woke a company is, the less bang for their buck they will get for that investment. Woke is not dead yet and ESG is a good cave for DEI to hide in until Trump blows over – or so they think. The ADF, Alliance Defending Freedom knows how harmful ESG is. Here is what they think: Activists are using ESG policies as a cudgel to try to force companies to bend to the will of their political causes. As Heritage Action explains, ESG is being used to “punish” American energy and advance a “‘woke’ cultural agenda … from the boardroom down to the factory floor. This agenda is being pushed by green activists, woke culture warriors, global elites, and the big businesses they control. Over the past two decades, companies all over the world have started abiding by the demands imposed on them by ESG. In fact, more than 90 percent of S&P 500 companies have adopted practices or changed their business policies due to ESG, as well as about 70 percent of Russell 1000 companies. But now Americans are waking up to the danger ESG policies pose. A growing number of individuals, groups, and companies are paving an alternative path forward for business. Shoving progressive DEI, ESG, and other woke policies down American throats is nothing new to the hard Left. Take a moment to view this one-minute video titled "ESG hurts" by Heritage Action For America. It's an eye opener, from the "ESG hurts" website: If a company decides not to adopt ESG policies, it risks being de-platformed. So what does adopting ESG policies actually look like? First, if a company wants to boost its environmental score, it needs to go green. Facing pressure from investors, banks, and shareholders, companies are rushing to appear as if they’re doing their part to save the planet. This includes creating policies that appear to address climate change—prioritizing wind and solar energy, limiting waste and water usage, and combating pollution. Second, in order to appear more socially conscious—the “S” in ESG—companies are coerced into educating their employees on critical race theory, supporting radical gender ideology, and adopting pro-abortion policies. The hope is that if a company can prove that it emphasizes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace, or that it provides travel coverage for employees to access abortions out of state, it will appear more valuable to investors, and hopefully major banking institutions will grant them bigger loans. How a company is ESG-rated on their DEI program, for example, can determine monetary compensation of top executives. If a company shows a high Social (DEI) rating, more wokesters, minorities, and gays can be represented in the highest positions of the company even though they may not be qualified. Vivek Ramaswamy, author of Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam and the founder of Strive, said about ESG: “BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard are using the capital of their clients—everyday Americans—to advocate for policies most of them probably don’t agree with.” Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican who represents Arkansas, the home state of retail giant Walmart, has a few choice words about ESG: Climate Action 100+ is an elite group of the most powerful ESG investors in America, including competitors BlackRock and JP Morgan. This cartel of competing investment firms actively targets less powerful companies and coerces them into lowering their carbon footprint... This may constitute what is called a “spoke and hub conspiracy.”… ESG is simply bad for working Americans. Underperforming ESG-compliant companies and under-invested fossil fuel companies alike are forced to lay off workers or scale back planned hiring because of ESG. Similarly, companies are forced to slow or freeze wage increases, hurting employed workers. Climate Action 100+ has as part of its policy to "… seek to ensure equality, diversity and inclusion are reflected in the composition of the Steering Committee." ESG is a major DEI hiding place. We Americans hate DEI so much that Donald Trump made it a focus for elimination. He should do the same with ESG. There is no place in a capitalist economy for climate craziness, racist DEI policies, or interference by culture into business, unless the business invites it – at their own risk. The business of business should be business. Period. Image: Pexels // CCO public domain DEI is hiding in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and must be exposed and eliminated.

Title: Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST): Among the Best Alcohol Stocks to Buy According to Analysts

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Alcohol Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) stands against the other alcohol stocks. An analysis by Goldman Sachs has revealed that beer and spirits volumes in the American market have shown little correlation with economic growth. This is because beer and spirits are often seen as affordable luxuries or even staples. Liquor tends to enjoy stable sales even when general consumer spending takes a hit elsewhere, while there have also been times when alcohol sales even increase during economic downturns, as they did during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Great Recession of 2008-09. READ ALSO: 10 Best Liquor Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers However, things haven’t been exactly easy for the alcohol sector lately, especially after the recent report from the U.S. Surgeon General claimed that alcohol consumption in the country is directly linked to approximately 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 deaths annually. The report has proposed to put cancer warning labels on alcoholic beverages, signaling a shift toward more aggressive tobacco-style regulation for the sector if adopted. The proposition, if enacted, could seriously hurt sales for a sector that is already struggling with a pullback in drinking by younger consumers. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, America’s per capita annual consumption of alcohol in 2022 was 2.5 gallons, down from 3.28 gallons in the early 1980s. The growing popularity of low-and no-alcohol products, rising prevalence of cannabis use, and anti-obesity drugs picking up steam certainly haven’t helped either. Another looming threat for the American liquor industry is that of tariffs. The European Union is due to reimpose its retaliatory tariff on American whiskey in late March, but at a higher rate of 50%. Over the last two years, American whiskey exports to the EU have surged by more than 60%, and total US spirits exports grew to a record high of $2.2 billion in 2023. But this success story could face a devastating turn unless President Trump's administration can swiftly negotiate a prolonged suspension or permanent removal of the tariff. However, amidst the sharp decline in sales following the pandemic, one category that could be a bright spot for the struggling booze industry is that of spirit-based RTD’s, despite the fall in the overall spirits segment. Americans consumed over 62 million cases of ready-to-drink spirits in 2023, up almost 25% from 2022, making it the second-largest spirit category by volume, right behind vodka. A plethora of new brands have popped up in the market over the last few years, offering canned versions of many bar classics, including Negroni, Daiquiri, and even the good ol’ Jack & Coke. The alcohol sector also seems to be responding adequately to the evolving consumer trends by investing heavily in a wide range of low- and no-alcohol beverages. The strategy seems to be paying off, as according to Nielsen, non-alcoholic beer, wine, and spirits collectively surpassed $565 million in sales in 2023, up 35% from the year before. Sales of Guinness 0.0, the zero-alcohol version of the highly beloved Irish stout, surged by nearly 50% between February 2023 and February 2024, putting it among the Best Selling Non Alcoholic Beers in the US. Nearly every major industry player has come up with No-Lo versions of their highly acclaimed brands, making sure they don’t miss out on their share of a market that is becoming more and more established every day. To collect data for this article, we examined all the companies in the alcohol sector that are listed on NASDAQ and NYSE and then compiled a list of the stocks with the highest upside potential according to Wall Street analysts, as of January 27, 2024. Following are the Best Alcohol Stocks According to Analysts. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A shelf filled with a variety of bottles of energy drinks, juices, and sodas in a convenience store. Stock Upside Potential: 18.43% Next on our list of the Best Alcohol Stocks is one of the biggest names in the global energy drinks market, Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), known for brands like Monster Energy, Relentless, and Burn. The beverage giant also forayed into the alcohol sector in 2022 when it acquired the CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective in a deal worth $330 million. The acquisition gave Monster ownership of CANarchy’s craft breweries, which now operate under the name Monster Brewing Co. Shares of MNST have gained over 46% over the last 5 years, with analysts predicting further gains in the future. A notable aspect of Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) is its strategic partnership with Coca-Cola, which has owned an approximate 16.7% stake in the energy drinks company since 2015. This gives Monster access to Coca-Cola's vast global distribution network and provides it a competitive edge in international markets. Monster Energy Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has recently been facing challenges in the domestic market, as the energy drinks market in the US continues to struggle. In Q3 of 2024, the company management also pointed to ‘excess inventory levels’ of its Alcohol Brands segment, suggesting slower sales of those products than expected. However, despite these challenges, Monster has managed to outperform its competitors and improve its market share in the US market both in volume and dollar terms, indicating that the company’s brand strength and aggressive marketing strategies are effective in maintaining its competitive edge. Monster Energy Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)’s globalization strategy also seems to be paying off as international sales now account for approximately 40% of its total revenue, reducing the company’s reliance on the tough domestic market. The international emerging markets are particularly attractive for Monster. As disposable incomes rise in these regions and Western consumer trends gain popularity, the demand for energy drinks is likely to go up. However, such aggressive geographical diversification carries its own risks and the energy drinks giant took a significant revenue hit from the ongoing hyperinflation in Argentina in Q3 2024. Overall MNST ranks 7th on our list of the best alcohol stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential for MNST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MNST but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Defensive Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best defensive stocks to buy right now. A notable event influencing current market sentiment is the recent selloff in technology stocks, primarily driven by speculations surrounding China’s DeepSeek AI model. This incident has underscored the market’s fragility, with key indicators pointing to potential instability. For instance, heavy betting on US tech stocks and rising bond yields have made equities less appealing compared to government debts, challenging the equity risk premium. In this context, the importance of defensive stocks becomes increasingly evident. Defensive stocks, also known as non-cyclical stocks, are those that provide consistent dividends and stable earnings regardless of the state of the overall market. They are typically found in sectors such as utilities, consumer staples, and healthcare. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. For example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company’s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.

For this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. Apple has a history of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the latest quarter, the company returned $30 billion to shareholders. The current annual dividend stands at $0.92 per share, yielding approximately 0.39%. Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) substantial cash reserves, totaling $68 billion as of June 2024, support its capacity to maintain and potentially increase these returns. Apple’s diversified product portfolio and strong brand loyalty contribute to its resilience during economic downturns. The significant growth in its services segment, which boasts higher margins, enhances revenue stability. Overall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of best defensive stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: This 13% Dividend Is Getting A Makeover. Time To Buy?

MILAN, ITALY - APRIL 10: The logo of American multi-national investment company BlackRock is ... [+] pictured (Photo by Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images) BlackRock is making changes to some of its highest-yielding funds. Today we’re going to zero in on a 13%-yielder that’s at the center of the action: the tech-focused BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ). Yes, the fund focused on tech. So the pullback in American AI stocks on news that Chinese AI chatbot DeepSeek, which was launched earlier this month, can rival the latest version of Open AI’s ChatGPT, factors in here, too. BIGZ is a closed-end fund with nearly $2 billion in assets under management — enormous for a CEF (The “BIG” is right in the ticker, after all). So any changes to BIGZ are worth watching, especially when, as is the case now, those changes (including a big share-buyback program) are partly a response to activist action, both around the fund’s sponsor, BlackRock, and the CEF industry as a whole. Let’s dive into exactly what’s going on here. The best place to start, actually, is with BlackRock’s other two big tech CEFs, the 8.2%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST) and the BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), another 13% yielder. Unlike BIGZ, these funds aren’t changing, for reasons that should be clear in a bit. These funds’ portfolios overlap, but they’ve recently taken different paths. BSTZ, for its part, has been focusing more on private tech firms, as well as fast-growing public companies. Nvidia (NVDA), its largest holding, and Astera Labs (ALAB), are examples of the latter. Both are at the heart of AI’s continued growth. Even with the DeepSeek news on Monday, and the pressure it put on American AI stocks, these two have still posted strong gains, up 31% and 34%, respectively, since Astera’s IPO in March 2024. However, as the developments around DeepSeek showed us, there’s still a lot of uncertainty around AI. That’s why BSTZ’s sister fund, BST, bolsters its NVIDIA position with mature tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN), all top-10 holdings. As a result, BST has been less volatile in the past year, on the basis of the performance of both its underlying portfolio (a.k.a. its net asset value, or NAV), and its market price (both including dividends). (Since CEFs have fixed share counts, there is often a difference between the market price and NAV returns, with the market price often discounted). But BSTZ (in purple below) put up a stronger market price–based total return as investors got aggressive about tech after the 2022 rout. Total Returns This, by the way, is exactly why we hold this duo — to get tech exposure and use BST’s large cap focus to temper our volatility. That’s worked well, with BST and BSTZ delivering us a 24% average return between them in the last year, well above the S&P 500’s 16% return, with a big slice of that in cash, thanks to their 10.5% average yield. So where does BIGZ fit in here? It has some investments in private firms, similar to BSTZ and, to a lesser extent, BST. But the key difference is that BIGZ has major holdings a little outside tech, with military contractor Axon Enterprise (AXON), data-center servicer Vertiv Holdings (VRT) and plumbing/HVAC specialist Comfort Systems USA (FIX) being its biggest positions. As you can see, the focus here is on small firms that are growing fast. This should mean fast returns for BIGZ — but that’s not what we’ve seen. Check its performance based on the latest numbers for its total NAV return (or, again, the return of its underlying portfolio, including dividends). BIGZ Lags As you can see, it was much weaker than those of the other two CEFs. This lag was unacceptable, as activists reminded BlackRock, which responded by shaking up BIGZ in several ways. For one, BIGZ will get a new management team and a new mandate tightening its focus on tech. You can read more about those changes here. BlackRock is also bringing in a buyback program under which shareholders can tender shares of BIGZ for 99.5% of the fund’s NAV per share. The company is offering this for half of the total number of shares outstanding, and the stop and start dates haven’t been announced yet. That’s a massive program that should help support BIGZ’s market price. With a 9.1% discount to NAV, investors can buy BIGZ at 90.9 cents on the dollar and sell at 99.5 cents on the dollar, a 9.5% gain separate from BIGZ’s market performance. The risk here is that, if BIGZ’s NAV drops before an investor can redeem their shares, they might end up redeeming them for less. But in that case, they could simply ignore the redemption and keep collecting BIGZ’s 13% dividend—provided the fund’s new management keeps earning enough profits to maintain that payout.

For example, companies that produce or distribute essential goods like food, beverages, and hygiene products tend to maintain steady cash flow and predictable earnings during both strong and weak economies. Dividends play a crucial role in investment strategies, offering both immediate income and long-term financial benefits. They represent a portion of a company’s earnings distributed to shareholders, typically on a quarterly basis. Historically, dividends have been a substantial component of total returns in the stock market. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, since 1936, dividends have accounted for more than one-third of the total equity return of the S&P 500, with capital appreciation making up the other two-thirds.

Title: Trump’s $10 Trillion Crypto Bet: Stablecoins To Replace Eurodollars?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/boazsobrado/2025/02/01/trumps-10-trillion-opportunity-stablecoins-to-replace-eurodollars/

PALM BEACH, FLORIDA - DECEMBER 16: SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son delivers remarks alongside U.S. ... [+] President-elect Donald Trump and Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce, Cantor Fitzgerald Chairman and CEO Howard Lutnick (L) at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort on December 16, 2024 in Palm Beach, Florida. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) "I think over the next, call it 20ish years, probably the entire eurodollar market is moving to stablecoins," predicts Austin Campbell, professor at NYU's Stern School of Business and CEO of WSPN USA. It's a bold claim – suggesting that a $210 billion market could absorb a system 50 times its size. Yet the prediction becomes more plausible when you understand how the offshore dollar market evolved, and why stablecoins represent its natural digital successor. The modern financial system runs on a form of dollars that most Americans have never heard of. Eurodollars – dollar deposits held outside the U.S. banking system – represent between $10-13 trillion in value. Born in the 1950s as a way for Soviet banks to hold dollars beyond U.S. reach, they grew into the backbone of international finance. Today, they're how Japanese manufacturers pay for Indonesian raw materials and how European banks fund American mortgages. This massive market emerged not through design but necessity. When Cold War politics made direct dollar holdings risky for Soviet institutions, they began keeping dollar deposits in European banks. These banks realized they could lend these dollars without maintaining the same reserves U.S. banks required, creating a more efficient (if less regulated) dollar funding market. Most Americans have never interacted with a stablecoin or a eurodollar, and many struggle to understand their value as they are well served by their domestic banking system. But Americans aren’t the only users of US dollars. A large percentage of dollars serve users outside America. Of the $2.3 trillion in physical U.S. banknotes, the Federal Reserve estimates that 40-75% circulate abroad. Traditional bank deposits show a similar pattern – the $18 trillion in U.S. domestic deposits is comparable to the size of the $10-13 trillion Eurodollar market. These numbers reveal a crucial reality: trillions of dollars already sit outside the U.S. banking system, held by individuals and businesses who need dollars but lack access to American banks. Stablecoins aren't creating this demand for offshore dollars – they're simply providing a more efficient solution for it. Originally stablecoins emerged as digital casino chips for crypto speculators. Just as a casino allows you to exchange dollars for chips that can be used throughout their property, stablecoins let you convert traditional dollars into digital tokens usable across the entire internet. And just like casino chips, their value is backed by real dollars held in reserve – at least in theory. The story of stablecoins can't be told without mentioning Tether (USDT), which remains the largest stablecoin with a market cap of over $100 billion. Founded in 2014 to solve crypto traders' need for a stable trading instrument, Tether's history reads like a thriller. Early controversies about its reserves – which once included commercial paper and mysterious "other investments" – gave way to increased transparency following regulatory scrutiny. Today, Tether primarily backs its tokens with U.S. Treasuries, managed by Cantor Fitzgerald under CEO Howard Lutnick (pictured above) – who is set to serve as Secretary of Commerce. This institutional evolution mirrors the broader transformation of the stablecoin industry from crypto frontier to mainstream finance. Newer entrants like Circle's USDC have taken a more regulated approach from the start. Circle's partnership with BlackRock for reserve management signals the institutionalization of the sector. Yet it is still early days for stablecoins. As analyst Simon Taylor explains, "We're in the dial-up era of Stablecoins, so they're still janky, and connecting is slow and painful. In time, Stablecoins will create an abstraction layer above existing payment rails, just as the Internet did over the telcos." Nevertheless, Taylor's analysis reveals why stablecoins aren't just cheaper – they're fundamentally better infrastructure. Traditional international payments involve a complex web of correspondent banks, SWIFT messages, multiple compliance checks, and days of settlement time. The genius of stablecoins lies in collapsing this complexity into a single layer. A stablecoin transfer is more akin to handing someone cash than initiating a bank wire – but it can happen instantly across borders. Recent research from Castle Island Ventures and Visa reveals the scale of adoption already underway. Stablecoin transaction volumes were estimated at $450 billion per month—roughly half of the just over $1 trillion that Visa processes monthly. Adoption is growing fastest in emerging markets. The study found that 47% of users in developing economies primarily use stablecoins for dollar savings, while 43% cite currency conversion as their main goal. This adoption isn't merely speculative. In Nigeria, where foreign exchange shortages are chronic, stablecoins have become crucial for international trade. As Yellow Card, Africa's largest stablecoin platform notes, "70% of African countries have a FX shortage that has been declared a crisis." The latest evolution comes from yield-bearing variants such as Mountain Protocol. Just as Eurodollar deposits typically offered higher interest rates than domestic U.S. deposits, new stablecoins are finding ways to pass along the yields from their Treasury holdings to users. This development suggests how stablecoins might eventually compete with traditional bank deposits. In his inauguration speech, Donald Trump argued for the creation of an “External Revenue Service” to collect revenue from other countries. Given that stablecoin advocate Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick will be involved in its creation, perhaps the president already had the shift from Eurodollars to stablecoins in mind. The transition from Eurodollars to stablecoins could mark a significant shift in America's global financial power. Eurodollars emerged during the Cold War, when U.S. policymakers saw value in allowing European banks to create dollar liquidity beyond American shores. Today's geopolitical reality is markedly different. In an era of great power competition and economic warfare, the diffuse Eurodollar system may have outlived its strategic utility. Stablecoins offer Washington a chance to recentralize control over offshore dollars. When foreign banks create Eurodollars, they share in the profits of dollar dominance. In contrast, major stablecoin issuers back their tokens primarily with U.S. Treasuries, directly funding American government debt. This shift would align with the more zero-sum view of international relations championed by figures like President Trump, concentrating the benefits of dollar dominance within U.S. borders. The winners in this transition would be concentrated in America: the U.S. Treasury would see increased demand for its debt, while U.S.-based stablecoin issuers would become the new gatekeepers of global dollar liquidity. Users in emerging markets would gain better access to dollars, potentially accelerating global dollarization. The losers would be equally clear: non-U.S. banks would see their Eurodollar business evaporate, while weak local currencies would face even steeper competition from digital dollars. Traditional payment intermediaries would find their business models undermined by more efficient stablecoin rails. Can stablecoins really absorb the $10 trillion Eurodollar market? The better question might be: why wouldn't they? They offer the same basic service – dollar exposure outside traditional U.S. banking – with added benefits of programmability, transparency, and efficiency. The transition won't happen overnight, but as Campbell suggests, the direction seems clear. Just as Eurodollars emerged to meet the 20th century's need for efficient dollar funding, stablecoins are evolving to serve the digital economy's demand for programmable, borderless dollars. The real question isn't whether digital dollars will become ubiquitous, but whether the U.S. will embrace and shape this transition to maintain its financial advantages in the digital age.

Title: NatWest finalises £450m bonus pot as return to private ownership looms

The bank's annual results will come with the government on the brink of no longer being its single-biggest shareholder after nearly 17 years, Sky News can reveal. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 1 February 2025 11:40, UK NatWest Group is finalising plans to pay out close to £450m in bonuses for last year as it prepares for a return to full private ownership nearly 17 years after its bailout. Sky News has learnt that the bank's remuneration committee is close to signing off the bonus pool ahead of its annual results announcement later this month. The figure of roughly £450m will be about 25% higher than last year's bonus pot of £356m, reflecting NatWest's sharply improved performance in 2024, according to City sources. Shares in the bank, which at one point was more than 80%-owned by British taxpayers, have nearly doubled over the last 12 months. The Treasury has been rapidly reducing its stake in NatWest, with it now standing at just under 8%. This weekend, Sky News can also reveal that the state will cease to become the company's single-biggest shareholder within a matter of weeks, based on the current pace of the government's trading plan, which drip-feeds stock into the market. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, holds a stake in NatWest of roughly 6%, meaning it could replace the Treasury as NatWest's biggest investor as early as this month. Trump latest: EU would respond 'within an hour' to Trump tariffs, as US president to call Xi amid trade war Treasury Committee demands HMRC answers on sanctions regime after Sky News investigation Money blog: Gordon Ramsay has opened the highest restaurant in London - take a look inside (and see how much it costs) That would represent another significant milestone for NatWest's board, chaired by Rick Haythornthwaite. In October, the bank raised its profit outlook after posting a 26% rise in third-quarter income. After its shares closed at 433.1p on Friday afternoon, it now has a market capitalisation of close to £35bn. Last year, Sky News revealed that NatWest was planning to hand its chief executive a potential multimillion pound pay boost as it returns to full private ownership. Lena Wilson, the chair of the bank's remuneration committee has been consulting leading institutional shareholders about an overhaul of its boardroom pay policy, with the proposals to be put to a vote at its spring AGM. Under the plans, Paul Thwaite, who took over as the bank's interim chief executive in July 2023 before being handed the role on a permanent basis in February, would be in line for an increase in his maximum annual bonus from 100% of his base salary to 150%. NatWest also intends to replace its restricted share plan (RSP) for Mr Thwaite, which awarded him stock worth a maximum of 150% of his salary, with a performance share plan (PSP) which could pay him up to three times his basic pay each year. Assuming his salary of just under £1.2m remains unchanged, that would mean him being in line for a maximum reward package - excluding pension contributions and other items - of about £6.6m, up from roughly £4.2m today. The prospective increase would bring Mr Thwaite's compensation more closely into line with peers including Charlie Nunn at Lloyds Banking Group and CS Venkatakrishnan at Barclays - who himself is expected to see his annual pay capped at just over £14m under a new policy. Mr Thwaite replaced Dame Alison Rose after she was forced to step down over the debanking row involving Nigel Farage, the Reform Party leader. Leading City investors who have been part of the consultation process are said to be overwhelmingly supportive of the pay overhaul. Follow our channel and never miss an update. During its previous incarnation as Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank encountered annual controversy over its remuneration - for its chief executives and the wider workforce. In the immediate aftermath of its £45.5bn rescue by taxpayers during the financial crisis of 2008, the pension package of Fred Goodwin, RBS's former chief, and bonuses awarded to his successor, Stephen Hester, became political headaches for the governments of Gordon Brown and David Cameron. In recent years, however, such conflagrations have been defused by a combination of pay restraint and improved performance. Even after the recent recovery in its valuation, taxpayers will see a loss running to billions of pounds from NatWest's emergency bailout. A NatWest Group spokesperson declined to comment.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Long Term Low Risk Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) stands against the other long term low risk stocks. As the DeepSeek craze ignites a sell-off in the tech sector, investors are weighing the implications of the downturn in the long term. This is because the technology sector, particularly the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, has been a significant driver of market gains in the past few years. However, Bank of America strategists caution that these tech giants may face challenges ahead, dubbing them the "Lagnificent 7" due to potential underperformance. Factors such as diminishing US exceptionalism, vast fiscal spending, high immigration, and the AI investment bubble are cited as contributing to this anticipated slowdown. The bank has advised investors to explore undervalued opportunities in sectors like Japanese and European banks, commodities, high-yield bonds, international stocks, and cyclical sectors, given expected rebounds in global manufacturing activity. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. There are also several long term and low risk equities trading on the US stock market that could provide investors with the hedge they need against volatile tech stocks. According to a report by news agency Reuters, looking ahead, investors are cautiously optimistic about 2025, anticipating gains fueled by a solid economy, moderating interest rates, and pro-growth policies from the incoming administration. The S&P 500 has experienced significant growth over the past two years, and corporate profits are projected to rise by over 10% in 2025. However, risks such as persistent inflation, potential policy shifts, and elevated stock valuations warrant careful consideration. Strategies may include diversifying portfolios, focusing on undervalued sectors, and closely monitoring economic indicators to navigate the evolving landscape.

The stock has declined in recent days after the firm posted fourth-quarter earnings, reporting earnings per share of $2.14 on sales of $6.5 billion, slightly below Wall Street's expectations of $2.16 per share, but sales exceeding the forecast of $6.4 billion. In Q3 2024, the firm achieved revenues of $5.8 billion, a 3% year-over-year increase, with non-GAAP core revenue growth of 0.5%.

Title: Eli Hewson of Inhaler: ‘There’s so much nepotism in every facet of life’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/2025/02/01/eli-hewson-of-inhaler-theres-so-much-nepotism-in-every-facet-of-life/
Time Published: 2025-02-01T05:20:00Z
Full Content:
When the four members of Inhaler walked in front of 80,000 people at Slane Castle in June 2023, they felt as if they’d tumbled down a rabbit hole and emerged blinking into a fantasy movie. “You can see how far back the hill goes, and you see the extent of people there. I remember turning to one of the guys and going, ‘What the f**k are we doing?’ And I remember being so nervous,” says Ryan McMahon, the drummer with the Dublin rock band. Eli Hewson, the group’s frontman, says: “I was expecting to get booed off the stage. Everyone was there for Harry Styles.” Seated beside him, Josh Jenkinson, who plays guitar, smiles and says that their friends and family were excited about Slane largely because it put Inhaler in the orbit of the former One Direction star, who was the day’s headliner. “All our girlfriends at the time were over the moon. It did genuinely feel we were in a scene from Lord of the Rings.” Styles was creating history as that rare pop star to headline the Co Meath venue. The day was equally significant for Inhaler, who confirmed their status as one of Ireland’s fast-rising major-label rock bands. Despite the jitters and concerns about being jeered into oblivion by the hordes of teenage girls, they are happy to report that the gig went fine. Two years later they are ready to take another leap forward with their glossy, crowd-pleasing third LP, Open Wide. It’s a slick, hook-filled affair that is brimming with easy-on-the-ear melodies (as in Eddie in the Darkness, the opening track), Coldplay-worthy “ooh ooh” choruses (Billy – Yeah Yeah Yeah) and finger-snapping grooves (the single Your House). It will appeal to all those Styles fans they won over at Slane – and even a few of those they didn’t. That’s partly thanks to the influence of the producer Kid Harpoon – Styles’s regular wingman in the recording studio – who encouraged Inhaler to push further and to connect with their inner pop stars. The other big draw is the charismatic presence of Hewson, who at moments sounds like a dead ringer for his father, Paul, known to some as Bono. Inhaler are understandably wary of coming across as some sort of novelty U2 offshoot: Baby Bono plus some pals from private school. (Three of Inhaler met at St Andrew’s College in Blackrock, one of Dublin’s most exclusive secondary schools.) Yet they are self-aware about their gilded backgrounds and understand the U2 factor is something they must negotiate. They can’t shut their eyes and hope it goes away. With or without them, people are going to draw a connection. “I always thought I was going to have a harder time than I actually did. My sister had a hard time,” the singer says about Eve Hewson, the actor. “There’s certain advantages to it.” You know, if you grow up in a house of music, you’re probably going to want to do music. Same if your dad back in the medieval ages was a blacksmith A famous father puts you in the spotlight, no question. “People coming for the first time to see you – you might sell a few more tickets in the beginning, or whatever. But it’s not going to make people come back,” says Hewson, a matey, down-to-earth 25-year-old who seems at pains not to project nepo-baby privilege. “You know what I mean? There is definitely a certain perception of you before people have heard you. So [you] kind of weigh it up. The other thing is that it’s not something we want to pretend isn’t happening. That would be silly.” On the other hand, Hewson doesn’t feel he’s playing life on easy mode by starting a band with friends. He has been surrounded by music his entire life: what’s so strange about wanting to pick up a guitar and sing? “It just makes me laugh. You know, if you grow up in a house of music, you’re probably going to want to do music. Same if your dad back in the medieval ages was a blacksmith. There’s so much nepotism in every facet of life.” Hewson shrugs, at pains to clarify that he isn’t complaining. “When it’s in the public eye ... you’re allowed give it a bit of scrutiny.” Of course, being a blacksmith and being the second-youngest child of Bono and Ali Hewson are two very different things. (That’s 18-year-old Hewson on the cover of U2’s 2017 LP Songs of Experience, as snapped by the music photographer Anton Corbijn). For one thing, people don’t spend all their time badmouthing blacksmiths on social media. With Bono it’s another story. For all his popularity, the U2 singer is also one of his generation’s most widely criticised rock stars – especially in Ireland. In the past 12 months alone the neotrad group Lankum have called him “Such a f****** West Brit” on stage in Dublin and Mary Coughlan has said she was “grossed out by the whole lot” of U2. How does Hewson feel about people continually taking potshots at his father? “I think I’m well used to it – like, I’ve seen it plenty. I’d just say get to know him first. That’s all I’ll say on it.” Inhaler look every centimetre the off-duty rock band sitting around a table in a hotel in South Dublin, a stone’s throw from their alma mater. Leather jackets, tight trousers, boho man jewellery, a tour manager who has ushered them to the venue straight from rehearsals: they tick all the boxes. Except one. Although their first two albums, It Won’t Always Be Like This and Cuts & Bruises, were well reviewed, they have none of the critical acclaim of fellow Dublin acts such as Lankum or Fontaines DC (whose 2018 show at the Tivoli Theatre, with The Murder Capital and Shame, they name as a life-changing gig for them). They radiate faint yet unmistakable traces of dorkiness – a trait they are happy to own. “We’ve always worn it on our sleeve when people meet us. It’s the same as when we do interviews and ... blah-lah ... we’re just, like, kind of dorks,” they say, speaking over one another. “I don’t think we’ve got to be conceptually cool. We’re just ourselves. We’re uncool sometimes.” Inhaler have also had to negotiate what might be called the “South Dublin” question. St Andrew’s is one of Ireland’s most expensive private schools. When you come from that background people make assumptions: that your life has been full of opportunity rather than adversity, that your tipple of choice is Heineken, that you have firm views on the state of the Leinster lineout. “It exists,” McMahon says of such inverse snobby. “But if you want to say that about one person ... No one says that about Radiohead or The Rolling Stones.” “It doesn’t matter,” Hewson adds. “But it wouldn’t be home without it.” Inhaler started when Hewson, McMahon and Robert Keating, their bassist, were at school in 2012. Three years later they met Jenkinson at a party. In their early years they were a “sh*tty metal band”, though they evolved into something more melodic when they discovered The Stone Roses – still one of their favourites. At this point it was decided that Hewson should take over from Keating as lead singer, which the retiring adolescent did with a degree of reluctance. (The name Inhaler comes from the fact that he had asthma in his teens.) “It was never a dream as a kid. I started singing out of necessity.” He adds, about overcoming shyness, “I’m definitely better than I was. I was bad a lot of the time ... It’s a miracle, really, to be honest.” With their first two albums they wrote songs largely so they would have material to perform live. The new LP is different as they went into the studio determined to grow as songwriters. That’s why they chose to work with Kid Harpoon. That was the least cool thing you could chose to do – ‘You’re in a band … It’s so lame’ The producer – real name Tom Hull – cracked the whip during recording sessions at RAK Studios in London (where The Pogues made Fairytale of New York). He didn’t hesitate to tell them if he felt a tune wasn’t cutting it. “Honesty is probably the most valuable thing in a studio setting from your producer,” Hewson says. “We had loads of songs that weren’t finished. We went to him hoping that he’d pull it together. And he was, like, ‘You’re not done’. So we had to go back and finish them. We actually found a different way of writing that was more effective.” It is fashionable to decry the death of the old-fashioned four-piece band. Guitar music has certainly become less culturally central – the reality is that the biggest event in rock this year will be the return of Oasis, a band who peaked in 1995, four years before Hewson was born. But Inhaler feel that is starting to change. Bands are back. “When we were in school it was all Ed Sheeran. No offence to him: we still love pop music. But I’m talking about bands. That was the least cool thing you could chose to do – ‘You’re in a band … It’s so lame’. Now you’ve got Sam Fender smashing it in the UK, Fontaines, Murder Capital, Last Dinner Party, Wunderhorse … There’s a lot of great music to listen to,” Hewson says. “I don’t know if that’s a result of the stagnant pop music we’ve heard ... It’s nice to hear something visceral. It feels more analogue-y than digital, which is refreshing. I’m happy about it.” A big summer awaits. Inhaler are touring Britain, the Americas and Australia. Hewson’s birthday coincides with one of Oasis’s Croke Park dates and he hopes to attend. (He knows Noel Gallagher a bit through his father.) Then there is a show at St Anne’s Park in Dublin – their biggest Irish headline concert to date, with a capacity of 20,000. “In the beginning we went to the UK and we gigged a lot there. We always felt we were missing home,” Hewson says. “It’s nice to be able to facilitate a gathering in your hometown. What an honour. We’ll do our best job. I think it will be great with the new music.” Open Wide is released on Friday, February 7th; Inhaler play St Anne’s Park, Dublin, on Friday, May 30th © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery Not every country’s financial market is suffering fallout from Donald Trump’s return to the White House — and money managers say relations with the U.S. are playing a growing role in deciding where to invest. As the likes of Colombia and Mexico are rattled by tariff fears, assets of nations seen as benefiting from close ties with the U.S. leader, like Argentina and Ecuador, are getting an extra lift. While that’s particularly true in Latin America, where most countries count the world’s largest economy as a key trade partner, the Trump "friend-or-foe” factor is impacting emerging-markets across the globe, from India to Vietnam. "Winners here are not the traditional ones that we’d think about — there’s a new set of countries that will emerge as winners,” Amer Bisat, a managing director and head of emerging markets fixed income at BlackRock, said at a recent industry panel. In today’s world, a country that "aligns itself politically to the U.S. ends up being the winner — and that becomes much more of a transactional relationship.” In a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.

Title: Trump Treasury Department Exits Global Climate Alliance Pushing Green Mandates on Financial Sector
URL: https://freebeacon.com/energy/trump-treasury-department-exits-global-climate-alliance-pushing-green-mandates-on-financial-sector/
Time Published: 2025-01-31T19:15:18Z

The Treasury Department withdrew the United States from a global climate alliance that was launched to push the financial sector to adopt green mandates. The so-called Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System was originally created to pressure banks and financial institutions to meet sweeping global climate targets, many of which have been set during United Nations summits. The Treasury Department said late Thursday that the alliance's mission doesn't align with the Trump administration's "priorities to grow the U.S. economy and American jobs." The announcement is part of the Trump administration's move to exit what it considers to be harmful global climate agreements. And it is the latest signal to the international community that the United States under Trump's leadership will seek to prioritize domestic energy production over commitments to bolster green energy and fight global warming. Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research, told the Washington Free Beacon that the withdrawal is a "major victory for consumers" and that the alliance "only existed to push a radical climate agenda onto taxpayers." The alliance's efforts, according to a review of its website and governing documents, fall in line with the broader green investing movement, which pushes financial institutions to divest from fossil fuel production and infrastructure and invest in green energy to stop climate change. "Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time, with impacts that are felt worldwide and necessitate urgent, coordinated action," the group states. The group is also one of the most high profile alliances of its kind worldwide—the alliance boasts 144 members across more than 90 countries, including the European Central Bank and Bank of England. The Biden administration had joined the alliance in February 2022. On his first day in office, President Donald Trump issued an executive action ordering the State Department to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accords. "President Trump is committed to pursuing an American First policy agenda," the State Department said in a subsequent internal memo confirming it had executed Trump's order. "The Paris Agreement prompted restrictions on America's ability to harvest vast natural resources and constraints on the American economy through oppressive domestic regulations." And the withdrawal comes two weeks after the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative—a private sector alliance whose mission largely mimicked that of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System—said it would suspend all operations. That decision was triggered after a number of the group's members, including trillion-dollar asset manager BlackRock, withdrew ahead of Trump's inauguration. "For too long ESG elites like BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink have been using political influence to manipulate federal agencies into pushing ESG on consumers and stunting the American economy," Hild, of Consumers’ Research, told the Free Beacon. "But thanks to President Trump's swift actions, the administration continues to remove the rot that is ESG from American institutions," he continued. "There is still more work to be done, and Consumers' Research remains committed to holding institutions accountable if they continue their senseless devotion to destructive ideological fads like ESG at the expense of taxpayers and consumers."

Title: Can We Still Solve Climate Change?

Tuesday, February 4, 2025 SAN FRANCISCO, California / APEX, North Carolina, Jan 31 2025 (IPS) - When it comes to climate change, the awful news has been coming thick and fast. We now know that in 2024, the Earth’s average temperature exceeded 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for the first time. Extreme weather seems to be multiplying, with shocking fires in Los Angeles and storms striking Europe and America’s east coast since the start of the year. U.S. President Donald Trump has announced his country will turn its back on the ambitious Paris Agreement adopted in 2015. Meanwhile, the United Nations’ latest annual summit—COP29 in Azerbaijan—ended in November with complaints it had done too little to change the narrative. Some even questioned whether the UN’s ongoing exertions were a waste of time, and whether annual global climate summits were still worth doing? Are things really so bad? Let’s break down the news piece-by-piece and look at each issue in turn. How bad is it that we have broken the 1.5C ceiling? It’s pretty bad. It means we can expect extreme weather like heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, and flooding to increase in frequency and severity. It’s also going to affect food production, harm many plant and animal species, and risk sending the world over several “tipping points”, such as faster melting of ice in the Arctic, Antarctic, and elsewhere, causing sea-level rise. If you don’t like that our weather is getting more extreme, then sadly it’s too late. We’ll all have to get used to it, and adapt accordingly. That said, it’s not all doom and gloom. There are some silver linings. First, the world has actually been doing a lot to fight back. Partly prompted by major international treaties like the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, countries have been actively finding ways to reduce emissions, such as investing in green technologies and working on new policies that affect pretty much everything we do. Whether it’s new energy efficiency programmes in our homes and offices, efforts to protect our forests, or the rise in hybrid and electric vehicles, a lot is happening. Perhaps the biggest transformation has been the growth of solar and wind power, which is now considerably cheaper and more efficient that earlier sources of electricity like coal or natural gas. The pay-off is clear, with countries like the UK, Sweden, and Denmark already cutting their greenhouse gas emissions in half since the 1990s. Another silver lining of our efforts to cut emissions is expert projections for temperature rise in the longer term. Before the Paris Agreement, some were predicting temperatures to go up by 4-6C by 2100, which would be catastrophic for humanity and the planet; an extinction event for modern civilization. Now, the estimates sit around 2-2.8C, depending on whether countries honour the goals they’ve set themselves. These numbers are still bad, but nowhere near as terrifying as they were. So yes, 1.5 is bad and we will need to redouble our efforts to make sure it doesn’t get much worse. But we shouldn’t give up hope just yet. What does President Trump’s decision to leave the Paris Agreement mean? No one can deny that U.S. leadership greatly helps our global efforts to combat climate change. Still, there are several reasons why we shouldn’t panic. First, as mentioned above, the world is already on a long-term path to cut emissions. The new U.S. administration may wish to “drill, baby, drill,” but renewables will continue to rise. Why? Because they’re cheaper than the alternatives. As an experienced business leader, President Trump knows as well as anyone that companies are motivated by profits. They will look for the most cost-effective energy option. In many cases, this will mean renewable energy. Secondly, even if the U.S. does leave Paris and change its domestic policies, there is an inertia in systems. The outgoing Biden administration, which had pledged $3 billion for the UN’s Green Climate Fund (GCF), has already handed over $2 billion. They’ve also spent much larger amounts on supporting the U.S. transition to a green economy. This is money the new President will not be able to take back. Plus, a country as big and powerful as America can’t turn its entire economy around overnight. For instance, during President Trump’s first term, emissions in the U.S. continued to fall, even if he himself did not support this. Thirdly, even American presidents aren’t all powerful. There are many other interests and alternative viewpoints in the U.S. Others who might disagree with President Trump will likely step up and try to fill the gap. For instance, business leader Michael Bloomberg has just announced that he will help cover U.S. financial obligations to the UN and its climate work. There is precedent for this, too. Back in the 2000s, a lot of progress was made on climate change at the state and city level throughout the U.S., even though President George W. Bush generally didn’t support it. Finally, there has been a shift in the centre of gravity when it comes to climate change. The U.S. remains important, but on climate change it matters less than it once did. Under Presidents Obama, Biden, and Trump himself, U.S. emissions have fallen. They now represent about 11% of the global total, down from 30% in 1970. These days, U.S. emissions are dwarfed by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa). These are the countries whose leadership will be needed in the decade to come. There are signs that big corporate players are also turning away from their climate pledges. For instance, Blackrock just left the Net Zero Asset Managers coalition. What does this mean? The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) was announced at COP26 in 2021. It brings together corporate leaders from the financial services sector to support the transition to an ambitious “net-zero” emissions economy. However, after the recent U.S. election, some big U.S. banks left the Net Zero Banking Alliance, which is part of GFANZ. Now, Blackrock has left a similar coalition for asset managers; which is also a part of GFANZ. This is not good news. It probably marks a symbolic victory for politicians who had been pressuring big corporate interests to step back from their climate pledges. In some ways, it mirrors the recent abandonment by several big American companies of their DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) programmes. At this stage, it is hard to know how much of a genuine impact this will have. For every company trying to appease the Trump administration by backtracking, it is likely there will also be those—like insurance companies—whose profits are being so badly impacted by climate change that they will be unlikely to change their positions. The latest UN climate summit brought no major breakthroughs but it did achieve some modest successes. Credit: Shutterstock. Was COP29 really a failure? No. Although the latest annual UN climate summit didn’t result in any big breakthroughs, it did achieve some modest successes. For instance, wealthy industrialized nations agreed to increase annual funding for developing countries from US$100 billion to US$300 billion annually by 2030. This is far less than the US$1.3 trillion many experts believe is needed to combat climate change, though that number was included as a goal for 2035. Although US$300 billion is an improvement on the previous amount, it’s not what developing countries were hoping for, which was closer to $500 billion by 2030. Other outcomes from COP29 include agreement on standards for carbon markets, which means carbon trading is likely to increase and new finances might flow to the Global South. What’s more, several countries announced that they would strengthen their pledges—known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)—under the Paris Agreement. These included Azerbaijan, Brazil, the UK, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Shouldn’t COP29 have done a lot more, given the urgency of the climate crisis? As we have noted in an earlier article for IPS (“Are Climate Summits a Waste of Time?”), the UN climate process is designed to help us make incremental progress, year after year, decade after decade. And it has. It may seem like the pace of change is too slow—and it often is—but the UN has kept the ball moving over many, many years, and can take credit for helping us forward much more than we realize. Isn’t Azerbaijan an oil producer? Why hold meetings on climate change in fossil fuel states? Yes, it is. In fact, many countries that have hosted the annual UN climate summit in the past have also been fossil fuel states. These include the UAE, UK, Poland, South Africa, India, and Indonesia. In fact, Poland (a major coal producer), has hosted the climate COPs three times! Why is this? The hosting of the COPs is decided by the relevant regional groupings of the UN. So, each region gets its turn every few years to decide who hosts. The fact is, many countries produce fossil fuels, and often these are the ones with the financial and organizational capacity to host large events like a UN summit. As we have argued in the past (“Global Cooperation on Climate Change: What Have We Achieved and What Needs to Happen Next?”), we believe hosts should be judged not on their fossil fuel status, but on whether the annual COP they host is a success. If we judge the hosts by what the UN summits achieve, then fossil fuel countries have a mixed record. COP29 was not a breakout success, but the recent COPs in Egypt and the UAE achieved a surprising breakthrough, with agreement on a loss and damage fund. Also, some of these fossil fuel producers are slowly transitioning their economies away from selling oil, coal and gas. Azerbaijan, for instance, is promoting its tourism sector. Are UN climate COPs still worth holding? Do they need to change? As mentioned above, we believe UN climate summits are worth it, as they have helped the world make significant progress over the past thirty years. That said, some people think the COPs need to change how they operate. For instance, there were 65,000 people at COP29, but only a few thousand were actually involved in the UN negotiations. Isn’t this a sign something needs to be done differently? We think the critics miss the point. While it’s true that the UN climate COPs have become large and unwieldy, they also serve many purposes. First, the world pays attention to these mega-events, which ratchet up the political pressure. Prime ministers, presidents, and other world leaders often attend, knowing the eyes of the world are on them. This, too, raises expectations and sometimes leads to better outcomes. Not only that, but the COPs are often teeming with other folks from every sector and country, all eager to talk about what they are doing, listen to others, and build networks, coalitions, and alliances. Sometimes, these lead to powerful “coalitions of the willing”. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) mentioned earlier is an example of this, as is the Global Methane Pledge, a coalition uniting 159 participating countries (and the European Commission) in pursuit of a goal to cut methane emissions 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. On other occasions, participants can generate new ideas that eventually end up in the formal UN negotiations. Recent examples include discussions on agriculture and water management. Currently, it appears as if climate change in the context of oceans and human health may soon be added to the formal discussions. Of course, the climate COPs could certainly be improved. For instance, the number of formal agenda items could be reduced, since the negotiations are now very complex. However, the UN COPs continue to serve an important function and should, in our opinion, include a wide range of stakeholders.

Credit: Umar Manzoor Shah/IPS The next COP is taking place in Belém, Brazil in November 2025. What’s on the agenda, and what needs to happen before then? The road to COP30 in Brazil lies through Bonn, Germany, which is the location for the annual preparatory meeting each June. UN climate watchers will be paying close attention to the two-week session in Bonn to see if we are on track to make any breakthroughs in Brazil. The key issues where observers would like to see progress at COP30 include: We would also like to see evidence at COP30 that the recently-created Loss and Damage Fund is starting to have an impact, and that the role of oceans in climate change mitigation and adaptation is being taken more seriously. Even though the situation is bad, is there still hope? Yes. Despite the recent bad news, we remain optimistic. History shows we have made positive strides already. We are convinced now is the time to double down on global, collaborative efforts to combat climate change, and that the UN COPs provide important, regular milestones to meet, review our progress, and strengthen our pledges. One piece of good news lost among all the big, bad headlines relates to the leadership at COP30. Ambassador André Corrêa do Lago has been chosen as president of COP30. He played a significant role in the Rio+20 negotiations and has been one of Brazil’s top civil servants for many years. His expertise when it comes to climate change and COPs is impressive. The appointment of such a consummate professional is a positive sign of how seriously the Brazilian government is taking its responsibilities as the COP30 host. Prof. Felix Dodds and Chris Spence have participated in UN environmental negotiations since the 1990s. They co-edited Heroes of Environmental Diplomacy: Profiles in Courage (Routledge, 2022). Their next book, Environmental Lobbying at the United Nations: A Guide to Protecting Our Planet, is due for release in June 2025.

Cool-headed Charlie Hempenstall drove Wesley into the Leinster Schools Senior Cup quarter-final claiming 18 points in their win over Belvedere College at Energia Park on Friday afternoon. The Leinster under-19s outhalf was a step ahead of everyone in engineering the first upset of the competition to make the last eight. Wesley hit the ground running from the off, working a smart lineout for Tom Burke to go over in the right corner. The touchline conversion proving no problem for Hempenstall. It wasn’t long before Belvedere captain Charlie Lyons was binned for an illegal tackle and Hempenstall sent Matthew Wystepek over on the right. Hempenstall found the posts from the touchline again for 14-0 in the 13th minute. He then rubbed salt into Belvedere’s wounds with a 17th minute penalty. David Gimore was away and a flashy attack ended with Hempenstall arrowing a kick for Wystepek to grab and ground for 22-0 in the 25th minute. Belvedere finally managed to gather their game, number eight Paul Dunne blasting off the base of a five-metre scrum for a badly needed try. The Ballinteer school’s quick, clean rucking was the secret to a multi-phase attack finished by prop Evan Caddow, joined by Hempenstall’s extras to make it 29-5 at the break. Belvedere blasted back into the game as their forwards upped the ante and their backs came alive. Lorcan Butler’s close-range burst and a similar effort from Cillian McCann delivered two quickfire tries, both converted by Jonathan Garrihy. The sense of desperation had dissolved as Garrihy was content to add a penalty from a promising position for 17 points in 18 minutes. Now, the pressure had shifted to Wesley' shoulders. It was then Hempenstall weaved a wonderful pattern for a phenomenal individual try which he also converted. Then was the calm after the storm. Another fluid move allowed fullback Max Colbert to stroll over on the right, Hempenstall adding the conversion. A late push from Belvedere saw replacement Eugene Isong claim their fourth try to reduce the deficit to make it a 16-point loss.
