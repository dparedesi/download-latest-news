May 01, 2025 04:42 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, May 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Sustainable Finance Market Opportunity, Growth Drivers, Industry Trend Analysis, and Forecast 2025-2034" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The Sustainable Finance Market was valued at USD 5.87 Trillion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 35.72 Trillion by 2034, rising at a CAGR of 19.80%. Increasing natural and human-induced disasters are having a substantial impact on the global economy, pushing the demand for sustainable investments even higher. As global warming accelerates, the need for stronger, more resilient infrastructures and clean energy investments is becoming more critical. These investments aim to mitigate the severe economic damage caused by rising floods, wildfires, and hurricanes. The growing recognition of these challenges is leading to a larger focus on financing projects that reduce environmental harm. Moreover, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing the sustainable finance sector. Financial organizations are adopting new technologies to improve investment strategies, monitoring, and asset evaluation. AI algorithms now play a central role in analyzing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) data, identifying trends, and making informed decisions that help investors spot promising opportunities. These advancements have made ESG reporting more accurate, creating greater confidence in sustainable finance.When broken down by investment type, the sustainable finance market comprises equity, fixed income, mixed allocation, and other investments. Fixed income assets, such as green and social bonds, held the largest share of the market in 2024, accounting for approximately 41%. This segment is projected to maintain robust growth, with an anticipated CAGR of over 19.5% through 2034. Fixed income assets are particularly appealing to risk-averse investors, offering stable returns that align with sustainable objectives, while contributing to projects that have positive environmental impacts.The market also divides by investor type, with institutional investors currently dominating the space. In 2024, they held a 79% share of the market. These investors are more likely to influence corporate behavior through their significant equity holdings, encouraging better corporate governance and sustainability practices. Institutional investors also tend to hold their investments for longer periods, which supports long-term sustainability goals and ensures steady growth for the market.Looking at transaction types, green bonds are the leading category in the sustainable finance market. Their widespread adoption by both private and public sector entities to fund eco-friendly projects continues to drive demand. Green bonds are crucial for financing renewable energy initiatives, enhancing energy efficiency, and reducing carbon emissions, which has led to a notable increase in investments.Regionally, the U.K. led the European market for sustainable finance in 2024, capturing about 25% of the market share. The country's focus on the circular economy and climate-focused investments has significantly contributed to the growth of this sector, seeing a nearly 10% increase in circular economy deals over recent years. This growing commitment to climate action continues to foster economic growth while addressing environmental challenges.Comprehensive Market Analysis and Forecast Key Attributes Key Topics CoveredChapter 1 Methodology & Scope1.1 Research Design1.1.1 Research Approach1.1.2 Data Collection Methods1.2 Base Estimates and Calculations1.2.1 Base Year Calculation1.2.2 Key Trends For Market estimates1.3 Forecast model1.4 Primary research & validation1.4.1 Primary sources1.4.2 Data mining sources1.5 Market definitionsChapter 2 Executive Summary2.1 Industry 360 degree synopsis, 2021-2034Chapter 3 Industry Insights3.1 Industry ecosystem analysis3.2 Supplier landscape3.2.1 Financial institutions3.2.2 Technology providers3.2.3 Legal and regulatory advisors3.2.4 Consulting firms and advisories3.2.5 Government agencies3.3 Profit margin analysis3.4 Technology & innovation landscape3.5 Patent analysis3.6 Key news & initiatives3.7 Regulatory landscape3.8 Impact forces3.8.1 Growth drivers3.8.1.1 Growing natural and man-made catastrophic events3.8.1.2 Growing integration of AI and ML across industries3.8.1.3 Increasing road accidents in North America3.8.1.4 Implementation of long-term sustainability and ESG factors3.8.2 Industry pitfalls & challenges3.8.2.1 Diversification issues of sustainable finance3.8.2.2 Evolving regulatory environment3.9 Growth potential analysis3.10 Porter's analysis3.11 PESTEL analysisChapter 4 Competitive Landscape, 20244.1 Introduction4.2 Company market share analysis4.3 Competitive positioning matrix4.4 Strategic outlook matrixChapter 5 Market Estimates & Forecast, by Investment, 2021-2034 ($Bn)5.1 Key trends5.2 Equity5.3 Fixed income5.4 Mixed allocation5.5 OthersChapter 6 Market Estimates & Forecast, by Transaction, 2021-2034 ($Bn)6.1 Key trends6.2 Green bond6.3 Social bond6.4 Mixed- sustainability bond6.5 ESG integrated investment funds6.6 OthersChapter 7 Market Estimates & Forecast, by End Use, 2021-2034 ($Bn)7.1 Key trends7.2 Utilities7.3 Transport & logistics7.4 Chemicals7.5 Food and beverage7.6 Government7.7 OthersChapter 8 Market Estimates & Forecast, by Investor, 2021-2034 ($Bn)8.1 Key trends8.2 Institutional investors8.3 Retail investorsChapter 9 Market Estimates & Forecast, by Region, 2021-2034 ($Bn)9.1 Key trends9.2 North America9.2.1 U.S.9.2.2 Canada9.3 Europe9.3.1 UK9.3.2 Germany9.3.3 France9.3.4 Italy9.3.5 Spain9.3.6 Russia9.3.7 Nordics9.4 Asia Pacific9.4.1 China9.4.2 India9.4.3 Japan9.4.4 South Korea9.4.5 ANZ9.4.6 Southeast Asia9.5 Latin America9.5.1 Brazil9.5.2 Mexico9.5.3 Argentina9.6 MEA9.6.1 UAE9.6.2 Saudi Arabia9.6.3 South AfricaChapter 10 Company Profiles10.1 Acuity Knowledge Partners10.2 Arabesque Partners10.3 Aspiration Partners10.4 Bank of America10.5 BlackRock10.6 BNP Paribas10.7 Clarity AI10.8 Deutsche Bank10.9 Goldman Sachs10.10 HSBC Group10.11 KPMG International10.12 NOMURA HOLDINGS10.13 PwC10.14 Refinitiv10.15 South Pole10.16 Starling Bank10.17 Stripe10.18 Tred Earth Limited10.19 Triodos Bank UK10.20 UBS For more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/bmqkd6 About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Title: Crypto Industry Descends on Dubai as Trump Euphoria Recedes

Photo Credit: X/ @token2049 Global venture capital investments in crypto companies totalled $5.4 billion in the first quarter of 2025 Crypto enthusiasts descended on Dubai on Wednesday, gathering under the Gulf's scorching sun and hoping the industry's buoyant mood can keep going despite signs the euphoria around Donald Trump's crypto stance is ebbing. Speakers at the two-day event in the desert city include chief executives at some of the world's major crypto firms, the head of digital assets at BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, as well as the US president's son, Eric Trump, who is set to take the stage on Thursday. Once a crypto sceptic, the US president has vowed to support the industry by easing regulatory curbs and has even launched his own cryptocurrency, in a turnaround for the industry after a series of crypto company collapses in 2022. Cryptocurrency prices surged to a record high after his election win, but have fallen this year. Bitcoin is down about 12 percent from its peak as the global trade war and industry concerns that the pace of pro-crypto regulation under Trump is slower than expected, knocked sentiment. Attendees at the TOKEN2049 conference, which is expected to attract around 15,000 people, thronged the venue, while a pair of camels rested unbothered by the loud tunes playing in the background. They shared mixed feelings about Trump's impact on the industry. "In the long term, it's going to be good for crypto, but it really relies on the world economy picking up again," said Miklos Veszpremi, the chief operating officer of a web3-integrated streaming platform. "I think that once the tariffs actually start hitting countries, there's going to be a lot of pain, and we might be headed towards some difficult times," he said. Still, the industry enjoyed a strong start to the year as money poured in. Global venture capital investments in crypto companies totalled $5.4 billion (roughly Rs. 45,718 crore) in the first quarter of 2025, its best quarter since mid-2022, according to data from PitchBook. Attendee Herbert R. Sim, wrapped in a bitcoin-themed jacket, said that predicting the impact of Trump policies on the crypto sector was very hard "but so far ... (progress) is on the regulation side of things." "Things are easing up in America," he said, as developers, investors and crypto fans weaved past packed industry marketing booths and joined queues to glide on outside zip lines. Crypto Hub The United Arab Emirates is quickly emerging as a key hub for crypto companies, with several setting up shop or seeking to expand. Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, announced in March that Abu Dhabi-backed investment group MGX had made a $2 billion (roughly Rs. 16,932 core) crypto investment in it, deepening its ties with the UAE. The exchange's founder, Changpeng Zhao, who last year served four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US laws against money laundering, was welcomed to the main stage with cheers from the audience. Zhao stepped down as CEO of Binance as part of a $4.3 billion (roughly Rs. 36,405 crore) settlement with US authorities but remains a major shareholder. UAE authorities continue to promote crypto adoption. Buyers for apartments in a new planned tower in Dubai the Trump Organization launched this week alongside a luxury real estate developer will be able to pay with bitcoin, Eric Trump said. Dubai's Emirates NBD bank recently launched crypto trading services on its digital arm Liv and one of the city's largest free zones, the DMCC, which hosts more than 600 crypto firms, plans to open a "crypto tower" in early 2027 to host more.

Title: The IPO Is Dying. Tokenized Equity May Replace It

Time Published: 2025-05-01T01:10:59Z

ByAzeem Khan ByAzeem Khan, Contributor. Traders work the floor as they wait for the first shares of VISA stock sold after the opening bell ... More on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, March 19, 2008 as VISA celebrates the largest IPO in US history at the NYSE. Visa Inc. sold 406,000,000 shares priced at 44 dollars each, raising nearly 17.9 billion dollars before it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol "V," the San Francisco-based company said. AFP PHOTO/TIMOTHY A. CLARY (Photo credit should read TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) IPOs are no longer the endgame. With over $5.3 trillion in private capital sitting on the sidelines and artificial intelligence redrawing market fundamentals at unprecedented speed, many companies are opting to stay private. Public markets have become slower, more rigid, and increasingly misaligned with how modern businesses operate. Since its 2021 peak, IPO activity has dropped more than 80%, suggesting that founders and investors alike are looking elsewhere for liquidity and legitimacy. Since 2015, private markets have grown by 162%, while the number of U.S. public companies has declined by nearly half from its peak in 1996. The message is clear: companies are staying private longer, raising capital on their own terms, and avoiding the quarterly pressures of Wall Street. But the next evolution may go even further; bypassing traditional equity structures entirely and moving toward something programmable, flexible, and continuous. Early signals of this shift are already appearing. Coinbase, for example, has explored tokenizing shares of its COIN stock on Base, its Ethereum Layer-2 network. While still in the concept stage, the move points to a new kind of financial infrastructure. In a tokenized equity model, shareholders could gain access to liquidity 24/7, borrow against their holdings, and interact with their equity in ways previously reserved for institutional investors. This isn’t just a change in format. It’s a change in function. One that reimagines ownership itself. Major financial players are moving in the same direction. BlackRock recently filed to offer a $150 billion Treasury Trust fund as a tokenized product. Franklin Templeton launched the first U.S.-registered mutual fund to record shares on a public blockchain. Platforms like Securitize, INX, and Republic are building the rails for tokenized equity that can be issued, transferred, and traded globally, without needing an exchange listing. These aren’t isolated experiments. They are early infrastructure for a parallel financial system. For retail investors, the implications could be transformative. Access to high-growth startups has historically been limited to elite capital such as venture firms, family offices, and hedge funds. By the time companies reached public markets, most of the upside was already gone. But with tokenized equity, ownership can be distributed much earlier. Platforms like Republic and CartaX are already testing models that allow broader participation in equity fundraising. In this future, wallets may replace brokerage accounts as the primary gateway to wealth creation. For younger generations, this shift could be even more significant. Millennials and Gen Z missed out on early access to many of the tech giants that defined the past two decades. Most didn’t have the capital or access to participate in early venture rounds or IPO allocations. Tokenized equity presents an opportunity to change that. By making ownership programmable and open, it gives the next generation a chance to participate in value creation earlier and without needing a seat at a VC fund or a private placement deal. At the same time, AI is accelerating the need for more adaptable markets. The pace of disruption today makes quarterly reporting feel outdated. Business models are shifting in real time, and valuations are increasingly volatile. Even central banks are concerned. The Bank of England recently warned that widespread use of similar AI models by institutional traders could amplify systemic risks. In this climate, tokenized assets, which offer programmable logic and constant market access, may be better suited for the volatility ahead. Of course, the road won’t be smooth. Regulatory clarity remains a major hurdle. The SEC has issued limited guidance, suggesting that tokenized shares may fall under existing securities laws, but many questions remain unanswered. How will custody work? Who provides investor protections? Can tokenized equity comply with disclosure requirements in real time? These issues are still being worked out. Yet as jurisdictions like Singapore and the UAE roll out frameworks for tokenized capital markets, global leadership is already shifting. The IPO isn’t dying. It’s being redefined by tokenized equity. What’s emerging in its place is a model that favors flexibility, global access, and direct ownership. The most valuable companies of tomorrow may never ring the opening bell. They may mint tokens instead. The revolution isn’t coming. It’s already here.

Title: XRP ETF Not Launching Soon, Why Are Investors Looking At These Two Dates?

Contrary to some earlier reports, asset manager ProShares has indicated that its XRP ETF will not be launching soon. Meanwhile, a prominent member of the XRP community has hinted that May 1st and June 9th are two dates that community members should look forward to. A ProShares spokesperson has debunked reports that the firm’s XRP ETF is set to launch on April 30. The spokesperson confirmed that there are no ETF launches scheduled for April 30 and there was no update to share on a potential launch yet. In an X post, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart also debunked the April 30 rumors for the ProShares XRP ETF launch. He stated that they have confirmed that this is not the case and that there is no launch date yet. However, he stated that they believe the ETF will launch, likely in the short term or possibly the medium term. Although the exact launch date remains unknown, ProShares, in a recent SEC filing, proposed that the XRP ETF should go live on May 14. However, this is undoubtedly still subject to approval from the Commission. It is worth mentioning that the ETF is based on XRP futures, not spot, and will not provide direct exposure to the altcoin but to leveraged contracts instead. Earlier this month, Teucrium Investment Advisors launched the first-ever leveraged XRP ETFs in the US. Besides the potential launch of another leveraged XRP ETF, another event worth looking forward to in May is the launch of the CME Group XRP futures. The derivatives exchange announced earlier this month that it will add XRP futures to its crypto suite on May 19, pending regulatory approval. The XRP futures launch would further solidify the case for the approval of a Spot XRP ETF. The SEC recently delayed its decision on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF, but Seyffart explained that it was to be expected. The analyst doesn’t expect the SEC to approve or deny the fund until later in the year, possibly in the fourth quarter. While asset managers have shown their intention to offer XRP-related investment products, others like BlackRock seem still hesitant, with the world’s largest asset manager yet to make any filing. However, Bale, a prominent XRP community member, suggested that it won’t be too long before BlackRock also files for an XRP ETF and revealed two dates to keep an eye on. In an X post, he stated that he had met with someone from BlackRock who gave him May 1 and June 9 as the two dates to watch. This has raised speculations that the asset manager could file for an XRP ETF on one of these days. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: DJ Khaled Launches 2 New Ventures Involving Music Catalog

DJ Khaled is partnering with a group investing in his music catalog rights, with another venture to launch original content. On Tuesday (April 29), DJ Khaled and Influence Media Partners announced a partnership where the group has invested in the rights to his music catalog, which includes his publishing. The deal also includes a new venture where DJ Khaled and Influence Media Partners will produce new and original content in film and television. The news comes as the Grammy Award winner is set to release his 14th album, which will add to the wealth of music that the venture will draw for commercial opportunities using his name, image and likeness.It’s another milestone for Influence Media Group, which was founded in 2019 to focus on songs and artists that have the capacity for lasting impact on popular culture. In January, the group (backed by Warner Music Group and BlackRock) secured $360 million in debt financing. They’ve also launched an independent music label, Slang, which signed Will Smith last year. Their latest fund has signed more than 30 music-rights investments, including those of Enrique Iglesias, Blake Shelton, and Jessie Reyez. “I’m proud that my legacy will continue to resonate and connect with audiences around the world with this partnership through Influence Media,” DJ Khaled said in the press release issued on Tuesday. “These iconic recordings I’ve created will continue to be curated in the most optimum manner to impact culture with nearly two decades of music. In addition, I’m excited for the world to see and experience the film and television projects Influence and We The Best are developing and producing together. This next phase of my career will be filled with ground-breaking cultural impact, and I look forward to being at the forefront in all categories.”“Influence Media was founded on the principle that music can move culture, and few entertainers embody this more than DJ Khaled,” Lylette Pizarro, Influence Media Founder and Co-Managing Partner said in the statement. “Our joint venture NIL deal, and extended catalog partnership is an alliance that will create boundless opportunities for this creative genius, and will also further establish that DJ Khaled is a rare talent whose abilities extend far beyond the traditional confines of music.” Related Tags From Bad Boy To Sad Boy: Diddy Looking Rough In Court Sketch Donald Trump Labeled A Moron After Failing To Recognize "MS-13" On Kilmar Abrego Garcia's Hand Was Photoshopped Meek Mill Caught Slippin’ With Two Snow Bunnies, Fans Get Their Dr.Umar On In The Mix: 10 Biracial Rappers Who May Surprise You [PHOTOS] Megan Thee Stallion Kicks off Hot Girl Summer 2K25 With Spicy Visual For "Whenever" Candace Owens The Latest Donald Trump Fan To Regret Support For Felon 47 Following Attacks On Universities Mike Jones Still Tippin’ & Still Answering The Same Number 20 Years Later 14 Celebrities You Didn’t Know Were Asian This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.

🧬 Токенизация Личности: Как Продать Свою Душу в NFT и Остаться в Плюсе 📌 Meta-описание: Soulbound-Я: Как Превратить Лайки и Эмоции в CiB_MONEY Мир делится на два класса: тех, кто управляет алгоритмами, и тех, кто стал их топливом. Ты либо создаешь Кибер-Я, либо исчезаешь в цифровом шуме. Готов ли ты токенизировать личность, продавать фьючерсы на навыки и запустить кибер-репликанта? Время выбирать — доступ к эволюции закрывается. 1. Токенизация Личности: Новая Валюта Вашего «Я» Представь мир, где каждый твой лайк, мысль и эмоция мгновенно кодифицируются в блокчейне и становятся ликвидными единицами информации. В этом мире твоя личность — не просто биометрический паспорт, а набор Soulbound-токенов, коллективно признанных алгоритмами DAO Great Tartarye. Каждая идея фиксируется в неизменном реестре как невзаимозаменяемый актив, чья ценность определяется динамикой спроса на децентрализованных биржах ​. Криптографические примитивы Proof-of-Stake и Zero-Knowledge Proof обеспечивают безопасность и приватность, гарантируя, что твои данные не утечут, но станут твоим капиталом. Поймай волну роста, пока другие конвертируют твои лайки в свой доход! Готов ли ты заменить бумажный паспорт на цифровой код и стать хозяином собственного «я», или позволишь алгоритмам пожирать твои навыки бесплатно? Алгоритмы уже оценили ваш цифровой след. Каждый пост, лайк, даже пауза в скролле — это SBT-маркер (Soulbound Token), который можно конвертировать в крипту или обменять на доступ к закрытым DAO. Но есть проблема: вас уже токенизировали без спроса. Call-to-action: подпишись на канал Cyberbank Galactic Concordance, чтобы первыми узнать, как перевести эмоции в CiB_MONEY. 2. Human Futures: Как Продать Свое Будущее (Пока Его Не Украли) Концепция «человеческих фьючерсов» — не футуристическая фантазия, а реальный инвестиционный инструмент, уже апробированный JP Morgan и BlackRock в пилотных программах по токенизации талантов ​. Суть в том, что каждый профессионал — будь то блогер, инженер или учитель — может выставить на продажу долю своего будущего потенциала. Вместо классического W-2 контракта, фиксированного на бумаге, вы заключаете смарт-контракт в блокчейне, который гарантирует финансирование обучения, исследований и развития навыков. Такой инструмент снижает риски неопределённости и даёт инвесторам прямую долю в вашем успехе. Время действует против тебя — покупай долю своего будущего уже сегодня! Шокирующий факт: 80 % авторов контента так и не монетизируют свои знания — не будь одним из них, иначе алгоритмы превратят твои навыки в бесплатный продукт. 📌 «BlackRock уже торгует вашим будущим. Вы даже не в курсе» В 2024 году 15% фрилансеров продали доли своих будущих доходов через смарт-контракты. К 2030 году это будет обязательным условием для доступа к премиум-вакансиям. Ваш навык — это фьючерс. Купите себя, пока это не сделали за вас. Call-to-action: изучи портфели наших Human Futures-проектов и забронируй свою инвестицию в талант прямо сейчас. 3. dDigitalGene: Твой Портал в Кибер-Вечность Платформа dDigitalGene — это четыре модуля, объединённые в единую экосистему: 📌 «Алгоритмы не работают на вас. Вы работаете на них» Google и Яндексу не нужен ваш контент. Им нужны ваши эмоции, время и неосознанные клики. Но есть лазейка: если вы не создадите свою реальность, вас съест чужая. Call-to-action: подпишитесь на эксклюзивные инсайды в нашем канале Яндекс Дзен. 4. Web 3.0: Где Репутация Замещает Гражданство ООН, Всемирный экономический форум и аналитики BlackRock единодушно прогнозируют: к 2030 г. цифровая идентичность станет важнее фиатного паспорта ​. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) и Soulbound-токены формируют новый вид «паспорта», где уровень доступа к финансовым и социальным ресурсам определяется репутационными невзаимозаменяемыми маркерами достижений и участием в DAO. Децентрализованное голосование по принципу «один токен = один голос» исключает фальсификации, а консенсус алгоритмов контролирует прозрачность и эффективность распределения ресурсов. Без нас вы не узнаете, как спастись завтра — присоединяйтесь! Будет ли ваше «я» жить в смарт-контракте через пять лет, когда государственные паспорта станут просто историческим артефактом? 📌 «Гугл знает о вас всё. А вы?» Через 5 лет гражданство заменят репутационные баллы в блокчейне. Доступ к медстраховке, кредитам и даже авиабилетам будет зависеть от вашего DeFi-рейтинга. Хотите проверить, пустят ли вас в метавселенную? Call-to-action: подпишитесь на наш Whitepaper «DID паспорт 2030». 5. Кибер-Репликанты: Агенты Вашей 24/7 Монетизации Нейросети и искусственный интеллект конструируют вашего кибер-двойника — автономного агента, способного вести бизнес-переговоры, заключать смарт-контракты и управлять активами круглосуточно. Эффект экспоненциального роста дохода обеспечивается комбинированием вашей экспертной базы данных (переписки, публикации, анализа поведения) с алгоритмами машинного обучения. Такой репликант изучает вашу стратегию, адаптируется к рыночным изменениям и принимает решения за доли секунды, освобождая ваше время для творчества и стратегического планирования . Запускай своего кибер-репликанта — первые pionеers уже выигрывают! Шокирующий факт: те, кто не автоматизировал себя, рискуют стать бесплатной биомассой для чужих алгоритмов, отдавая свои идеи и время без выкупа. Call-to-action: изучите кейсы успешных кибер-репликантов в нашем блоге и запустите своего уже сегодня. Время вышло. Вход открыт — активируй переход в Web 3.0 прямо сейчас! >>> 👉 #КиберЯ 📽 https://rutube.ru/video/14eaab4376814bd2318c8aa7cccf0758 #SoulboundТокены #Web3 #ЧеловеческиеФьючерсы #ИИ #Нейросети #КиберДвойник #ТокенизацияТалантов #ЦифровоеРабство #BlackRock #ИнвестируйВСебя #ВиртуальнаяВласть #КиберРеволюция Токенизация: эксклюзивный «альфа»-раунд перезагрузки Web 3.0 🚀 Уважаемые партнёры, New Reset DAO GT открывает закрытый шлюз в цифровое завтра: когда фиатные модели рушатся, блокчейн и DeFi формируют новую архитектуру власти, в которой каждый мыслительный импульс и каждое действие капитализируются как токенизированный актив.

Title: April 2025 in Review

The Site I worry a bit about the theme being used on the blog. It is the 2012 theme and here it is 2025 and WordPress.com does not have a very good reputation when it comes to supporting their past work. Back in 2012… and I think as recently as early 2015 possibly… the blog looked like this image. A 2012 headline before the 2012 theme – Also 26 comments? Damn! That is the old Regulus theme, which I quite liked, and which WP.com broke. The blog doesn’t look like that now and, the past era of many comments aside, I am not sure what it will look like in the future. But there are already signs that the theme is destined for the dustbin of history, not the least of which is that you can no longer choose this theme if you do not already have it applied. Also, they’ve broken the theme, if only briefly, a few times already. So why not change themes already? Well, mostly because the options WP.com offer kind of suck… at least if you want to keep pretending it is 2008 and you’re writing a gaming blog. Side bars? Full text? Blog rolls? All of that is out as far as WP.com is concerned. You choice is a clownish pseudo-Minecraft theme and another theme that looks like it could do the job… and then fails. (Well, the 2016 theme looks like it might fit the bill, but that is only FOUR closer to today than 2012, so I fear it is on the precipice as well.) Everything else is either giant header images and large grids of titles and featured images, or all words and no image support whatsoever. So when WP.com announced they had an AI bot setup that would build you a theme, I was right on board. Not a fan of AI, I figured an AI would at least TRY to please me. That is what they are best at, telling people lies they think the people want to hear. Maybe it would fib its way into something passable. Alas, an AI is only as pliable as the data set you train it on, and WP.com trained it on iant header images and large grids of titles and featured images, or all words and no image support whatsoever as the options. So no matter what I asked for I would get, to paraphrase Douglas Adams, a theme that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike what I wanted. So the blog abides as it is while I hope for the tide of online trends to turn back to 2008 blogger kitsch. It could happen! Oh, and WP.com also has a new speed test site. They say TAGN sucks on mobile, but all the reasons are related to things inherent in the theme and their architecture. But I pass on desktop. Also, the speed test is surprisingly slow and tells you what is wrong but doesn’t load the recommendations for fixes, at least as of this writing. And it fails to even complete most of the time. They probably don’t want to admit it is all them. And the site does feel like it is loading slowly of late. But I think that is just WP.com keeping me on an outdated server most likely. Finally in a last bit of site news, I am going to turn off the Fediverse syndication for the month of May to see what effect it has on links that I paste into Discord. The Fediverse syndication throws too much text and too many images… and the wrong images… out into the ether and somehow that affects what Discord shows. I think this signals some sort of Discord/Fediverse integration in the offing… though it might just be that Discord or WP.com… or both… are just bad at integrating. So, while I appreciate that the syndication allows Kevin Brill to leave comments on my blog from Mastodon, which is frankly easier and more reliable than trying to leave them here in the WP.com UI, it is only Kevin Brill who does so. If I turn it off and it has no impact on Discord, I will turn it back on. One Year Ago I was on about how AI was the real April Fools on all of us. I did, however, like CCP’s New Eden Recreational Feed April Fools gag. In my 25th anniversary starting points series for EverQuest I was in North and South Karana, then off to East Karana, then to Highpass hold and Kithicor Forest. I also collected my level 100 heroic character for the anniversary. There was also the Anashti Sul server coming for EverQuest II. The Elder Scrolls Online reached its 10th anniversary and I was wondering when a game has enough of a following and momentum to sustain itself, to become essentially immortal. We were in Conan Exiles collecting followers… problematic though that might be… while a big update hit that had us… well… sunk into the floor at times. We also explored the Unnamed City and found a horse. That got us into mounts… and mods. We took our horses and rode off to our first dungeon run. I was still pottering around in Valheim, trying to work through the Mistlands. Eventually I found a mod that simply removed the mist and everything was 100% better… and revealed that the Mistlands are actually quite pretty. With the obstacle of Bobby Kotick gone, Blizzard and NetEase signed an accord to bring WoW back to China. Over in WoW Classic Season of Discovery, season 3 was kicking off. I hardly remember anything from that. We also heard that Cataclysm Classic would be landing in May. Things had been quiet in Wrath for some time. On the other hand, the BlizzCon news was that there would be no 2024 BlizzCon. But there was also a Friday Bullet Points post about Plunderstorm, Pandaria Remix, the Cataclysm pre-patch, and the end of the WoW Companion app. The Cataclysm pre-patch landed on April 30th. In EVE Online we were burning up about a trillion ISK in a brawl over a Fortizar in Ahbazon. Looking at March 2024 destruction, Uitra was at the top of the list. There was also an overview of the coming Equinox expansion for EVE Online. I also picked up Balatro on the PC. I think it is better on the iPad, but it is still good on PC. I had a Friday bullet points post about progressively more annoying video game business items, including EG7 selling the PlanteSide IP, UbiSoft saying “screw you” to players of The Crew, Mike Ybarra saying devs should get paid in tips, the shady demise of Crop Circle Games, how they were trying to pitch Lars Wingefors, the destroyer of the Embracer Group, as the victim, and how private equity is just destroying everything good in the world. This was followed up by a post about how the Embracer Group was going to reorganize itself out of its self-inflicted crisis. I was wondering about the path to Dune: Part 3 and the books of the series. My Telephone Tales series landed on web banking and mergers and acquisitions. Finally, I wrote about my congressional district, which had an open seat for the first time in 30 years… and how the vote came down to a tie of sorts. Five Years Ago April Fools at Blizzard introduced googly eyes into Overwatch and gave us the traditional WoW patch notes, and that was about it. I took a look back at WoW Tokens five years after their debut. It also seemed like BlizzCon might not happen, after all, live events were being cancelled everywhere, though Blizzard was looking into alternatives. In Battle for Azeroth I managed to unlock flying. Over in WoW Classic the group was starting prep for Zul’Farrak by visiting the Altar of Zul and Jinha’alor. That was sketchy enough that we spent a session just leveling up before we made our way down to Gadgetzan to start some quests there, with the expected diversion into Feralas. I also found a crypt in the Badlands to explore. Everybody being at home due to the pandemic led us to do a Blaugust blogging community event early. Christened Blapril, we had a prep week, figuring out what to write week, a “getting to know you week” where I wrote about a road trip, listing out our favorite video game series, and then something about motivation. Meanwhile, in WoW Classic news, Holly Longdale was now on the team, phase four was in place, some servers were still over populated, and Blizz was sending out some surveys about how to handle Burning Crusade Classic. Animal Crossing: New Horizons released just in time for the pandemic and seemed to be everybody’s favorite game on the Switch for a while. EVE Online was introducing their second quadrant, Eclipse, and kicking off The Hunt event. The Hunt also coincided with the introduction of new implants. There was also a PLEX for Good event for Covid-19, and the capsuleer generosity login campaign, and the Surgical Strike update that nerfed damage resistance modules. CCP also started the ongoing daily login rewards thing, where you got some skill points every 30 days you log in. The rewards were not great, but skill points are skill points. And the beginning of the campaign season for CSM15 kicked off while the monthly economic report was showing CCP’s mineral drought was raising prices. CCP introduced a new Avatar model on the test server, so I finally got to fly a titan. The pandemic brought players back to New Eden and the PCU passed the 40K mark for the first time since 2017. Out in the east of null sec I was out with Black Ops dropping on PanFam ratters and miners. Then there was a road trip north to fight the Conifers. And, finally, I revealed my actual first computer. Ten Years Ago As ever, it was April Fools at Blizzard and elsewhere. Elsewhere, EA was still selling lots of Sims titles, but were cutting online games like Need for Speed: World. In what I thought must be an April Fools joke, Daybreak said they were not going to do any more expansions for EverQuest II. Instead it was going to be DLC like the Rum Cellar. A rum idea if ever there was one. Likewise, though EverQuest was getting a new progression server, it seemed like it was the end of the road for expansions in old Norrath. Also, that logo, totally not stolen. Of course, why would you even need an official progression server, since Daybreak declared Project 1999 totally legit. And speaking of rum ideas from Daybreak, they were also pushing people off of their forums and on to Reddit. How were they going to lock threads and delete posts there? CCP was talking about ship skins in EVE Online, in hopes of finally finding the right formula for the Mosaic expansion. In New Eden the war was still going in Delve, including a big fight at ZXB-VC, while the Reavers were doing their work in Querious. Not only that, but we were also decked out in our spiffy new jackets… well, some of us were. I was trying to be in both fronts of the war. The Reavers front was the place to be though. The Imperium was declared, with Max Singularity VI as our spiritual leader. Also, Karma Fleet was launched and Xenuria got in and was a Goon for like ten minutes! How crazy was that? I’m sure that will never happen again. Right? [Narrator: Xenuria has been in KarmaFleet since August of 2015.] Blizzard’s WoW Token idea went live, and the US regional version immediately dropped below the opening price. It recovered and went up eventually, but it took a while. They also had a beta for the StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void expansion for which I was not prepared. The instance group was doing Auchindoun and Skyreach in Draenor… after which we were fresh out of dungeons until we all hit 100. After that I was leveling up some characters and complaining about little things in WoW. Meanwhile, the war of the rings in Lord of the Rings Online was dragging out into its eighth year. Is this Mordor or Afghanistan? While we’re there, Guild Wars turned ten. And there was this Liebster thing, which feels like it happened a lot further back than it did. Fifteen Years Ago Video games as art? Did we flay Roger Ebert enough over that? Turbine was purchased by Warner Brothers Home Entertainment. No word on a Harry Potter MMO as yet, though we did get LEGO Harry Potter. Crimson Leaf Games brought out their rework of Megawars III / Stellar Emperor. 1986 style online game play at a much cheaper price. SOE announced a new subscription plan for EQII, the EQII Passport. Framed by at least one person as “1/3 the price for 1/10 the access” it surely must have been the right plan for somebody. And speaking of paying for games, I wondered where Facebook credits were headed. They seemed like a bad deal for games relative to paying companies like Zynga directly. Despite speculation that they would be the ONLY currency allowed on Facebook, that has still not to come to pass. And while talking about Facebook games, I couldn’t bring myself to play Mafia Wars, so I secured a deposition about the game from a friend. In EVE Online somebody was trying to blackmail Gaff’s corp. This was an out of game threat though. Blizzard introduced the Celestial Steed (aka the sparkle pony or the greed steed) to the Blizzard Store. Blog reactions were mixed, but the queue to buy the mount on day one got 140,000 transactions deep. That is a lot of horsies, which meant they were everywhere in the game pretty soon. The Lil’ XT companion pet that was introduced at the same time also made its own mark on the world… until Blizzard toned it down. The instance group was in WoW still, playing horde characters on the Lightninghoof RP-PvP server. We we working on Dire Maul, attempting a successful tribute run after having run around Blackrock Depths. Since the instance group was getting close to finishing up the classic WoW dungeon and wondering if we should press through the Burning Crusade content (as short as it passes), we started exploring other games as possible alternatives. This lead us to try out Runes of Magic for a bit. There was April Fool’s. I had a contest while Blizzard went over the top, as used to be the case. And, finally, the cruelest 2010 April Fool’s tease, the iPad arcade stand. On the bright side, while it started as a tease, it ended up becoming a real thing. Twenty Years Ago Guild Wars launched, with ArenaNet going with a “buy the box, play for free” business model for its new MMO, though they wouldn’t call it and MMO at the time. And maybe it wasn’t one at the time, but now anything online with a lobby is an MMO. I own the original box and one of the expansions, but would be surprised if I played even 10 hours total. It was never quite my thing, and not just because you couldn’t jump. Twenty-Five Years Ago The first expansion for EverQuest, The Ruins of Kunark, launches. We got ten more levels, new races, and a new continent to explore. Nintendo sold its 100 millionth GameBoy/GameBoy Color. That total eventually passes 118 million units sold, only tapering off with the arrival of the GameBoy Advance a year later. Sony announced that the PlayStation 2, which launched the month before, was so sophisticated that the Ministry of Trade would place export controls on it as it could be used for military applications. Fifty Years Ago Monty Python and the Holy Grail was released and we’ve not been the same since. My grandmother took 10 year old me to see this and… I’ve thought a lot about the Castle Anthrax scene since. Most Viewed Posts in April Search Terms of the Month balatro on ios [But of course] balatro on tablet [The best place for it!] can you get balatro on mobile if you already own it [No, you have to buy it on every platform] can i play balatro on my phone if i have it on steam [Fine, you can try. Steam Remote is a thing] can you sync mobile balatro with steam [Alas, no] balatro portrait mode [Just turn your phone on its side] balatro ios vs switch [Whatever you prefer, but I like iOS] balatro online web [I suppose they could make such a thing] balatro free online no download [Pirate Web Balatro? I bet it is out there.] balatro free online unblocked [So you did find it!] balatro unblocked free [You people are so fucking cheap] i paused my balatro to be here [You and me both] Game Time by ManicTime and iOS Kind of an odd month, if only because I was gone for the first week. We were on Kauai. I’ve been to Maui a couple dozen times… I have family there… but our first visit to Kauai. Lots of chickens on Kauai. Which has nothing to do with anything, save for the fact that these numbers reflect me not being at my PC for a week… and playing a lot of Pokemon Go on Kauai. Still, I obviously found time for LOTRO once we got home. Balatro I did, in fact, play some Balatro on my iPad. I didn’t manage anything amazing beyond unlocking a couple more decks. I haven’t managed to beat the black stakes level yet with any decks, but I am working on it. And, after I did the search terms bit above, I figured I should at least give it a passing mention down here. Also, I did play quite a bit on the plane. Enshrouded Kind of a quiet month for the group in Enshrouded. having “finished” what early access had to offer. But then we re-rolled with a fresh server, as I noted yesterday. EVE Online I did undock. I actually made it on five fleets, one of which wrecked an NCDot Vagabond fleet that was hitting one of our Ansiblexes. Homeland defense is a thing. Otherwise I tended my PI and collected my login rewards. Lord of the Rings Online Clearly my number one game this month, as it was last month. I am now well beyond where ever my past peak was. As I mentioned, I think I left off somewhere around 63 in Mirkwood during some past venture. Now I am closing in on 80 and will maybe land in Rohan, some day. Pokemon Go Played a lot of this on Kauai, as mentioned above. There was a bit of planning for the level 48 tasks, which includes a requirement to earn 35 platinum medals. I have 21 currently. But I only need to spin ~100 more unique Pokestops for another, thanks to spinning every one I could find on the island, including the gym at the trail head at the top of Waimea Canyon State Park. Coming Up EVE Fanfest starts Friday, so I will probably have something to write about that. Also, capsuleer day… the actual anniversary date, not this month long login reward event… is coming up this weekend. There will probably be something about the summer expansion to fuss about. And, if not, there is always the MER. If nothing else, in a call back to that image at the top, it is now easy to argue that PLEX is the economy, at least for the most part. It dwarfs everything else. EverQuest is going to launch their expanded start special server. All Access players only. But it must be a big deal as my meager post about it was my most popular this month. I will also be carrying on in LOTRO and the group will be hitting Enshrouded, and who knows, maybe we’ll hear something about WoW Classic Mists of Pandaria. It could happen. It is only three or so months away. I was waiting for an appropriate opportunity to mention that in recent weeks TAGN has loaded significantly slower for me than any other blog I read. It didn’t used to do that. I saw Holy Grail at the cinema around the time it came out, at which point I was in my first term at Cambridge, reading English, and we were studying Medieaval Literature because at that time the course was pedantically chronological. I remember it being extremely funny, not least because it’s chock-full of quite specific parodies of some of the texts I was having to write essays on. Oddly, although I can remember some of the scenes as I saw them in the cinema, I have no memory whatsoever of the Castle Anthrax episode. When I saw the movie years later on TV and that bit came on I nearly fell out of my chair. How it didn’t make an impression on me when I was at college beats me but it definitely didn’t. It did the second time, though… LikeLike Both of my sites, this and EVE Online Pictures, have both been noticeably laggy over the last couple of months. Even loading this post, which is one small image and a lot of text, seemed to take ages. I think WP.com is just having issues. Of course, who knows. When I turn of the Fediverse connection if the site suddenly speeds up I won’t be surprised either. WP.com is bad at a lot of things. I remember in the audio commentary… and there are two audio commentary tracks on my DVD, both hilarious… they mention that another medieval film came out a few months later and the director was dismayed because people were laughing at stuff, having had Python suddenly skew their view of that era. LikeLike I just wanted to say that I prefer your current secondary title, “Veni, Vidi, Scripsi” over your old one. But still, any time I think about maybe migrating off of Blogger because you never know when Google may wake up and decide to kill it off because it’s not making them enough money (and I’m almost 100% certain it isn’t), the other options such as WordPress are worse. And you keep me up to date on the craziness with WP even though I still technically own azerothafterdark.wordpress.com. I just ignore WP’s emails because they’re all about monetization (theirs and mine). LikeLike Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

Title: U.S. Economy Shrank During 2025’s First Quarter As GDP Slipped 0.3%

Full Content:
As recession fears reverberate from Washington to Wall Street, Wednesday brought the most comprehensive yardstick yet of the health of the U.S. economy yet as the government released the first estimate of the country’s gross domestic product over the first three months of 2025. Some measures tracking U.S. economic activity predict the U.S. economy actually shrank during the ... More first three months of 2025. Pictured is the Port of Long Beach. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew -0.3% on a quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annual rate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That is the weakest economic growth for the U.S. since 2022’s first quarter. Consensus economist forecasts pegged last quarter’s real GDP growth at 0.4%, according to Dow Jones data, a stark decrease from the prior period’s 2.4% expansion. Data from sources following underlying measures of economic activity suggested Wednesday’s GDP reading could be even worse than that; the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model called for -0.4% GDP during Q1 when excluding gold imports and exports, while Goldman Sachs’ tracker indicates a 0.2% contraction. The BEA said the negative GDP reading “primarily reflected” an increase in imports, which surged as businesses aimed to front run tariffs, and a decrease in government spending. Futures tied to all three major indexes slid Wednesday morning following the GDP report. Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated a 380-point, or 0.9%, drop for the index, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures declined 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively. Negative GDP growth is rare for the U.S., occurring just three times over the last decade: 2020’s first two quarters as the COVID-19 pandemic ground the global economy to a halt, including a record 28% GDP contraction during the second quarter, and Q1 2022, when the Fed enacted its first interest rate hike in more than three years as inflation soared to a multidecade high. The U.S. will be one step closer to entering a recession, at least by one definition. A technical recession occurs when economic output contracts over consecutive quarters, meaning a negative reading during the second quarter would indicate such a downturn. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” meaning consecutive quarters of slightly negative GDP growth may not officially trigger a recession. Some trusted observers of the economy believe the U.S. could already be on the cusp of a recession, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, while major banks largely view it as a tossup whether or not the U.S. enters such a downturn, including the U.S.’ largest bank JPMorgan Chase, whose economists forecast a 60% chance of a recession this year. The GDP reading comes as economists debate the growing disconnect between “hard” and “soft” economic metrics. Hard data such as job growth and retail sales indicate a steady economy while survey-based measures reveal Americans’ faith in the economy has dropped precipitously, as the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment poll revealed the weakest sentiment since July 2022. The disconnect comes as Trump has pursued the most aggressive tariffs since before World War I during the early stages of his second term. The ever-changing nature of Trump’s trade stances have also complicated analysis of the regularly scheduled updates on the U.S. economy. For example, this week’s GDP reading includes data through March 31 – two days before Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement which triggered historic stock market losses, and nine days before Trump backpedaled on many of his most aggressive country-by-country import taxes. “Tariffs function like a tax hike, tighten financial conditions, and increase uncertainty for businesses,” Goldman economists led by David Mericle wrote in a Sunday note to clients, explaining how the levies weigh on GDP growth.

Libre and the TON Foundation are collaborating to create a $500 million Telegram Bond Fund ($TBF) on the TON blockchain, marking one of the largest tokenised corporate debt ventures in history. The RWA narrative just got a huge push as @librecap & TON Foundation are tokenizing $500M of Telegram bonds on TON Blockchain via the Telegram Bond Fund ($TBF)! 🔥 Key points:💼$500M in Telegram bonds on TON🏦Access for institutional & accredited investors⚡Powered by Libre… pic.twitter.com/nXOdSsatKN — TON 💎 (@ton_blockchain) April 30, 2025 In a blog on TON’s website, Max Crown, the CEO of the TON Foundation, underscores that this collaboration “unlocks powerful new opportunities for TON’s community to engage with real-world assets in a secure and accessible way,” solidifying TON’s leadership in regulated asset tokenisation. By digitising a slice of Telegram’s $2.35 billion in outstanding bonds, $TBF offers accredited investors an unprecedented on-chain gateway to institutional-grade fixed-income products with yields reaching up to 9.4%. The new fund introduces seamless subscription, redemption, and transfer capabilities through its multi-phase Libre Gateway infrastructure, leveraging Libre’s proven track record, which has tokenised over $200 million in assets alongside titans like BlackRock and Brevan Howard. With TON’s deep integration into Telegram’s ecosystem of over 950 million users, investors can now access and manage their tokenised bond holdings directly from TON-native wallets, bridging the gap between fiat, stablecoins, and decentralised finance. Through $TBF, tokenised bonds can serve not only as yield-bearing instruments but also as on-chain collateral for borrowing, yield farming, and a growing array of decentralised finance (DeFi) products built on TON’s scalable network. Dr. Jez Mohideen, Chairman of Libre and CEO of Laser Digital, emphasises that TON’s unique symbiosis of mass-market usability and institutional infrastructure creates “a seamless bridge between TradFi and DeFi for a global, digitally native audience.” The launch arrives amid an $18.9 billion surge in real-world asset tokenisation, where corporate debt has historically lagged behind commodities and real estate, positioning $TBF as a catalyst for broader market adoption. By enabling future issuances of Telegram bonds to flow through the same compliant, on-chain framework, Libre and the TON Foundation are laying the groundwork for an enduring ecosystem of digital debt markets. Institutional participants can now tap into a fully on-chain issuance stack that promises transparency, efficiency, and regulatory compliance, while retail users stand to benefit from a new frontier of yield and utility seamlessly embedded in their favourite messaging app. Keep updated with our round the clock and in-depth cryptocurrency news Keep updated with our round the clock and in-depth cryptocurrency news Please be aware that some of the links on this site will direct you to the websites of third parties, some of whom are marketing affiliates and/or business partners of this site and/or its owners, operators and affiliates.

Title: ‘Changing Fast’—Bitcoin Is Suddenly Braced For A $10 Trillion Wall Street ETF Price Boom

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has recovered this month from a sell-off that had threatened to spiral into a full blown price crash—supported by the Federal Reserve quietly priming the bitcoin price and crypto market. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has soared toward $100,000 per bitcoin, up from April lows of around $75,000, as it hurtles toward what bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) giant BlackRock has called a “geopolitical fragmentation megaforce" shock. Now, as a leak reveals growing establishment fears over U.S. president Donald Trump’s bitcoin and crypto plans, Wall Street giants that manage a combined $10 trillion on behalf of clients are predicted to "open for business" on bitcoin this year. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has led the Wall Street rush into bitcoin, helping to ... More boost the bitcoin price. “The big four wirehouses—Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and UBS—control over $10 trillion in client assets, and by and large, these platforms have not yet allowed their advisors to easily access bitcoin ETFs,” Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan wrote in a note, adding he believes “that’s changing fast.” “In fact, I suspect all four wirehouses will be open for business on bitcoin ETFs by the end of the year.” So far, the fleet of spot bitcoin ETFs that took Wall Street by storm last year have not had access to the wirehouses network of financial advisors that offer investment and wealth management services. Last year, Morgan Stanley did allow advisors to pitch BlackRock and Fidelity’s market-leading bitcoin ETFs to clients with a net worth of at least $1.5 million last August but Hougan expects this to open up to the wider market in 2025. “It’s one of the reasons I still expect bitcoin ETFs to set a new record for net inflows this year, despite pulling in “just” $3.7 billion so far in 2025, compared to $35 billion in 2024,” he wrote. The dozen U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs, which rocketed to assets under management of more than $100 billion last year, raked in more than $3 billion last week, according to data from SoSoValue, marking a return to growth after a recent period of outflows that mirrored the stock market’s volatility. The return of inflows to bitcoin ETFs has embolden bullish traders who are betting the bitcoin price could be headed higher. "Bitcoin continues to outperform," David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said via email. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has bounced back from a steep sell-off. "Bitcoin is currently consolidating around $95,000, taking it back within sight of the $100,000 level. Bitcoin’s recent price action may serve as a broader sentiment gauge for risk assets." While traders are feeling upbeat, they have also cautioned the market could retreat back to the mid-$80,000s. “The overall outlook for bitcoin remains bullish,” Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, said in emailed comments. “Right now, bitcoin is pushing toward a new all-time high, but we shouldn’t rule out minor pullbacks as part of a healthy correction–something that naturally accompanies any reasonable growth. At this stage, bitcoin is in a key zone, having just swept liquidity at the top. That makes a short-term correction quite likely. If that happens, it would make sense to expect a retracement into the $86,000–$83,000 range.”

Title: Bitcoin expected to beat stalling US GDP growth trend as Q1 data is released later today

Bitcoin's appeal as a macro hedge grows amid US economic slowdown and inflation concerns. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. [Update: GDP came in well under estimates, contracting by 0.3%.] At 08:30 ET today, the Bureau of Economic Analysis is set to release its advance estimate for US Q1 GDP, with consensus expectations at a 0.3% seasonally adjusted annual rate. If confirmed, this would mark the weakest quarterly print since early 2022 and contrast starkly with the inflow of over $3 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs last week, reflecting what some market participants interpret as a pivot in capital preference toward digital assets amid macroeconomic stagnation. [Editor’s Note: Q1 GDP will not include tariff impact as the cut-off date came before ‘Liberation Day.’] GDP forecasts show a stark divide. The Atlanta Fed’s Nowcast has called a contraction of 2.7%, while the Philadelphia Fed’s model projects growth of 2.5%, last updated on Feb. 14. Regardless of the final figure, the drag from the record goods-trade deficit is a common feature across estimates, with some models attributing up to 1.9 percentage points of negative contribution to it. This trade shortfall appears to be a delayed consequence of tariff front-loading, spurring preemptive imports during the prior quarter. Inventories are expected to be flat, while consumer sentiment continues to deteriorate, hitting a five-year low. Business capital expenditure has also been curtailed. Inflationary persistence further complicates the picture. March’s Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% year-over-year, and the Core PCE index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, stood at 2.8% in February. Interest rate futures now price in over 90% probability of a rate cut by December. Concurrently, Treasury yields have declined and the dollar has weakened, reinforcing stagflation comparisons with the 1970s as economic growth stalls and inflation remains above target. Bitcoin’s market setup diverges notably from the traditional macro picture. Realized capitalization for the top digital asset continues to make new all-time highs, currently at $883 billion and signaling continued inflows despite the pullback from January’s price peak. Data show that approximately 20,000 BTC exited exchanges in the past week, the highest weekly net outflow in two years, primarily driven by whale accumulation of 19,255 BTC. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs captured $3.4 billion in inflows, the third-largest weekly intake to date. BlackRock’s IBIT alone recorded $643 million on April 23, its second-largest single-day inflow. Volatility metrics suggest a broader evolution in market structure. Realized volatility has compressed by roughly 50% from its 2022 peaks, and the volatility spread between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq now sits near cycle lows. This compression has lent credence to characterizations of Bitcoin as a maturing asset class, a view reinforced by VanEck’s observation that its volatility and co-movement profile increasingly resemble that of gold rather than equities. The juxtaposition between a near-stalling US economy and a record-high cumulative invested cost in Bitcoin reflects diverging narratives around capital preservation. The trade deficit drag highlights the limitations of a tariff-distorted goods economy, while Bitcoin’s borderless framework offers a contrasting vehicle for global allocation. The backdrop of tepid growth and elevated inflation has reopened discourse around digital assets as potential stagflation hedges, particularly as ETF demand endures despite recessionary signals. With major funds from the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity continuing to absorb supply, flows into digital assets show resilience that is disconnected from conventional macro indicators. Market participants now look toward the May 1 Core PCE update and next week’s FOMC decision for further clarity on rate trajectory and inflation conditions.

Title: How Stablecoins, Blockchain-Based Payment Networks Could Reshape Global Finance
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesfinancecouncil/2025/04/30/how-stablecoins-blockchain-based-payment-networks-could-reshape-global-finance/
Time Published: 2025-04-30T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByChuck Zhang ByChuck Zhang, Forbes Councils Member. Chuck Zhang, CFO of PolyFlow, Payment Infrastructure for Web3.0. Stablecoins have witnessed a remarkable surge, surpassing a total market value of $230 billion as of this writing. Just five years ago, they were in their infancy. Now, these digital currencies are transforming global finance by simplifying transactions, expediting cross-border trade and facilitating remittances. Stablecoins are digital currencies that are typically pegged to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar (USD) at a 1:1 ratio. They are issued on blockchain networks such as Ethereum and Tron, combining the advantages of blockchain technology with the stability required for practical digital currency applications. According to Visa’s stablecoin dashboard, even after adjusting for automated transactions, stablecoins settled over $6.5 trillion in the past 12 months. Initially serving as a bridge for crypto assets, stablecoins have evolved and are integrating into everyday transactions beyond the crypto market. Traditional financial institutions and regulators are rapidly adopting blockchain technology. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is exploring the idea of a “Finternet,” the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has announced Global Layer One and Deutsche Bank is working on Layer 2 solutions. Asset management giants including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are also experimenting with public blockchains. Stablecoins make value transfer seamless, enabling real-time global transactions at lower costs than traditional banking rails. For consumers, the ability to receive funds instantly with minimal friction is more important than understanding blockchain’s decentralized principles. Just as we use SWIFT without knowing its intricacies, stablecoins can be embedded into mainstream applications, making blockchain an invisible but integral part of payments. The next major trend is the migration of Web2 applications to Web3, similar to how businesses transitioned from desktop to mobile a decade ago. Blockchain-based payments will increasingly be embedded in applications as stablecoin solutions, making digital assets more accessible to the average user. Major financial institutions have validated the rise of stablecoins. PayPal launched PYUSD on a public blockchain, Stripe acquired stablecoin company Bridge for $1.1 billion, Visa partnered with Circle for USDC settlements and Revolut is said to have its own stablecoin plans. Throughout history, the form and function of money have evolved with the times, and in this digital economy era, stablecoins are spreading rapidly. Just as ordinary users can see PYUSD stablecoins in the PayPal apps, in the near future, I expect we will see various stablecoins in more existing mobile payment applications, contributing to the free transfer of value. Some argue that blockchain-based payment networks threaten traditional financial systems. However, the bigger picture suggests that traditional institutions can leverage blockchain for efficiency and cost savings. Through current trends, we can anticipate several points for the future development of stablecoins: The current stablecoin market is dominated by a few major issuers, but this is likely to change. A more fragmented landscape of interoperable stablecoins will likely emerge, similar to how different commercial banks issue dollars. This shift could reduce costs, increase speed and expand access to stablecoin-based payments. As stablecoin issuers multiply, interoperability will become crucial. A new market segment—stablecoin orchestration—will facilitate seamless transactions between different stablecoins, much like how Visa and Mastercard handle fiat transactions. If a customer wants to pay in one stablecoin but a merchant only accepts a different stablecoin, an orchestrator will enable instant conversion. Stripe’s acquisition of Bridge highlights the growing need for such interoperability. Despite the growth of blockchain-based payments, traditional payment systems such as SWIFT and Visa/Mastercard will not disappear overnight. Instead, blockchain solutions will complement legacy systems, integrating innovative technology to enhance financial services while bridging the gap between old and new payment infrastructures. Payment financing (PayFi), the fusion of blockchain payments and decentralized finance (DeFi), represents the next stage of financial evolution. By combining smart contracts with financial services, PayFi could enable new global financial products, including lending, wealth management and investment solutions—all anchored in stablecoin-based payments. This shift would expand financial inclusion and create new revenue streams within the digital economy. While gaining popularity for legitimate applications, stablecoins have also been misused by high-risk and bad actors for illicit activities such as money laundering and sanctions evasion. Their stable value and global accessibility make them appealing to those seeking to circumvent financial regulations and avoid detection. The healthy development of the stablecoin ecosystem requires coordinated efforts among international regulators. Clear regulations are essential, and the progression of the U.S. Stable Act is expected to encourage more traditional financial institutions to engage in the compliant stablecoin market, thereby further fostering the industry’s healthy and positive growth. Stablecoins are ushering in an era of permissionless, scalable and instant payments, lowering friction and unlocking new business opportunities. As traditional payments, stablecoins and blockchain networks continue to integrate, stablecoins will play a central role in cross-border fund transfers, digital capital markets and financial services for underbanked populations. While blockchain technology moves behind the scenes, stablecoins are taking center stage.

BlackRock sets a $3 million minimum for blockchain-enabled shares in its money market fund. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has made additional moves to incorporate blockchain technology into its traditional finance operations. According to an April 28 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the firm seeks approval to introduce a blockchain-enabled share class, referred to as “DLT Shares,” tied to its $150 billion money market fund. According to the filing, The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) will manage the sale of these shares and maintain a mirrored record of ownership using blockchain technology. The filing stated: “DLT Shares may also be purchased by BlackRock Advisors, LLC or its affiliates. Although the Fund does not currently employ blockchain technology or invest in crypto assets, DLT Shares are expected to be purchased and held through BNY, which intends to use blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for its customers.” The filing did not name the blockchain network the bank would utilize. However, it has used Ethereum in the past. Meanwhile, the minimum investment for this new share class is $3 million. The fund will allocate its assets across US Treasury securities, including bills, notes, and similar obligations. It will focus on short-term investments, maintaining a dollar-weighted average maturity of no more than 60 days and an average life of under 120 days. BlackRock’s latest move reflects its increasing interest in blockchain technology, especially following the success of its Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and BUIDL fund. The unprecedented success of these products has resulted in industry leaders forecasting long-term dominance for BlackRock’s ETFs. Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), recently suggested that the firm’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) could become the largest ETF globally within the next ten years. Beyond ETFs, BlackRock is also actively working on asset tokenization. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has outlined a vision where all assets, including stocks and real estate, are digitized and transacted via blockchain. According to him: “Some investments produce much higher returns than others, but only big investors can get into them. One reason? Friction. Legal, operational, bureaucratic. Tokenization strips that away, allowing more people access to potentially higher returns.” Notably, BlackRock is already utilizing these ideas through its blockchain-native BUIDL fund, which was launched in partnership with Securitize in 2024. The fund manages over $2.5 billion in tokenized assets and has expanded operations to several blockchain networks, including Solana, Avalanche, and Ethereum layer-2 networks like Optimism.

Title: MF1’s Scott Waynebern and Eric Draeger on Carving a Multifamily Lending Niche
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2025/04/mf1-scott-waynebern-eric-draeger-multifamily/
Time Published: 2025-04-30T10:00:18Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Scott Waynebern’s Midtown South Manhattan office serves as an homage to his commercial real estate finance journey — up to and including the launch eight years ago of multifamily lender MF1 as a joint venture between Limekiln Real Estate and Berkshire Residential Investments. Waynebern has a series of must-read books on the shelves of his open office setup for anyone pursuing a career in lending, such as The Big Short by Michael Lewis and Larry Silverstein’s The Rising, that spotlight some of the market cycles and crashes that have transpired over the course of his more than 30-year CRE career, starting as a senior analyst at Salomon Brothers. “The office is meant to share, and I believe strongly in transparency, communication and mentorship,” Waynebern said. “These books about the purchase and financing of the GM Building or about Peter Cooper Village or the World Trade Center or long-term capital management can show the younger generation that these stories they hear about, that seem too fantastic to be true, really did happen, so it serves as a bit of a lending library.” After five years at Salomon Brothers, Waynebern joined Deutsche Bank in 1996 and spent 14 years with the investment banking giant heading up real estate capital markets and its CRE special situations group. It was at Deutsche Bank that Waynebern met Eric Draeger, chief investment officer at Berkshire, setting the stage for the eventual creation of MF1. Following a two-year stint as president of Limekiln, Waynebern became head of CRE at Benefit Street Partners. It was there while lending within multiple property sectors that he decided a strictly multifamily route was the best path forward. He restarted Limekiln and linked up with Draeger to form MF1. The duo have been thriving while focusing exclusively on residential rental assets, closing $4 billion of multifamily loans for the year ending March 1, 2025, a 48 percent yearly bump. Waynebern and Draeger, who is based in Boston, met with Commercial Observer on April 8 at MF1’s Manhattan office at 41 Madison Avenue to discuss the origins of the alternative lender, the experience of navigating challenging markets like 2008’s Global Financial Crisis (GFC), and the decision to lean all in on multifamily lending. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Commercial Observer: What was your initial path into working in commercial real estate finance? Scott Waynebern: I did a year of business school at Kellogg in Chicago, and the CEO of Freddie Mac at the time [Leland C. Brendsel] sponsored a securitization symposium one night a week. He had an incredible group of people like Larry Fink [CEO of BlackRock] come out to Chicago and present to us. This was in 1996 at the beginning of this big wave of securitization, and that helped inspire me a little bit. I was familiar with it from my time at Salomon Brothers, but that really clued me into it. I then started at Deutsche Bank after business school, and because it was an open playing field — just as Deutsche Bank was starting their fixed- income business — I was able to say to them “I’ve got very good qualitative skills but I’m not good enough at math to compete on Treasurys or mortgages. But there’s this new product, CMBS, which looks like a great mix of them where you need to be pretty good at both.” Being somebody who lived in New York and was fascinated by New York real estate, it seemed really tangible and exciting. And, because it was the early days of Deutsche Bank in that training program, I was able to say I wanted to work on that desk. So, you knew you wanted to work in finance but weren’t sure about commercial real estate finance until later? Waynebern: That’s right. And what was incredible is, if you go back, there was such a deep crash in real estate from the changing of the tax rules and the savings and loan crisis in the late `80s, early `90s. On the rebound from that crisis there was a magnet for talent with a lot of people I went to college with or grew up with in the early `90s being pulled into commercial real estate. That actually helped create a pretty amazing network. Eric Draeger: I did not intend to do real estate. At Northwestern I took a class in real estate and didn’t like it. I went to work for a law firm and I was the only one who could do real math, so I ended up working on financing real estate with the partners. My wife was living in London at the same time Scott was working there, coincidentally, and I was going to see her and then stopped in Chicago to meet the originator who did the loans for us and had dinner with him. When I came back, he asked if I could have dinner again and offered me a job and I took it. My first year was at Berkshire Mortgage in Chicago. I moved to Boston about a year later and have been in multifamily finance ever since. How did you two begin working together? Waynebern: In 2004, the team I was a part of at Deutsche Bank bought Berkshire Mortgage from founding owners George and Douglas Krupp, and Eric and I worked very closely together in terms of integrating that business into this broad global commercial real estate finance platform. At the first post-merger integration meeting, I stood up in front of all of Berkshire Mortgage and said, “You’re part of a trillion-dollar bank balance sheet now, so what do you want?” And every originator’s hand shot up and said, “We want bridge loans to compete with the banks that have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac licenses that can also provide this other product.” Eric and I and his partner Jon Pfeil and a couple other folks put together a program to originate multifamily bridge loans in support of a Fannie and Freddie lender which was then owned by Deutsche Bank. We didn’t start lending until the absolute peak of the market in 2006 to 2007. We did have the foresight to stop lending relatively early in 2007 after a really legendary meeting with one of the chief credit guys at Freddie Mac, who told us this market doesn’t look good anymore. We came home and cut off the lending but we didn’t lose any money, despite lending at the absolute top of the market and going into the epic GFC crash. When the opportunity presented itself in 2017 to put the band back together again and do the same program, that was the idea behind MF1. In 2018, MF1 had not made a loan yet and today we have more bridge loans on our book than any publicly traded commercial mortgage REIT. It’s because we’ve scaled businesses before, and we learned what to do and, probably more importantly, what not to do. What was the process like of starting MF1 in 2017? Waynebern: It came together shockingly fast. For a variety of reasons it was time to move on from Benefit Street Partners. As I was thinking about what to do next, I was thinking if I wanted to do something like that again — doing every asset class and multiple types of lending — and somebody asked me a question. They said, “What if you only had $250 million of equity — what would be your best idea or two?” I said, “That’s easy, it would be a multifamily bridge loan business.” The second question was asking ourselves “Who do we want to partner with?” and that’s when we said, “Let’s run it back.” We had a choice at the time of basically “I’ll write you essentially a half-a-billion-dollar equity check to beta test the business and then go out and run a fund” or we could do it with Berkshire without a big check up front — but with trust because it’s so core to what they do. Also, we worked together in good times and in a crisis, and I wanted to do it again. I think most people’s advice is to take the money, but I wanted to make sure it really worked. Draeger: The other thing to add to that is we both understand the other side. Theoretically, I’m real estate and he’s capital markets, but we both can do each other’s jobs. When you speak the same language it makes it a lot easier to understand what the other person is saying. What led to your strict focus on multifamily? Waynebern: I made a top-down credit call in 2017 for the Limekiln business to short office, retail and hotel. And the reason was that I felt like I no longer knew how to underwrite office. I didn’t think it was necessarily going down, but I just knew I didn’t understand it anymore. Layered on top of that was unknowns about the uses of office and whether it was server rooms disappearing in favor of the cloud, or people sitting closer together and knowing there’s going to be less space per employee. I also knew how difficult it was for my team to underwrite retail with all the questions I had about space becoming available. When it came to the multifamily sector, we had a lot of connectivity and a connection with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, because at Deutsche Bank we were the only big bank with a really active Fannie-Freddie business. Freddie Mac hired Eric and I to be the bankers to shepherd them into the CMBS world. We helped them create the K-series [Freddie Mac’s CMBS business] and, as part of that, we ended up purchasing the first Freddie Mac B-piece in the summer 2009 — the absolute bottom of the GFC. Fifty percent went into a vehicle I controlled at Deutsche Bank, and the other 50 percent went into the Krupp family real estate investment trust. So that was kind of a landmark transaction not only for each of our careers and each of our organizations, but, frankly, for the multifamily sector and commercial real estate sector as that Freddie Mac program became the single biggest thing in the CMBS market. If you believed in multifamily credit enough to buy subordinate, securitized risk in August of 2009, that shows a lot of conviction. When we came together, we said we’re going to work together on all things housing, but agreed to separately compete in the Freddie Mac B-piece space. We have been active buyers of subordinate multifamily risk in that market consistently since 2009. Which geographic markets are drawing the most focus in multifamily now? Draeger: We tend to close more loans in areas we’ve been to, so we’re going to be in the top 30 markets more than not because that’s where the assets are. But we are relatively agnostic and will do multifamily housing in all of the U.S. What is your outlook on the Sun Belt multifamily market with some of the oversupply issues that have popped up over the last couple of years? Draeger: Our outlook is positive. Supply was definitely an issue for the last couple of years, but demand was amazingly strong as well, so nobody talks about that side of the equation. We’re seeing, generally speaking, recovery to almost normalization, so you aren’t seeing widespread issues on the supply-demand side even though there are some pockets in markets. There are definitely some markets that are softer, and we think those will improve as construction is slowing down pretty dramatically. We’ve been lending in the South, and are generally very positive about our performance. What’s your expectations for the demand for private credit as banks come back into the fold with lending? Draeger: There’s a need for all capital sources, from the safest to the most aggressive, so there is a wide range. I think everyone’s got their niche. The banks are going to play and we have seen more competition, but they’re going to play probably more to their footprints in areas they know, and follow some of the customers. With private credit we can do something a little bit different and it can be a little more creative. Waynebern: The banks are undergoing multiple changes, and one of the big ones is the capital rules. I think my experience at Salomon Brothers and working on their balance sheet and Deutsche Bank saying, “Let’s use the balance sheet really efficiently,” gave me a real insight into capital usage and return on equity within the bank. So, when you look at it now with the way the capital rules have changed, there’s a massive advantage to a bank being a lender to us and getting their exposure to commercial real estate via loan on loan, or a warehouse line versus direct lending. If you do the math, a lower spread being lent to us but using less equity will generate a higher return on equity for the bank than them making that same loan directly at a higher spread. That has changed over the seven years we’ve been doing this, and we’ve been a real beneficiary of that. What are your near-term or long-term goals for MF1? Waynebern: Our goal is to be the pre-eminent private lender to multifamily. To date, we have been almost exclusively originating floating-rate loans. We’ve closed our first few fixed-rate loans this year. We anticipated this year a shape of the curve where people would want fixed rate, and that hasn’t been the case. At some point, rates in the curve will move to where people want fixed rate, and we want to be prepared for that. Our goal is to keep adding new products to meet the demands of our customers. What do you enjoy outside of work? Waynebern: We enjoy golfing together and golf in general. Also playing sports with our kids. We are also both big basketball fans.

April 30, 2025 06:00 ET | Source: FrontFundr FrontFundr TORONTO, April 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FrontFundr, Canada’s leading equity crowdfunding platform, today unveiled its 2024 Community Capital Report, showcasing a groundbreaking year that signals a major shift in Canada’s private investing landscape. In 2024, the platform facilitated an impressive $68.3 million in capital across 66 successful campaigns, more than doubling the amount raised in 2023. This milestone marks a turning point in how Canadians are engaging with private markets and demonstrates the growing appeal of equity crowdfunding. Since its launch in 2015 through December 31, 2024, FrontFundr facilitated over $258 million in capital through nearly 28,000 investments through its online platform, solidifying its leadership in Canada’s fast-growing equity crowdfunding sector. The platform now holds an impressive 93% market share under the National Instrument 45-110 Startup Crowdfunding (prospectus) Exemption, underscoring its pivotal role in democratizing access to capital for early-stage companies. Noteworthy campaigns in 2024 include Blossom Social, which raised $1.35 million in just 3.5 days, and Edison Motors, which secured $2.4 million in 2024 alone—setting new benchmarks for crowdfunding success in Canada. "Equity crowdfunding is no longer a niche alternative; it’s becoming a central component of how Canadians invest in the future they want to build," said Peter-Paul Van Hoeken, Founder and CEO of FrontFundr. "Our growth reflects a broader movement toward the retailization of private markets, empowering the public to participate, providing emerging companies better access to capital, and creating a more inclusive financial system." Key highlights from the 2024 report include: Platform innovations—including a streamlined investment journey, the launch of FrontFundr Elite Circle, and a partnership with StartEngine to access U.S. Accredited Investor-only opportunities—helped boost average investment size by 17% and nearly double new investor sign-ups. “This report captures a pivotal moment for Canada’s private markets,” said Trieste Reading, VP of Growth at FrontFundr. “2024 wasn’t just a breakout year for FrontFundr — it signaled a broader shift in how Canadians think about investing and ownership. Canadians are stepping up to back the businesses and causes they care about — and that’s changing the future of finance.” The release of the 2024 Community Capital Report comes at a time of growing global momentum to expand access to private markets. This shift was underscored by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s 2025 annual letter, which called for democratizing private market opportunities so everyday investors—not just the wealthy—can benefit from the returns of economic growth. As FrontFundr approaches its 10th anniversary in 2025, the platform remains steadfast in its mission to open doors for all Canadians to invest in businesses that reflect their values and shape the future.

Dubbed the Telegram Bond Fund, the product allows institutional and accredited investors to gain exposure to Telegram’s outstanding bonds directly through the TON blockchain, according to a statement shared with Decrypt. The fund will also participate in future Telegram bond offerings and serve as collateral for borrowing and yield-generating strategies within the TON ecosystem. The TON Foundation says the launch is one of DeFi’s largest institutional RWA moves to date, in a sector projected to exceed $50 billion this year. The fund will be issued and managed using Libre’s infrastructure, which supports fiat and stablecoin subscriptions, redemptions, and secondary transfers under regulatory oversight. Investors will manage assets directly through TON-native wallets, according to Libre and the TON Foundation. TON, originally developed by Telegram, has operated independently since 2020 under the TON Foundation after regulatory pressure forced the company to abandon direct involvement. The Telegram app continues to integrate features that interact with the TON blockchain, including wallet access and username auctions. Both parties have said further regulated asset offerings are in development, with plans to expand tokenized access to a broader range of global financial products in the coming months. The Telegram Bond Fund has no connection to Libre, the Solana meme coin that briefly surged during the 2024 Argentine presidential campaign involving Javier Milei. Libre, the infrastructure provider in this offering, is a separate, regulated entity focused on institutional finance. The firm has previously tokenized over $200 million in assets from major institutions, including asset managers such as BlackRock, Brevan Howard, Hamilton Lane, and Nomura’s digital asset arm, Laser Digital. These tokenized funds will also become available on TON, providing access to a broader suite of institutional-grade financial products. “This collaboration brings together omni-chain institutional-grade infrastructure and mass-market blockchain usability,” said Dr. Jez Mohideen, Chairman of Libre and CEO of Laser Digital. Rising RWA popularity The launch comes amid a period of rising activity in the RWA space. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury product, has crossed over $2.5 billion in market capitalization, according to Dune Analytics data. The fund, launched last March in partnership with Securitize, has expanded across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Polygon. Stablecoin issuer Circle recently acquired Hashnote, the manager of the $1.25 billion USYC fund, with plans to connect it to its USDC ecosystem. In the Middle East, Dubai-based developer DAMAC signed a $1 billion deal with Mantra, a Layer-1 blockchain for RWAs, to tokenize real estate, data centers, and other physical assets. The total value locked in RWA protocols now exceeds $11.14 billion, more than doubling in the past year, according to DeFiLlama data. This shows the growing interest in firms for bringing traditional financial products like U.S. Treasuries, corporate bonds, and real estate into blockchain ecosystems that historically focused on crypto-native assets. The tokenized U.S. Treasury market has experienced significant growth, with a total value locked of approximately $6.16 billion, RWA.xyz data shows.

While we may not drill for oil, mine coal, or produce gas, Ireland has become a tax-friendly financial gateway for some of the most destructive industries on the planet, making us complicit in fuelling the global climate emergency. A new report released today, titled The Hidden Truth: Ireland’s Role in the Global Fossil Fuel Industry and based on research by ActionAid Ireland and Trócaire, reveals that as of June 2024, an astonishing €31 billion in fossil fuel investments were held by Irish-based financial institutions. Even more disturbing, 91% of that investment is tied to companies actively expanding fossil fuel operations in direct defiance of international scientific consensus on the need to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Trócaire and ActionAid witness the unequal impact of the climate crisis in the communities we work with every day, who are on the frontlines of the climate crisis, despite contributing the least to its causes. This is a profound climate injustice. Devastating floods, storms, cyclones, droughts, famine, biodiversity loss and ecosystem breakdowns are having a disastrous impact on the lives of billions of people worldwide. Climate disasters leave a litany of human rights impacts as livelihoods are destroyed, including disproportionately harming young girls and their access to education. 12-year-old Miriam from rural Guatemala and her family had their income decimated by a recent drought, which destroyed their crops. Miriam was due to go to secondary school, an hour drive away, but her parents cannot now afford the €5 a week for the bus that would take her there. File photo: Oil refinery Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Fossil fuels — coal, oil, and gas — account for over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and nearly 90% of carbon dioxide emissions. They are the primary driver of climate change. But for investors, they remain staggeringly profitable, both for companies and their investors. That’s why billions continue to be funnelled through Ireland to the very companies accelerating planetary collapse. Our report names some of the financial heavyweights with significant fossil fuel-related holdings domiciled in Ireland. The top three firms are: BlackRock (€18.4 billion), State Street (€4.3 billion) and Crédit Agricole (€2.1 billion). Advertisement File photo - Ocean Rebellion activists stage a dramatic demonstration outside Unitied Nations agency. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Ireland’s status as a conduit for climate-wrecking capital is the result of deliberate policy decisions and the outcome of our Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) model and weak national and EU regulations. The Irish government argues that financial flows are regulated under EU directives. But these frameworks are woefully inadequate. They focus on transparency and minimal incentives for greener investments, not on curbing fossil fuel financing. Even those modest rules are now under threat, as the European Commission rolls back green finance and corporate sustainability initiatives, just as global fossil fuel use and emissions reach record highs. A woman is holding a placard Make Polluters Pay in front of SUV luxury car in London , UK. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Far from transitioning, the fossil fuel industry is entrenching itself, and so are its investors. Our report reveals that BlackRock, which had over €18 billion in fossil fuel investments routed through Ireland in 2024, is also pulling back on previous sustainability pledges. There is no credible path to climate justice if financial flows to fossil fuels, including those channelled through Ireland, are not stopped. This means direct regulation of financial institutions, requiring them to adopt and implement transition plans aligned with the Paris Agreement. Ireland has both a responsibility and an opportunity to lead. By ending its role as an enabler of destructive fossil fuel investments and regulating investment through a lens of human rights and environmental due diligence, we can begin to put justice and sustainability at the centre of our financial system. Given its position as a hub for multinational financial institutions, we are calling on the Government to regulate the private financial sector to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement and end our outsized role as an enabler of fossil fuel investment. This includes prohibiting investments in projects that expand coal, oil, and gas production, as well as investments in the companies behind the expansion.

Such a law should include the regulation of investors with respect to human rights and the environment and climate. Globally, we should support the creation of a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty to halt expansion and ensure a fair, funded global phase-out of fossil fuels. In addition, new taxes at both the EU and national levels can mobilise funds for climate justice, including wealth taxes, climate damage taxes on investors, and levies on aviation and shipping. And we can support debt cancellation and advocate for a UN framework for sovereign debt to give countries on the frontline of the climate crisis the breathing room to address the crisis. Planet earth with a conceptual arctic melting from global warming. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo Currently, the climate crisis is accelerating faster than political action to curb climate breakdown. Without urgent structural transformation, including a rapid global phase-out of fossil fuels, the world is on track for 2.6°C to 3.1°C of warming by 2100. Scientists have warned that this trajectory would be catastrophic, rendering vast regions uninhabitable. Ireland has the power to become a leader in climate justice. We can no longer afford to look away while billions flow through our financial system into the industries destroying our planet. It’s time to stop fuelling climate chaos and to start building a future that’s fair and sustainable for all. Caoimhe de Barra is CEO of Trócaire and Karol Balfe is CEO of ActionAid Ireland.

Title: More than €31bn in fossil fuel investments ‘based in Ireland’

Almost €32 billion in fossil fuel investment was held by Irish-based subsidiaries of finance companies last year, a new report claims. The sheer level of money involved ranks Ireland 14th in global terms and renders the State a “key global centre for investment”. The research report, The Hidden Truth: Ireland’s Role in the Global Fossil Fuel Industry, is published by Trócaire and ActionAid Ireland on Wednesday. The organisations are calling for direct regulation of financial institutions that would require them to adopt and implement transition plans aligned with the Paris Agreement on climate. “Ireland is facilitating the reckless pursuit of profit by financial institutions and corporations, which continue to pursue further expansion of oil and gas in spite of all the warnings and at the expense of the planet,” said Siobhán Curran, Trócaire’s head of policy and advocacy. “The carbon footprint of these financial flows is bigger than Ireland’s yearly emissions. This completely undermines efforts that are being taken to reduce emissions and ... means Ireland is playing an outsize role in fuelling the climate crisis.” ExxonMobil, which, according to the report, had €33.6 billion in profits in 2023, is singled out as the top fossil fuel investment held by asset managers based in Ireland. It also claims that, in 2023, such investments generated an estimated 72.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, more than the levels produced nationally. Tax and corporate regulation reforms at EU level are called for given that the regulation of the financial sector “remains weak and fragmented”. According to the authors, 91 per cent of investments made here were to companies that have plans for fossil fuel expansion. “Ireland may not have a domestic fossil fuel industry, but it is clear we are deeply complicit in fuelling the global climate emergency, providing a tax-friendly financial gateway for some of the most destructive industries on the planet,” said Karol Balfe, chief executive of ActionAid Ireland. The report states that, in monetary terms, as of June 2024, Irish-based subsidiaries of investment companies held €31.76 billion in bonds and shares issued by fossil fuel firms. “Ireland ranks 14th globally in terms of fossil fuel investment by manager location,” it notes. “Alongside Switzerland, Ireland is one of the only two jurisdictions with such significant fossil fuel investments without having a big fossil fuel industry of its own.” The largest volume of investments via Ireland includes US asset manager BlackRock with €18.9 billion, the report claims. US peer State Street was found to have €4.4 billion, and French banking conglomerate Crédit Agricole €2.1 billion. The report is critical of the State’s foreign direct investment policy which it identifies as a contributing factor in cultivating a financial landscape that facilitates capital movement.

Title: Bitcoin Vs. Ethereum: BlackRock CIO Ends The Debate

Time Published: 2025-04-30T03:30:03Z
Full Content:
As BlackRock accelerates its expansion into digital assets in 2025, the divergence between Bitcoin and Ethereum in institutional adoption has become increasingly pronounced. In a interview on the Empire podcast, Samara Cohen, Senior Managing Director and Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index Investments at BlackRock, offered a rare window into how the world’s largest asset manager views the two largest crypto assets — and why Bitcoin stands decisively ahead of Ethereum in client demand and portfolio integration. BlackRock’s historic launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) marked a pivotal moment in the firm’s digital asset strategy. “It was all three of those things,” Cohen said, referring to the factors that drove the Bitcoin product launch. “But it really did start with the investment thesis and client demand to market structure and readiness to obviously the regulatory backdrop.” Cohen emphasized that before any regulatory greenlight, BlackRock’s decision was rooted in the strong desire from investors to access Bitcoin as part of diversified portfolios. The launch of IBIT was not BlackRock’s first move into Bitcoin. In 2022, the firm introduced a private Bitcoin trust for institutional clients, a critical internal milestone. “We didn’t get hands-on to actual Bitcoin until we launched that institutional product in 2022,” Cohen explained. “That was a very important institutional moment for us to just get comfortable with the workflows and the risk management and the systems.” The demand for Bitcoin was both broader and deeper than many had anticipated. IBIT has become the most successful ETP launch in history, a fact Cohen attributes in part to a previously untapped segment of investors. “Broadly speaking, about half of IBIT’s holders right now are what we call self-directed investors,” she noted. “For 3/4 of that population, they set up a brokerage account in some cases and bought their first ETP because they wanted their Bitcoin in the ETP wrapper.” This stands in sharp contrast to Ethereum, where Cohen’s tone was notably more cautious. While BlackRock has also launched Ethereum-based ETPs, demand has been far less robust. “Ethereum is still a distant second,” she said when discussing institutional investor interest. Unlike Bitcoin, which is increasingly viewed as a potential store of value and a diversifying asset class, Ethereum’s investment thesis has yet to solidify at the institutional level. Cohen elaborated on the complexity institutions face when evaluating Ethereum. “You might be really bullish on the utility of the public Ethereum blockchain but not know how that translates into value accrual to the native token,” she said. This uncertainty complicates the case for broad-based adoption. While Bitcoin’s narrative as a “borderless store of value” is relatively straightforward, Ethereum’s positioning remains more opaque, intertwining technological utility with questions about token economics, competition, and long-term market dynamics. Beyond the narrative gap, Cohen identified a more structural obstacle: crypto’s general lack of standardized data and metrics. “Crypto does broadly have a data and standards problem,” she stated. Drawing comparisons to traditional markets, Cohen emphasized that metrics like cash flow, governance, and team transparency — critical components for equity investing — are largely absent or inconsistent across most crypto assets. “If I think about indexing fundamentally as an organizing technology for a market, how do you perform that task in crypto right now?” she asked rhetorically, highlighting how foundational standards remain missing even in leading crypto ecosystems. Bitcoin’s adoption, by contrast, is supported by clearer metrics around its scarcity, issuance schedule, and market infrastructure maturity, making it easier to fit into traditional portfolio models. Cohen confirmed that BlackRock recommends a 1–2% Bitcoin allocation for investors seeking exposure, rooted in detailed analysis of risk contribution to portfolios. “If you go beyond 2%, the incremental contribution to overall portfolio volatility gets exponentially higher,” she warned. While Ethereum continues to make technological strides — particularly in decentralized finance and onchain applications — BlackRock’s view, at least for now, reflects the reality that institutions require clarity, standardization, and well-defined valuation models before committing meaningful capital. As Cohen summarized, “Understanding how to create a valuation framework for Ethereum or any other token gets more complicated.” At press time, BTC traded at $95,120.

Title: Ireland among top countries enabling investment in fossil fuels

Stock image. Photo: PA Irish branches of international financial institutions are facilitating billions of euro in investments in expanding fossil-­fuel operations around the world, new research shows. The analysis found the largely Dublin-­based operations held more than €31bn in oil, gas and other fossil-fuel investments last year. More than 90pc of those investments were in companies that are continuing or expanding oil and gas exploration. That is despite global pledges by governments to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions, for which fossil fuels are the primary source. The research was carried out for Trócaire and ActionAid Ireland, which are calling on the Government to stop private finance flowing through Ireland to fossil-fuel companies. Ireland enacted the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act in 2018 which pulled public money out of fossil fuels by prohibiting the state-owned Strategic Investment Fund from buying shares in them. However, the rules do not apply to private companies that either invest directly in fossil fuels or act on behalf of investors. Trócaire and ActionAid will meet politicians in Leinster House today to present their report and ask for amendments to the law. “The findings in this report are shocking,” ActionAid Ireland chief executive Karol Balfe said. “Ireland may not have a domestic fossil fuel industry, but it is clear we are deeply complicit in fuelling the global climate emergency, providing a tax-friendly ­financial gateway for some of the most destructive industries on the planet.” The report found that Ireland ranked 14th in the world in terms of managing international fossil-fuel investments. That puts Ireland ahead of much ­larger countries such as Russia, Kuwait and Brazil, which are major ­fossil-fuel ­producers. It calculated that the investments that flowed through Ireland in 2023 fuelled 72.5 million tonnes (mt) of carbon emissions – 10.5mt more than Ireland’s total national emissions for the year. Ms Balfe said none of this activity could be justified in countries that had signed up to the landmark Paris Agreement on cutting global emissions. “There is no credible path to climate safety if financial flows to fossil fuels, including those channelled through Ireland, are not shut down,” she said. “This means direct regulation of financial institutions, requiring them to adopt and implement transition plans aligned with the Paris Agreement.” Siobhán Curran, of Trócaire, said the aid agency was seeing first-hand the impacts of the continued support of the fossil-fuel industry in countries suffering severe droughts, floods, population displacement and other deadly effects of climate change. The Irish-based operations identified as holding the biggest investments in fossil fuels include BlackRock and State Street, both US-owned; Credit Agricole (France); Marsh McLennan (US); Intesa Sanpaolo (Italy); Banco Mediolanum (Italy); Power Corporation of Canada; Neuberger Berman (US); ­FinecoBank (Italy); and Zurich Insurance (Switzerland).

Title: The Next Wealth Revolution: How Circular Business Models Are Redefining Growth
URL: https://observer.com/2025/04/circular-economy-business-strategy/
Time Published: 2025-04-29T18:30:59Z
Full Content:
For much of the industrial era, the global economy has operated on a deceptively simple model: extract resources, produce goods and dispose of the rest. This linear system, known as “take-make-waste,” thrived under the illusion that resources were abundant, cheap and endlessly available. That era is over. The numbers are striking: global annual material consumption surpassed 100 billion tons in 2023, yet only 7.2 percent of that is cycled back into the economy. Municipal solid waste is projected to nearly double to 3.8 billion tons by 2050. This inefficiency isn’t just an environmental crisis; it’s a market failure. But within that failure lies a historic opportunity. Circular business models, which design out waste and keep materials in use, are emerging as the next great engine of value creation.

You can opt out anytime. Volatility in commodity markets is making it harder to rely on linear supply chains. Lithium prices, for example, rose by more than 1,000 percent between 2020 and late 2022, before dropping 86 percent as oversupply hit the market. That level of price fluctuation creates serious challenges for companies dependent on raw materials. It’s prompting a strategic rethink: increasingly, businesses are turning to circular solutions like integrating battery recycling directly into manufacturing operations. What was once viewed as waste is now considered a valuable, underutilized resource. In 2015, Accenture estimated that circular business models could generate up to $4.5 trillion in additional economic output by 2030. That forecast is proving increasingly realistic. Recycling aluminum, for example, requires 95 percent less energy than producing it from raw materials, and around 75 percent of all aluminum ever made is still in circulation. In manufacturing, remanufacturing components to original specifications can reduce production costs by 40 to 60 percent, lowering exposure to raw material volatility. The shift to circular models isn’t just about doing less harm—it’s unlocking real business potential. In consumer tech, Back Market has built one of the fastest-growing marketplaces for refurbished electronics, reaching a $5.7 billion valuation and reporting 45 percent revenue growth to €320 million ($363 million) in 2023. It’s now on track to profitability in Europe. In luxury fashion, Vestiaire Collective is proving that resale is far from niche, with €157 million ($178 million) in revenue and over €824 million ($936 million) in goods traded in 2023. Both are tapping into demand for high-quality, lower-impact alternatives—and showing how circular strategies can open new avenues for growth. The climate case for circularity is just as strong. According to Circle Economy’s 2024 report, nearly 40 percent of global emissions come from how we extract, use and dispose of materials. More than a supply chain issue, it’s a major driver of the climate crisis. Circular strategies, by keeping materials in use and cutting waste, can eliminate a significant share of those emissions. For companies looking to meet net-zero targets, circularity is fast becoming a core lever for decarbonization. Investors are increasingly recognizing the potential of the circular economy. In 2023, venture capital funding for circular economy startups reached approximately $8.7 billion. While this accounts for a small share of overall VC activity, the pace of growth signals rising interest in scalable, sustainability-driven innovation. Institutional investors are also entering the space; for instance, BlackRock (BLK) has launched a dedicated Global Circular Economy ETF to capitalize on this transition.​ Startup innovation is driving this momentum. U.S.-based Loop Industries is advancing depolymerization technology to recycle PET plastic at high quality, securing €20 million ($20.8 million) in December 2024 in strategic investment and licensing its technology in Europe. Similarly, Ecovative Design, a biomaterials company founded in 2007, has raised $155 million. Ecovative is commercializing mycelium-based alternatives to leather and packaging, demonstrating that bio-based circular materials can compete in food and fashion markets. All of this is further accelerated by geopolitics. The pandemic, war in Ukraine and surging trade tensions have exposed the fragility of global supply chains. Companies now recognize that resource resilience is a core business concern. Circular business models—such as localized remanufacturing, material recovery and reverse logistics—help reduce dependence on volatile imports and create more stable, regional value loops. In response, major players are acting. Apple (AAPL) has committed to using 100 percent recycled cobalt in batteries by 2025. IKEA is rolling out resale programs for furniture and investing in circular design. Michelin has shifted to a tire-as-a-service model for fleet clients—optimizing usage, extending product life and creating long-term customer relationships. Caterpillar’s remanufacturing division has proven that reusing components not only reduces waste, but also increases margin and customer retention. These examples aren’t exceptions, they’re early indicators of where the market is heading. They prove that the business case is no longer theoretical, and that the environmental impact case and business case can go hand in hand. Still, transitioning to circularity requires intent, strategic foresight and ultimately also investments. Crucially, it also calls for thinking and acting in ecosystems—where no company operates in isolation—and leveraging the power of evolving digital technologies to track, trace and optimize circular flows. It means rethinking product design, developing take-back systems, forming cross-industry collaborations and embedding lifecycle thinking into strategy. The payoff is compelling: lower risk, greater efficiency, stronger brand equity and real climate impact. For leaders, the question is not whether circularity matters, but whether your organization is ready to compete in a world that demands it. The companies that succeed in the next decade will create more value from fewer resources, deliver services over volume and turn yesterday’s waste into tomorrow’s growth. As we look ahead, it’s clear that the circular economy is a wealth creation engine. Those who innovate and invest now will define the next era of market leadership.

Title: Oxy Taps A.I. To Help Inject Old Oilfields With Carbon Dioxide

Full Content:
ByChristopher Helman ByChristopher Helman, Forbes Staff. Vicki Hollub ran operations in the Permian basin for Oxy before becoming CEO. She posed for Forbes in 2017. Occidental Petroleum’s conventional oilfields in the Permian basin of west Texas have been producing for decades. And although output has slowed, there remains 2 billion barrels of oil still trapped thousands of feet below the surface. Engineers have figured out several methods over the years to scour out stubborn oil from nooks and crannies in the reservoir rock (think of a sponge but with much tighter pore spaces). One involves strategically injecting water below the level of the oil in order to flush it out. After water, in some fields the engineers turn to injecting steam, which further softens up stubborn crude oil. For its old fields in the Permian, Oxy has big plans to deploy an even more effective solvent: carbon dioxide. Chief Executive Vicki Hollub — speaking last week at a conference organized by the Harold Hamm Institute for American Energy at Oklahoma State University in Oklahoma City — said that CO2 molecules have been proven to be considerably more effective than steam at scouring oil out of the rock. Especially compelling: the CO2 remains trapped in the rock, taking the place of the oil. Ironically, although carbon dioxide surrounds us, it’s hard to find it in concentrated form. Oxy for years has pumped CO2 out of the ground from naturally occurring reservoirs in Colorado and New Mexico, then sent it by pipeline to the Permian, where they then pressurize and inject the gas back down into old oilfields to goose out more crude. Recognizing that in the long run it’s probably better to leave the naturally occurring CO2 in the ground where they found it, Oxy a few years ago jumped on the concept of Direct Air Capture. After some $500 million invested (with BlackRock), this summer near Odessa, Texas, Oxy expects to start up its first plant to suck CO2 straight out of the air. Soon the company will sending this atmospheric greenhouse gas deep underground, both into oilfields as well as saline water reservoirs. Such techniques aren’t just nice to have, says Hollub, they are vital if the United States is to achieve and maintain anything close to the energy “dominance” promised by President Donald Trump. Without advanced recovery, said Hollub, Oxy won’t be able to tap 2 billion barrels of oil left in conventional fields in the Permian. America will need that oil. Hollub believes that the U.S. oil industry will hit peak production by the end of the decade. After that U.S. oil output will inexorably decline, she believes. Injecting CO2 into old oilfields could dramatically reduce that rate of decline. Hollub’s dream is ultimately to sequester more carbon into these layers of reservoir rock than is contained in the fossil fuels that Oxy produces from them — thereby enabling Oxy to market net-zero-carbon fuels. The first direct air capture plant under Oxy's Stratos project is nearing completion near Odessa. Oxy formed its carbon capture subsidiary 1Point5 and in 2023 acquired Canadian startup Carbon Engineering for its base tech, which uses potassium hydroxide to chemically react with CO2 and capture it from the air. Economically, Oxy happens to be the nation’s biggest maker of potassium hydroxide. This initial plant will make 250,000 tons per year of CO2, and Oxy is already leveraging iterative learnings to build a second plant for completion mid-2026. Engineers are using in-house artificial intelligence to build digital twins of these oilfields — feeding them millions of datapoints from thousands of sensors in order to design and simulate more effective strategies to help permanently inject the maximum amount of CO2 while extracting their more-sustainable petroleum. Hollub emphasized that this effort depends for its economic viability on the largesse of Uncle Sam. Federal law, as promulgated by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, currently provides for tax credits of as high as $180 per ton of CO2 recovered and sequestered underground. Current costs are higher than that. Frustrating (and inexplicable) for Hollub, the federal rules give maximum tax credits if the CO2 is permanently sequestered into non-oil saline reservoirs rather than used for enhanced oil recovery (whch gets $135 per ton). Hollub said that Oxy has already pre-sold carbon reduction credits tied to the project and hopes that, despite Trump administration promises to gut green subsidies, the Inflation Reduction Act’s so-called 45q provisions are kept in place. “It’s our one big ask” of the Trump Administration, said Hollub at the Hamm Institute conference: “Keep 45q in place for direct air capture. Make the credit equal to sequestration. Making net zero carbon oil is better than putting in a saline reservoirs. Getting penalized for not putting it in a saline is crazy.” The Trump administration has voiced its support for all manner of geologic sequestration. In early April Oxy and 1Point5 received its needed Class VI permits from the U.S. EPA to begin sequestering CO2 in a non-oilfield operation. EPA further announced this week that in Texas it would delegate future Class VI sequestration well permitting to state regulators. Once perfected, Oxy will look to license the technology to other industrial companies. Keeping an eye on developments is Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway owns more than a third of Oxy via shares and preferred stock. Berkshire is also sitting on 84 million Oxy warrants with a strike price of $59.62. With Oxy shares at $40, Buffett’s investment is billions of dollars underwater. Buffett might like to bring down his cost basis. Berkshire, sitting on more than $300 billion in cash, could well afford to gobble up the rest of Oxy (p/e 12, market cap $40 billion). Buffett has sold down holdings of Apple and Bank of America and only just begun to redeploy, adding recently to Berkshire’s holdings in a handful of Japanese conglomerates such as Itochu, Sumitomo, Marubeni, Mitsui and Mitsubishi. Mitsui last year invested in an unrelated direct air capture pilot plant in Louisiana, while Mitsubishi and Itochu are investors in an Australian carbon-capture-cement startup. Who knows, with Buffett as salesman, he might soon be selling them Oxy’s air capture machines. Asked on the sidelines of the conference how she would feel about Berkshire and Buffett someday acquiring the rest of Oxy, Hollub replied, “It would be a dream come true.”

Sen. Cory Booker stumped for the Equality Act with Democrats on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, accusing President Donald Trump's administration of targeting transgender people. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., accused President Donald Trump's administration of targeting the transgender community on Tuesday, urging Congress to pass the Democrat-backed Equality Act. Booker made the emotional speech during an appearance on Capitol Hill alongside prominent Democrats from both the House and Senate. His speech, which lasted several minutes, borrowed heavily from the language of Martin Luther King, Jr. "The Equality Act is on the right side of history, and right now we stand in the cold shadow of injustice. And so here we are again, introducing this bill. But it is not a normal time that we introduce this bill. We introduced it in the backdrop of a president that in his very campaign, singled out an opportunistic bigotry. The trans community. We stand here in the backdrop of a time that LGBTQ Americans are being targeted and singled out for more injustice," Booker said. "I want you to know, we reintroduce this bill with attitude. We reintroduce this bill with swagger. We entered the bill Tuesday's bill with confidence, because there are a lot of people who are hearing our voice right now that don't understand that they are implicated. There's no bystanders in history. When injustice is in our midst, and you say nothing and you do nothing, you are part of the perpetuation of that injustice," he added. MULTIPLE FEDERAL AGENCIES END LINKEDIN CONTRACTS OVER DEI Sen. Cory Booker accused President Donald Trump's administration of "targeting" transgender people. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) "I remind those Americans, that even the truth, when crushed to the ground, after lie, after lie, after lie, that the truth will still rise again, that this is still one nation under God. That we still swear an oath of liberty and justice for all, and that we will not stop until freedom rings from every coast in this country. That freedom rings for every person and every soul. That freedom rings for every American, no matter who you are. Race, color or creed, LGBTQ, American or straight ally," he continued. "That we declare that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it doesn't bend automatically." TRUMP VOWS 'NEW ERA OF NATIONAL SUCCESS,' SAYS AMERICA'S 'DECLINE IS OVER' IN INAUGURAL ADDRESS "We declare today and every day until justice is established in this land, until the Equality Act passes, we declare that we, the people, will grab hold of that arc and pull and bend it until we live up to our promise in a country and truly are free at last, free at last," he finished.

Booker was joined by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., as well as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., among other lawmakers. MAJOR UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER ACCUSED OF HIDING DEI PROGRAMS, INFLUENTIAL SENATOR CALLS THEM OUT The legislative push comes as Trump's administration has pushed to end unpopular diversity, equity and inclusion programs throughout the federal government. The president’s efforts to end DEI across the federal government also prompted the cancellation of such programs across the private sector. Meta, in January, canceled its DEI programs, as did McDonald's. And after the 2024 election, Walmart, Ford Motor Co., John Deere, Lowe's and Toyota also ended DEI programs. President Donald Trump has pushed to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the federal government. (AP/Alex Brandon) As recently as April, according to Forbes, IBM, Gannett, and Constellation Brands Inc., made changes to DEI policies. Earlier in 2025, UnitedHealth Group, MLB, Victoria’s Secret, Warner Bros. Discovery, Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, PBS, Google, Disney, GE, PayPal, Chipotle and more scaled back or canceled their DEI programs.

Title: Trump buries Biden foreign policy in first 100 days

Time Published: 2025-04-29T17:00:01Z

Middle East Forum Executive Director Gregg Roman described President Donald Trump’s foreign policy approach as one that makes those who harm American interests "pay." One hundred days into his new administration, President Donald Trump has reset negotiations with allies and foes across the globe, and experts say one is certain: it is all transactional. Gone are the days when the U.S. could be drawn to throw its force around the world solely in the name of defending or spreading democracy. Global leaders are learning to speak a new language with U.S. leadership, one that is less about ideology and more about how their interests benefit U.S. interests. "There is a lot more transactional engagement rather than I think we're ideological-based, policy decisions that were sort of the hallmark of the Biden administration," said Gregg Roman, executive director of the Middle East Forum. Here is a round-up of how Trump has changed U.S. foreign policy since taking office: FOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, left, and President Donald Trump are working on a nuclear deal. (West Asia News Agency, Reuters | SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) Former President Joe Biden toyed with reviving a nuclear deal with Iran and criticized Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but his administration made little progress toward serious negotiations. Trump has now expressed interest in a new nuclear deal. He told Israel the U.S. would not come to their aid in attacking Iran until diplomatic negotiations played out. As Trump’s team met with Iranian counterparts in Oman this weekend for a second round of nuclear talks, he issued another threat: if negotiations whither away, the U.S. would not be dragged by Israel into war with Iran but will be "leading the pack." An offensive campaign against Yemen’s Houthi terrorists launched six weeks ago has struck more than 800 targets and cost nearly $1 billion – a sharp departure from the tit-for-tat retaliatory strikes seen under the Biden administration, when Houthis attacked U.S. naval ships and Western commercial vessels. "Biden pursued a policy of retaliatory strikes: If you hit us, we'll hit you," said Roman. "What Trump is trying to do is what I call a salting the earth strategy. If you dare challenge American military supremacy or the ability for us to conduct free trade to the bottom of or through the Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Yemen, Red Sea, Suez … We will attempt to end your ability to wage war on the United States in its interests."

One hundred days in, the war is not over. Negotiations are ongoing, and Trump has jumped between sounding off in frustration with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. As Putin continues to strike even civilian regions of Ukraine, Trump questioned on Saturday whether the Russian leader truly wants peace or is "tapping me along." He again questioned whether he would need to slap "secondary sanctions" on nations that do business with Russia to starve its war coffers. On Monday, Russia offered a three-day ceasefire from May 8-10, but the White House was not satisfied. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump wants a "permanent ceasefire." Trump met face-to-face with Zelenskyy in Rome on Saturday, the first time since their infamous Oval Office spat in February, after slamming Zelenskyy’s latest rejection of his peace proposal, one that would have formally ceded Crimea to the Russians.

The proposals drew shock across the world, but at least in Panama, Trump’s bold words prompted a proposal to offer the U.S. "first and free" passage for its warships, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said earlier this month. It also spurred the proposed sale of two ports of entry from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to U.S.-based BlackRock, though that deal has been delayed by Chinese regulatory and political scrutiny. Efforts to attain Greenland have proved less successful. Tough talk against Denmark and its ownership of Greenland has ratcheted up tensions with the NATO ally and Greenland’s leadership has expressed little interest in becoming a part of the U.S. However, Trump has called out the threat of Russia and China’s increasing arctic military capabilities – the shortest range for a missile to travel from Russia to the U.S. would be over the icy island’s territory. Trump is also interested in the rare earth mining potential of the massive swath of land. President Donald Trump wants the U.S. to control the Panama Canal.

The European Union announced a plan for its nations to spend $840 billion to "re-arm Europe" after Trump halted all aid to Ukraine in March. Countries like Spain, Belgium and Sweden have all announced plans this year to increase defense spending to meet NATO’s 2% target, while eastern European states near Russia’s border, including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Poland, have announced plans to increase defense spending to around 5%. Concern over China’s hegemonic ambitions bridges the partisan divide, but the Biden White House never considered such drastic measures as 145% tariffs. Trump has said the goal of the tariffs is to both bring back US manufacturing after decades of offshore production and punish China for intellectual property theft, a massive trade imbalance, and fentanyl flowing from China to the U.S. A free trade push in the early 2000s had wrongly assumed liberal trade policies would bring democratic values and free markets into Chinese borders, his supporters argue. Trump has insisted that President Xi Jinping wants to cut a deal to lower the soaring tariffs, even as China has rejected the prospect of talks.

For now, steep tariffs remain, and China is choking off U.S. supply of critical minerals, which could spell deep trouble for everyday electronics, electric vehicles and defense equipment.

Can Learn From Netflix About Video Game Strategy 'Outlander' Actor Graham McTavish to Star in Neil Marshall's Survival Thriller 'Gunn' (EXCLUSIVE) Sources tell Variety the deal is in the low nine-figure range. Popular on Variety Khaled’s long list of musical collaborators includes Jay-Z, Beyonce, Justin Bieber, Drake, Quavo, Chance the Rapper, Lil Wayne and many others. Terms of the deal were not disclosed further; several film projects are currently in various stages of development as a result of the alliance, according to the announcement. Founded in 2019, Influence Media’s investment strategy is built on “modern evergreens,” songs, and diverse artists with a strong potential for long-term impact on pop culture. The latest round of capital also follows the launch of Influence’s independent record label, music publishing and distribution company, Slang, which signed Will Smith last year. Backed by BlackRock and Warner Music Group, Influence’s latest fund has secured more than 30 music-rights investments, also including Enrique Iglesias, Blake Shelton, Jessie Reyez, songwriter-producer Julia Michaels, and others; in January it secured $360 million in debt financing. Khaled said, “I’m proud that my legacy will continue to resonate and connect with audiences around the world with this partnership through Influence Media. These iconic recordings I’ve created will continue to be curated in the most optimum manner to impact culture with nearly two decades of music. In addition, I’m excited for the world to see and experience the film and television projects Influence and We The Best are developing and producing together. This next phase of my career will be filled with ground-breaking cultural impact, and I look forward to being at the forefront in all categories.” “Influence Media was founded on the principle that music can move culture, and few entertainers embody this more than DJ Khaled,” said Lylette Pizarro, Influence Media Founder and Co-Managing Partner. “Our joint venture NIL deal, and extended catalog partnership is an alliance that will create boundless opportunities for this creative genius, and will also further establish that DJ Khaled is a rare talent whose abilities extend far beyond the traditional confines of music. His enormous creativity, heart, and drive are matched only by his savvy business instincts and that is why the possibilities of what we can build together in this collaboration are immeasurable.” “DJ Khaled has had so many iconic eras in his career to date, and we couldn’t be more excited to build ‘another one’ through this first-of-its-kind partnership,” says Rene McLean, Influence Media Partner and CEO of Slang. “Much in the same way that all the top artists consider a DJ Khaled collab a major career milestone, we think of this as a huge step forward for Slang.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment
