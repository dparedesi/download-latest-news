Title: Virgin Media presenter Katja Mia: ‘I get scared, I worry about the people I care about. These are weird times’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/09/06/katja-mia-i-grew-up-in-ireland-through-struggle-its-made-me-hyper-ambitious/
Time Published: 2025-09-06T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
When Dublin TV presenter, influencer and model Katja Mia was doing the Leaving Cert more than a decade ago, she plastered the study area in the Blanchardstown family home with motivational quotes from the likes of Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela. “I was not blessed academically, I was one of those people who had to work really hard to get just above average,” she says. “I had all these quotes posted up everywhere, I’d write down the number of points I wanted to get so I could see them.” She was manifesting before manifesting became a thing? “I suppose I was,” she laughs. “But I also studied for hours and hours. Nothing came easily.” While it’s been an often-derided TikTok trend for a few years now, manifesting – the idea that our thoughts and actions can positively influence what we accomplish – has actually been a thing for a while. There’s a Sanskrit text called Rigveda from 3,500 years ago containing hymns that suggest that by focusing on our hopes and dreams we can influence personal destiny. At any rate, the presenter is something of a poster girl for the trend. From a family of Burundian immigrants a combination of ambition, determination, hard work, luck and – scoff if you like – manifesting eventually landed her her dream job presenting the Six O’Clock Show on Virgin Media. We’re talking in the boardroom of the television station before she goes to studio to record the hour-long live show. She’s wearing black athleisure wear and there’s a large - “lab grown” she qualifies - diamond engagement ring sparkling on her finger. In a couple of weeks, she’ll go to Burundi, in east Africa, for the first time in 15 years to take part in a traditional “dot” engagement ceremony in front of 300 family and friends. It will be a chance for her fiancé and boyfriend of eight years, Daragh Curran, an influencer called The Guinness Guru who specialises in tasting pints of the black stuff all over the world, to meet her extended family. Having grown up in Dublin she’s looking forward to immersing herself in the culture of her parent’s homeland, royal Burundian drummers and traditional costumes included. “I’m embracing all of it,” she smiles. Her mother Carinie is all over the arrangements. The wedding next year will be an Irish one. “We’ll do our own thing for that,” she says. The goal, as she grew up, was financial security, which explains the motivational quotes and commitment to her studies. She was born in Germany, in 1996, after her parents sought refuge there from the civil war in Burundi, a protracted conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups, which killed an estimated 300,000 people from 1993 to 2005. Her uncle had been murdered in a grenade and knife attack in the former Belgian colony and “there was a threat to my dad’s family in particular so he had to flee the country”. [ Festive and funny tales with Thalia Heffernan, Katja Mia, Killian Sundermann and moreOpens in new window ] The family spent a couple of years in a village near Frankfurt but when they went to get their visa renewed it was denied. The family’s difficulties in Germany were compounded by the racism they were subjected to by neo-Nazis. Unable to return to Burundi, the family came to Ireland as undocumented immigrants. She was only 17 months old when they moved to Dublin, first settling in Blackrock. The Department of Justice initially refused their application for asylum on the grounds that they had made their original application in Germany. Threatened with deportation she says her father Joseph was given assistance in his campaign for his family to stay in Ireland by “some excellent people” including former Irish Times journalist Andy Pollak. “My dad saw him talking on a news programme one day and looked up his number in the phone book,” she says. Later, I find an Irish Times news report from 1998 about the family’s experience in Germany and the racist abuse they suffered there. “It was torture,” her mother Carinie told Irish Times reporter Paul Cullen back then. “We had already left one form of atrocious situation, [in Burundi] and now we were in another. We were just looking for somewhere calm, where our children can grow up and be integrated in society.” Eventually, they were given leave to remain in Ireland and got their Irish passports. They instilled positive affirmations in us about being black from a really young age Her parents’ experience as immigrants has had a significant influence on the presenter. “I was always aware of their struggle. They were educated but English is not their first language so they had to start from the bottom and I witnessed that.” Joseph and Carinie, who also speak French, encouraged their four children to speak English at home instead of Kirundi, the official language of Burundi, so that they would have a better chance of integrating. Her mother worked in a supermarket and her father, now a taxi driver, had two jobs at one point. “I would see him come home from one shift and put on his uniform for a second job. I think when I saw that it really instilled a work ethic and made me put my head down. They came here for me to have a better life. They didn’t want me to struggle. When you see people struggle it makes you want to go after security and financial stability”. The family moved from Blackrock to Usher’s Quay in the city centre and then to Lucan where she attended primary and secondary school even after the family eventually settled in Blanchardstown. “Growing up I always felt Irish, I sang Irish songs, did Irish dancing, on Brigid’s Day we celebrated Nano Nagle. When you are migrating to a new country, integrating is everything, especially for kids.” Every Monday afternoon from the age of six she’d go to a stage school in Lucan where she thrived - dancing and singing in shows. It wasn’t until the move to Blanchardstown that the family became victims of racist attacks. “We were the first black family on our council estate. There were a lot of teenagers coming to our house, throwing eggs at our windows, breaking my mum’s car door on a weekly basis. It was a kind of torment, to be honest.” “I remember vividly one day being egged by a group of boys, and I was only 11 or 12, I had my uniform on and I was just drenched in eggs ... you have to reassure yourself that people are ignorant, they’re doing it out of fear and you should not waste your energy trying to defend yourself because you’ve nothing to defend. “And I think it stood to me, because even now, working in media, it’s inevitable that you’re going to get comments, people that don’t like you for whatever reason, whether it’s the dress you’re wearing your make-up or whatever.” This resilience was modelled by her parents who changed the narrative when it came to their four children. “They instilled positive affirmations in us about being black from a really young age. They’d tell me: ‘You have amazing skin, you are a descendant of the Tutsi tribe, you are beautiful, be proud’.” When it came to choosing her career path, despite her love of performing, her need for security led her to pursue finance. The motivational quotes paid off. She got enough points for a finance and economics degree from Maynooth University and went into banking as a depository analyst working in funds. In the pandemic, she began a remote job in Bank of America but she wasn’t happy. “I was lost,” she says of her time in the corporate world. “I had no passion. I didn’t know what I was doing. I even started praying about it.” By now manifesting was everywhere. “I read the books, I listened to podcasts and I started posting on Instagram almost as a tool to throw s**t at the wall and see what stuck”. She began curating her feed “in a fun, aesthetic way” building an audience. When a friend needed a presenter for a music show in Swords, she nervously accepted. “It was a nine or 10-hour day but it felt like about 10 minutes because I was having the time of my life. I just thought, how can I make this a job?” There are people on TikTok saying, ‘Ireland is for the Irish’. People get angry at me, telling me: ‘You’re not Irish’ She had grown up admiring presenters like Kathryn Thomas and Martin King “who I ended up working with”. She’d watch E! News all the time. “I was obsessed with television culture, but I had no idea how to get into it ... then a friend sent me a link to a competition for online presenters and I ended up winning it.” The competition, to be a brand ambassador for Love Island presenter Maya Jama’s skincare range Mij Masks, was open to people across the UK and Ireland. It was the break she was hoping for and led to Virgin Media getting in touch. She began there as a contributor, moving to hosting on Weekend AM with Martin King. At one stage, when Ireland AM presenter Muireann O’Connell was on holiday, she got a call to replace her for three shows. “That was just wild to me. My whole family was jumping on the bed. It’s a three-hour live show. I’ll never forget that moment.” Eventually, she was named as the new permanent host with Brian Dowling of the station’s Six O’Clock Show. That was in November 2023, less than two years after landing her first presenting job. “Ideally, in a dream world, I would have done a degree in media and journalism, naturally I still feel impostor syndrome, but I learn from people, I learn by making mistakes. It worked out the way it worked out and I have so much backing in Virgin Media, I’ve been really supported.” [ We cannot police the streets if online material is not regulatedOpens in new window ] In the meantime she had been spotted by a modelling scout on Instagram, which she calls “the modern day CV for creatives”, and was a “curvy” model for a few years. Last year, when she was one of the celebrities competing in Dancing With the Stars, she received abusive messages about her size. “I got comments about whether my dance partner could lift me, people saying: ‘She’s a disgrace’.” Did the abuse affect Katja? “Absolutely, it did,” she says. “I would find myself on rehearsal days looking at playback, focusing on how big my thighs looked instead of my dance form. I have to say, once I shared the horrible comments there was so much support”. She has spoken of dealing with endometriosis and says her weight has always fluctuated. Of the abuse she says: “I have the tools to deal with it, I just needed to reinforce those positive affirmations. And my family were amazing. They just thought it was cool that I was dancing on TV.” Inevitably, given her backstory, we talk for a while about the rise of anti-immigration sentiment and the “Ireland is full” protests around the country. She is thoughtfulon the subject. “It’s conflicting,” she says. “I am a young person living in Ireland, I know it’s tough.” “I have a friend coming home from Australia with her boyfriend and they are finding it so hard to find somewhere to live. I understand that people are in a difficult position and when things get hard people look for people to blame. And the easiest targets are the newbies, the immigrants, the people who don’t sound like you or look like you.” [ Manifesting is the perfect religion for our times. But does it work?Opens in new window ] She says she hates “it’s come to that” because she immediately thinks of her parents. “They still have accents, when they talk they don’t sound Irish even though they’ve been here for so long. They are easy targets. I am someone with black skin. I know that just walking around without someone hearing my Dublin accent, I will be judged. “Something could happen to me. So I hate that black and brown people, any people of colour in Ireland, are in danger and have to worry about abusive and racist rhetoric and also physical violence.” The “conflict” she feels on the issue is about the challenges many people in this country face. “I’ve lived in Ireland my whole life. I pay taxes in this country, but I know when the time comes around when I get married and I want to look for a house, it’s going to be incredibly difficult, even though I work hard and I know other people are working hard too.” “People just want a better life for themselves. But at the same time, it’s not the fault of immigrants who are just trying to blend and integrate into a country,” she says. “It’s the fault of a Government that needs to do better. The pressure should lie with the Government to create resources for people who are struggling with the socio-economic situation, who can’t get houses. They need to be the ones to create a solution.” I feel like it’s very taboo to say, but I am someone who really wants to create a comfortable life for myself and stability for my family I ask how she feels being asked about this subject. Does it get wearying? “Every time I talk about it, and I’ve talked about it a lot, it always comes with a certain amount of hate. So I’ve become more apprehensive. There are people on TikTok saying, ‘Ireland is for the Irish’. People get angry at me, telling me: ‘You’re not Irish’. They say: ‘You’re a diversity hire’. They say all these crazy things so I’ve drawn back on it a bit”. But does she feel it’s important to speak out? “Yes, especially now seeing the attacks on Indian people, it’s heartbreaking. I grew up with Indian friends in my class and Pakistani friends. They’ve been here for years. And the new people should be welcomed too because at the end of the day we’re citizens of the world. The Irish history of migration in Australia, in Canada and in America is well known and there is never any issue with that. It’s clearly a skin colour issue and that’s what makes me upset.” In 2020, attending a protest against the murder of George Floyd by police in America, she told an Irish Times reporter that watching the footage of Mr Floyd’s death made her think of her father and brother. “My dad has such a gentle soul and to think that someone would look at him and perceive him as violent from the colour of his skin is absolutely outrageous. We’re protesting here for George Floyd but also for every black person who has gone through discrimination.” Now, she says: “My dad is a taxi driver, I get afraid for him when he is out at night because these people seem to have this new-found confidence to be blatantly racist and they think it’s okay to hurt people like that. So I get upset and I get scared, I worry about the people I care about. These are weird times.” On a more positive note, she’s happy to see things moving, however slowly, in terms of increased representation and participation of people of colour in Irish society. “I feel like it is slowly changing in a natural, unforced way. What you are seeing is the second generation of immigrants growing up and choosing careers like presenting or being make-up artists, there are more of us in the creative industries. “I think traditionally there was a lot of pressure to be, like, a doctor or a lawyer. But we also need to have visual representation in creative spaces too. And I think slowly we’re getting that.” In many ways, she is still the industrious Leaving Cert student, pushing herself forward to the next thing. She’s still manifesting, still dreaming. “I’ve had to back myself and be like: this is what you asked for, what you dreamt of, so work hard, open your ears, learn”. She’ll turn 30 next year. There’s a wedding to plan. What are her latest goals? “I feel like it’s very taboo to say, but I am someone who really wants to create a comfortable life for myself and stability for my family. It’s always at the back of my mind, it goes beyond myself. I have dreams of buying a home for my family one day, and of having the life that I always dreamed of in Ireland, especially growing up through struggle,” she says. “It’s made me hyper-ambitious and focused on having security in life. I have a job that really drives me, a job I’m very lucky to say I love.I’ve met amazing people and the dream is just to continue doing something like this. If I can have longevity in this industry, then I’ll be very happy.” Katja Mia presents The Six O’Clock Show with Brian Dowling every weekday on Virgin Media © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: We Are Becoming A Nation Of...: HDFC AMC's Navneet Munot On India's 'Multi-Pronged Growth Model'
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/we-are-becoming-a-nation-of-hdfc-amcs-navneet-munot-on-indias-multi-pronged-growth-model

The rapid pace of economic reforms by the government, including tax cuts, GST (Goods and Services Tax) reductions and liquidity measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has created a wave of optimism about India’s growth trajectory, according to Navneet Munot, Managing Director and CEO of HDFC Asset Management Company (AMC). He lauded the government's economic strategy, describing it as a combination of "policy prudence, agile execution and effective communication" that sets India apart on the global stage. “India has been a nation of savers for generations. What we are doing now is becoming a nation of investors. If you are astute, you would take a long-term view of India. It is going to be a multi-pronged growth model rather than a very narrow set of growth models most of the other countries have seen,” he said during a conversation with NDTV Profit on Friday. He said that India has become 'Atmanirbhar' (self-reliant) in its capital markets, while acknowledging the importance of the inflow of foreign funds. “I won't say that we don't need foreign savings. I think our investment needs are humongous. We need more foreign flows for sure. And at some stage, it's likely to come both in the form of FDI as well as in the form of FPI.” He contrasted India's approach with that of major economies like the United States, highlighting a fundamental difference in philosophy. “On one side, you are seeing increasing tariffs and putting more burden on the consumers... On the other side, what India is doing is, I want to give more benefit to the larger section of the society," he said. He described this as the 'Bahujan Hitai, Bahujan Sukhai' (for the welfare and happiness of the masses) philosophy, starkly different from policies that favour tax cuts for the wealthy while imposing tariffs that ultimately hurt consumers. Munot cited recent measures like personal income tax relief, GST rate cuts and RBI’s liquidity injections as steps to stimulate consumption and credit growth. “It is not only about cutting rates and paying less taxes. It's also about like Chanakya said that the government should take taxes the way a butterfly gently takes nectar,” the top executive said. Munot was bullish on India’s potential to produce global-scale asset managers akin to Blackstone or BlackRock. “Several of those businesses are managing hundreds of billions in alternatives and trillions in public markets. Over a period of time, as this economy grows from $4 trillion to $40 trillion in our lifetime, you will see asset managers in India talking about that size,” he said. Highlighting India’s importance for the world, he said, “This is where 18% of humanity is. This is where the youngest population in the world is. We will be the biggest supplier of labour force to the world for the next several decades. So, you have to ensure that you take full advantage of that demographic dividend.” Shares of HDFC Asset Management Company closed 0.44% higher at Rs 5,594 apiece on the NSE, while the benchmark Nifty50 ended 0.03% up at 24,741.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Jio BlackRock Asset Management Company is all set to launch its first actively managed fund, a flexicap fund, on 23 September. The AMC is an equal joint venture between Jio Financial Services and global investment giant BlackRock. What sets it apart from other funds? According to Sid Swaminathan, CEO of Jio BlackRock AMC, it has a data-driven approach using BlackRock’s Aladdin software with insights from human fund managers. The fund house also has the benefit of Jio's large distribution ecosystem, which allows it to focus on direct-only plans for now. In this interview, Swaminathan talks about the fund's plans, AI-driven products and more. Edited excerpts:Can you walk us through the overall plan that you have for unfolding Jio BlackRock AMC? With BlackRock bringing its tech platform, Aladdin, to India, asset managers can do everything in a very scalable, operationally safe manner. We also have our partner Jio, which allows us to access customers at scale in the digital ecosystem. Our platform in BlackRock, systematic active equity (SAE), is a quantitative data-driven AI machine learning approach to equity investing. A computer does all the data crunching for you, and then you have the fund managers who can overlay some specific insights on it. You can then input all of this into Aladdin. Next, run a portfolio-level optimisation using the risk model and an India-specific risk model built for the joint venture to generate a portfolio recommendation. If you aim to outperform a flexicap fund using these insights by X percent annually, with Y amount of risk relative to that benchmark, here is a suggested portfolio. What about your products and their rollout? We have launched three institutional-focused cash funds to start with. We are very happy with the kind of start that we got, and also the retail participation…about 67,000 investors in the first three NFOs since July. We have also looked at the index funds. So again, in a way, bread and butter for BlackRock. The third set of funds in phase one will be more leaning towards the active side, with flexicap as the first one. Some fund houses are more tilted towards growth, and some towards value. Is there an overarching philosophy for you? The overarching philosophy is that it's a data-driven approach. It allows us to use and leverage the data in many ways. For example, for this flexicap fund that we are going to launch, the fund managers will typically look to generate the alpha purely through stock selection. Now the same data can be used to build another fund, which will come later. But instead of just having views on stocks, I may have views on factors. So I could have a growth tilted, or a value tilted fund, or I could do factor rotation…so we have all the insights to do that. Or rather than factors, we can have sectors. So, as a fund house, our philosophy is to be data-driven and then deliver that in differentiated ways to our end customers. Do you have an upper and lower limit to the number of stocks you would have in the fund? Not necessarily. You would expect around 125 to 150 stocks, which is, again, a lot more than you would see in a typical flexicap where it’s probably 30 to 40. But you're never going to see 500 stocks because, again, that's an index fund. You've chosen to take the direct route for distribution. What was the thinking behind this, and how will it pan out? People are becoming increasingly comfortable managing their finances digitally on their phones. Our partnership with Jio, which has access to that ecosystem, gives us a clear understanding that this is the direction we want to pursue. We aim to see how direct digital approaches work. We have the capacity to manufacture at scale, and if we can reach customers and offer them value digitally, that would be excellent. We can always consider growing, expanding, and exploring other options in the future. The ₹24 tax filing product enables users to file their returns digitally. Would it accelerate your growth? A lot of new products are coming online from JioFinance. Yes, like new functionality on the Jio Finance app will help accelerate our growth. Our presence will also accelerate Jio Finance’s growth, because people will get excited by things like the NFO periods going online. We currently have 50 to 55 million unique permanent account numbers (PAN) in the mutual fund space. How large do you think the market can grow? Fifty-five million is a very big number, but in the context of India, it's still very small, right? We have just crossed 20% of AUM (assets under management) as a percentage of GDP. By comparison, the UK is at 80% and the US is at 150%. There can be some short-term blips that we have seen even in the last few weeks, but the overall macro is very sound. Demographics are very positive. Tell us a little about your team Our chief investment officer (CIO), Rishi Kohli, has been involved in the systematic quant investing space in India for many decades. In addition, two dedicated fund managers who previously worked at BlackRock have joined the team. There are also two dealers and a couple of researchers for the equity team. On the fixed income side, we have three fund managers, two dealers, and a couple of researchers. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

(Photo: Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes) WILMINGTON, Delaware: Elon Musk's blow-out US$1 trillion pay package from Tesla proves everything is bigger in Texas, especially under its new management-friendly law. Last year, Tesla reincorporated in the Lone Star State after a judge in its former corporate home, Delaware, ruled a US$56 billion compensation for the CEO was "unfathomable" and unfair to shareholders. Musk urged companies to ditch Delaware and his board worked on a new pay package. Freed from the constraints of Delaware's widely used corporate law, Tesla has super-sized the next pay deal for Musk, already the world's richest person. Despite increasing his pay nearly 20-fold, there is a better chance this package will be approved and a lesser risk it will be struck down in the courts, thanks to Texas's corporate law. In addition, it would be harder for shareholders to challenge the independence of the two board members who developed the pay package.

By Ross Kerber, Dawn Kopecki, Simon Jessop and Arsheeya Bajwa NEW YORK -Tesla's $1 trillion, 10-year pay package to retain CEO Elon Musk is likely to be approved by shareholders at the company's annual meeting in November even though the amount is staggering. That is because it was crafted with an eye on keeping Musk in place, addressing concerns about the company's technical outlook and giving big company owners just enough reason to back the massive amount, investors and executive pay analysts said. Earlier on Friday, the automaker's board approved what it called "A Super Ambitious Incentive Package for a Pioneering, Ambitious and Unique CEO" that sets out lofty earnings and valuation targets – awarding Musk millions of shares over the next decade if he hits them. It immediately gives Musk 96 million shares of restricted stock worth more than $31 billion as of intraday trading on Friday that vests over the next two years, as well as more control over the company. His total 2025 compensation package is worth north of $113 billion, executive compensation research firm Equilar has estimated. “The pay package, which makes a big bet on the future of robots, may see shareholder support," said Taufiq Rahim, a SpaceX investor and principal at 2040 Advisory. "But it raises larger social questions about the outsized gains going to relatively few capital holders, which is likely not sustainable and will face public pressures.” The package is designed to keep Musk from leaving and is squarely focused on transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence and robotics powerhouse, the board said in a securities filing. It said Musk is the only person on the planet who can unlock Tesla's full potential. The compensation committee started negotiating Musk's pay package in February, it said, meeting with lawyers 37 times and directly with Musk 10 times over seven months. Certain items were non-negotiable for the idiosyncratic CEO: he wanted 25% of the company, to control Tesla's future direction and to be fully compensated for a 2018 pay package that was hung up in litigation. THREATS TO LEAVE Musk threatened to leave more than once, and the board worried the company's AI talent would follow him out the door, it said in the filing. The $31 billion in restricted shares, which he cannot sell for at least five years, is partial payback for a $56 billion 2018 pay plan that a Delaware court voided last year. If Musk wins in court within a certain time frame, he will not receive the one-time payment "so there can be no 'double dip,'" the board said. "Musk also raised the possibility that he may pursue his other interests and leave Tesla if he did not receive such assurance," the board said. SHAREHOLDER PROVAL The pay plan is by far the largest ever for any CEO, Equilar said. And while it is likely to face legal challenges, compensation experts see it winning shareholder approval. "Time and time again, Tesla's shareholders have approved these grants over the years," Equilar Research Director Courtney Yu told Reuters. "While it may seem outlandish now, shareholders will get tremendous value out of it if Elon Musk is successful." None of Tesla's three largest outside investors, Vanguard Group, BlackRock or State Street, immediately said on Friday how they would vote. Among them, Vanguard and BlackRock supported Musk's $56 billion pay package last year, disclosures show, while State Street funds voted against it. Tesla and top funds can still expect pressure over the pay, however, with a number of union figures and public-sector treasurers voicing concern. "We urge shareholders to reject Musk’s money grab, take away the Tesla board’s rubber stamp, and restore basic corporate governance standards," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, in a statement. Musk, who currently controls close to 13% of the company, would own 25% if the plan is approved, so long as he hits his performance targets and sticks around for at least seven more years. Payable over 12 tranches after hitting certain milestones, the ultimate prize could make Tesla the most valuable company in the world with an aspirational market capitalization of $8.5 trillion, making it worth more than Microsoft , Meta Platforms and Alphabet combined, today, the board noted. Kristin Hull, founder and chief investment officer of Tesla investor Nia Impact Capital, called the package irresponsible. “This is investor money that could go into R&D or acquisitions, places that would really benefit Tesla in the long term," she said, adding that she is considering a challenge with other shareholders. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called Musk a visionary but said the pay plan was excessive and could set a bad precedent in corporate governance. He questioned whether Musk was worth that much. “He also presides over a company that has lost its edge, is being overtaken by rivals, and whose brand has been tarnished by Musk’s actions outside of Tesla," he said. 'PICK A NUMBER' Tesla’s shares closed up 3.6% at $350.84 on Friday. They are down 13% for 2025, although they have recovered from their lows. Investors worry about its deteriorating electric vehicle business and rising foreign competition. “One minute Tesla’s board is wondering if Elon Musk is a liability to the company given his outspoken views and political distractions, the next they’re effectively saying ‘pick a number, any number’ to lock him in for as long as possible," Coatsworth said. "Surely Musk should be fighting for his job, not Tesla’s board fighting to keep him?" This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Title: Stocks wobble as Wall Street wrangles with whether the job market is too weak

U.S. stocks wobbled lower on Friday as Wall Street questioned whether the U.S. job market has slowed by just enough to get the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to help the economy, or by so much that a downturn may be on the way. After rising to an early gain, the S&P 500 erased it and fell 0.3% below the all-time high it set the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 220 points, or 0.5%, after swinging between an early gain of nearly 150 points and a loss of 400. The Nasdaq composite edged down by less than 0.1%. The action was more decisive in the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled after a report from the Labor Department said U.S. employers hired fewer workers in August than economists expected. The government also said that earlier estimates for June and July overstated hiring by 21,000 jobs. The disappointing numbers follow last month’s discouraging jobs update, along with other lackluster reports in intervening weeks, and traders are now betting on a 100% probability that the Fed will cut its main interest rate at its next meeting on Sept. 17, according to data from CME Group. Investors love such cuts because they can give a kickstart to the economy, but the Fed has held off on them because they can also give inflation more fuel. So far this year, the Fed has been more worried about the potential of inflation worsening because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs than about the job market. But Friday’s job numbers could push the Fed to consider cutting rates in two weeks by a steeper amount than usual, said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “This week has been a story of a slowing labor market, and today’s data was the exclamation point,” according to Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Strong hiring for health care jobs had been helping to support the overall market, “but with it now showing some tangible signs of decline, the foundation underneath the labor market seems to be cracking,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. While the data on the job market is disappointing, it’s still not so weak that it’s screaming a recession is here, and the U.S. economy is continuing to grow. A big question for investors is whether the job market can remain in a balance where it’s not so strong that it prevents cuts to interest rates but also not so weak that the economy falls off. Uncertainty about that helped lead to Friday’s swings in the stock market. Wall Street needs things to go as hoped because it already sent stock prices to records amid expectations for a Goldilocks scenario where interest rates ease, and the economy keeps chugging along. On Wall Street, Friday’s heaviest weight was Nvidia, the chip company that’s become the face of the artificial-intelligence boom. It’s been contending with criticism that its stock price charged too high, too fast and became too expensive following Wall Street’s rush into AI, and it fell 2.7%. Lululemon dropped 18.6% after the yoga and athletic gear maker’s revenue for the latest quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations. CEO Calvin McDonald pointed to disappointing results from its U.S. operation, while Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said Lululemon is facing “industrywide challenges, including higher tariff rates.” Still, more stocks rose on Wall Street than fell. Leading the way was Broadcom, which climbed 9.4% after reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Hock Tan said customers are continuing to invest strongly in AI chips. Tesla rose 3.6% after proposing a payout package that could reach $1 trillion for its CEO, Elon Musk, if the electric vehicle company meets a series of extremely aggressive targets over the next 10 years. Smith & Wesson Brands jumped 6.5% after the gun maker delivered better results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Mark Smith said it saw good demand for new products in what’s traditionally a slow season for sales of firearms. All told, the S&P 500 fell 20.58 points to 6,481.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 220.43 to 45,400.86, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 7.31 to 21,700.39.. In stock markets abroad, indexes in Europe lost early gains to turn lower with Wall Street. That followed strength across much of Asia. The Nikkei 225 rallied 1% in Tokyo after data showed accelerating growth in earnings for Japanese workers. Chinese markets rebounded following three days of decline, with indexes rising more than 1% in both Hong Kong and Shanghai. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.09% from 4.17% late Thursday and from 4.28% on Tuesday. That’s a notable move for the bond market and could mean lower interest rates are coming for mortgages and other loans.

Title: After 100 Years, Trillion-Dollar Fund Manager Wellington Wants You to Know Its Name

The staid, nearly century-old firm that mostly serves vanilla equity and bond strategies to buttoned-up institutions like pensions and endowments is moving aggressively into private markets and hedge funds and building its brand with retail investors. September 5, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Wellington Management Co. is a rarity in the investment world: a fund manager with more than $1 trillion of assets and almost zero brand recognition. Not for long. The staid, nearly century-old firm that mostly serves vanilla equity and bond strategies to buttoned-up institutions like pensions and endowments is now moving aggressively into private markets and hedge funds. Wellington is spending big to hire from bulge-bracket banks and alternative investment firms, adding dozens of private markets professionals to build a unit of about 40 people. It’s also hustling to build a brand with retail investors, many of whom have never heard of the $1.3 trillion firm. It’s a big change for a money manager that for decades didn’t care about what the world thought, as long as its big institutional clients were happy. Among its recent hires, Wellington recruited a head of private investments capital formation from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., poached a team from Pacific Investment Management Co. to expand in private credit and hired Christina Kopec Rooney from Goldman’s asset management arm to head its nascent push into the US wealth market. It even partnered with private equity giant Blackstone Inc. and Vanguard Group to launch hybrid funds for retail investors. Related:Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank Launch Alternative Investment Program for UHNW Investors In perhaps its most radical shift, Wellington – housed across 19 floors in Boston’s Atlantic Wharf – has done the previously unthinkable: It hired a public relations team. “It’s unfamiliar,” said Steve Klar, Wellington’s president. It’s a sign of the times. Tectonic shifts in asset management are pushing the firm, and others like it, out of their comfort zone. Traditional asset managers under pressure from outflows and fee compression in their mutual funds are striving to break into the more lucrative private markets to boost their margins and assets before their competitors gain all the spoils. Rivals such as Franklin Resources Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc., and even the likes of industry giants BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp., are diving in headfirst, buying alternative investment firms or partnering with private equity shops to launch funds. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it will purchase as much as $1 billion of T. Rowe Price shares as the two team up to sell private-market products. Wellington’s Chief Executive Officer Jean Hynes said in an interview at the firm’s headquarters that despite relying mostly on stickier institutional money, she knows the firm isn’t immune to the intense pressures reshaping the asset management industry. Client migration to cheap passive funds has pushed the industry’s average fee down to just 0.3% from about 1% two decades ago, according to Morningstar Inc. (Vanguard — Wellington’s largest client, accounting for about a third of the firm’s assets — charges an average fee of 0.07%.) Related:Goldman to Buy $1 Billion of T. Rowe Stock as Firms Team Up Wellington argues it’s especially well positioned among its peers to go big on private markets. The firm’s executives say its private partnership structure – with no shareholders to answer to – gives the firm control, allowing it to play the long game and retain its tight-knit culture. Michael Carmen, a partner at Wellington who’s behind the expansion, says that an ambitious 10-year plan kicked off in 2023 to grow the private markets unit that now manages only $9.7 billion. He’s even interviewing candidates to start a secondaries business to acquire illiquid positions from other investors, one of the hottest areas in alternative investing. Its new emphasis on higher-fee alternatives is already shifting internal power dynamics at a time when different teams inside the firm are fighting for resources. Some who work in the more traditional, lower-fee parts of the business say that as private markets become more prominent at the firm, the rewards are going disproportionately to employees who work in that business, according to people familiar with their thinking. Related:No Gold in Morningstar’s First Batch of Semiliquid Ratings Klar, one of three people who determines partner compensation, said this is not the case. If the privates business does well, then all the partners at Wellington benefit, he said. While most of Wellington’s assets are in privately held accounts, for which information isn’t available, data for its public funds offer a glimpse into the industry’s struggles. About 160 funds with combined assets of a half-trillion dollars managed or sub-advised by the firm recorded outflows of more than $130 billion between 2022 and the end of June 2025, according to Morningstar. Wellington’s growing hedge fund franchise, set up in the mid-1990s, now manages about $20 billion in long-short strategies. While that’s a tiny slice of the firm’s overall assets, it accounts for an outsize share of the firm’s profits. To attract and retain the talent needed to generate the above-market returns many alternative investment clients expect, the firm has also had to utilize other routes to a big payday besides its classic and lengthy path to becoming a partner. Alternative investment portfolio staffers are compensated in line with market standards, Klar said. For those deemed to have a big impact on the firm’s financial performance, there’s always the position of managing director — a role that allows staff to share in some of the profits without having been named partner. Wellington’s push into wealth is also forcing the firm to rethink another closely guarded aspect of its culture: its secrecy. For decades, the asset manager was so content with having a name known only among pensions and endowments that it made a point of not having a public profile. But Wellington often took its privacy to extremes. A former employee recalls that it was so hard to find information about the firm when he joined 20 years ago that he wasn’t sure it was a legitimate company until he had his first interview. People at bank wealth channels — which play a vital role in selling Wellington’s products to individuals — have said that everyday investors don’t know the firm and, for the funds to sell, the brand needs to be bigger. And so, Wellington has reluctantly begun hiring its first public relations people in recent years. It’s learning, slowly but surely, how to put itself out there. This isn’t the first time Wellington has had to reinvent itself. The firm, founded in 1928, faced an existential crisis 50 years ago after a disastrous run in equities nearly left it for dead. Its roughly two dozen partners at the time mortgaged their houses and used the money to delist the firm from the stock market. It later fired Jack Bogle, in 1974, after disagreements with Wellington partners over investment strategy and personnel matters. Bogle went on to found Vanguard, and Wellington agreed to run active strategies for his new outfit. Vanguard eventually became a household name synonymous with the 401(k) market, while Wellington built its brand with institutional clients and shunned the spotlight. In the ensuing years Wellington became less Boston-centric, opened offices and launched funds in Europe and Asia and abandoned a fixation on US equities to start investing in international stocks and, more recently, in bonds. (Today, about 40% of its assets are in fixed income.) As it looks to its next century, the firm is stretching further beyond the status quo. As part of its partnership with Blackstone and Vanguard, Wellington now oversees around 100 people globally working on the project. Terry Burgess, one of the firm’s top three decision makers, is in charge of the effort. Klar said that beyond courting retail investors, the firm’s alts expansion — and attracting talent for that business — is another reason Wellington wants its name out there. As it peddles its brand, Wellington now records podcasts, produces videos with weekly market updates, and churns out regular press releases. It’s a far cry for a firm that, until recently, never even had a publicist on the payroll.

Joseph Chalom, co-CEO of SharpLink, told Decrypt that the treasury company is currently staking almost the entirety of its holdings through its custodians, Anchorage and Coinbase. However, as the company matures, it will look to diversify the staking vehicles it utilizes as it seeks out higher-yield opportunities. “When you hold billions of dollars of ETH and you're looking at a portfolio of staking, there is going to be an ability to deploy that through staking opportunities on Linea,” Chalom told Decrypt. “And that is really, really important, not only to Consensys, but to the Linea Consortium. And if there are opportunities that SharpLink can avail itself of to get better yield, higher risk-adjusted yield through the Linea network, we will do that.” "SharpLink has been staking our ETH after purchasing through a combination of native staking and liquid staking tokens," he added. "As we expand our potential staking opportunities, we will be actively considering Linea-based staking opportunities." The co-CEO stressed the importance of driving real-world activity to “Ethereum-aligned” projects, Linea being one of those. He explained that by driving high-quality activity towards these kinds of projects, it should, in turn, also drive up the price of Ethereum—which is ultimately in the interest of SharpLink as one of the largest holders of ETH. “When I say we're here to support Ethereum, we're here to support Ethereum and the L2s that derive from it,” he added. “So not only allocating tokens for Linea bootstrapping [as part of the Linea Consortium], but also [exploring] potential opportunities in staking and liquidity provision, given how much ETH we as a treasury want.” Back in July, SharpLink joined the Linea Consortium—a group of companies that will steward 75% of the LINEA token distribution. Chalom said the Consortium is “mission-aligned” to make Linea a “highly successful” layer-2 network, adding that the token launch will “bootstrap” the network with more than 80% of the supply being used to support on-chain projects. Consensys, the creator of Linea, is led by CEO Joe Lubin, who is also a co-founder of Ethereum and the chairman of SharpLink's board of directors. As such, it's only natural that Linea aims to support the Ethereum base layer through mechanics such as native yield on bridged ETH and ETH burns—a response to the narrative that layer-2 networks take value away from Ethereum’s mainnet. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.) That said, exactly how much Ethereum the firm bridges over to Linea and in what capacity it will be used to generate yield has yet to be confirmed. Five weeks ago, Ethereum celebrated 10 years of zero downtime. Next week, LINEA becomes the most significant token to enter the ecosystem since ETH itself.

Check yours at https://t.co/GDV3kRe0Kf pic.twitter.com/emB8WlqCNF — Linea.eth (@LineaBuild) September 3, 2025 "We are, at this point, trying to figure out what is the optimal portfolio of staking, beyond just vanilla, native staking through custodians,” Chalom explained. “We're also investors and staking liquidity providers to Liquid Collective, which is a liquid staking token. There are ways to drive more of the delegation to participants on the Linea network, even through native staking as well as liquid staking." “It’s early days. I’m not really comfortable sharing exactly what the plans are, because we’re trying to figure out the entire portfolio of staking,” he added. “Remember: The number-one thing an ETH treasury is supposed to do is preserve its capital. The second is to have that capital appreciate, and the third is to go along the risk spectrum and drive yield.” At the time of writing, SharpLink’s entire treasury of $3.6 billion worth of Ethereum—or approximately 0.69% of the total supply—is being staked with its custodians. However, the firm is on the precipice of diversifying where and how it is using its Ethereum. “We're at a pivotal moment in terms of opportunities to stake, and we want to do it in a way that really, really is diversified,” Chalom explained. “So I think what you'll find is we're going to walk before we run, but our goal is to drive the highest yields on a risk-adjusted basis for our investors.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Jumbo-rate-cut chatter is rising after a dismal jobs report

Time Published: 2025-09-05T14:44:05Z

The job market tripped up big time last month. In a way, that's exactly what the market was looking for. Investors are taking weak August jobs data as a green light to fully expect the Fed to cut interest rates at its next policy meeting — a major bullish catalyst for stocks that the market has been anticipating all year. The priced-in probability that the Fed will cut rates at its September FOMC meeting surged to 100% Friday morning, shortly after jobs growth was found to badly miss expectations in August. The odds of a jumbo-sized 50 basis-point rate cut also jumped to around a 12% chance the Fed could make the decision to announce the equivalent of two rates. It's a relatively rare occurrence, although the Fed did announce a jumbo cut in September 2024 as well. "The labor market is soft, even though the economy is in pretty good shape, meaning the Fed's got to cut," Rick Rieder, the CIO of global fixed income at BlackRock, where he oversees $2.4 trillion, told Bloomberg after the report. "I think the Fed could cut 50 basis points. I think they should." David Kelly, the chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Business Insider that while a jumbo rate cut is in play, he still needs to see more data. "Whether they cut 50 or not, depends upon the strength of the inflation number that we get next week," he said. The jobs report is another example of how bad news is turning into good news for the market as investors eye soon-to-come monetary policy easing. Jobs growth over the last four months has been lackluster and fueled concerns about a potential recession, but the prospect of rate cuts being just around corner is too good for investors to pass up, explaining why stocks remain around all-time highs. The economy added just 22,000 jobs over the month of August, falling significantly short of the 75,000 job gains that were expected for the month. Several sectors in the labor market also showed net job losses. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, ticked higher to 4.3% from 4.2%, the highest jobless rate recorded since 2021. "With the weak job growth, the Fed is cleared to cut rates in September. The question is whether we get 25bp or 50bp," Scott Helfstein, the head of investment strategy at Global X, wrote in a note on Friday. "Job growth is clearly signaling a slowdown in the economy," Kevin O'Neil, a senior research analyst at Brandywine Global, wrote in a note. "The weakness in the labor market is too significant for the Fed to ignore," he added. The jobs report didn't contain all bad news. Wage growth remained steady and grew at a 3.7% clip year-over-year, offering one glimmer of optimism, Helfstein added. "Though there may be fewer new jobs, wages growing faster than inflation means the consumer is likely to keep spending, and that remains an important driver in this part of the economic cycle. That may be the silver lining here," he said. Jump to

Title: Crypto pours into TradFi faster than Wall Street can keep up, says Franklin Templeton’s crypto lead

About us Copy link The race to attract crypto investors is heating up. While some traditional financial institutions had already begun experimenting with blockchain products, regulatory shifts in the US in 2025 have sharply accelerated crypto’s push into mainstream finance. Roger Bayston, Franklin Templeton’s head of digital assets, told DL News that the speed at which crypto firms are entering securities-related businesses is significantly faster than that of financial institutions adopting blockchain technology. “There’s the ‘have-wallet’ ecosystem, and the ‘want-wallet’ ecosystem,” Bayston said, characterising these two groups. “The ‘have-wallet’ ecosystem is likely to journey into the securities-related businesses faster than the ‘want wallet’ ecosystems. In the past few weeks, Bayston’s “have-wallet” players have indeed stormed traditional finance en masse. On Wednesday, Ondo Finance, a tokenisation platform, announced that it would enable users to trade tokens representing over 100 stocks and exchange-traded funds on Ethereum. ‘The “have-wallet” ecosystem, which was tremendously influential in the election.’ Earlier this year, heavyweight crypto exchanges, including Kraken and Coinbase, announced plans to offer users stock trading as well. This influx is largely due to the drastic changes in the US under President Donald J. Trump. In July, he signed into law landmark legislation that makes the issuance of stablecoins legal for banks and non-banks. Trump-appointed commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission have either paused or halted several high-profile lawsuits against numerous crypto companies, too. “The ‘have-wallet’ ecosystem, which was tremendously influential in the election, and got them regulations melted away, and many new ideas moving forward,” Bayston said. Traditional financial institutions, by contrast, have gradually inched onto the blockchain over the past few years. Franklin Templeton was one of the first, after it launched its BENJI fund on Ethereum in 2021. Other prominent brands, such as BlackRock, the $12 trillion asset manager, launched a similar money market fund in November 2024. These days, the tokenisation market, a niche representing the total of various financial instruments that exist on the blockchain, is now worth more than $28 billion, according to RWA.xyz. Bayston believes these two disparate worlds will soon merge into a single market, portfolio by portfolio — so long as a business can cater to the full range of investor interests. “It’s going to be a 24/7 environment where you can highly customise your portfolio, and the more customisation that can be delivered, the stickier the assets are for that platform,” he said. Naturally, Bayston and Franklin Templeton expect to be well placed for this transition. “Navigating that kind of in-between space as all of these things move forward is something we find to be a very promising thing to be doing.” Liam Kelly is a DeFi Correspondent at DL News.

Title: Tokenization Is 'Mutual Fund 3.0,' Bank of America Says
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/05/tokenization-is-mutual-fund-3-0-bank-of-america-says

Bank of America (BAC) sees tokenization, the creation of a virtual investment vehicle on the blockchain linked to a tangible asset, as the next phase in the evolution of investment products, describing it as “mutual fund 3.0,” the Wall Street bank said in a Friday report. Just as mutual funds first emerged in 1924 and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reshaped investing in the 2000s, blockchain technology could underpin a new generation of financial vehicles, analysts led by Craig Siegenthaler wrote. Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is advancing quickly. The bank noted that firms like Securitize are working with managers including BlackRock (BLK), Apollo, KKR and Hamilton Lane to issue tokenized funds. Asset manager WisdomTree (WT) built its own tokenization engine, giving it the ability to offer more than a dozen tokenized funds. According to data provider RWA.xyz the value of real-word assets represented on-chain exceeds $28 billion, largely in private credit and Treasuries. Still, regulation remains a headwind. The GENIUS and Clarity Acts address stablecoins, but leave many questions about tokenized funds unresolved. Still, the bank argues, the advantages of tokenization will drive adoption over time despite limited access for U.S. investors today. The case for tokenized equities is weaker because U.S. brokers already offer commission-free stock and exchange-traded fund (ETF) trading after Robinhood’s (HOOD) disruption in 2019, the analysts wrote. That shift pushed firms toward monetizing client cash and order flow, making tokenized versions of these assets less compelling, the bank's analysts said. But tokenized money market funds, powered by smart contracts, could upend those cash sweep economics and open new revenue models. Distribution is still the bottleneck. Platforms offering tokenized funds remain rare, though online brokers like Robinhood, Public and eToro (ETOR) are well positioned given their crypto businesses and younger, self-custody-oriented client bases. Coinbase (COIN) may also emerge as a partner as it expands beyond pure crypto, the report added. Bank of America expects tokenized money market funds to lead adoption thanks to their attractive yields relative to stablecoins, which cannot pay interest under the Genius Act, with private credit and high yield likely to follow.

President Éamon de Valera with John F Kennedy during the US president's Irish visit in June 1963. The campaign to elect the president of Ireland is not fully up and running. While we wait, I like to look back at presidents and visitors to Áras an Uachtaráin such as General Montgomery of World War II fame, who was keen to meet President Éamon de Valera as he greatly admired him. De Valera was elected to two terms as president – in 1959 and in 1966, at the age of 83. He was involved in Irish history’s big moments – from the 1916 Rising, the War of Independence and the Civil War. He was Taoiseach during World War II and attended the funerals of President John F Kennedy in 1963 as well as those of civilians shot dead on Bloody Sunday in 1972. As well as Montgomery, other visitors to the Áras included Kennedy, Richard Nixon and Princess Grace of Monaco. Nearly a quarter of a million people lined his funeral route in September 1975. Erskine Childers was elected in 1973, but died of a heart attack in 1974. A minister in various Fianna Fáil governments, his father took part in the War of Independence and was executed in the Civil War. Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh was a judge at the European Court of Justice. He believed that the office of president was publicly disrespected in 1976 by the coalition government when he had legal concerns about a security bill it wanted him to sign into law. He referred it to the Supreme Court to check its constitutionality before signing it into law. He resigned as a protest on the lack of respect for the presidency. Mary Robinson was our first female president to be elected, in 1990, and is still in public life. She visited Egypt’s border with Gaza last month to hear of problems in getting food aid into war-torn Gaza. President Michael D Higgins also speaks strongly on human rights. He has criticised the EU for not responding adequately to the Gaza crisis. He may be remembered as our foremost humanitarian president. Mary Sullivan, College Road, Cork Having read Oliver Callan’s article on the presidency (‘Gentleman Jim will treat his rivals fairly in most bloodless presidential race ever’, Irish Independent, September 4), I wish to say that although I am an ardent GAA fan, I know little of the character of Mr Gavin, even if he did oversee the greatest ever Dublin team. Mr Callan could be right, but I do not believe there is any such thing in politic as a bloodless battle. He is confident that Mr Gavin only has to turn up, and that it will be akin to Dublin playing Carlow, in terms of results. If it was that simple, politics would not be the art of the possible. The dutiful Fianna Fáil backbenchers lined up on the plinth of Leinster House on Wednesday like altar boys. But it’s not over yet. Mr Callan is overlooking the fact the nature of the campaign is brutal for all: any ­possible flaw is hunted for and pounced upon. This contest could turn into a clash more like the epic Meath v Dublin sagas of old. Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo The presidential campaign reminds me of the The Traitors Ireland TV show. Allow me to explain. Catherine Connolly was first out of the traps with great enthusiasm. She is like David. From Wednesday’s Irish Independent, he was “breakdancing in the sitting room, jumping over the back of the sofas”. Sadly for him, he was given the bum’s rush early on. Jim Gavin says little. He is like Paudie, who is playing a similar game. So far he has attracted little negative attention and is predicted to go far. Heather Humphreys is like Eamon, the garda who is not a garda. He is too cool for school, but already he is attracting suspicion. He burned brightly at the start, but his flame is now dimming. Billy Kelleher, with an impressive political CV, is like Niall the Gaeilgeoir teacher who saved the day because of his “líofacht sa Ghaeilge”, only to be dispatched for exactly the same reasons. Who will ultimately be crowned president of Ireland and scoop the top prize of €250,000? You decide in a public vote on October 24. Tommy Roddy, Ballybane, Co Galway Israel is conducting genocide in Gaza before the eyes of the world. The UN has formally declared that there is a famine in the area. The response from the US and its president, who once claimed that he could end this shameful tragedy overnight, is nothing more than grandstanding and play-acting. The murderous situation in Gaza could be ended by the US and Western democracies working together to this end. They should do so before Gaza becomes another indelible stain on the conscience of humanity. J Anthony Gaughan, Blackrock, Co Dublin Thank you Raymond Deane for your comment (Irish Independent, Letters, September 4). I did vote for Brexit, and believe Britain has “shared values” with Europe, especially Ireland. For the record, I do not support the UK selling arms to Israel so viciously used against innocent Palestinian people by the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who stands indicted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. Hopefully, in the near future, an independent Palestine can take its rightful place on the world stage alongside a reunited Ireland. Dominic Shelmerdine, London The ongoing strike by school secretaries and caretakers exposes a serious injustice in our education system. These vital workers are still denied basic entitlements – pensions, fair sick leave and bereavement leave. It’s unacceptable. Schools depend on these people every day. Secretaries manage medical needs, maintain records and act as first responders in emergencies. Caretakers handle fire safety, hygiene and building security. Without them, schools cannot operate safely, or at all. To deny these workers fair conditions is not only unfair: it puts children’s health and safety at risk. As a retired teacher, I know schools are held together by the work of these professionals. I urge fellow educators to support them on the picket lines and demand the Government resolve this dispute with justice and respect.

Title: From fish and chips to baba ganoush: Corinna Hardgrave’s favourite takeaways around Ireland

It’s hard to believe I’ve been writing this takeaway column for more than three years – the extra kilos prove it. This is my final article on takeaways, and instead of a top 10 – I’ve too many favourites – here are the places that stood out. Eunice Power opened AndChips on the Quays in Dungarvan, Co Waterford, in 2019, serving only wild Irish fish, a model for how fish and chips should be done. Also excellent is Fish on MacCurtain Street, Cork, where the fritto misto and cod and chips are the things to order. The Little Saltee in Kilmore Quay, Co Wexford is top notch. For seafood, there’s Julia’s Lobster Truck in Ennistymon, Co Clare, with scampi po’ boy, and lobster and chips; and in Letterfrack, Co Galway, Snappy Snappy is the spot for crab rolls. Grá Pizza in the North Kildare Sports Club in Maynooth does great pies such as The Flann O’Brien with Ballymakenny potatoes and cheese. In Dublin, Doom Slice’s Detroit-style is finished with a cheesy frico crust; Mani on Drury Street is famous for its carbonara slice; and Bambino on Stephen Street Lower serves classic New York-style slices. In Galway, the Dough Bros use The Wooded Pig’s pepperoni on the Pepp Guardi-Jala – a classic. Chiya on Dawson Street in Dublin 2 serves Berlin-style kebabs grilled on vertical rotisserie spits. Passion4Food on Clanbrassil Street Lower has the same sight: chicken and lamb doner kebabs on the vertical grill. At D’Grill on Aungier Street, Dublin 2, the mantos (steamed dumplings) are filled with lightly spiced minced beef and onions. Yalla in Dundrum goes beyond shawarma with standout baba ganoush and kibbeh bil laban. Umi Falafel now has branches in Dublin, Cork and Belfast offering notably good value for their falafel wraps. Dash Burger on Kevin Street Lower in Dublin 8 does first-rate smash burgers, while The Burger Cartel in Herbert Park, Dublin 4 (and other markets) does grilled burgers. Mad Egg on Charlotte Way, Dublin 2, fries free-range chicken to order. In Walkinstown and Tallaght, Ian Ussher makes a good Korean fried chicken at Cluck. In Letterkenny, Co Donegal, The Dirty Souls do Texas-style brisket. At Sumi’s Kitchen at Ryan’s pub in Beggar’s Bush, Dublin 4, the tawa pulao – spiced rice with vegetables – is a hit. Al Khair at the mosque on the South Circular Road turns out really good lamb nihari. Tadka House in Rathmines, Dublin 6 and Blanchardstown kicks up the heat with its Jaipuri laal maas, lamb in a sauce of Mathania chillies. You’ll find seekh kebab kathi roll at Joginder Singh’s Spice Village in Terenure, Dublin 6W, and Rialto, Dublin 8; Spice Cottage in Sallynoggin delivers rich north Indian dishes like lamb kohlapuri; and The Little Yeti in Loughlinstown does Nepalese steamed dumplings. Hyderabadi Kitchen on Camden Street, Dublin 2, specialises in dosas, and in Cork, Spice Genie pops up at Midleton Market, Co Cork, with masala dosa. The Pie Guys pop up at The Black Market in Dornan’s Yard and Cork’s English Market. Pies, such as Beef and Beamish, come with buttery mash. Argentinian chef Victor Franca grills on a custom-built parilla at Nua Asador in Cork’s Marina Market. For Dublin’s work crowd, Tiller and Grain – run by Ottolenghi alum Clair Dowling – is the place for salads, as are Jack and Theo Kirwan’s Sprout branches, using produce from their Kildare farm. For sandwiches, there’s Green Bench on Montague Street, Dublin 2 (try the hoisin pork or veggie hot pot), Little Geno’s on St Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2 (classic Reuben), and Carved in Grand Canal Dock and Ballsbridge, Dublin 4 (porchetta with fennel). On Parnell Street, Dublin 1, Pho Kim’s rice paper spring rolls make a fresh, aromatic lunch. For rotisserie free-range chicken, head to Poulet Bonne Femme in Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock and Avoca. And in Kenmare, Co Kerry, Bean & Batch delivers top-class sandwiches, sausage rolls and apple tart. Some takeaways are “heavy hitters” – spin-offs from big-name restaurants. At Kevin Hui’s China Sichuan to Go in Sandyford, Dublin 18, the star is aromatic duck with cucumber, spring onion, plum sauce and pancakes. At Sunil Ghai’s Street in Dublin 14, the Punjabi black dal – lentils slow-cooked for 36 hours – is legendary, while Asheesh Dewan’s Jaipur in Dalkey serves the best takeaway biryani. At Una in Ranelagh, Dublin 6, queues form for sourdough from John Wyer of Forest Avenue; alongside focaccia, quiche and pastries. Some cuisines were entirely new, like Australian chef Mark Senn’s Mushroom Butcher in Portobello, Dublin 8. He runs a weekend truck with his partner, growing mushrooms next door and changing the menu every two weeks, with highlights including mushroom acarajé. Mama Shee, once at Merrion Square market in Dublin 2, now runs a Nigerian/west African canteen in Tallaght – the goat curry is essential; and Georgian Delight in the Moore Street Arcade, Dublin 1, introduced me to acharuli khachapuri, bread filled with molten cheese and a soft egg yolk. Three years, too many kilogrammes and countless plastic containers later, what stays with me is the proof that independent operators can be as inventive and committed to quality produce as any top dining room. It has been a joy eating through it – now the only thing left is to put down the delivery bag and get on the treadmill. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Technocracy Rising

Editor Tech Greg Reese Technocracy Rising by Greg Reese While many people rightly say that money is already digital, when world leaders say the word “digital money” today, it means cryptocurrency, which is now part of a worldwide scheme to monitor your actions and control your money. This new form of currency will require you to have a unique digital wallet, which is essentially a digital ID. Last Spring, European Central Bank President Christine Largarde said that the ECB will be ready to launch the Digital Euro by this October. According to the Atlantic Council, 137 countries and currency unions are preparing for a Crypto Digital Currency. Three countries have already launched theirs, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria. CBDC’s in the advanced stages are the Digital Euro, China’s Digital Yuan, India’s e-rupee, the United Kingdom’s Digital Pound, Brazil’s Digital Real, and Russia’s Digital Ruble. Hong Kong is preparing to launch a Stablecoin. Japan’s Financial Services Agency is preparing to launch a Japanese yen Stablecoin this fall. And President Trump, who has been pushing Stablecoin development, has repeatedly announced that the USA will lead the world in AI and Crypto. His family is heavily invested, and stand to make billions when the world goes Crypto. The Trump family even have their own Stablecoin, the USD1 Stablecoin from World Liberty Financial. Trump’s puppetmasters likely have another Stablecoin in mind to be the Digital Dollar, but a puppet can still dream. The only difference between a CBDC, Central Bank Digital Currency, and a Stablecoin, is name only. Both will be programmed according to the nation’s financial policies. Both are capable of operating a carbon tax and a social credit score. The only difference is one will be managed by a Central Bank, and the other by a private corporation, in the USA, something like Blackrock. CEO of BlackRock and long time business associate of President Trump, Larry Fink, was recently appointed interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum. The Trump administration has been normalizing the deployment of the US Military as a police force in the streets of America. And according to Fox News, Pentagon officials are about to mobilize National Guard troops in 19 states to assist Homeland Security with President Trump’s nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration and crime. This likely means ID checkpoints, because how else will a citizen prove their citizenship? But with a new Digital ID, the military police state can simply scan you from a distance with Palantir technology. Doctors are discussing online how President Trump’s swollen ankles and hand bruising are indications of congestive heart failure. The bruises on the hand being typical of IV diuretic treatments. The White House says its from shaking hands. If Trump goes the unfortunate way of the clot shot, which he is still proud of, then JD Vance will be President. And he owes everything to Palantir’s Peter Thiel, one of Technocracy’s biggest cheerleaders. The stage is now set for crypto and Digital IDs, and if that happens, there will be push back. Especially in the 19 states being supplied with the National Guard. Tech Tech Tech

Title: Goldman Sachs says gold could hit $5K as fears grow over Federal Reserve’s independence

Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs predicted that gold prices could soar to the $5,000 mark on fears that President Trump is trying to clamp down on the Federal Reserve’s independence. The precious metal has rallied 35% this year to more than $3,500 per troy ounce, making it one of the world’s best-performing major assets. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation. “A scenario where Fed independence is damaged would likely lead to higher inflation, lower stock and long-dated bond prices, and an erosion of the dollar’s reserve-currency status,” Goldman Sachs analysts including Samantha Dart said in a note. “In contrast, gold is a store of value that doesn’t rely on institutional trust,” the note added. “Gold remains our highest-conviction long recommendation in the commodities space.” The paper is the David Solomon-led lender’s latest dig at Trumponomics. The president went on a furious Truth Social tirade last month and called for Jan Hatzius, the bank’s chief economist, to be fired after he predicted consumers would end up picking up the tab for the tariffs that the White House has slapped on imported goods. “I think that David should go out and get himself a new Economist or, maybe, he ought to just focus on being a DJ, and not bother running a major Financial Institution,” the president wrote. However, the price of shares in the top bank have surged by more than 50% over the past year, and stood at $740.73 in afternoon trading on Thursday. Goldman’s view was also echoed by economists at the BlackRock Investment Institute who warned that markets “can no longer rely on longer-term US Treasuries to offer protection during equity selloffs.” Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.

Never miss a story. “Gold has surged as investors seek other ways to build resilient portfolios; indeed, foreign central banks now hold more gold than US Treasuries,” the Sept 2. paper said. “Investors must find new sources of resilience as diversifiers grow scarcer.” American Hartford Gold is a top-rated precious metals dealer specializing in gold and silver for physical delivery or within retirement accounts. Known for its transparency, white-glove customer service, and easy-to-navigate onboarding process, the company helps investors hedge against inflation and economic volatility. Whether you’re new to gold or rolling over a 401(k) into a Gold IRA, AHG provides tailored solutions, real-time market tracking, and secure storage options — all with no hidden fees and a price match guarantee. GoldCo is a leading provider of gold and silver IRAs, helping investors protect and grow their retirement savings with precious metals. With a strong reputation for client satisfaction and financial education, GoldCo makes it simple to diversify your portfolio with physical gold, offering personalized consultations, secure vaulting, and tax-advantaged strategies. Its team of experts guides clients through the entire rollover process, offering transparency, competitive pricing, and long-term support. The price rise of the precious metal appears to indicate that markets are indeed concerned about the political uncertainty that surrounds the future makeup of the Federal Reserve. It follows a months-long spat between Trump and Chair Jerome Powell over whether to slash interest rates now. The pair have clashed over the costly overruns of the Fed’s $2.5B downtown DC HQ, as well as the allegations of mortgage fraud surrounding Governor Lisa Cook. The DOJ announced earlier on Thursday that it was opening a probe into the Joe Biden-era appointee. But critics of the president claim he is trying to oust members of the Federal Reserve Board who are refusing to cut the key borrowing rate immediately. Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Wednesday repeated his call for an interest-rate cut in September given the weakening in the labor market. “I think we need to start cutting rates at the next meeting, and then we don’t have to go in a locked sequence of steps,” Waller said in an interview on CNBC Advertisement

Δ Citi Portfolio Solutions powered by BlackRock, announced Thursday (Sept. 4), will see BlackRock manage around $80 billion in assets for thousands of Citi Wealth clients whose accounts are currently managed by Citi Investment Management (CIM). “We want to bring best-in-class advice, solutions and service to our clients, and we want to serve more of the world’s changemakers,” said Andy Sieg, Citi’s head of wealth. “With this offering, we can accomplish both. It brings together the sophisticated relationship-driven and market-based advice of our bankers, backed by the insights of our own Chief Investment Office, with the renowned investment expertise and innovative technology capabilities of BlackRock.” According to a news release, the agreement will see BlackRock manage a mix of “core, opportunistic and thematic” investment strategies across equities, fixed income, multi-asset Class strategies and, eventually, private markets. Citi has also chosen BlackRock’s Aladdin Wealth technology platform — which features advanced risk, portfolio management and data insight capabilities — to help the bank’s private bankers and investment professionals. The announcement came the same day that Merrill and Bank of America introduced a private market program aimed at the bank’s ultra-wealthy clients. The Alts Expanded Access Program, designed for ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) clients with a net worth of $50 million or more, is set to launch this fall. Meanwhile, recent PYMNTS Intelligence research has uncovered a subtle not still notable shift among higher-income Americans when it comes to managing their finances. The data shows that as of January, 52% of individuals who make $100,000 or more annually now identify as “reactors” — those who manage finances on an as-needed basis — compared to 27% in February 2024. ​ Higher incomes have traditionally been associated with proactive financial management, characterized by strategic planning, consistent repayment of their debts and building a healthy savings cushion. But the current trend suggests that even affluent people are increasingly employing reactive approaches, addressing financial obligations as they crop up rather than via preemptive planning. “While financial prudence is nothing new, the nature of these reactions suggests that broader economic uncertainties are playing a role,” PYMNTS wrote. “Inflation, geopolitical tensions and fluctuating interest rates have all contributed to a climate of uncertainty that extends beyond traditional economic strata.” Citi Picks BlackRock to Develop Custom Asset Management Offering BofA and Merrill Debut Private Market Program for Wealthiest Clients McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski Says Tipped Wage Laws Create ‘Uneven Playing Field’ SEC Says Regulatory Clarity for Crypto Assets Is ‘Key Priority’ We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: The Mass Shooters Are Performing for One Another

Time Published: 2025-09-04T17:58:46Z
Full Content:
The goal of these attacks is to join a lineage of infamous killers. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. Last week, a 23-year-old opened fire outside a church at a Minneapolis Catholic school, killing two children and injuring 19 other people before dying by suicide. Just a few hours later, the shooter’s YouTube videos began to circulate online. In one, the shooter shows off an arsenal of weapons and ammunition laid out on a bed. The killer laughs and offers a stream-of-consciousness monologue. “I didn’t ask for life,” they say, the camera focused on the shooter’s vape. “You didn’t ask for death.” The video generated a lot of attention, in large part due to the images and phrases that the shooter had inscribed on guns and magazine cases: racial slurs, random expletives, and the names of at least 13 other killers. There were references to Waco and Ruby Ridge as well as BlackRock and ExxonMobil. One of the guns says Release the files! An ammo magazine is scrawled with kill Donald Trump; another says I’m the woker, baby, why so queerious. There are multiple references to memes: Popular phrases like skibidi appear, as does “Lenny Face”—( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)—and an extremely niche allusion to a web comic from 2008. Taken together, the messages are incoherent. This is irony-poisoned nihilism, tactical gear as shitposting—the only cause this person seems to have is to troll the viewer. And it worked. The video was picked apart by people looking for some hints as to the shooter’s motivation or politics. Some right-wing influencers and MAGA-friendly news outlets seized on the killer’s gender identity, insinuating that the shooting had something to do with them being trans. Others fixated on the message about killing Trump and suggested the killer was a deranged liberal. Some left-leaning commentators seized upon the anti-Semitic scrawlings and racial slurs and said the killer was clearly a neo-Nazi. But the rush to make sense of the shooting based on these messages and symbols is misguided. As incoherent, unhinged, or even cringey as the Minneapolis shooter’s videos might seem, they are part of a familiar template of terroristic behavior—one that continues to spread in online communities dedicated to mass shootings and other forms of brutality. In these morbid spaces, killers are viewed as martyrs, and they’re dubbed “saints.” Really, they’re influencers. These disaffected communities live on social networks, message boards, and private Discords. They are populated by trolls, gore addicts, and, of course, aspiring shooters, who study, debate, and praise mass-shooting tactics and manifestos. Frequently, these groups adopt the aesthetics of neo-Nazis and white supremacists—sometimes because they are earnestly neo-Nazis and white supremacists, and sometimes because it’s the look and language that they’re cribbing from elsewhere. It’s always blurry, but it usually amounts to the same thing. In an article published by this magazine last year, Dave Cullen, author of the book Columbine, summed it all up: “As you read this, a distraught, lonely kid somewhere is contemplating an attack—and the one community they trust is screaming, Do it!” Dave Cullen: The Columbine-killers fan club Authorities have not released information as to whether the Minneapolis shooter was active in these online communities. Still, the shooter did appear to be participating in what could only be described as a fandom: One of their guns contains a direct reference to the perpetrator of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting. To understand the dynamics at play here, I spoke at length with Alex Newhouse, a researcher at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies online extremism. He told me that the “proximate goal of these attacks is to entrench the shooter in the broader legacy of violence and propel the legacy further.” The idea, in other words, is to motivate someone else to become a shooter—by creating a public manifesto, leaving a trail of digital evidence, and even livestreaming attacks in some cases. “The more frequently the template shows up, the more likely it will repeat,” Newhouse said. “It’s not ideological in the sense that we tend to think about it. There may be anti-Semitic or fascistic elements therein, but the real incentive is the self-reinforcing legacy of these shooters.” For that reason, Newhouse calls these groups “mass-shooter-creation machines.” There are many different networks of terror online, all with a constellation of differing ideologies, though many of them overlap. There is the Terrorgram Collective, whose leaders were last year indicted by the Department of Justice “for soliciting hate crimes, soliciting the murder of federal officials, and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists.” Another group is known as the True Crime Community, or TCC, which is a collection of users that grew in part out of the “Columbiners” community—these are fans of mass shooters and serial killers. Sometimes, these groups overlap with other violent networks, including those that traffic child pornography and target and exploit vulnerable minors into cutting or otherwise hurting themselves. As the extremism researchers Jean Slater and Ry Terran wrote earlier this year, these groups, as well as right-wing youth subcultures, have blended together into a diffuse, “hybrid threat network.” What this means is that users from all these fringe subcultures—people from Terrorgram, mass-murder fan groups, people looking to groom children, trolls—are interacting across public social networks and private chat communities. These individuals may not all share the same interests, yet they are fellow travelers on many of the worst spaces on the internet. Slater and Terran call this loose network the “Soyjak Attacker Video Fandom,” named in part after a message board started by 4chan users. This network, they write, “is best understood as a fandom or subculture; it has no official membership or leaders. The fandom goes beyond simply admiring mass attackers, and is truly an active and participatory subculture.” This is all meant to be impenetrable to outsiders, which is one reason for the confusion that follows shootings such as the one in Minneapolis. But the dynamics are familiar: There are in-jokes, lore, and, most importantly, real people trying to impress their perceived peers. For instance, in January, the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism and ProPublica reported that two teenagers who carried out separate shootings in Madison, Wisconsin (December 2024), and Nashville, Tennessee (January 2025), crossed paths online and frequented many of the same spaces dedicated to glorifying and discussing mass killings. The report notes that the Nashville killer praised the Madison shooter online as a “saintress” and boasted online that he “used to be mutuals with someone who is now a real school shooter ;-).” Again, all of this confounds traditional attempts at sense making. “So much of the killers’ legacy is built upon the dependability of individual shooters being treated as puzzles to solve and people to understand,” Newhouse told me. “The reaction—by the media, by researchers, by politicians—to dig into these individuals and sort it into something we can wrap our heads around is very human, but it helps sustain this cycle.” The problem is not that media coverage or attempts at explanation necessarily glorifies the shooter, but that it directs attention toward the shooter. That people might be falling for the Minneapolis shooter’s scribblings and raging at each other over potential motivations is likely thrilling to potential copycat killers—proof that the troll still works. We can link to the post still but summarize it ourselves: As one extremism researcher posted last week, the goal of these attacks is to join the lineage of mass shooters and for the next killer to inscribe their name on a gun before an attack. What is chilling about this still-novel brand of extremist violence is that it weaponizes one of the internet’s greatest gifts: the ability for small groups of like-minded people to find each other and build community. To counter this dynamic, Newhouse thinks lawmakers, those in charge of news coverage, and even interested onlookers should redirect attention away from individual perpetrators. Instead, they should focus on how mass shootings are a social problem driven by networks and communities. Addressing the problem would mean tackling the loneliness and alienation that cause people to seek out or fall into these online spaces. It would require real changes to firearm access. It would mean finding ways to counter the degradation of real, physical communities that lead people to retreat to the digital world, and it would mean expecting tech companies such as the infamously permissive Telegram to take a more active role in halting the recruitment of children into dangerous groups. There are no politically easy or fast solutions. But the situation is not hopeless. Near the end of our conversation, Newhouse offered an interesting comparison for the networked phenomenon of the modern, online mass shooter: ISIS. In 2015, Twitter began conducting mass-deletion campaigns of suspected ISIS accounts, significantly disrupting the group’s organizing and recruiting. When ISIS moved to more private networks, a group organized by Europol worked with nine technology platforms and service providers, including Telegram, to identify and suspend ISIS accounts and jihadist content. Eighty-nine countries and institutions, including the United States, have joined a “Global Coalition” to fight ISIS, which continues to monitor digital activity and financial transactions to combat the terror group. “There are signs throughout the last 20 years that you can disrupt well-resourced established networks to make them less prolific, but it requires an extreme amount of government and corporate coordination,” Newhouse said. As for the media, in the aftermath of the Minneapolis shooting, I went back and reread Columbine. I was haunted by the passages that chronicled the mass media’s response to the shooting. In a rush to understand the tragedy and feed a hungry audience, their reporting helped spread rumors—that the killers were goths, that they targeted jocks and minorities, or that they were gay. Some of these mistruths portrayed the killers as outcasts and, crucially, victims. Others incorrectly stated that the killers had executed their plan to perfection. In reality, they botched their attack horribly. Their bombs never went off, and the pair died, according to Cullen, as “miserable failures.” But more than 26 years later, these mischaracterizations endured, becoming foundational lore for young people who want to follow in the killers’ footsteps. The cycle that Columbine helped kick off has evolved into a subculture that is dark, unwieldy, and durable. Yes, it is an outgrowth of sick individuals, broken policy, and a nation brimming with firearms, but also of a culture that refuses to learn lessons from past tragedies. To break this nightmarish cycle, every bit of it has to change.

Title: Three reasons why Ethereum’s price is seen to be heading for $10,000
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/three-reasons-why-ethereum-is-seen-to-head-for-10000/

About us Copy link Ethereum is waking from its slumber, one analyst says. Two years ago, when Ethereum traded at $1,600 and faced mounting competition, Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, called it crypto’s “sleeping giant.” Now, he’s pointing to three converging catalysts that make Ethereum’s investment case one that’s “compelling for long-term holders.” “One enduring lesson I’ve learned from navigating crypto markets over the last decade is that transformative ecosystem shifts often unfold during periods of apparent quiet,” Kerbage wrote in an August 27 note to investors. “My expectation is that ETH can surpass $10,000 once we start to see stablecoin solutions being implemented for US payments.” Kerbage’s latest note came days after Ether broke a new price record. Until then, the token’s price performance was lacklustre this year compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, XRP and Solana. But nowadays, the tide seems to have turned. Fresh regulation surrounding stablecoins, the surge of Ethereum treasuries, “relentless bids” into exchange-traded funds, and the rise of staking yields are driving Ether’s growth. Today, Ether trades at about $4,400, up 83% in the past year. Market watchers are predicting it will trade at $7,500 by years-end, or even at $20,000 at some point in this cycle. Here’s the three reasons why Kerbage sees Ethereum’s price going higher. First, staking. Investors love yield-bearing assets, and Ethereum’s staking model offers exactly that but in crypto form. Nearly 36 million Ether are now staked, according to the Ethereum Foundation, representing nearly one-third of the network’s total supply. “This growth reflects heightened network security and investor confidence, with staking rewards averaging a 2.9% APR, appealing to yield-focused portfolios,” Kerbage noted. Kerbage isn’t the only market watcher who thinks staking will drive a lot of Wall Street interest for Ethereum. For Jeff Park, head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, Ethereum is a stronger corporate play than Bitcoin. “Investors will lean into Ethereum not just so that it can appreciate in price alone, but because someone is doing something with that to generate yield,” Park said. Institutions have been pouring in, with ETFs now holding $24 billion in Ether, according to Coinglass. Some analysts predict large entities will hold 10% of the total supply. Tokenisation is the second driver behind the price, Kerbage said. The tokenisation of real-world assets on Ethereum has blown past projections, reaching $24 billion by mid-2025 — up from just $5 billion in 2022. Moreover, Bank of America forecasts the market will hit $16 trillion over the next five to 15 years. At current growth rates, however, that timeline looks conservative. “That vision is materialising faster than anticipated,” wrote Kerbage. Value stored in RWAs sits just above $15 billion, according to DefiLlama, with Ethereum accounting for $11 billion. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who called tokenisation a potential finance revolution in 2023, reiterated his bullish stance this year, wrote Kerbage. His firm’s own tokenised fund, BUIDL, is the largest in the sector, with $2.2 billion. Kerbage expects the Genius Act to bring even more froth to the sector, as “stablecoins are set to boom.” In third place, there’s the youngsters. Over 50% of Gen Z now owns crypto, with $100 trillion set to move from older to younger generations over the next two decades. “This shift mirrors historical tech adoption — credit cards in the 1990s or the internet’s rise,” Kerbage observed. “Skepticism from older cohorts persists, but a decade into its existence and Ethereum’s utility is undeniable, much like how we now can’t imagine life without smartphones.” Pedro Solimano is DL News’ Buenos Aires-based markets correspondent.

Title: Ørsted sues Trump administration for halting $1.5bn offshore wind project
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/09/04/orsted-sues-trump-administration-for-halting-15bn-offshore-wind-project/
Time Published: 2025-09-04T15:37:53Z
Full Content:
Ørsted has taken legal action against US president Donald Trump’s administration in an effort to restart work on a nearly completed offshore wind project halted by the US government last month. The troubled Danish renewable energy company is seeking a court order that would let it finish its $1.5 billion (€1.3 billion) Revolution Wind project, which was meant to supply enough power for 350,000 homes in north-eastern US. But the US move to halt the development, driven by Mr Trump’s deep scepticism about wind power, has hit Ørsted’s business and sent its shares to record lows. Ørsted said in the court filing on Thursday that the stop-work order was “arbitrary and capricious” after the company and its partners had spent billions of dollars on approvals. It is one of a series of orders issued by the Trump administration aimed at blocking new offshore wind projects, which the president has described as the “scam of the century”. The Ørsted lawsuit comes a day before the company holds an emergency shareholder meeting in Copenhagen aimed at approving a 60 billion Danish krone (€8 billion) rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet, which has been badly damaged by the Trump administration’s repeated attacks on the industry. Ørsted shares are down 38 per cent this year to DKr199 on Thursday. The Danish state and Equinor, Ørsted’s two-largest shareholders with 50 per cent and 10 per cent stakes respectively, have backed the rights issue, as has Norway’s $2 trillion oil fund, which owns 3 per cent. Equinor has itself sued the Trump administration over a stop-work order on its own Empire Wind project. It later dropped the action after the US lifted the order as New York’s governor opened up for more gas pipeline capacity. Norway mustered a big diplomatic push over the affair, including using Jens Stoltenberg, a former head of Nato who is now the country’s finance minister. But Denmark is more exposed as it is already in a major diplomatic stand-off with the US over Trump’s insistence that he can gain control over the Arctic island of Greenland from Copenhagen. While Ørsted executives and Danish officials have tried to work out what Trump might require to restart Revolution Wind, which is 80 per cent complete, they and the wider industry have become increasingly fearful that the US administration is ready to intensify its attacks. Court filings issued in the US in recent weeks show the administration is working to withdraw permits from at least two wind farm developments off the coast of Massachusetts. These are SouthCoast Wind, being developed by France’s Engie and EDP Renewables, and the New England Wind 1 and 2 projects being developed by Avangrid, a subsidiary of Spain’s Iberdrola. Ørsted has a second unfinished project in the US, Sunrise Wind, and some investors worry it could also become a target. The Danish group owns a 50 per cent stake in Revolution Wind, the rest being owned by a unit of BlackRock, but it owns 100 per cent of Sunrise, and its difficulties in selling down that stake are what led to the rights issue. Doug Burgum, US secretary of the interior, has defended the suspension of work on Revolution Wind, citing national security concerns, including the possibility that undersea drone attacks could be launched through a wind farm. “People with bad ulterior motives against the US would launch a swarm drone attack through a wind farm. The radar gets very distorted,” he said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Dutch Pension PZFW Terminates BlackRock, AQR, L&G Mandates Amidst Portfolio Reshuffle

The Dutch pension fund for the health care industry, Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzij, known as PFZW, has terminated BlackRock Inc., AQR Capital Management LLC and Legal & General Investment Management as equity managers. “PFZW has been developing a new investment strategy where financial performance, risk and sustainability are weighed equally within the framework of a total portfolio approach,” a spokesperson for PFZW said. Spokespeople for the fund told Dutch publication NRC that the fund removed thousands of companies in which it had invested as it makes a switch from a largely index-based passive equity portfolio to an actively managed one, in order to gain more insights into and influence over the companies in which it invests. The fund will continue to use several managers across its 50-billion-euro ($58.37 billion) equity portfolio, including internal asset manager PGGM, Lazard, UBS, M&G, Robeco, Man Numeric, Acadian and Schroders. PFZW completed the selection process for its external managers in the first half of 2024 and began executing mandates in January. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  “We have appointed external managers whom we believe are best positioned to carry out PFZW’s assignment under the Investment Policy 2030: delivering market-based returns for a good pension, with an appropriate risk profile and a desired level of sustainability,” a spokesperson for PFZW said. PZFW, which manages 247 billion euros in assets, will continue to invest with BlackRock through a money market fund. “BlackRock clients—including our Dutch clients—continue to invest through BlackRock to meet their sustainable investing goals, entrusting us to manage over $1 trillion in sustainable and transition assets on their behalf,” a spokesperson for BlackRock said. The spokesperson said the firm noted PFZW’s redemption in the first half of the year. NRC reported that PFZW’s discussions with American asset managers on the topic of sustainability became difficult, and firms did not want to face pressure from the administration of President Donald Trump, one increasingly hostile to such investing initiatives. The publication noted these managers were also more hesitant to vote shareholder proxies in favor of sustainability resolutions at shareholder meetings. “PFZW have always voted their portfolio with BlackRock themselves,” the BlackRock spokesperson said. “For eligible clients who wish to participate in the stewardship of their assets, we have built the industry’s largest voting choice program, as well as a climate and decarbonization stewardship program for those clients who choose to prioritize those investment outcomes.” A spokesperson for L&G emphasized its sustainability bona fides. “L&G is a committed global leader in responsible investment,” the spokesperson said. “It is central to the way we drive long-term value creation for our clients, which is why we incorporate it into our investment decisions and stewardship activities. This includes our ongoing work with clients like PGGM, where our relationship remains as strong as ever across asset classes including in other sustainable investment strategies.” Under the Dutch Pensions Act, pension funds in the Netherlands are required to report how their investment policies consider environmental, social and governance factors. BlackRock faces criticism from both proponents and opponents of sustainable and responsible investing, and the $11 trillion asset manager has become a target both as a firm not doing enough to support sustainable initiatives and as one pushing a climate-focused agenda. Earlier this year, BlackRock and several other asset managers left the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which sought to achieve net-zero portfolio emissions among its members. BlackRock’s exit was one of the last before the initiative was frozen. As a result, Dutch pension fund PME Pensioenfonds announced it would review the 5 billion euros it had invested with BlackRock. The pension fund has stated that a decision about its continued work with the manager would be made this year. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s one-time membership in NZAM and similar initiatives was a sufficient reason for some state and federal U.S. lawmakers and asset owners to put the asset manager on notice or divest from it completely. The Texas comptroller’s office, in June, removed BlackRock from a list of companies alleged to boycott the oil and gas industry. BlackRock was also named in a multi-state lawsuit, along with State Street and Vanguard, alleging the trio conspired to suppress the coal market. The Indiana Public Retirement System terminated BlackRock as a fixed-income manager in December 2024 to follow state law after it was determined asset manager had ESG commitments—despite INPRS staff noting no concerns with the performance of BlackRock’s fixed-income strategy.

Title: BlackRock details a trade designed to capitalize on a US dollar that will stay historically weak for years
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-invest-to-benefit-from-weaker-us-dollar-blackrock-2025-9

Stocks outside the US have been big winners this year as factors like tariffs, rate cuts, growing government debt, and a decline in investor confidence have weakened the US dollar. BlackRock says the trend is likely just getting started. "We believe we are toward the beginning of a weaker dollar cycle, which has tended to boost international returns — potentially indicating a structural relationship change that requires investors to consider evolving portfolio construction," the firm said in an August 29 report authored by Gargi Pal Chaudhuri and Kristy Akullian. The continued: "The dollar has long benefited from a cycle of robust US growth and investment. But we think the structural bull market may be challenged amid current trade policy and demand for alternative reserve currencies." The numbers support this view. Dollar weakening cycles since the 1970s have lasted an average of eight years, the firm said. The current cycle is less than three years old. As for how to invest around the trend, the firm said that "unhedged international equities may stand to benefit the most from ongoing currency weakness." Investing in unhedged international stocks means having exposure to them in their local currencies. That way, if that currency rises relative to the dollar, your total return in dollars is larger. On the other hand, if the foreign currency falls relative to the dollar, it eats into your total returns. Investors can choose to hedge their investments in foreign stocks, which takes the currency volatility out of the equation. BlackRock has multiple unhedged international stock ETFs, like the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS). Other examples include the Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) and the Schwab Emerging Markets Equity ETF (SCHE). Data shows investors are still overconcentrated in US stocks, BlackRock said. "The average advisor allocates 77.5% of their equity portfolio to the US, up from 70% in 2018," the firm said. But money is starting to move overseas, with the portion of ETF inflows going to international funds up to 29% from 12% in August last year. That has coincided with strong performance in overseas stocks. IXUS is up 20% in 2025 compared to the S&P 500's 9%. A Bank of America survey of fund managers earlier this year showed that 54% of the group thinks international stocks will be the best-performing trade over the next five years. In the case of a recession, BlackRock said that international stocks may be a better portfolio diversifier than US small-caps, which are subject to the same macro forces that large-cap US firms are. "Lower correlation and corporate reforms in certain parts of the world suggest that most investors could benefit unconditionally from owning more international stocks and seeking alpha in international markets as well as the U.S. markets," said Phil Hodges, co-lead of the Systematic Equities Macro Group at BlackRock, in a quote included in the report.
