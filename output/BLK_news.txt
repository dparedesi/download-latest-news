Layoffs in 2026: At least three large companies have announced mass layoffs in the recent days, and January is not even over yet. The job loss trend that gripped 2025 seems to have entered 2026 too — at least for now — with giants like Meta, Citi Group and BlackRock laying off thousands of staff across roles. The BlackRock layoffs were the most recent job cuts announced by a major company in this month, with the firm announcing that it will let go hundreds of employees. Here is a list of major companies across the world that have announced layoffs in 2026 — Mark Zuckerberg's Meta is planning to cut 10% of its workforce in the company's Reality Labs sector as it plans to restructure to put more money into AI, Bloomberg reported. As per the report quoting a person familiar with the development, the Meta job cuts are expected later this week as the company wants to shift money away from some virtual reality products and into other AI wearables. Last year, Mark Zuckerberg had asked company executives to look for budget reductions within the Reality Labs. Banking major Citigroup is about to lay off around 1,000 employees this week as CEO Jane Fraser seeks to control costs and improve returns at the company. The Wall Street bank had around 227,000 employees at the end of September as per data shared by it. The latest round of layoffs at Citigroup comes as part of the company's plan announced two years ago to eliminate 20,000 jobs by the end of 2026, as per a Bloomberg report quoting people in the know. “We will continue to reduce our headcount in 2026,” Citigroup said in a statement. “These changes reflect adjustments we’re making to ensure our staffing levels, locations and expertise align with current business needs; efficiencies we have gained through technology; and progress against our transformation work,” it added. Under Fraser, who took over as CEO in 2021, Citigroup has seen a company-wide revamp where it exited much of its international retail business and restructured its core operations. BlackRock on Monday said it will fire hundreds of employees across the company, becoming the latest Wall Street firm to announce job cuts. As per a Bloomberg report quoting people in the know, the BlackRock layoffs will see around 1% of its workforce being let go, translating to around 250 employees across divisions. “Improving BlackRock is a constant priority. Each year, we make decisions to ensure that our resources are aligned with our objectives and that we are well positioned to serve clients today and in the future,” a BlackRock spokesperson was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. The move comes as the CEO of the world's largest asset management company pushes for alternative investments.

The Bank of Italy warns of systemic risk as Ethereum's collapsing price could pave the way for network hijacking and asset manipulation. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. An Ethereum price collapse could break the blockchain’s ability to settle transactions and freeze over $800 billion in assets, a Bank of Italy research paper warns. The paper, authored by Claudia Biancotti of the central bank’s Directorate General for Information Technology, outlined a contagion scenario where ETH's price collapse degrades the blockchain’s security infrastructure to the point of failure. Such a breakdown, the report argues, would trap and compromise tokenized stocks, bonds, and stablecoins that major financial institutions are increasingly placing on public ledgers. Essentially, the paper challenges the assumption that regulated assets issued on public blockchains are insulated from the volatility of the underlying cryptocurrency. According to the report, the reliability of the settlement layer in permissionless networks like Ethereum is inextricably tied to the market value of an unbacked token. The paper's core argument rests on the fundamental difference between traditional financial market infrastructure and permissionless blockchains. In traditional finance, settlement systems are operated by regulated entities with formal oversight, capital requirements, and central bank backstops. These entities are paid in fiat currency to ensure trades are finalized legally and technically. In contrast, the Ethereum network relies on a decentralized workforce of “validators”. These are independent operators who verify and finalize transactions. However, they are not legally mandated to serve the financial system. So, they are motivated by profit. The planned jump in capacity relies on a fragile shift to ZK-proof verification that could buckle under network stress. Validators incur real-world costs for hardware, internet connectivity, and cybersecurity. Yet, their revenue is denominated primarily in ETH. The paper notes that even if staking yields remain stable in token terms, a “substantial and persistent” drop in the dollar price of ETH could obliterate the real-world value of those earnings. If the revenue generated by validating transactions falls below the cost of running the equipment, rational operators will shut down. The paper describes a potential “downward price spiral accompanied by persistent negative expectations,” where stakers rush to sell their holdings to avoid further losses. Selling staked ETH requires “unstaking,” which effectively deactivates a validator. The report warns that in an extreme limit scenario, “no validators means that the network does not work anymore.” Under these conditions, the settlement layer would effectively cease to function, leaving users able to submit transactions that are never processed. So, assets residing on the chain would become “immovable,” regardless of their off-chain creditworthiness. Meanwhile, this threat extends beyond a simple halt in processing. The paper argues that a price collapse would drastically lower the cost for malicious actors to hijack the network. This vulnerability is framed through the concept of the “economic security budget,” defined as the minimum investment required to acquire enough stake to mount a sustained attack on the network. On Ethereum, controlling more than 50% of the active validation power enables an attacker to manipulate the consensus mechanism. This situation would enable double-spending and the censorship of specific transactions. As of September 2025, the paper estimates Ethereum’s economic security budget was approximately 17 million ETH, or roughly $71 billion. Under normal market conditions, the author notes, this high cost makes an attack “extremely unlikely.” However, the security budget is not static; it fluctuates with the token's market price. If ETH’s price collapses, the dollar cost to corrupt the network falls in tandem. Simultaneously, as honest validators exit the market to cut losses, the total pool of active stake shrinks, further lowering the threshold for an attacker to gain majority control. The paper outlines a perverse inverse relationship: As the value of the network’s native token approaches zero, the cost of attacking the infrastructure plummets, yet the incentive to attack it may increase due to the presence of other valuable assets. This dynamic poses a specific risk to the “real-world” assets (RWAs) and stablecoins that have proliferated on the Ethereum network. As of late 2025, Ethereum hosted more than 1.7 million assets with a total capitalization exceeding $800 billion. This figure included roughly $140 billion in combined market capitalization for the two largest dollar-backed stablecoins. In a scenario where ETH has lost nearly all its value, the token itself would be of little interest to a sophisticated attacker. However, the infrastructure would still house billions of dollars in tokenized treasury bills, corporate bonds, and fiat-backed stablecoins. The report argues these assets would become the primary targets. If an attacker gains control of the weakened chain, they could theoretically double-spend these tokens by sending them to an exchange to be sold for fiat while simultaneously sending them to a different wallet on-chain. This brings the shock directly into the traditional financial system. If issuers, broker-dealers, or funds are legally bound to redeem these tokenized assets at face value, but the on-chain ownership records are compromised or manipulated, the financial stress transfers from the crypto market to real-world balance sheets. Considering this, the paper warns that the damage would not be confined to speculative crypto traders, “especially if issuers were legally bound to reimburse them at face value.” JP Morgan’s move into tokenized funds poses new challenges to traditional stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. In conventional financial crises, panic often triggers a “flight to safety,” in which participants shift capital from distressed to stable venues. However, such a migration may be impossible during a collapse of blockchain infrastructure. For an investor holding a tokenized asset on a failing Ethereum network, a flight to safety could mean moving that asset to another blockchain. Yet, that presents significant obstacles to this “switch in infrastructure.” First, cross-chain bridges, which are protocols used to move assets between blockchains, are notoriously vulnerable to hacks and may not scale to handle a mass exodus during a panic. These bridges could come under attack, and further rising uncertainty could cause assets to be “speculated against,” potentially causing “weaker stablecoins” to de-peg. Second, the ecosystem's decentralized nature makes coordination difficult. Unlike a centralized stock exchange that can halt trading to cool a panic, Ethereum is a global system with conflicting incentives. Third, a significant portion of assets may be trapped in DeFi protocols. According to DeFiLlama data, about $85 billion is locked in DeFi contracts at the time of writing, and many of these protocols act as automated asset managers with governance processes that cannot respond instantly to a settlement-layer failure. Furthermore, the paper highlights the lack of a “lender of last resort” in the crypto ecosystem. While Ethereum has built-in mechanisms to slow the speed of validator exits, capping processing to about 3,600 exits per day, these are technical throttles, not economic backstops. The author also dismissed the idea that deep-pocketed actors like exchanges could stabilize a crashing ETH price through “massive buys,” calling it “very unlikely to work” in a true crisis of confidence where the market might attack the rescue fund itself. The Bank of Italy paper ultimately frames this contagion risk as a pressing policy question: Should permissionless blockchains be treated as critical financial market infrastructure? The author notes that while some firms prefer permissioned blockchains run by authorized entities, the allure of public chains remains strong due to their reach and interoperability. The paper cites the BlackRock BUIDL fund, a tokenized money market fund available on Ethereum and Solana, as a prime example of early-stage traditional finance activity on public rails. However, the analysis suggests that importing this infrastructure comes with the unique risk that the “health of the settlement layer is tied to the market price of a speculative token.” Reallocation by major holders drives BUIDL-I share class drawdown, impacting BlackRock fund's net outflow. The paper concludes that central banks “cannot be expected” to prop up the price of privately issued native tokens simply to keep the settlement infrastructure secure. Instead, it suggests that regulators may need to impose strict business continuity requirements on issuers of backed assets. The most concrete proposal in the document calls for issuers to maintain off-chain databases of ownership and to designate a pre-selected “contingency chain.” This would theoretically allow porting assets to a new network if the underlying Ethereum layer fails. Without such safeguards, the paper warns, the financial system risks sleepwalking into a scenario where a crash in a speculative crypto asset halts the plumbing of legitimate finance.

Title: JPMorgan Backs Altice USA’s Refinancing of TPG, Goldman Debt

(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. is lending Altice USA an additional roughly $1.1 billion to refinance debt before an early repayment penalty kicks in, a move that may sooth creditors still reeling from a bombshell antitrust lawsuit and controversial debt maneuver. JPMorgan is providing the funds so that Altice can refinance the loan — a $1 billion asset-backed facility it got from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and TPG Angelo Gordon in July — at par value, according to people familiar with the matter. The debt’s call protection period starts in the coming days, meaning Altice would have to pay a premium above par to refinance. Representatives for JPMorgan, TPG and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. A representative for Altice didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Any efforts to preserve Altice’s cash are likely to appease creditors to the embattled telecommunications firm, which has struggled under a heavy debt load and has brought on advisers to evaluate its options. Its lenders have also been rocked by some of its recent moves. In November, the US unit of billionaire Patrick Drahi’s telecom empire sued creditors including Apollo Capital Management LP, Ares Management LLC and BlackRock Financial Management Inc., alleging they had formed an “illegal cartel” when they struck a so-called cooperation agreement. That same month, Altice — which recently rebranded as Optimum Communications Inc. — raised $2 billion from JPMorgan for the early refinancing of a loan due in 2028. While that loan carried some of the strictest investor safeguards in the company’s capital structure, the borrowing was raised with collateral that had been removed from existing creditors, effectively making JPMorgan more senior in the debt repayment line, Moody’s Ratings said in a report. The refinancing comes before a premium kicks in that could allow the lenders to capture as much as 116 cents on the dollar. The asset-backed facility due 2031 is secured by receivables generated by the company’s Bronx and Brooklyn service area and network assets, primarily the Hybrid-Fiber Coaxial network.

Title: What's behind Trump's feud with world's most powerful central banker

Trump's fight with Federal Reserve Chair Powell just took a new twist — sending stocks and the dollar lower and lifting gold. DW looks into whether a new criminal investigation could put the Fed's independence at risk. Federal prosecutors in the United States have launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress on the $2.5 billion (€2.14 billion) renovation of the US central bank's headquarters in Washington, DC. Powell confirmed the probe Sunday in a statement posted on the social media platform X, hitting back at what he said was pressure from the Trump administration on interest rate policy. During US President Donald Trump's first term and since he returned to the White House one year ago, the pair have clashed repeatedly over interest rate decisions made by Powell The Fed chair has maintained that the central bank must set policy independently — guided by economic data rather than political pressure. Trump has grown increasingly vocal in his criticism of the Fed's decisions — notably in March, when the US central bank held interest rates steady. The president wrote on his Truth Social platform that the Fed would be "MUCH better off CUTTING RATES." In April's so-called Liberation Day announcement, Trump said lower rates would help the US economy deal with his sweeping new import tariffs on goods from major trading partners. After calling Powell "stupid" and a "numbskull," Trump went further in July after the Fed still failed to cut rates, saying the policy was "hurting people." That month, Trump even visited the Fed’s headquarters — the first such trip by a sitting president in decades — which was widely seen as expressing his dissatisfaction with Powell. Trump also moved against other senior Fed figures, including Governor Lisa Cook, whom he sought to remove over unrelated allegations. The subsequent litigation is awaiting a hearing in the US Supreme Court. By midyear, US media outlets reported that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had emerged as a front-runner to replace Powell when his term ends in May. He has since downplayed his candidacy. Other reports suggested that the Trump administration was sounding out a wider list of possible successors. More recently, US media outlets have focused on four candidates: longtime Trump loyalist Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. By the end of 2025, Trump said he would announce Powell's successor in January. The growing speculation underscored how much pressure the chairman was facing well before the criminal investigation became public over the weekend. The probe stems from Powell's appearance before the US Senate Banking Committee in June, when he downplayed cost overruns related to the Fed office renovation and unnecessary luxury features, including rooftop terraces and gardens, premium marble flooring and private art collections. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott had raised concerns prompted by a New York Post article that likened the project to the French Palace of Versailles — the former royal residence near Paris commissioned by King Louis XIV. Powell pushed back at what he said were "inaccurate" and "misleading" claims and denied luxury add-ons, saying the project, which is self-funded by the Fed rather than via taxpayers, focused on modernization and long-term cost savings. A month later, Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna announced that she was referring Powell to the Department of Justice (DOJ), accusing him of perjury and making false statements. As the DOJ rarely comments on active investigations, a spokesperson for the agency declined to react to Powell's statement on Sunday, but said: "The Attorney General has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars." In his video statement, Powell labeled the investigation as "unprecedented action," which he said is really linked to the Trump administration's pressure over interest‑rate policy. "This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. ... Those are pretexts. ... This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether, instead, monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation," the Fed chair said. "Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats," Powell said, adding that he would continue to do the job "with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people." The probe caused a selloff in US stocks and the dollar on Monday, while Gold jumped to a record $4,600.33 per ounce. Trump has denied any knowledge of or involvement in the DOJ probe, but repeated his belief that Powell is "certainly not very good at the Fed and he's not very good at building buildings." In an interview with NBC News on Sunday night, Trump said: "What should pressure him [Powell] is the fact that rates are far too high — that's the only pressure he's got." As the central bank of the world's largest economy, the Fed's core mission is to set interest rates, keep inflation close to its 2% goal, support maximum employment and keep the financial system stable. It also supervises banks, acts as a lender of last resort during financial crises and helps keep credit flowing through the US economy, which has for decades also been the world's most attractive investment market. As the US dollar is the world's so-called reserve currency in which much of world trade is conducted, the Fed’s interest‑rate decisions have ripple effects globally, influencing borrowing costs, capital flows and economic growth far beyond the United States. The Fed is not funded by the US government; instead, it earns income from loans to corporate banks and its investments in US government bonds, currencies and other securities. The Fed's independence is widely seen as critical to avoid political pressure, which is often based on short-term goals because of the four-year US presidential election cycle. The bank's decisions to cut or raise interest rates are vital to prevent high inflation and steady the US economy during downturns. Though these moves may be unpopular among voters, proponents of Fed independence say handing interest rate control to elected politicians would risk destabilizing the economy. In reaction to the Powell probe, Capital Economics disputed whether central bank independence has helped keep inflation low historically and warned that high levels of public debt would make it harder to control price rises via interest rate hikes. But the London-based research house warned that "any shift away from monetary policy autonomy would send a worrying signal of a weaker commitment to maintaining low inflation." Many economists and corporate leaders believe that Trump's unprecedented tariffs have already hurt investor confidence in US sovereign debt and the economy's long-term future. Edited by: Uwe Hessler

Title: Bitcoin ETF redemptions explain why BTC stalled near $91k

Bitcoin’s rally stalled near $91,000 as BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led more than $300m in redemptions. Bitcoin’s rally stalled on 12 January as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded another daily negative flow to cap the week. BlackRock’s IBIT led the selling and triggered a wave of real BTC transfers to Coinbase Prime. According to Lookonchain data, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined net outflow of 3,734 BTC on the day, equivalent to roughly $339 million at current prices. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust [IBIT] accounted for the bulk of that move, shedding 2,791 BTC, while Grayscale’s products lost a further 891 BTC. The selling came as Bitcoin struggled to hold above the $91,000–$92,000 range, failing to sustain a breakout after a brief rally earlier in the session. Blockchain data adds a crucial layer to the ETF flows. Arkham Intelligence shows that wallets linked to BlackRock’s IBIT sent large tranches of Bitcoin to Coinbase Prime within hours on 12 January. The transactions, visible on Arkham’s tracker, include a long series of transfers of 300 BTC each, alongside a smaller 143 BTC transaction. In total, the visible deposits exceed 3,400 BTC, broadly matching the size of IBIT’s reported daily outflow. Source: Arkham Intelligence Coinbase Prime is the primary settlement venue used by U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. When ETF shares are redeemed, authorized participants receive Bitcoin, which is typically routed through Prime before being sold into the spot market or redistributed across trading desks. The on-chain flows therefore suggest that BlackRock’s ETF redemptions were not simply accounting entries but translated into real Bitcoin being delivered into exchange liquidity pools. The data highlights a structural shift in how Bitcoin trades since the launch of spot ETFs. While ETFs initially acted as a powerful demand engine in 2024, they now operate in both directions. When investors withdraw capital, ETF issuers must source Bitcoin from custody and deliver it into the market, turning redemptions into direct sell-side pressure. On 12 January, BlackRock alone was responsible for nearly three-quarters of total Bitcoin ETF outflows, making IBIT the dominant driver of the day’s liquidity event. Grayscale’s products also continued to see outflows, though on a smaller scale. At the same time, Fidelity’s FBTC recorded a modest +87 BTC inflow, insufficient to offset the broader selling. Bitcoin attempted to extend its January recovery earlier in the day but was rejected above $92,000, before sliding back toward $91,000 as ETF-linked selling emerged. The timing of the Arkham-tracked deposits aligns closely with the intraday reversal, reinforcing the view that institutional flow, not retail sentiment, is now setting short-term price direction. With more than 1.29 million BTC now held across U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, even modest percentage shifts in investor positioning can translate into thousands of coins hitting the market in a single session. The episode underlines how Bitcoin has entered a new phase of market plumbing. ETF inflows and outflows are no longer just sentiment indicators; they now drive physical settlement flows that ripple directly into spot liquidity. BlackRock’s transfer of thousands of BTC to Coinbase Prime shows how quickly ETF demand can flip from absorption to distribution. Price action around key levels is now increasingly influenced by institutional portfolio decisions, rather than just speculative trading.

Title: GOP Sen. Thom Tillis says he will block any of Trump’s Fed picks over investigation into Powell

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) said Sunday he will block any of President Trump’s candidates for the Federal Reserve following news of the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Tillis’ new stance could throw a monkey wrench into approval for any of Trump’s picks to lead the Fed or replace potential retirees — the Senate Banking Committee, which has 13 Republicans including Tillis plus 11 Democrats, must approve all central bank nominees. “If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,” Tillis said in a Sunday statement. “I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved,” added the senator, who is retiring. Powell’s term as chairman expires in May. It’s possible he could stay on as a Fed governor through 2028, though he has declined to comment on whether he will remain on the board. Powell confirmed Sunday that federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into him related to the Fed’s renovation of its Washington, DC, headquarters — after months of Trump bashing the chairman as “Too Late Powell” for not slashing interest rates quickly enough. “No one — certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve — is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure,” Powell said in a Sunday statement. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,” he added. Fellow Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) echoed Tillis’ comments, accusing Trump of wanting to install a “sock puppet” to lead the central bank. “Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends,” said Warren, who years earlier called Powell a “dangerous man.” “This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair.” Amid Trump’s broadsides against Powell, the White House has pressured Fed Governor Lisa Cook to step down, accusing her of mortgage fraud. Cook called those allegations “baseless.” Stephen Miran — Trump’s economic adviser who stepped into a seat vacated by Adriana Kugler — will see his term expire in January. There are also rumors about potential retirements from the board, such as Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and former Fed governor Kevin Warsh are reportedly in the lead in the race to chair the Federal Reserve. BlackRock exec Rick Rieder and Fed governor Christopher Waller have also been interviewed for the position. Prosecutors are investigating Powell over his testimony last summer about the central bank’s renovations. During an interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump denied any involvement in the criminal probe. “I don’t know anything about it, but he’s certainly not very good at the Fed, and he’s not very good at building buildings,” he said. “What should pressure him is the fact that rates are far too high. That’s the only pressure he’s got,” the president added. In December, Trump threatened to sue Powell for “gross incompetence,” adding that he’d love to fire him for not slashing rates at a fast enough pace. During an unrelated press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president fumed at the ballooning costs of Powell’s multi-year renovation of Fed headquarters near the National Mall. “It’s going to end up costing more than $4 billion — $4 billion!” Trump said. “Highest price of construction per square foot in the history of the world.” Last summer, Trump said he wouldn’t fire Powell after the pair wore matching hard hats and toured the central bank’s building renovation project, the cost of which has jumped from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion so far. On its website, the Fed attributed spending increases to unforeseen events, like unexpected costs of materials and labor, more asbestos than anticipated and toxic contamination in the soil. But the project will “reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations,” according to the website. After their tour of the renovation site in July, Trump took questions from the press while Powell stood nearby. At one point, the president said the costs of the renovation were much higher than the latest price tag showed, but Powell quickly jumped in, saying Trump had included costs from a project completed years earlier.

Title: Porter injury 'didn't look promising' - Bleyendaal

Raf Diallo RTÉ Sport Journalist Leinster attack coach Tyler Bleyendaal has admitted that the calf injury Andrew Porter picked up in training last week "didn't look promising" amid a growing front row predicament for Ireland in the build up to the Guinness Six Nations. The New Zealander also said fellow international Paddy McCarthy's foot injury "didn't look great". The prop sustained what the province describe as a "significant foot injury" during Saturday's dramatic 25-24 win over La Rochelle in the Investec Champions Cup. Porter missed that match as a result of his own setback and both he and McCarthy will be assessed before further confirmation on the extent of their respective injuries. "Yeah, obviously, Paddy's didn't look too great for him to come off immediately, so hopefully we get some clarity in the next few days," Bleyendaal told RTÉ Sport on Monday. "We're hoping for the best but it really didn't look too great to be honest and Ports the same. "To come out late in the week with that injury and again, waiting for the official kind of diagnosis, but it didn't look promising that it was going to be a quick turnaround. "So we're going to have to dig in and it's next man up, and we're going to have to find a way. "I thought the guys on the weekend did a great job and Jerry (Cahir) came on and he put his best foot forward and we're going to have to just dig deep into the depth and we've got some guys coming back as well. "So we lose some, we get some and whoever is available is going to have to do their best." McCarthy's injury comes at a time when the 22-year-old has built up real momentum for province and nation, having been rewarded with four caps during Ireland's Autumn Nations Series campaign. It is unclear how long the former Blackrock College student will be sidelined for. But the timing is far from ideal with the potential of a maiden Six Nations campaign just around the corner. "It's never a great time if it's a serious injury but like you say he's been playing so well," Bleyendaal said. "He's been a really valuable player for us - both sides of the ball. From the attack side, he gets us great momentum, defensively he's really solid and I think his set-piece is always improving. "He's been really good for us there. Like you say, he's got that taste of the Irish camp and no doubt he would have been involved again or hopefully still will be and that's why we'll go and get an update on him. "And fingers crossed, because like you say, he's been improving with every game and I think he's definitely got that Irish ambition." Jerry Cahir, who signed a short-term contract after impressing in the Energia All-Ireland League, replaced McCarthy following his withdrawal on Saturday, and the 25-year-old impressed Bleyendaal. "He's packing down scrums against some of the world's best and now he's learning, he's getting his opportunity and he's trying to put it all out there," he said. "It's great reward to see that he can come through that pathway and opportunities do arise. But it's a credit to those guys and their attitude." Bleyendaal also reserved praise for the development of wing Joshua Kenny, who weighed in with two tries against La Rochelle to bring his total up to eight in just six games for Leinster. "Just taking every opportunity that he's been given and he's obviously got some ball in some space and he's finished some tries for us which is great," he said. "But he's put in so much work off the ball as well and he's making cover tackles or he's getting invovled or he's chasing kicks. "He's come in at the start of the pre-season with a great attitude and have just been really impressed with him. "He's willing to make errors but he does it at full speed. He learns and he's willing to make errors and learn again so he's going through that process. "But he's great to watch with ball in hand and space, so it's our goal to get him more opportunities." © RTÉ 2026.

Title: Charles Hoskinson doubts CLARITY Act timeline, says Trump crypto czar should quit

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said the CLARITY Act may not pass this quarter, and criticized US crypto laws for favoring big banks over innovation. Cointelegraph in your social feed Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said he doubts the US Digital Asset Market Clarity Act will pass this quarter and called on President Donald Trump’s crypto adviser, David Sacks, to resign. Hoskinson criticized the US approach to regulating crypto in an interview on Sunday with Bitcoin (BTC) enthusiast Scott Melker on The Wolf of All Streets Podcast. “I don’t think the CLARITY Act is going to pass this quarter,” Hoskinson said, warning that if Democrats regain control of the US House of Representatives in November’s midterm elections, the current window to pass the bill could be lost. “If it doesn’t pass this quarter, I think Sacks should resign,” he added, blaming Sacks for “utterly failing” the crypto industry since taking on the role of Trump’s crypto czar in late 2024. Introduced in May 2025, the CLARITY Act cleared both the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee with bipartisan support. It seeks to clarify the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in regulating cryptocurrencies, and to provide guidance on different types of tokens. The Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to vote on the bill later this week, in a potential milestone for the US crypto industry. In expressing doubts over the bill’s passage, Hoskinson said Sacks had “failed” the industry in three areas, including falling prices, lack of regulatory clarity and the absence of a strong foundation for building projects. “If you’re the czar and you’re in charge of this whole thing, I got to judge you by your track record. Most cryptos are down 40 to 50% since Trump took office. So the industry is unhealthy,” he said. Expanding on the industry’s struggles, Hoskinson also argued that other bills, such as the stablecoin-related GENIUS Act, favor large financial institutions over retail investors. “It [GENIUS Act] centralizes the industry around BlackRock, Cantor, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley and all these big guys,” he said, adding that the bill essentially “handed Wall Street the keys to the crypto kingdom.” Related: Coinbase could pull CLARITY Act support over stablecoin rewards ban Addressing Trump’s approach to crypto, including the controversial Trump memecoin, Hoskinson urged the US not to favor or nationalize cryptocurrency, warning it should remain a global, neutral product: Hoskinson said crypto laws should be passed carefully, with the industry united and the US government working alongside it rather than rushing for partisan gain. “Even if it takes longer to get done, the goal should be to pass rules that last and don’t harm innovation,” he said.

Title: Does Washington’s Global War Against China’s Oil Suppliers Stand Any Chance of Success?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/?p=303898
Time Published: 2026-01-12T11:00:24Z
Full Content:
Does it make any sense? Among the White House demands of Venezuela is that it “kick out” China and sever economic ties. The Financial Times declares that “Donald Trump’s Venezuela action raises threat for China’s oil supplies.” As even Seymour Hersh reports: Their bluster and crude language transfixed the world’s media, but they also diverted attention from an opportunistic Trump plan whose goal was not only to unseat the corrupt President Nicolás Maduro, but also, crucially, to cut off China, America’s economic rival, from its ongoing purchases of Venezuela’s cheap heavy crude oil. Okay, but there’s a problem. China Does Not Rely on Venezuelan Oil While the mainstream media has mostly ignored this fact, it is clear: China is by far Venezuela’s largest oil customer (left chart: https://t.co/9SokdGJ3Z6). But Venezuela is a tiny fraction of China’s oil imports and doesn’t even make the top 10 for 2024 according to Chinese customs data (right chart: https://t.co/WrXoVAQKlj). pic.twitter.com/YAJi8HhuF7 — Kyle Chan (@kyleichan) January 7, 2026 China was the major buyer of crude from Venezuela, but those shipments made up only 4 per cent of China’s oil imports last year. Caracas did, however, provide a high-sulphur crude that’s used to produce bitumen, which is used for construction and road building, and Beijing was getting it at a steep discount thanks to U.S. sanctions on Venezuela sales. According to The Business Times, Beijing has plenty of that sludgy oil in reserve: … a hoard of sanctioned crude in floating storage will cushion Chinese buyers in the coming months. Almost 82 million barrels is currently on tankers in waters off China and Malaysia, according to data intelligence firm Kpler. More than a quarter is Venezuelan and the rest is Iranian, it said. China could take a small hit from the US move in Venezuela. In September, China Concord Resources Corp. (CCRC) installed a self-elevating offshore oil platform in Lake Maracaibo. From Venezuelanalysis: The privately-owned China Concord secured a 20-year deal to run the Lago Cinco and Lagunillas Lago oilfields and will reportedly invest US $1 billion with the goal of raising production from the present 12,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 60,000 bpd by the end of 2026. Chinese oil majors Sinopec and China National Petroleum also have legacy claims to develop Venezuelan oil reserves, but that appears unlikely if the US has its way. Still, let’s look at the makeup of Chinese oil imports, courtesy of the Financial Times: As the Times notes, those imports from Malaysia are believed to be mostly Iranian crude in a route to circumvent US sanctions. And following the kidnapping of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the American Zionists are now back focused on Tehran. Hersh also reported the obvious: The next target, I have been told, will be Iran, another purveyor to China whose crude oil reserves are the world’s fourth largest. And yet even if Washington and Israel are finally able to topple the government there, it would likely just drive Beijing and Moscow even closer together. Let’s look at how that energy relationship continues to evolve ever since Washington embarked on its grand plan topple the government in Moscow. First on natural gas. From Amwaj: Following the September summit of Chinese, Mongolian and Russian leaders in Beijing, Russia’s Gazprom and China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) agreed to launch the Power of Siberia-2 (PoS-2). The pipeline is designed to deliver up to 50B cubic meters (cm) of gas annually to China. Although no firm timeline is set, the project is expected to go online after 2030–31. China and Russia also decided to expand flows through existing gas pipelines. By 2028, the capacity of Power of Siberia-1 will rise from 38B to 44B cm. Meanwhile, the Far Eastern route—expected to enter service in 2027—will transfer 12B cm of gas, up from 10B. Moscow additionally plans to ramp up liquified gas exports to China via the new Arctic LNG-2 project and the existing Sakhalin-2 plant. Despite western sanctions on Russia, China began receiving Arctic LNG-2 cargo in late August, becoming the sole major customer of the project and thereby effectively keeping it alive. Notably, Beijing is expanding imports from Russia despite analysts’ assessment that existing contracts will likely cover the country’s needs over the next decade. It’s almost as if Beijing knows there’s a plan afoot to cut off its supplies and so is leaning on its most reliable and geographically convenient partner. And it’s doing the same with oil. Even if the US knocks out other suppliers and American pirates control most of the world’s seas blocking a huge chunk of the oil trade, disrupting that “dragonbear” hydrocarbon supply chain is a whole different game than Venezuela and Iran, as the years-long unsuccessful Project Ukraine has shown. But is there more at play than simply cutting supply to China. As Nick Corbishley pointed out Friday, even the most American-friendly states in Latin America are having a difficult time severing their relationship with China. Not even the US can do that. So what did Washington achieve on this front—if anything? Grand Industrial Planners or Spoiled Destructive Children? Despite all the talk of the oil and mineral bonanza in Venezuela, there are still loads of roadblocks, and someone will have to point to a recent example of the US successfully building anything. Note Of Extreme Caution To Comrades: DO NOT FALL FOR THE “IT’S ALL ABOUT OIL” LIE I’ve lived through multiple imperial wars where the so-called “left” reflexively responded with the same lazy line: “They’re just there for the oil.” I remember this explicitly during the First… pic.twitter.com/i03Y48xA2n — Chris Morlock (@CDMorlock) January 6, 2026 Morlock offers some important reminders, including: Do you seriously believe that Trump, along with his Palantir Technologies cronies, are about to become industrial planners? That without invasion, without regime change, without national reconstruction, they’ll somehow negotiate a $200 billion, 15-year industrial oil expansion in a country whose infrastructure has been deliberately strangled for a decade? This is a pipe dream of pipe dreams. What’s actually lined up for Venezuela is not extraction, but asset stripping. The firms positioned to “re-enter” Venezuela are overwhelmingly financial, not productive. Asset managers like BlackRock are positioned to absorb distressed sovereign and PDVSA-linked debt, restructure it, and turn future production into collateral streams rather than national revenue. U.S. and European oil majors are waiting not to build capacity but for production-sharing agreements, arbitration rulings, and debt-for-equity swaps that cap output and guarantee rents. Sanctions relief is used as leverage not to expand capacity, but to discipline the state and force Venezuela into IMF-style restructuring, privatization, and legal subordination to Western capital markets. They want the Chinese to pay for this oil in dollars, a minor nuisance for Xi, a silly ploy for the western rentier oligarchs. China reportedly holds roughly $19–20 billion in loans to Venezuela tied to “oil-for-loan” deals. That’s not much, but also won’t set a great precedent if Caracas defaults on the debt and ends resource exports to China. ‘Control’ Over Existing Production in Western Hemisphere? While oil majors are reluctant to jump into Venezuela, what about existing production in the Western Hemisphere? Javier Blas writes at Bloomberg of the US exerting control over all the oil production of countries—from Canada to Argentina— living under the “Donroe Doctrine.” That’s nearly 40 percent of the world’s oil output. Now Blas assumes the US can control this vast territory, but seeing Canada as a vassal state and the rightward, US-friendly turn of much of Latin America, could he be right—at least on the oil front? President Donald Trump now has his very own oil empire. And I’m talking about actual barrels already flowing into the market, not underground reserves that would take time and money to be developed1. With such resources Trump has an economic and geopolitical lever no US president has had since Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1940s. At home and nearby, his country can tap a vast sea of oil. The implications of getting unfettered access to Venezuela’s reserves, the world’s largest, were immediately apparent to anyone in the energy and commodities business, particularly American foes. Oleg Deripaska, a US-sanctioned Russian oligarch, put it well on Saturday: Washington would have the means to keep the oil price close to $50 a barrel — giving it a winning hand in the future against anyone threatening to push the price higher by curbing supply. The Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev said seizing power in Venezuela offered “huge leverage” over the global energy market. Having de facto control of the Western Hemisphere’s petroleum wealth is a geopolitical game changer. For decades, US military adventurism was constrained by the impact of any war on energy costs. Today the White House has primacy over oil-producing allies and adversaries alike — whether it’s Saudi Arabia or Iran, Nigeria or Russia. The past 18 months have already shown what these new hydrocarbon riches mean for US foreign policy. Trump’s administration has taken once unthinkable steps: from bombing Iranian nuclear facilities to helping Ukraine target Russian oil refineries. There is also talk that in the more immediate future the larger effect from the move against Venezuela could be in neighboring Guyana: While the world watches Venezuela, the real story might be next door in Guyana, where the world’s most important new oil frontier was under direct threat. Maduro’s claim to two-thirds of Guyana’s territory (Esequibo region) aimed to seize over 11 billion barrels of onshore and… pic.twitter.com/tHC6Ljh81D — Jack Prandelli (@jackprandelli) January 5, 2026 And there’s the ol’ ‘swingman’ argument: ⚠️The US Has Only 7 Years of Reserves But is pumping 13 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY 🇺🇸🛢️ The United States sits outside the top 5 in proven oil reserves At current production rates, that’s ~7–8 years of reserve life. And yet… The US is the world’s oil swing machine 🔥 ~13 mb/d… pic.twitter.com/N4ssuY4aA6 — Jack Prandelli (@jackprandelli) January 9, 2026 But what of China’s role as a “swingman”? As Kevin Walmsley notes: China is very well-insulated from any supply-side shocks for oil, no matter where from. This is a surprising situation now, for economists and experts in the oil market. China is the world’s biggest importer of crude oil, and the world’s biggest consumer of oil. The traditional thinking – until recently — is that it is the oil suppliers, like OPEC+, who determine the global price for oil, and that big importers, like China, are price takers in the market. Now, if the market faces oversupply, it would be OPEC members who would be price takers, temporarily, until they can push production down to balance supply and demand again. But a new development has scrambled all that convention wisdom: China’s enormous — and still growing — oil storage industry. That is putting a floor on the global prices—Chinese buy when oil prices fall enough, and stash the surplus into their tanks. But there is also a ceiling on price—if prices rise, China will just reduce imports or draw down inventories until prices fall again. Where does it leave us? It sounds a lot like an inverted strategy against Russia. Rather than stopping Moscow’s ability to sell, Washington is now after Beijing’s ability to buy. The real danger for Beijing—and for the rest of the world— is not that the US is likely to succeed; it is that a newly emboldened Washington believes it can threaten, topple, smash, and grab whoever it wants wherever it wants. And it treats the world as a game of Risk. This is the strategic map by @ConGeostrategy you must study in the New Cold War between the Anglosphere and the DragonBear. Venezuela is no longer red. Greenland will face growing American presence. The main interconnected flashpoints will be from the Arctic to the Indo-Pacific. pic.twitter.com/kUFtOUkPaZ — Velina Tchakarova (@vtchakarova) January 8, 2026 This is a good analysis as far as drawing in almost all the relevant threads, including neighboring Guyana where GDP has grown by some 30 percent each of the last two years after the discovery of the offshore oilfield there. What it leaves out of the equation is this— Trump says he will visit Beijing in April and host China’s Xi for a state visit later next year https://apnews.com/article/trump-xi-china-taiwan-aab2ec36f55abc9e98d91a5f0d133a92 Current thinking in China is that Trump wants as much leverage as he can get right now in the short term to reach a grand agreement analogous to the Nixon-Mao summit 55 years ago which set the global power balance in the US’s favor for the following 40 years. Trump’s aim at this Trump-Xi summit is to do that for the next 40 years. And yes, as Conor’s OP notes, the Chinese could reset their oil imports to make up the loss of S. America oil imports with increased Russian imports. But there’s a debate now in China as to whether it wants to make itself that strategically dependent on Russia going forward. Pragmatically, then, Xi and China could take the option of playing along with an agreement which lets Trump return from China claiming that China has acceded in whatever degree to Trump and the US’s terms in the knowledge that, firstly, no such agreement is in the long term worth the paper it’s written on if it’s not advantageous to both sides and, secondly, US decline is baked in at this point. Conversely, though, part of what Trump and the US want is for China to acknowledge No 2 pole position behind the US as the No. 1 global hegemon and also to resume buying US treasury debt — which is now over $38 trillion — in the quantities China formerly did. (Because, honestly, who else can buy enough of it at this point?) Does China need to accept that? What’s the best strategy to handle this dangerous, declining (and frankly racist, in the Chinese view) hegemon, the USA? A big complicating factor is that — as Conor also notes — China believes that, immediately following April and this Trump-Xi summit — where Trump intends to have settled US-China hegemonic relations for the next few decades in the US favor — Trump and the US will then pivot to Iran to settle the disposition of the Middle East as US-Israel wish to have it in the coming decades. Furthermore, Washington and Israel understand that attacking Iran will likely mean that it then close downs oil exports from the Middle East, possibly for years if it attacks and destroys its neighbor’s oil fields. Indeed, they’re planning for it. Europe currently gets roughly 10–15% of its crude oil from the Middle East, for instance. The world’s biggest oil exporter is already the US and, going forward, it intends to control the fifth of proven global oil reserves in South and Central America. So the US will then be able to demand whatever it wants to ask for oil going to the EU…. And so on. You may believe this Trump-US strategy is nutso in its narcissistic grandiosity and has too many moving parts not to fail. But, honestly, it’s no more nutso grandiose that the preceding US plan under the neocons to disassemble Russia and cannibalize its resources in order to recollateralize US and the ‘West’s’ capitalist order. That was Plan A , if you like (to put on my inner Alastair Crooke), and the current Trump-US plan is Plan B. In short, no it won’t work. What stands out here is not whether Washington can meaningfully disrupt China’s access to Venezuelan or Iranian oil – the evidence suggests it cannot – but how misaligned this entire strategy is with the realities now unfolding. Even if U.S. pressure succeeded in constraining a few sanctioned supply routes, it would do nothing to change the underlying condition shaping global power: accelerating climate breakdown. Global heating has already reached 1.5 °C, far sooner than expected, and is now driving non-linear damage across economic and social systems. The clearest signal is coming from the insurance industry, where catastrophic losses are doubling roughly every decade and coverage is being withdrawn from whole regions. When insurance fails, infrastructure investment stalls, housing markets seize up, and state capacity erodes regardless of who controls marginal oil flows. Against that backdrop, oil-centric power games resemble a contest over a resource whose strategic value is already collapsing under physical constraints. The binding limit is no longer access to barrels, but the atmosphere’s diminishing ability to absorb emissions without triggering cascading failures. China’s real insulation does not come from Venezuelan crude or Russian pipelines alone, but from diversification, storage, electrification, and a rapid pivot toward energy systems less exposed to climate risk. By contrast, strategies built around interdiction, asset stripping, and hemispheric dominance assume a stable world in which energy rents can still be converted into durable power. That world is ending. The danger is not that Washington will succeed in cutting China off from oil. It is that major powers remain locked in 20th-century geopolitical scripts while the financial, insurance, and ecological foundations that made those scripts viable are already giving way. Control over energy matters less when the systems that insure, finance, and govern its use are themselves breaking down. Thank you for this very interesting comment. I was mentally fumbling with some thoughts along similar lines. The fear is that the death throes of the incumbent geopolitical system, which is still capable, as we have seen, of wielding great destructive power, are taking us all down with it. I think this space had a comment link a few weeks back that indicated the US and its Isrl partner had plans to produce technology to Geo-engineer the arctic via aerosol dimming to drop the temperature with a yearly rentist model. My guess is if this is so, and they are the first movers to affect lowering of the arctic temps they will be able to hold the world hostage from super-heating the rest of the world and blocking an ice free arctic. Were this to be the new normal, a kind of inverse Dr Stranglove would emerge, where a small group would get their rocks off on seeing others just sweat (literally in places) until they could to pay the fees for this years installment. I would bet the same brinkmanship would occur which is seen when US congress wants to stall on paying employees and just stops paying its government employees until a deal is done. So no need to worry, the two current belligerents have our back in the Climate Change front,,,,and a captive planet…. then they can move to near earth orbit and the outer rim, having sewn up this little place for now as a reseource and revenue stream. I haven’t seen this mentioned yet, but about a year ago Reuters reported that US refiners were running out of heavy sour crude for their refineries, and were contemplating retrofitting them for light sweet crude, which is a rather expensive endeavor, I am led to believe. https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-refiners-mull-switch-alternative-lighter-crudes-amid-trump-tariff-fears-2025-02-20/ Prices have two sides – buyer and seller. If the price of oil, like the Russian Oligarch above, stays at $50 a barrel or lower it will also harm American shale-oil producers who have a $60 cost of production. If Oil prices go up or supplies get limited and China has to pay more for oil, then they will increase prices on manufactured goods and inflation will get passed on to over-consuming countries like the US. Trump’s biggest challenge is improving the lives of voting Americans, not moving pieces on some grand chessboard with the pawns representing foreign countries. He has until early November to pull it off and so far, it doesn’t look like cracking down on illegal immigrants is getting him there. The Chris Morlock tweet is informative, but why the rants about “the left” and end consumers? The US did not rebuild Iraqi infrastructure or import Iraqi oil, yet it controls it. This is the Trump template for Venezuela; control now, consumption later. Why does the US still control every penny of Iraqi oil revenues? Cradle Since the signing of Executive Order 13303 (EO13303) by President George W Bush on 22 May 2003, all revenues from Iraq’s oil sales have been funneled directly into an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. EO13303, titled “Protection of the Development Fund for Iraq and Other Property in Which Iraq Has an Interest,” has been renewed annually by every US president, including Joe Biden in 2024. This executive order essentially places control over Iraq’s oil revenues under the discretion of the US President, leaving Baghdad with limited control over its resources and earnings. The shale plays will be tapped out in the coming decade and the US then pivots to Venezuelan heavy and Alberta tar sands. Climate is not a problem for an 80 yo Trump. The US is a net importer of crude oil (40%) but a net exporter of refined petroleum products (at a profit). The main crude import is from Canadian ‘tar sands’. I’m sure Venezuelan crude looks very inviting to Grump. But that heavy crude is in the future (10 yrs) and lots of capital investment before it can put a dent in the US need for diesel, jet fuel, etc.. Total US oil products consumption is nearly as large as it’s production. Upsetting the oil markets will likely increase the price of gasoline to Americans. (“It’s the economy, stupid!”) Crude Oil Production Current Production Rate: Approximately 13.4 million barrels per day (MMb/d). Production Growth: Increased by 2.5% in 2024, marking a 165% rise since 2008. Domestic Supply: About 60% of the crude oil processed in U.S. refineries is produced domestically. Refined Product Exports Export Rate: In 2024, the U.S. exported around 10.71 million barrels per day of petroleum products. Composition of Exports: 38% of exports were crude oil. 62% were refined petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. Export Growth: Exports of petroleum products rose by 8.3% in 2024. What I find fascinating is that all the major US oil companies seem to have just told Trump publicly that there is no way that they are investing in Venezuela. Well, I think Chevron said it can double production. Clearly Trump and his team did their usual due diligence, wide consultation, and careful advanced planning. I believe the detailed plan read: 1. Kidnap Maduro 2. A miracle occurs 3. We steal the oil Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email * SUBSCRIPTIONS

President Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 7 withdrawing the U.S. from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and 65 related organizations, framing it as a defense of national sovereignty and economic interests. The Treasury confirmed the halt of U.S. contributionsâpreviously 22% of the UNFCCC's budgetâredirecting financial control. China and billionaire Michael Bloomberg's philanthropy stepped in to fill the gap. Major financial institutions (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street) abandoned net-zero alliances amid antitrust probes and political pressure, with critics calling these groups "market-manipulating cartels." Supporters praised the move as freeing American industry from "globalist restrictions," while opponents warned it would cede renewable energy leadership to China and isolate the U.S. diplomatically. Trump's withdrawal signals a broader rejection of multilateral climate governance in favor of unilateral energy dominance, accelerating a global power vacuum filled by Chinaâs expanding influence.

On Jan. 7, President Donald Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the United States from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and 65 other international organizations tied to climate and social justice initiatives. The move, framed as a defense of U.S. sovereignty and economic interests, follows a wave of corporate departures from net-zero alliances amid conservative backlash. Critics of environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies cheered the decision, arguing such agreements harm American livelihoods, while climate activists condemned it as a retreat from global leadership. The U.S. originally joined the UNFCCC in 1992 under President George H.W. Bush, with the Senate ratifying the non-binding treaty. Subsequent agreementsâthe 1997 Kyoto Protocol and 2015 Paris Accordâdeepened emissions reduction commitments but faced bipartisan resistance in Congress. Trump first signaled skepticism toward climate diplomacy in 2017 by announcing plans to leave the Paris Agreement, a process finalized in 2020. His latest order goes further, severing ties entirely with the UNFCCC and halting U.S. funding to affiliated programs, including the Green Climate Fund. The Department of the Treasury confirmed on Jan. 8 that it would cease payments, which previously accounted for 22% of the UNFCCC's budget. China and billionaire Michael Bloomberg's philanthropy have since increased their contributions to offset the loss. BrightU.AI's Enoch notes thatÂ UNFCCC is a globalist tool disguised as environmental policy, pushing fraudulent CO2 alarmism to justify centralized control, carbon taxation, energy restrictions and depopulation agendas under the guise of "climate action." Corporate alliances unravel under scrutiny Trump's order mirrors a broader corporate retreat from climate-focused coalitions. Once-dominant alliances like the Net-Zero Banking Alliance and Net Zero Asset Managersâbacked by financial giants BlackRock, Vanguard and State Streetâhave hemorrhaged members following antitrust investigations and political pressure. Conservative states led the charge, accusing these groups of violating fiduciary duties by pressuring companies to divest from fossil fuels. Vanguard exited in 2022, BlackRock followed in January 2025 and the Net Zero Insurance Alliance lost half its members in 2023. "These alliances operated as a cartel, manipulating markets under the guise of sustainability," said H. Sterling Burnett of The Heartland Institute. Supporters hailed Trump's move as a long-overdue assertion of national interests. Myron Ebell, a former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) transition adviser, called the UNFCCC a "climate racket" that "enriched bureaucrats while impoverishing the working class." Critics, however, warned of dire consequences. Yamide Dagnet of the Natural Resources Defense Council argued the U.S. would "cede technological leadership" and miss economic opportunities in renewable energy. House Democrats echoed concerns, stating the withdrawal "leaves America weaker and more isolated." Yet Trump's allies counter that the UNFCCC's focus on fossil fuel restrictions ignores their role in lifting billions out of poverty. "Energy affordability is a human right," Burnett added. Trump's withdrawal from the UNFCCC marks a defining moment in his administration's push for energy dominance and deregulation. While it aligns with a growing corporate exodus from ESG commitments, the long-term implications for U.S. influenceâand global climate effortsâremain hotly debated.

Bush, with the Senate ratifying the non-binding treaty. Subsequent agreementsâthe 1997 Kyoto Protocol and 2015 Paris Accordâdeepened emissions reduction commitments but faced bipartisan resistance in Congress. Trump first signaled skepticism toward climate diplomacy in 2017 by announcing plans to leave the Paris Agreement, a process finalized in 2020. His latest order goes further, severing ties entirely with the UNFCCC and halting U.S. funding to affiliated programs, including the Green Climate Fund. The Department of the Treasury confirmed on Jan. 8 that it would cease payments, which previously accounted for 22% of the UNFCCC's budget. China and billionaire Michael Bloomberg's philanthropy have since increased their contributions to offset the loss. BrightU.AI's Enoch notes thatÂ UNFCCC is a globalist tool disguised as environmental policy, pushing fraudulent CO2 alarmism to justify centralized control, carbon taxation, energy restrictions and depopulation agendas under the guise of "climate action." Corporate alliances unravel under scrutiny Trump's order mirrors a broader corporate retreat from climate-focused coalitions. Once-dominant alliances like the Net-Zero Banking Alliance and Net Zero Asset Managersâbacked by financial giants BlackRock, Vanguard and State Streetâhave hemorrhaged members following antitrust investigations and political pressure. Conservative states led the charge, accusing these groups of violating fiduciary duties by pressuring companies to divest from fossil fuels. Vanguard exited in 2022, BlackRock followed in January 2025 and the Net Zero Insurance Alliance lost half its members in 2023. "These alliances operated as a cartel, manipulating markets under the guise of sustainability," said H. Sterling Burnett of The Heartland Institute. Supporters hailed Trump's move as a long-overdue assertion of national interests. Myron Ebell, a former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) transition adviser, called the UNFCCC a "climate racket" that "enriched bureaucrats while impoverishing the working class." Critics, however, warned of dire consequences.

Title: SP Group unit likely to face higher costs in new fundraising

Goswami Infratech, the SP Group’s real estate and civil engineering company, is planning to raise as much as ₹25,000 crore through a two-year zero-coupon bond issue in the coming weeks. In early discussions, investors demanded returns similar to those offered to investors in Porteast Investment, which sold three-year bonds ​at a 19.75 per cent interest rate in May, raising ₹28,600 crore in India’s largest corporate bond sale ever. However, the interest rate climbed to 21.75 per cent in December after it failed to meet a covenant linked ​to a stake sale ⁠in another company, the sources said. “Now that the yield on Porteast Investment’s debt has risen, investors are expecting a similar level for Goswami Infratech,” one of the sources said. The sources ‌requested anonymity, as they are not authorised to speak to ‌the media. In a response to Reuters queries over the weekend, SP Group said, “Goswami Infratech is pursuing ‍a fund raise at 21.75 per cent is grossly incorrect and totally misleading. The company will refinance the bonds well ahead of its due ‍dates.” It added that based on feedback and in-principle interest from investors, the transaction will be at substantially tighter pricing, reflecting an improved credit profile. While confirming the rise in yield for the other unit, the statement said, “This temporary increase in Porteast financing will also step down to its original yield”. Goswami Infratech is now evaluating its options, which could also mean the deal will take longer ⁠to close, the source said. Bankers had been expecting the deal to close in January, with the company meeting ​investors such as Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO), BlackRock and Vanguard along with ⁠others, Reuters reported last month. “It seems the issuance may be pushed to March,” the second source said. Goswani Infratech plans to raise funds to refinance its outstanding high-yield notes maturing in April and another loan, as well as for ⁠other debt-related and corporate purposes.

In a bold move, Goswami Infratech, under the umbrella of Shapoorji Pallonji Group, is set to pursue an ambitious 250 billion rupee raise.

Title: Prudential Financial is said to mull India asset manager sale

(Bloomberg) — Prudential Financial Inc.’s investment management arm is considering selling its loss-making asset management unit in India a decade after acquiring the business from Deutsche Bank AG, according to people familiar with the matter. PGIM Inc., the investment management business of US-based Prudential Financial, has tapped EY to advise on the potential sale of its asset management subsidiary in India, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. The sale of PGIM India Asset Management Pvt Ltd. is taking place after its parent weighed up the growth of the unit, which manages assets of around 266 billion rupees ($3 billion). The unit has seen little meaningful expansion in recent years, the people said. PGIM and EY declined to comment. The asset manager’s business strategy in the country has differed from its peers such as BlackRock Inc. which is investing aggressively in India to tap the rising equity culture. Last year, WestBridge Capital bought a 15% stake in Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd., which is expanding its national presence. PGIM, a global investment firm with around $1.5 trillion in assets under management, bought Deutsche Bank’s India asset management business in 2015. PGIM has assets across fixed income, equity, alternatives and real estate. PGIM’s after-tax losses in India rose to more than 235 million rupees in the year ended March 2025, according to its annual report. The firm appointed a new chief executive officer in July 2025, according to a local media report. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2026 Bloomberg L.P.

Tata Consultancy ​Services posted a bigger-than-expected third-quarter revenue on ​Monday as artificial ⁠intelligence-led demand ramped up. Rupee recovers to 90.16 against the dollar, boosted by improved trade deal prospects and easing crude oil prices. Board declared a third interim dividend of Rs 11 and a special dividend of Rs 46 per Equity Share of Rs 1 each of the Company. Click here for latest Q3 results ASK Property Fund, the real estate arm of the Blackstone- backed ASK Asset & Wealth Management Group, has announced a significant investment of INR 340 crore in a portfolio comprising three residential projects spearheaded by Mantra Group. This investment aims to facilitate Mantra Group in acquiring two projects through the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) route, as well as supporting an additional ongoing residential project. Part of the allocated funds will be directed towards settling outstanding dues owed to financial creditors, with the balance utilised to address the projects’ working capital requirements. This strategic move underscores ASK Property Fund’s ongoing commitment to investing in high-quality residential developments situated within high-potential urban centres. The projects are located in well-established micro markets: one close to JVLR, Mumbai, and two in Pune’s Wakad and Mundhwa (on-going). The JVLR project will benefit from seamless connectivity to major business and employment hubs across the Western and Eastern Express Highways. Similarly, the projects in Wakad and Mundhwa are strategically located in proximity to Pune’s IT hubs in the West and East, respectively. Another distinguishing feature of these projects lies in their expansive layouts - (9 acres in Jogeshwari, 5 acres in Wakad, and 8 acres in Mundhwa)—and a range of attractive configurations tailored to the preferences of end users. Amit Bhagat, Co-founder, CEO & MD, ASK Property Fund, stated: “We remain committed to providing growth capital for land acquisition of residential projects linked to approvals and requiring financial closure of up to INR 500 crore.” Jio BlackRock Investment Advisers Private Limited (“JioBlackRock Investment Advisers”), a 50:50 joint venture between Jio Financial Services Limited (“JFSL”) [BSE, NSE: JIOFIN] and BlackRock Inc. [NYSE: BLK], is pleased to announce the launch of its official website www.jioblackrock.com, the commencement of an exclusive early access campaign, and the introduction of its executive leadership team led by Marc Pilgrem, who was appointed as the CEO in June 2025. The website provides educational resources and enables users to register for early access to product updates and launch information. This development takes JioBlackRock a step closer to the full commercial launch of its advisory business, following the successful introduction of its asset management company earlier this year which to date has launched 10 investment products, each of which attracted significant investor interest. Building on this foundation, JioBlackRock’s advisory service aims to open up access to high-quality investment solutions with affordable, and personalised investment advice to individuals across India. JioBlackRock leverages BlackRock’s global investment expertise and BlackRock’s proprietary technology Aladdin® with JFSL’s digital reach, to offer institutional-quality investment solutions for the people of India delivered through simple digital tools. JioBlackRock Investment Advisers has also established a presence on LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and X , and is initiating an awareness campaign to address longstanding barriers to investment advice, thereby empowering investors to build wealth with confidence. Designed for deployment by defence and security forces, AeroDrop supports precision tactical payload delivery and mission-critical operations in complex and high-risk environments. The launch represents a significant evolution of Jyoti Global Plast’s UAV portfolio, extending beyond civilian and industrial applications into purpose-built military platforms. This move aligns with the growing reliance of modern defence forces on unmanned systems to enhance operational reach, reduce personnel exposure, and improve battlefield effectiveness. The introduction of AeroDrop forms part of a broader strategic initiative that is currently progressing through the company’s standard shareholder approval process. AeroDrop has been developed as a tactical payload delivery UAV, capable of deploying mission-specific defence payloads with high accuracy and control. The platform supports a maximum take-off weight of 25 kg and a payload capacity of up to 7 kg, with dedicated hardpoints for 5–7 payloads and an automatic payload release mechanism to enable precise deployment during operational missions. The fund will invest in high-quality money market instruments with maturity of up to one year, aiming to provide regular income while maintaining high liquidity and a controlled risk profile, in line with regulatory norms. Key highlights of the fund: NFO will open on January 19, 2026, and close on January 21, 2026 Open-ended debt scheme investing in money market instruments with residual maturity up to 1 year Relatively low-interest rate risk and moderate credit risk Aims to provide regular income with easy liquidity Scheme benchmarked against NIFTY Money Market Index A-I TRI We feel that the Union Budget 2026-27 will be catalytic for Indian Economic Development or Viksit Bharat. It will ensure public funds are used to support welfare programs, development initiatives, long term economic stability and GDP growth rate. By prioritising sectors like healthcare, education, infrastructure and poverty reduction, the Government will ensure that money reaches the areas where the people who need it most. After the basic necessities, the Budget will place Trade Policy at the heart of Economic Development to restrict widening trade deficit and diversifying export destinations. These apart, ‘PLI Linked -FDI in India’ would also get expanded and deepened, so that we attract more Investments in this VUCA world. Finally, given the falling interest rates, promotion of a tax linked savings scheme under the New Income Tax Rules may be adapted to boost domestic savings.” “From a Budget expectation standpoint, continued emphasis on digital payments, cybersecurity, and financial infrastructure would go a long way in strengthening trust across the ecosystem. These are foundational areas that directly impact how confidently consumers and businesses adopt digital credit. We would also expect a sustained push toward technology investments, particularly in secure payment platforms, cybersecurity, virtual and tokenised cards, and UPI-first credit products. These are critical enablers as consumer behaviour shifts toward real-time, digital-first transactions. Equally, policy support for alternative credit assessment models can meaningfully expand access to formal credit. Enabling the use of transaction and cash-flow data will help bring more first-time and underserved consumers into the system, while ensuring credit growth remains responsible and sustainable” BSE on Monday cautioned investors to remain vigilant against deepfake video of its CEO giving stock recommendations and investment advice on social media platforms. Food delivery platforms have continued to scale up their delivery workforce over the past two years, but the pace of expansion is beginning to diverge from growth in employee-related spending. “The last year has shown meaningful intent from both the Centre and the states to strengthen India’s startup engine. The ₹1 lakh crore RDI Fund has been a much-needed catalyst, finally bridging the gap between research and commercialisation and giving deeptech and science-led startups the confidence to build for scale. Delhi’s draft Startup Policy, anchored by a ₹200 crore VC fund, signals a strong commitment to early-stage founders, while Karnataka’s Startup Policy 2025–2030 brings a clear focus on deeptech, regional inclusion and expanding innovation beyond major hubs. The recent GST cuts are equally important, especially for consumer-facing ventures, as they improve purchasing power in semi-urban and rural markets and support India’s value-driven economy. These developments reflect a maturing policy environment that recognises what founders truly need which are stability, market access and the freedom to build responsibly. As we look toward the upcoming Budget, the expectation is for deeper support through simpler compliance, clearer tax frameworks, enabling dual listings and creating stronger incentives for domestic capital to participate at the earliest stages. These steps can help convert today’s policy intent into durable, long-term outcomes. India has laid a strong foundation. With continued, thoughtful reforms, we have the opportunity to become one of the most resilient and inclusive startup ecosystems globally.” Sensex settled 301.93 pts or 0.36% higher at 83,878.17 after hitting an intraday low of 82,861.07. Nifty 50 increased by 106.95 pts or 0.42% to 25,790.25 Public Issue of secured, rated, listed, taxable, redeemable, non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of face value of Rs. 1,000 each (except in case of zero coupon NCD, face value shall be ₹ 1,00,000 each) The Tranche I Issue of NCDs is for a Base Issue Size of Rs. 500 crore with a green shoe option of up to Rs. 4,500 crore aggregating up to Rs. 5,000 crore, which is within the shelf limit of Rs. 10,000 crore NCDs are rated “CARE AAA; Stable” by CARE Ratings Limited, “Crisil AAA/Stable” by Crisil Ratings Limited and [ICRA] AAA (Stable) by ICRA Limited Coupon Rate up to 7.30% p.a (for NCD Holders in Category IV with a tenor of 15 years, payable annually)1 Tranche I NCD Issue opens on Friday, January 16, 2026 and closes on Friday, January 30, 2026 with an option of early closure or extension2 The NCDs are proposed to be listed on National Stock Exchange of India Limited (“NSE”) (“Stock Exchange”).

This launch marks the first in a series of fund offerings that Barjeel Geojit plans to introduce, spanning local and global markets. BGIOF is a UAE-regulated umbrella fund with sub-funds having separate legal personality and independent financial capacity. BGIOF enables investors, NRIs as well as foreign nationals, to participate in India’s growth trajectory by offering access to its diversified basket of sub-funds across sectors and market segments. The NFO is open for subscription from 14th January to 13th February 2026. It is a USD-denominated fund with a minimum investment of USD 5,000. Barjeel Geojit’s entry into the investment management business marks a significant milestone in its growth journey, building on over 25 years of legacy in the UAE and aligning with the Emirates’ vision to be a global hub for fund management. “As the luxury housing segment moves into a more mature phase in 2026, the upcoming Union Budget has an opportunity to reinforce growth through targeted, market-aligned reforms. The industry looks forward to rationalisation of transaction costs, clearer GST benefit transmission, and incentives that support high-quality, sustainable development. While continued focus on affordable housing and urban infrastructure is essential for overall sector momentum, calibrated measures that recognise the luxury segment’s ability to attract long-term domestic and global capital will further strengthen India’s positioning as a credible, global luxury real estate market.” BetterInvest, the only structured private credit provider for the media & entertainment industry in India, has announced the launch of its SEBI-registered Category II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), BetterInvest Media Vision Fund - 1. The fund is designed as a private credit, income-generating vehicle with a five-year tenure, targeting a corpus of ₹300 crore, and a green shoe option of an additional ₹300 crore. The BetterInvest Media Vision Fund-1’s core investment strategy focuses on the media and entertainment sector, with a sharp emphasis on movie and content production financing. Unlike conventional debt funds, this AIF adopts a strategy of a debt-plus-profit-sharing structure, enabling investors to participate not only in interest income but also in the upside potential profits from successful content projects. Deal tenures are typically shorter and structured for faster capital churn and active portfolio management. Mr. Sedhumanikandan, Co-founder, BetterInvest, said, “India’s media and entertainment industry has reached a stage where content financing requires institutional-grade capital, faster deal execution, and smarter risk structures. With the launch of our SEBI-registered Category II AIF, we are formalising what has largely been an unorganised financing segment.” “Our expectations from the Budget are limited. In recent years, it has tended to excite markets but rarely deliver major changes, as taxation and strategic decisions increasingly occur outside the Budget. Most sector-specific taxation tweaks -- such as those related to life insurance -- have already been addressed, while changes to mutual fund taxation appear unlikely, as past hikes hurt sentiment without meaningfully boosting revenues. We believe defence capex is likely to see an increase, given the current geopolitical environment. We hope the government avoids aggressive fiscal tightening. With weak demand, subdued private capex and stagnant household incomes, government spending remains critical. That said, divestment targets could be raised to compensate for lower tax collections. The last Budget marked a pivot towards consumption and revenue expenditure; this one should avoid any further tightening.” Bandhan Mutual Fund has announced the launch of the Bandhan Gold ETF FoF and Bandhan Silver ETF FoF, two open-ended schemes designed to provide investors with an easy, transparent, and cost-efficient way to participate in gold and silver. The New Fund Offers (NFOs) open on Monday, 12 January 2026, and close on Tuesday, 20 January 2026. Vishal Kapoor, CEO, Bandhan AMC, commenting on the launch, said, “Gold and silver can play a meaningful role in portfolio diversification, but the way investors access these assets matters. Physical metal often brings uncertainties around purity, making charges, storage, and resale, while ETFs require demat accounts that many investors still do not use. The Fund of Fund (FoF) structure removes barriers such as demat requirements, lowers the entry point to ₹1,000, and enables disciplined investing through SIPs starting at ₹100. Bandhan Gold ETF FoF and Bandhan Silver ETF FoF combines the assurance and transparency of ETFs with the simplicity of mutual fund investing. Investors can now participate in the resilience of gold and the structural industrial demand for silver through a liquid, transparent format.

Scale, Certainty and Execution matter more than Incremental Incentives. AI is no longer a pilot initiative; it is now a revenue engine. We sincerely expect the Union Budget 2026 to accelerate Enterprise-scale AI adoption and reward IP creation, not just headcount. As we know, Indian IT companies compete globally every day. We expect Policy support from the Honourable Prime Minister & the Finance Minister in this Budget that protects margins and improves ease of doing business for the Indian Digital & IT Companies, thus directly strengthening India’s global market share. Another very important expectation from the Budget is about the Digital & IT Talent Pool in the Country. Digital & IT Talent is a national infrastructure. Large-scale, outcome-driven skilling is essential for India to remain the world’s preferred technology partner. The Government must come up with a policy and clear incentives in this regard in the Union Budget. This is our time and opportunity to become the World’s Most Trusted Digital Innovation Hub, Combining Scale, Security and Sovereign Digital Infrastructure. The Budget must provide Policy Support, Incentives and Required Impetus to achieve this objective and also pave the way for us to become a Developed Economy Very Soon!!” If India wants to build lasting leadership in neuroscience and healthcare innovation, it has to create an environment where serious research is given both the right time and support to succeed. Neurotechnology and biomedical innovation require long term research. This work spans neuroscience, engineering, AI and clinical medicine. Such science does not succeed with short funding cycles or disconnected policy support. Specific grant programs and targeted tax breaks for deep tech research and development, especially in areas like brain computer interfaces, neural sensing, and rehabilitation, would give researchers the time and assurance they need. This support enables them to pursue projects that might not fit into short term timelines but hold long term clinical value. Strengthening translational research is equally important here. So much promising science stalls between the lab and the clinic. Budgetary support for shared research infrastructure, hospital-startup partnerships, and faster regulatory pathways can help convert discoveries into deployable healthcare solutions. Lastly, we must invest in people by supporting interdisciplinary training programs. These programs allow scientists, clinicians, and engineers to learn and collaborate early in their careers. With the right policy support, India has the chance to not only join global brain tech innovation but to also influence it in ways that are affordable, scalable and focused on genuine patient needs. ~ Aurionpro secures AFC order for Bhopal & Indore Metro valued at ~Rs 1.5 bn over 5 years, strengthening its smart mobility footprint in Indian metro rail ~ Total order book now stands at ~Rs 17 bn; out of this, ~Rs 1.0 bn added to the order book, while ~Rs 0.5 bn is AMC revenue over 5 years ~Order win aided by DMRC partnership, leveraging Aurionpro’s proven AFC execution and operations experience in Delhi Metro ~Deployment of NCMC-compliant EMV & QR-based AFC systems, reinforcing Aurionpro’s position in end-to-end, India-made smart fare collection solutions Link to latest report: https://bit.ly/3JjvvoF Monarch Networth Capital board has approved investment in the equity shares of Monarch Networth Asset Management Private Limited, the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, up to an amount not exceeding Rs. 59 crores by way of subscription to rights issue.

Tax incentives and a simpler CSR route for industry–academia partnerships could free up about ₹5,000 crore a year for structured apprenticeships, greatly improving employability for rural and first-generation learners. Making employer-sponsored health coverage mandatory for contractual and gig educators, and speeding up claim processing, would also boost the resilience of the academic workforce. These measures will close the rural–urban skills gap, align learning with future job needs, and position India as a global leader in inclusive, job-ready education. Renisha Chainani, head of research at Augmont, writes - Gold and silver surged to fresh record highs, with gold crossing $4,600 (₹1,40,000) and silver moving past $83 (₹2,60,000). The rally was driven by a mix of rising geopolitical tensions and growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates further. Last week itself, gold ended up nearly 4%, while silver jumped a sharp 12%, as markets reacted to weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data and an increasingly uncertain global backdrop. Geopolitical tensions back in focus Geopolitical risks have once again taken centre stage. Tensions remain high amid escalating unrest in Iran, the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war, the U.S. capture of Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, and renewed signals from US about taking control of Greenland. Investors are closely watching the protests in Iran, now in their third week, with reports suggesting more than 500 deaths so far. President Donald Trump has warned Iran’s leadership against using force on protesters and hinted at possible U.S. action if the crackdown continues. Iranian officials, in turn, have warned against any U.S. or Israeli intervention and threatened retaliation, including targeting U.S. military bases in the region. All of this comes at a time when Trump is projecting U.S. power more aggressively on the global stage—ousting Venezuela’s president and openly discussing the possibility of acquiring Greenland, either through purchase or force. Growing pressure on the Fed to cut rates U.S. economic data is adding to the case for easier monetary policy. December nonfarm payrolls rose by just 50,000, falling short of expectations, while the unemployment rate edged down to 4.4%. The numbers point to a weakening job market, which, combined with geopolitical risks, firmer oil prices, and rising uncertainty, creates a supportive environment for precious metals. Markets continue to price in two rate cuts this year, even though the Fed is expected to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting. Adding to the drama, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that the Trump administration had threatened him with a criminal probe over his Congressional testimony—moves Powell described as an attempt to pressure the central bank into lowering rates. The comments pushed the dollar and U.S. equity futures lower, while gold and silver gained further. Supreme Court ruling on Trump tariffs in focus Another major risk event is brewing. There is growing speculation that the U.S. Supreme Court may deliver a ruling on January 14 on the legality of tariffs imposed under emergency powers. If the court upholds Trump’s authority to impose tariffs without Congressional approval, tariff threats could return quickly—this time aimed not just at China, but Europe as well, potentially linked to U.S. ambitions around Greenland. If the ruling goes the other way and declares such tariffs illegal, markets could see sharp volatility. That said, the administration reportedly already has alternative legal routes lined up to reimpose tariffs. In either case, precious metals are well positioned. Trade tensions typically weigh on the dollar and push investors toward safe-haven assets like gold and silver, while supporting currencies such as the euro and Swiss franc. An even more intriguing outcome would be if the court places clear limits on presidential powers—something that could make Trump’s policy responses even more unpredictable going forward. What to watch this week This week’s economic calendar is packed, with the spotlight on U.S. inflation and consumer data. Tuesday’s December CPI report will be especially important, as it may be the first inflation print unaffected by the government shutdown. That said, geopolitics could easily steal the spotlight. Any Supreme Court decision on tariffs—or fresh developments on the geopolitical front—could end up driving markets more than economic data. The gold boom began in mid-August around $3400 and reached $4400 by mid-October. The prices then retraced and have been taking support from the uptrendline since. Gold has crossed its previous high resistance of $4570. The next level to watch for is of $4745-50 (78.6% fibbonnicci extension) and $4966-70 (100% fibbonnicci extension). The Silver rally started from $45 in October, and extended up $82.7 in December 2025. Fibonacci extension suggests that this rally can extend further towards $84, $88, $93 and $99 in the coming few months of 2026 with strong support at $70.

Budget expectation: Gurvinder Gandhi, CFO, Mitsubishi Electric India “India’s manufacturing journey is moving from automation adoption to automation depth. With investments in industrial automation estimated to grow from USD 19.71 billion in 2026 and the market projected to enlarge at a notably high pace in the forthcoming decade, the upcoming Union Budget can accelerate this by enabling the domestic manufacturing of advanced factory automation tools, including PLCs, industrial robots, cobots, and servo systems. The incentives in these segments can assist the Indian industry to go beyond fragmented automation to interconnected, data-based, and intelligent factory ecosystems that are consistent with global standards. The reinforcement of high value engineering and innovation are also critical in India. Since Global Capability Centres are carrying out more core R&D, system design and advanced engineering, incentive policy assistance can support the anchoring of this industry in India, enhance involvement in global value chains and establish long-term technical capabilities. From a sustainability standpoint, there should be focus on technologies that address air quality and energy efficiency across industries. The incentivisation of more advanced and energy-efficient technologies in air purification can provide quantifiable benefits in terms of cutting down the losses associated with pollution, enhancing the urban living conditions and supporting the overall climate commitments of India.” Alembic Pharmaceuticals receives USFDA Tentative Approval for BosutinibTablets, 400 mg Shares dip nearly 1% to Rs 792.15 on the NSE.

While schemes such as PLI and PRIP have laid a strong foundation, the next phase must focus on scale, execution, and global cost competitiveness. Rationalisation of import tariffs on critical raw materials, coupled with targeted incentives for value-added formulations and APIs, will be crucial to offset rising input and compliance costs. We also see a strong case for enhanced tax incentives for R&D, faster depreciation benefits for quality and compliance investments, and easier access to export credit for pharma manufacturers. A Budget that strengthens PLI outcomes, supports green and compliant manufacturing, and aligns trade policy with India’s healthcare diplomacy will help the sector move decisively towards its $120–130 billion ambition by 2030 and reinforce India’s position as the Pharmacy of the World.” - Mr. Bhavin Mehta, Whole Time Director Kilitch Drugs and Vice Chairperson, Pharmexcil. “As the Union Budget 2026 approaches, the industry would welcome continued support to strengthen India’s manufacturing ecosystem through policy stability, infrastructure development, and a level playing field for domestic producers. For the metals and stainless steel sector, factors such as rising steel input costs, raw material volatility, global trade disruptions, and dumping pressures continue to pose challenges. The forthcoming Budget may consider measures such as trade safeguards where appropriate, rationalisation of duties on critical steel inputs, and incentives that encourage capacity expansion and value-added manufacturing. Improved access to long term financing for technology upgrades, compliance requirements, and scale efficiencies could further support sectoral growth.”- — Chandragupt Prakash Mangal, Managing Director, Mangalam Worldwide Limited Once the bulls get some hold and start pushing the price up, natural gas futures can rally to ₹350.

At 9.26 am on Monday, March Brent oil futures were at $63.46, up by 0.19 per cent, and March crude oil futures on WTI (West Texas Intermediate) were at $59.23, up by 0.49 per cent. January crude oil futures were trading at ₹5349 on Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) during the initial hour of trading on Monday against the previous close of ₹5352, down by 0.06 per cent, and February futures were trading at ₹5365 against the previous close of ₹5366, down by 0.02 per cent. Sensex fell by 240.66 pts or 0.29% to 83,335.58 at 9.19 am after opening at 83,435.31 against the previous close of 83,576.24. Nifty 50 dipped by 69.15 pts or 0.27% to 25,614.15. Ravi Singh, Chief Research Officer from Master Capital Services Ltd. The Indian equity markets witnessed intense selling pressure during the week ended January 09, as rising global uncertainties and domestic concerns weighed heavily on investor sentiment. The Nifty 50 declined sharply by around 2.5% or 645 points to close the week at 25,683.30, while the BSE Sensex fell nearly 2.55% or 2,185 points to settle at 83,576. The broader markets remained under even greater stress, with the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices slipping by about 2.64% and 3.08% respectively, reflecting a clear risk-off approach among participants. Sector-wise, the selling pressure was most pronounced in oil & gas, energy, and infrastructure stocks, which declined by nearly 5.76%, 5.14%, and 4.74% respectively. In contrast, select defensive pockets such as defence and consumer durables outperformed the broader market, ending the week with modest gains of around 1.35% and 1%. The recent market weakness can largely be attributed to four key factors. Firstly, global sentiment turned cautious after the U.S. President approved a bipartisan Russian sanctions bill, paving the way for heavy tariffs, up to 500%, on major buyers of Russian energy products. Secondly, lingering uncertainty surrounding the U.S.–India trade deal continued to dampen investor confidence, as markets remain watchful for concrete progress. Thirdly, expectations of mixed Q3 earnings, and sustained FIIs selloff. On the flows front, FIIs continued to remain net sellers, offloading equities worth Rs. 8,808 crore. Meanwhile, DIIs maintained strong support for the market, recording net inflows of Rs. 15,700 crore. Nifty ended the week on a weak note, declining 2.45 percent after touching a fresh all-time high of 26,373. The fall was largely driven by profit booking at higher levels. The index has now slipped below its 21-day and 55-day EMAs and also breached the rising trendline, reflecting a loss of short-term momentum. However, Nifty is currently placed near its 21-week EMA, which may offer temporary support. Overall chart structure and candlestick patterns indicate further weakness. Immediate support lies at 25500 and a break below could drag the index toward 25300. On the upside, resistance is placed at 25900, with sustained strength above this level opening room toward 26100. Sell on rise remains the preferred strategy. Nifty Bank declined around 1.5 percent over the week, closing on a weak note and forming a bearish Marubozu candle on the weekly chart after touching its all-time high of 60,437. The index has breached the 21-day EMA, indicating short-term weakness and a shift in momentum. This breakdown suggests selling pressure is dominating at higher levels. 2.The next crucial support is placed in the 58,780–58,800 zone, and prices may drift toward this area in the coming week, supporting a sell-on-rise strategy. On the upside, 59,600 remains a key resistance; sustained trade above this level could trigger a recovery toward 61000.

Morgan India Cables & Wires: Shovel sellers in the ‘electrification’ rush; capacity shock key risk: Initiate coverage of KEI (OW), Polycab (OW) Cable and Wire (C&W) majors offer ‘picks and shovels’ exposure to the structural trends of electrification and energy transition, and we believe they are poised for near-term EPS upgrades, driven by the rise in copper prices (JPM FY27E EPS 8-12% above consensus). While we expect the upcoming entry of large conglomerates, starting with the ‘higher-margin and largely organized’ wires segment, to impact industry margins/ROCE, we see KEI and Polycab as better placed than peers, given their higher cable mix (65-70%) and EPS growth visibility (c.20-25% over the next 3 years). We initiate coverage of KEI (OW, 21% potential upside) and Polycab (OW, 16% potential upside). Polycab vs KEI: While we believe Polycab is likely to deliver higher growth in the near-term, structurally we slightly prefer KEI for its cleaner exposure to C&W, higher ‘export and EHV (Extra High Voltage) mix, and potential margin improvement as recently commissioned capacities ramp-up. For Polycab, we expect normalization of margin superiority vs peers (~450bps higher EBIT margin than top 5, despite having a higher share of cables) as competition increases and as Polycab enters a capex cycle to maintain capacity share in cables. However, with Polycab trading at ~10% discount to KEI, risk/reward seems similar. ▶️Net Profit Up 37.5% at ₹584.9 Cr vs ₹425.4 Cr (YoY) ▶️NII Up 34.8% at ₹897.5 Cr vs ₹665.8 Cr (YoY) Changes in settlement schedule due to settlement holiday on January 15, 2026 on account of Municipal Corporation Elections in Maharashtra Trade dt.14.01.2026 and 15.01.2026 Pay in and Pay out on 16.01.2026 Two Settlement on 16.01.2026 SHARES BOUGHT ON 14.01.26 DO NOT SELL ON 15.01.26 ( NO BTST) Turnover : (NSE + BSE) Cash Volume : 106746.84 + 7953.66 Total: 114700.5 F&O Volume : 193718.32 + 5162718.11 Total: 5356436.43 Provisional Cash: Only NSE FII/FPI: NET SELL: -3609 (10851.68 - 14460.68) DII: NET BUY: +5341.01 (17108.33 - 11767.32) So long as the barrier at ₹170 holds, the sentiment will be bearish.

Clontarf extended their lead atop Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League to five points with a hard-earned and significant 24-20 win away to Ballynahinch. It was the kind of sleeves-rolled-up, midwinter victory that is the trademark of the reigning champions. Clontarf thus completed the double over Ballynahinch, backing up their first Bateman Cup triumph against the same opponents last month. On a day when the Ballymena-Dungannon derby an hour up the road was postponed due to a frozen pitch, frost meant doubt about the fixture at Ballymacarn Park persisted until 11am, when the pitch was declared playable. Clontarf led 12-6 at half-time through tries by Alex O’Grady and Fionn Gilbert, before Ballynahinch were on the verge of a first win over Clontarf since 2020 thanks to a try by Ryan Connolly and a penalty try, as well as eight points from the boot of Conor Rankin. Despite being down to 13 men, Clontarf turned down a kick at goal and were rewarded with a fourth try by Leinster academy lock Alan Spicer, capping a stormer. Conor Kelly converted. St Mary’s had assumed leadership overnight after gaining revenge for their 14-0 loss to Lansdowne four weeks ago with an equally hard-fought 13-7 win on the Aviva back pitch on Friday night. Returning again to his former club, Mark McHugh’s gritty side restricted Lansdowne to just a penalty try in the first-half. Mick McCormack’s close-range finish rewarded concerted pressure and Mick O’Gara’s second penalty helped keep the home side at arm’s length despite Lansdowne’s late rally. In the absence of JJ Kenny, on Leinster try-scoring duty against La Rochelle, Terenure turned to another ex-Irish Sevens winger in Ed Kelly. He duly scored the first try as Terenure gained a 27-19 revenge win over Old Belvedere in an entertaining game that was moved to the Lakelands Park astro pitch. After Will Hickey added another for a 17-0 interval lead, Old Belvedere stayed in touch through two tries by full-back Morgan Meredith either side of Chris Cosgrave becoming a third former St Michael’s pupil to score for Terenure. Before a consolation try for Belvo in the last play, Harrison Brewer powered over off a lineout to complete a bonus-point win that elevated ‘Nure to third in the table on 32 points, five points behind neighbours St Mary’s. Cork Con also moved one point above Lansdowne and into the top four on 32 points by completing a double at home to UCD with a 26-7 bonus-point win; Michael Foy, Sean Condon, Danny Sheahan and Peter Hyland scored their tries. Four weeks after losing 57-10 in Tom Clifford Park, Nenagh Ormond were vastly more competitive at home to Young Munster. Although they lost 43-31, Nenagh finally picked up their first point in the top flight thanks to two tries by number eight Willie Coffey and one each by half-backs Luke Kerr and Charlie O’Doherty, who also kicked 11 points. But Young Munster are now accumulating the wins that their expansive rugby has deserved and they picked up their seventh attacking bonus point through tries by Oran O’Reilly, Luke McCready, Ajae Hanson, Stephen McLoughlin, Oisin Pepper and Jake O’Riordan.

Daragh Cronin said he wanted the children of Munster to be able to receive ‘best-in-class paediatric care’ (Brian Lougheed/Mediaconsult) A young man riding a bike from Ireland to Mount Everest has said he is doing it to “give back” to the Cork community which has supported him in the past. Daragh Cronin is hoping his mammoth journey will raise €30,000 for children’s wards at Cork University Hospital (CUH). Mr Cronin said the charity was close to his heart and that he wanted the children of Munster to be able to receive “best-in-class paediatric care”. He also wanted to inspire children of the region to “chase their dreams”. Daragh Cronin outside Cork University Hospital (Brian Lougheed/PA) Mr Cronin’s journey will begin at Blackrock hurling club on February 14 and take him on a ferry from Rosslare to France, then trekking out over Europe and the Middle East before heading to Everest base camp. The 23-year-old Cork man is no stranger to long-distance bike journeys, having navigated the length of Africa by riding almost 13,500km between Morocco and South Africa “with zero prior cycling or camping experience”. He said that experience had inspired him to raise money for the hospital, through the CUH Charity. He said he had been told his Africa trip would be “impossible” without experience. “I had guns pointed in my face. But 99pc of the time, there was genuine hospitality and huge amounts of kindness,” he said. Daragh Cronin is from Blackrock in Cork (Brian Lougheed/Mediaconsult) “I know these things are coming my way again but I trust my instinct, I was able to talk my way out of some hairy situations in Africa.” Now, with his trip to Everest, he said: “This time I want to do it for a cause. “I had crazy support when I went to Africa, half of Cork had my back, so I want to do something to give back this time.” The route will see him cross the tip of Oman, through Pakistan, India and Nepal before he reaches Mount Everest. “The record I’m trying to set is to hike the bike from a place called Lukla (in Koshi Province) to Everest base camp, and no Irish person has done that,” he said. “I will cycle as far as I can through Nepal, on to Lukla, and then put the bike over my neck and get to base camp.” – Mr Cronin’s charity fundraiser is available at here.

Title: Binance’s CZ Claims US Banks Are “Loading Up” on Bitcoin While Retail Panics—But Is It Really a Buying Spree?

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has tweeted that major US banks are “loading up” on Bitcoin while the rest of the market has engaged in panic selling. Zhao, fresh from his pardon from US President Trump, has become a much more vocal proponent of the cryptocurrency revolution and is visiting countries around the world to promote it. CZ tweeted: CZ’s tweet is highlighting the latest trend of major American banks buying up Bitcoin in large amounts, even as retail investors continue to be on the defensive. Notable names like BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Barclays, and Standard Chartered have reportedly invested directly. Other financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo have engaged indirectly through Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Adding to Wells Fargo’s $383 million purchase of BTC, Morgan Stanley has invested $270 million in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), while JPMorgan Chase holds millions of dollars in multiple Bitcoin ETFs. Goldman Sachs reportedly has a sizeable $1.3 billion stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF and $300 million in Fidelity’s ETF. While CZ is doing his best to amplify the recent Wells Fargo purchase, it is not yet true that the US banks are going on a Bitcoin buying spree. The premier digital currency has had a bearish 2025 overall, while other commodities like Gold, Silver, etc., have had a much better showing, outperforming it by a considerable margin. The total investment by US banks in BTC is in the range of several billion dollars, and while that sum may seem huge, it is peanuts compared to their total worth, which is in the tens of trillions of dollars. BlackRock alone is worth in excess of $10 trillion, and its BTC exposure is a minuscule fraction of that valuation. However, the idea that these top banking institutions will be interested in loading up their coffers with BTC in the near future is a likely possibility, as several top executives have voiced their support for it. If these major institutions start holding crypto as a reserve asset, other companies are expected to follow suit, which will likely set off a snowball effect that sharply drives up the crypto market. In addition to major financial players, governments around the world are also looking to buy Bitcoin for their strategic crypto reserves. Several US states, such as Texas and New Hampshire, have already bought BTC for their state coffers, and the US federal government is also moving toward this move.

Title: The billionaire's social calendar for 2026: The must-attend events for the world's wealthiest business icons

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Like wildebeest migrating across the plains of East Africa or monarch butterflies flying thousands of miles south every winter, billionaires are a remarkably predictable breed. The world's nearly 3,000 billionaires follow a familiar annual circuit: cruising between vacation spots on superyachts, jetting to marquee sporting events, and suiting up for the same closed-door business conferences. "Birds of a feather flock together," Doug Gollan, the founder of Private Jet Card Comparison, told Business Insider. Each year, private jets congregate at events like The Masters or Super Bowl, he said. 2026 is no different. There will be the Davos and Sun Valley conferences, the FIFA World Cup, and the Monaco yacht show. In between, some billionaires may attend Art Basel or the Oscars. Here's a look at the 2026 billionaire calendar — and how much it would cost to join them. Business leaders and politicians gather at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, to kick off their year with policy discussions, networking, and, if time allows, some ski runs. This year's summit, which runs from January 19 to 23, is themed "A Spirit of Dialogue." While speakers have not been announced, regular attendees include BlackRock CEO Larry Fink (a cochair of the WEF), Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. Access to the invite-only event can cost tens of thousands of dollars, and most of Davos' luxury hotels, such as the Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère and AlpenGold, are closed to the public. Apartment rental rates typically jump during the event, with nearby units commanding at least four figures a night. The surge pricing also applies to food. With most of the restaurants booked up for conference events, you may be left paying $43 for a hot dog. NFL teams are popular toys of the ultrarich: Walmart's Rob Walton has the Broncos, hedge fund manager David Tepper owns the Panthers, Clark Hunt and his siblings control the Chiefs, and so on. These billionaire owners — as well as billionaire fans and friends — flock to the Super Bowl, and this year's game on February 8 in Santa Clara, California, will be no exception. "The Super Bowl is always a draw. It's an excuse to see the best of the best in terms of sports, parties, and entertainment," Elisabeth Brown, client manager at travel and lifestyle concierge company Knightsbridge Circle, told Business Insider. Host committees and travel agencies curate luxury experiences for the wealthiest football fans, which can cost six figures and include chartered jets, five-star accommodations, and access to the field after the game. Throughout the weekend, there are VIP parties featuring celebrity guests and billionaire hosts, like Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin, who's become known for his star-studded annual Super Bowl bash. The most exclusive celebration of them all, though, is in the winning team's locker room. Just ask billionaire Jeffrey Lurie, whose Philadelphia Eagles snagged the trophy last year. As Hollywood and the tech world become increasingly intertwined, the Academy Awards and the various events surrounding it have become a magnet for billionaires. Oprah Winfrey took the stage at last year's ceremony to honor Quincy Jones, and the Vanity Fair Oscars Party drew Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos — Amazon produced nominee "The Nickel Boys" — as well as Alphabet cofounder Sergey Brin and Skims cofounder Kim Kardashian. Two other billionaires, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, typically throw a rival after-party at Chateau Marmont. This year's Oscars, which will be held on March 15, are likely to draw a similarly monied crowd. Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison leads the storied movie studio Paramount, may make an appearance, as may billionaires Steven Spielberg, who produced in Best Picture hopeful "Hamnet," and James Cameron, director of "Avatar: Fire and Ash." The Masters Tournament, taking place from April 9 to 12 this year, kicks off the run of major professional golf championships and signals the start of spring for billionaires. Each year, hundreds of private aircraft land at the airports around Augusta. In past years, billionaires like former Nike CEO Phil Knight, hotelier Robert Rowling, and investor Herbert Allen Jr. have had their planes touch down. So has Tiger Woods, the only billionaire winner of The Masters. The tournament's venue, the famously exclusive Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, counts a number of billionaires among its members. Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Warren Stephens, David Ziff, and Stanley Druckenmiller have belonged to the club, Bloomberg reported in 2015. It's invite-only, and new members can only join when existing ones leave. The general public can spectate alongside some of the biggest names in business. Tickets for the Masters are available through a lottery system. Every year, the Milken Institute, a think tank founded by billionaire investor Michael Milken, hosts the Milken Global Conference in Los Angeles. Dubbed the Davos of the West Coast, Milken launched the summit in 1998 as a forum for discussions on economic and policy matters. While the program for this year's conference, running from May 3 to 6, has not been announced, last year, Henry Kravis, Bill Ackman, and Jensen Huang were among the billionaire speakers. The event isn't technically invite-only; members of the public can pay $35,000 to support the Institute as a council member and receive complimentary admission. While billionaires tend to spend June in the Hamptons or on yachts crisscrossing the Mediterranean, this year, many are expected to head to arenas across North America for the FIFA World Cup. "The big, big, big thing everybody's talking about and getting tickets for right now is the World Cup," Charlie Garcia, the founder of centimillionaire membership club R360, told Business Insider. The soccer competition, which takes place every four years, starts in June and runs through early July. Tickets for the final at MetLife Stadium start at over $9,000 on the resale market. While the tournament organizes teams by country, many star players are signed to clubs owned by billionaires, including Todd Boehly and Mark Walter's Chelsea, Stan Kroenke's Arsenal, and John Henry's Liverpool. There will likely be at least one billionaire on the field: Cristiano Ronaldo, who is set to play for Portugal. Private jets descend on the small town of Hailey, Idaho, every July for the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference. Since 1983, boutique investment bank Allen & Co. — its president, Herbert Allen, is a billionaire himself — has hosted the event, which attracts the biggest and richest names in business, such as Jeff Bezos, Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett. The conference has become known for the deals struck in between rounds of golf, guided hikes, and tennis matches. It's where Jeff Bezos snagged The Washington Post for $250 million in 2013 and where the seed for Disney's $19 billion acquisition of ABC was planted in 1995. Last year was no exception. David Ellison, the scion of billionaire Larry Ellison, met with Bari Weiss at the conference to discuss Paramount Skydance's potential purchase of The Free Press, The New York Times reported. In October, the $150 million deal was announced. The vacation-cum-business-meeting is invite-only and pretty much restricted to masters of the universe. Security is strict, with even the press walled off from most of the wheeling and dealing. Burning Man — the anticapitalist art and music festival in the Nevada desert — has been a rite of passage for the tech elite for decades. Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are longtime Burners — the festival inspired the very first Google Doodle — as is Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO. Facebook cofounders Dustin Moskowitz and Mark Zuckerberg, and Uber cofounder Garrett Camp have also attended. Even Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, joined in 2019. Last year's festival, marked by storms in Black Rock City, drew fewer billionaires than in previous years. Still, hundreds of private planes flew into Burning Man's temporary airport during the festival. The starting price to charter a plane through Burner Express Air was $18,000, one way. This year's festival runs from August 30 to September 7, with planning already underway by the Burning Man Project. The coastline of Monte Carlo, already a haven for the ultrawealthy, becomes crowded with superyachts at the end of September for the Monaco Yacht Show, where billionaires scope out their new toys. The 120-plus superyachts on display feature elevators, bars, spas, pools, gyms, hot tubs, and helipads, and were worth a combined $5 billion last year. Jet Skis and submersibles are popular add-ons. Last year's yacht show featured yachts owned by the likes of billionaires Denis O'Brien and Paul Fireman. The largest of them, Mar, is still listed for sale with an asking price of $230 million. In the past, yachts owned by billionaires such as Paul Allen, Steve Wynn, and Sergey Brin have been exhibited at the show. The Monaco Yacht Show is open to the public, with one-day passes starting at about $800. October presents numerous opportunities for the affluent to expand their art collections. First, the Frieze Art Fair and nearby Frieze Masters, held annually in London, focus on contemporary art and pre-21st-century art, respectively. In years past, collectors like Point72's Steve Cohen and Diamond titan Laurence Graff have been spotted there. Shortly after, across the English Channel, is Art Basel Paris, a relatively new addition to the art fair circuit. Last year's fair drew James Murdoch, an investor in Art Basel's parent company, as well as Delphine Arnault, the daughter of Bernard, and billionaire art collector J. Tomilson Hill. A painting by Gerhard Richter marked the fair's biggest sale, fetching $23 million, and several works sold for seven-figure sums. Exactly which moneyed collectors are behind specific purchases tends to be kept under wraps. While the VIP previews, when most billionaires are spotted, are invite-only, anyone can buy tickets to these shows themselves, which begin on October 14 with the Frieze fairs. Formula 1 has become a passion for billionaires over the past couple of decades. The racing business itself is owned by John Malone's Liberty Media, and nearly all of the teams are connected to billionaires through their ownership structures. The various Grand Prix attract these wealthy owners and fans thanks to the races and parties. Monaco maybe a marquee of the F1 calendar, but newer events like the Las Vegas Grand Prix increasingly draw big names. Last year's race drew billionaires, including Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Magic Johnson, Fanatics founder and CEO Michael Rubin, and Aston Martin Team owner Laurence Stroll. Three-day passes for the Sin City heat, which runs from November 19 to 21 this year, started at $400 for general admission last year but rose considerably for various seating and package options. While Aspen and Vail remain billionaire favorites over the holidays, no destination is as popular as St. Barts when it comes to ringing in the new year. Last year, superyachts owned by the likes of David Geffen, Jerry Jones, and Eric Schmidt were moored off the Caribbean island's coast. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos were seen partying at a beach club. For those who don't stay on yachts, rooms at popular luxury hotels like Eden Rock and Cheval Blanc, owned by Bernard Arnault's LVMH, cost upward of $7,000 a night. "There is nothing mass-market about it," Winston Chesterfield, the founder of Barton, a consulting firm focused on luxury and the wealthy, told Business Insider. "It's impossible to be there unless you are really wealthy." Jump to

The Bitcoin Spot ETFs have experienced a turbulent start to 2026 after early inflows were wiped out by four consecutive days of withdrawals. Amid Bitcoin’s recent failure to sustain its market recovery above $94,000, institutional investors are seeking more stability, especially considering the falling chances of a possible interest rate cut. According to data from the ETF tracker site, SoSoValue, the Bitcoin ETFs registered $681 million in net outflows in the first full trading week of 2026. Notably, these investment funds had commenced the year on a positive note, notching $697.2 million in net deposits on January 5 after an initial $471.1 million inflow on January 2. However, a combined net outflow of $1.378 billion between January 6-9 soon cleared out all positive momentum driven by the earlier inflows. In analyzing individual ETF performance, Fidelity’s FBTC experienced the largest net redemptions valued at $481.32 million. Following closely was Grayscale’s GBTC, which recorded a net outflow of $171.79 million. Meanwhile, Ark/21Shares’ ARKB also had a sizable contribution to the overall weekly negative performance as its withdrawals exceeded deposits by $45.34 million. Other Bitcoin Spot ETFs with red performances include Grayscale’s BTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL, with net outflows varying between $3 million and $22 million. On the other side of the spectrum, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded the largest net inflow of the week, valued at $25.86 million. The BlackRock flagship crypto ETF continues to dominate with a remarkable cumulative net inflow of $62.41 billion, as its total net assets climb to $69.88 billion. Other ETFs with a positive performance include Invesco’s BTCO, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and WisdomTree’s BTCW, which also attracted net investments between $1 million and $15 million. Meanwhile, Hashdex’s DEFI stood alone as the only ETF with a zero netflow. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs boast a cumulative total net inflow of $56.40 billion. Meanwhile, their total net assets are valued at $116.86 billion and represents 6.48% of the Bitcoin market cap. Interestingly, the Ethereum Spot ETFs produced a similar weekly performance. Initial net deposits of $282.87 million between January 5 and January 6 were followed by three consecutive days of heavy withdrawals, resulting in a net outflow of $68.57 million. The Ethereum ETFs now hold $18.70 billion in total net assets, representing 5.04% ofthe Ethereum market cap. At the time of writing, Bitcoin exchanges hands at $90,422 as price movement over the last week resulted in a minor 0.17% decline. Meanwhile, Ethereum is valued at $3,088 while its daily trading volume crashes by 63.46%. Featured image from Forbes, chart from Tradingview For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock warns crypto’s love affair with AI is over as an energy war with Bitcoin miners begins
URL: https://cryptoslate.com/blackrock-ai-energy-forecast-bitcoin-mining-impact-2026/
Time Published: 2026-01-10T18:10:00Z

For years, Bitcoin mining fought an optics war over energy. Now AI is walking into the same grid, with a very different pitch: jobs, national competitiveness, and always-on demand. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock is telling clients to stop looking at artificial intelligence as software and start treating it as energy. In its 2026 Global Outlook, the BlackRock Investment Institute argued that the AI buildout is pushing against physical limits and highlighted electricity as the constraint investors are underpricing. The report’s headline-grabber is its warning that AI-driven data centers could consume as much as 24% of US electricity by 2030, a scale that would reorder everything from utility capex to industrial siting. That kind of forecast lands with an obvious follow-on question in crypto: if grid access becomes the scarce asset, what happens to the industry that built a business model around turning cheap, interruptible power into Bitcoin? In 2025, narratives arrived around the potential synergy of crypto and AI due to the theory that AI agents will want to use crypto for payments over traditional finance. However, a power war may tarnish this relationship going forward. For years, mining has lived in a political argument about energy waste. The industry’s counterargument has always been operational: miners can be the flexible load, switching off when the grid is stressed and soaking up surplus generation when prices collapse. In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has explicitly designed programs for “large flexible customers, such as Bitcoin mining facilities,” encouraging curtailment during peak demand. But AI data centers come with a different consumption profile, different contract terms, and a different level of political support. They don't want to power down, ever. They want the baseload. BlackRock’s broader point is that the AI boom is unusually capital-intensive. The firm cites a $5 trillion to $8 trillion range of total capital spending intentions for the AI buildout through 2030, with heavy spending on compute, data centers, and energy infrastructure. What began as a race for chips has quickly become a race for megawatts. There’s wide agreement that data center electricity demand is rising fast, even if analysts debate the ceiling. A Department of Energy announcement tied to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s data center report says data center load growth in the US has tripled over the past decade. Moreover, it is projected to double or triple by 2028. EPRI modeling from 2024 cited by Utility Dive put US data centers at 4.6% to 9.1% of US generation by 2030, depending on AI uptake and efficiency gains. A World Resources Institute explainer, citing a Berkeley Lab study, points to 6.7% to 12% of US electricity consumption by 2030. (wri.org) BlackRock’s “up to 25%” framing sits at the aggressive end of that spectrum, and is meant to be provocative. Yet even the lower-end scenarios would be enough to tighten power markets and harden the grid politics around who gets to plug in first. Reuters reported that utilities and grid operators are already adjusting rate structures and rules as hyperscalers and colocation firms scramble for capacity, especially in hotspots like Texas and Northern Virginia. That’s the environment Bitcoin miners are walking into. They are large, mobile power users, and they're first in line in regions with abundant generation or attractive pricing. Until now, those traits looked like advantages. Bitcoin mining is brutally simple at the physics layer. Specialized computers perform hashing to secure the network, and electricity is the dominant input cost. When power is cheap relative to Bitcoin’s price and network difficulty, miners print cash. When power is expensive, they shut down, relocate, or go bankrupt. That operational flexibility has become the industry’s best talking point as public scrutiny has increased. The US Energy Information Administration estimated crypto mining likely represented about 0.6% to 2.3% of electricity consumption in the US in 2024, a small share in percentage terms but large enough to show up in local politics and grid planning. Texas is the cleanest case study because the state’s competitive power market turns that flexibility into revenue. In a 2023 SEC filing, Riot Platforms said it curtailed power usage by more than 95% during periods of peak demand in August 2023, choosing to forego mining revenue to support ERCOT reliability. CryptoSlate reported that ERCOT paid a miner $31.7 million in energy credits that month to power down during a heat wave, a detail that captures both the value of flexibility and why the politics can get ugly fast. Powering profitability through energy credits, Riot Platforms navigates crypto market downturn. Now put that model next to AI. Training and serving large models need constant power and tight uptime. A hyperscaler signing a long-term lease wants predictable delivery, not voluntary curtailment. If miners are the shock absorber, then AI is the shock creator. And BlackRock’s yearly outlook effectively says that the shock is coming and there's no stopping it. In the mining playbook, “cheap power” means stranded hydro, surplus wind at night, or a friendly industrial tariff. But as data centers scale, cheap power becomes a moving target, because grid access itself becomes the bottleneck. Interconnection queues and transmission delays are the new friction. Even when a region has generation, it may not have the wires, the transformers, or the permitting pathway to deliver it to a new 500-megawatt campus. NERC has warned about reliability threats from rapid load growth tied to AI, data centers, EVs, and electrification colliding with generator retirements and slow buildouts. (Financial Times) That matters for miners because their advantage is speed. They can drop containers on a site, energize, and start hashing faster than a conventional industrial plant can ramp. But if the gating item becomes substation capacity and interconnection approval, then that speed turns into a regulatory contest. When power markets tighten, lawmakers start looking for villains. Mining has often been convenient because it feels optional, even to people who understand nothing about it. In contrast, AI is now being both to the public and to lawmakers as national competitiveness. That asymmetry is what will shape policy. It's easier to impose reporting requirements or additional tariffs on miners than on the data centers the local chamber of commerce is courting. It's also easier to frame mining as a speculative luxury and frame AI as the backbone of defense, productivity, and medicine. If BlackRock is right that AI’s energy footprint will become a macro risk, the political coalition supporting grid investment may widen, but so may the pressure to prioritize “productive” loads. Miners might respond by leaning harder into the flexibility story. A Duke University report cited by Utility Dive argues the existing US grid can handle significant new load if it can be curtailed during stress events, and mining can do that. Many AI workloads, especially inference for consumer products, generally can't. That creates a potential wedge: miners as a controllable load that helps integrate renewables, versus data centers as an inflexible load. This argument is already brewing in policy circles and utility commission hearings. However, whether it wins will depend on local economics and lobbying, not internet debates. There's another adaptation path already underway: pivoting from hashing to hosting. The logic is straightforward. If you already own land, power rights, and a substation, you have what AI developers need most. And if your legacy business is volatile, the prospect of contracted cash flows from compute hosting is tempting. CryptoSlate reported in October that some firms originally focused on Bitcoin mining have been pivoting toward AI infrastructure, with deals tied to cloud and AI workloads, precisely because power access in places like Texas has become valuable. The article’s message is not that every miner will become an AI landlord, but that the industry’s prime asset is shifting from machines to megawatts. With 500MW and 168MW hosting deals inked, miners get financing-friendly dollars while hashrate and fee trajectories determine who captures the upside. This pivot is harder than it sounds. AI data centers require different cooling, different network architecture, and different uptime guarantees. Mining can tolerate interruptions, but many AI customers won't. The cost of retrofitting can be enormous, and the competition includes specialist data center operators with deep relationships and financing advantages. Yet the direction of travel is clear. When power becomes scarce, the highest-value use of a megawatt tends to win. BlackRock’s forecast isn't about Bitcoin specifically, but about the end of cheap abundance. If AI pushes the US toward a world where electricity demand grows fast, and transmission remains slow, any business built on marginal power economics gets squeezed. Of course, miners won't disappear. Bitcoin’s incentive structure is designed to keep hash power online somewhere, and the industry’s mobility means it can chase new energy pockets. But the center of gravity could shift. Regions with surplus generation and friendly policy will likely see miners as a stabilizing industrial load, especially if they can credibly offer curtailment. Regions courting hyperscalers will surely treat miners as a second priority. The likely outcome is a barbell. On one side: miners that integrate with grids, sign structured demand-response agreements, and become part of utility planning. On the other: miners that turn their energy positions into broader compute infrastructure, essentially arbitraging their early arrival in power markets into a new line of business. Either way, the easy era is ending. BlackRock’s warning that AI data centers could swell to an enormous share of US power demand is a reminder that the next phase of digital infrastructure won't be constrained by code, but by the messy physical world of wires, permits, turbines, and heat.

Title: US to secure $800bn in Ukraine reconstruction contracts – The Telegraph
URL: https://www.rt.com/russia/630786-us-ukraine-reconstruction-deal/
Time Published: 2026-01-10T17:04:31Z
Full Content:
Washington and Kiev are preparing to sign an $800 billion agreement to rebuild Ukraine, The Telegraph has reported. The deal is scheduled to be sealed at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos later this month, Western sources told the newspaper. The agreement is reportedly structured around the rare earth minerals deal clinched by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky and US President Donald Trump last year. The accord grants Washington preferential access to the resources; however, the security guarantees long sought by Kiev are not included. At the time, Trump promoted the agreement as a way to recover what he described as the massive financial aid provided to Kiev by the previous administration. Earlier this week, he reiterated that a deal on rare earth metals was a condition for the White House to continue its efforts to peacefully resolve the Ukraine conflict. “I said that if we want to move forward, we need rare earth metals,” Trump told Fox News on Thursday. “We want our money back.” Officials told The Telegraph that the “prosperity” plan envisages attracting around $800 billion over ten years through a combination of loans, grants and private-sector investment. The newspaper noted that US envoy Steve Witkoff called the agreement a crucial part of the overall ceasefire package he has been negotiating for the past few months. The top state official reportedly said that the world’s largest investment group, BlackRock, would participate in the program. Trump repeatedly criticized unconditional aid to Kiev in the past, calling Zelensky “the greatest salesman on earth.” Last year, he said his predecessor, Joe Biden, had “fleeced” America by committing $350 billion in military aid to Ukraine. He has since argued that the US is now profiting from the conflict by sending Ukraine weapons which are being paid for by Washington’s European NATO partners. Moscow has repeatedly condemned Western arms deliveries to Kiev, arguing that they prolong the fighting without altering its outcome.

Title: Pro XRP Lawyer John Deaton Slams Warren’s Crypto War as Wall Street Doubles Down on Crypto
URL: https://zycrypto.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-john-deaton-slams-warrens-crypto-war-as-wall-street-doubles-down-on-crypto/
Time Published: 2026-01-10T15:33:34Z
Full Content:
John Deaton has once again slammed anti-crypto senator Elizabeth Warren, saying that she has lost her war on crypto. The pro-XRP lawyer opined that with Wall Street’s major entry into the industry, critics will likely change their stance. Deaton’s remarks come after financial giants, including Morgan Stanley, Charles Schwab, and Vanguard, announced plans to offer their clients exposure to crypto assets. In an X post, Deaton mentioned several financial institutions on Wall Street that are dipping their toes into crypto. These include Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, and Vanguard. He said that based on this, even the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, could soon affirm that “crypto is here to stay.” Deaton also suggested that the former chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, might issue a pro-crypto statement soon. “Schwab, Vanguard, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley – even Jamie Dimon says crypto’s here to stay. Someone tell Warren she lost the crypto war and her anti-crypto army has been dismantled. Soon, Gary Gensler will come out saying he was for crypto all along,” he stated. Last year, Deaton launched a Senate bid to unseat Warren in Massachusetts but failed to clinch the seat. Nevertheless, he has maintained his pro-crypto stance and continues to bash Warren, who earlier this year wrote a letter to crypto czar David Sacks, raising concerns about plans for a Bitcoin reserve. Deaton’s optimism regarding crypto adoption in the US follows a wave of interest from top financial institutions. According to the President of ETF Store, Nate Geraci, the surge has proven that crypto is not a scam. In an X post, he stated, “In the next few months, Charles Schwab will offer direct spot crypto trading to clients while Morgan Stanley will launch spot BTC & SOL ETFs… Meanwhile, Vanguard now allows clients to trade spot crypto ETFs. You see what’s happening here yet?” On December 6, Morgan Stanley filed with the SEC to offer Bitcoin and Solana ETFs to its clients. If approved, the investment bank will join BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, which already offer these products. The filing also comes when more investors are showing interest in ETFs that track the prices of different crypto tokens. Data from SoSoValue shows that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recorded $228 million in inflows on December 6, while Solana and XRP ETFs saw inflows of $9 million and $19 million, respectively.

Title: Tokenized Treasuries skyrocketed 125%, creating this “programmable cash” loop that banks are scrambling to copy

Tokenized RWAs are dominated by Ethereum, but one unexpected blockchain rival just surged 28% to outpace the leader. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tokenized real-world assets reached $19.72 billion on Jan. 9, the closest the market has come to the $20 billion threshold. That figure measures distributed assets, which are tokens that circulate on-chain and can be transferred between user wallets. As a result, it excludes another $19.78 billion in active private credit loans, which are tracked as represented assets on-chain for recordkeeping but don't enable open transfers. The distributed RWA market splits into three segments. US Treasuries and money market funds dominate, accounting for $8.86 billion in on-chain collateral. Tokenized commodities, led by gold, sit near $4 billion. The remainder, consisting of institutional funds at $2.84 billion, distributed private credit tokens at $2.32 billion, tokenized equities at $801 million, and bonds at $880 million, represents the experimental edge. Here, growth has been explosive, but issuer concentration remains extreme. Stablecoins, measured separately at $307.6 billion, dwarf the entire RWA stack and function as the liquidity rail that tokenized assets plug into. The past 12 months rewrote the trajectory. Treasuries roughly doubled. Institutional funds grew eightfold. Private credit's distributed tokens primarily represent loan participation, while the $19.78 billion in active loans, up 100% from an estimated $9.88 billion in January 2025, reflects the actual lending activity that generates yield. Bitcoin treasury companies need a blend of price stability, strategic governance, and revived leverage demand. Tokenized US Treasuries grew from an estimated $3.95 billion in January 2025 to $8.86 billion by January 2026, a 125% increase. BlackRock's BUIDL fund crossed $2 billion in April 2025, one year after launch, and has distributed $100 million in dividends as of December of the same year. Reallocation by major holders drives BUIDL-I share class drawdown, impacting BlackRock fund's net outflow. Binance accepted BUIDL as collateral in November, and Ethena's USDtb stablecoin now backs 90% of reserves with BUIDL tokens. JPMorgan launched its own tokenized money market fund, MONY, on Ethereum in December, with a $100 million seed. The pattern: institutions are treating tokenized Treasuries as programmable cash. Smart contracts automate interest payments, redemptions happen 24/7, and tokens move peer-to-peer without intermediaries. Against $28 trillion in total outstanding US Treasuries, the tokenized segment remains microscopic, but infrastructure is scaling faster than adoption. Institutional alternative funds grew from roughly $350 million to $2.84 billion, a 714% increase. Centrifuge holds 34.29% market share, Securitize controls 31.02%. That concentration means partnership decisions by a handful of tokenization providers move the entire category. These funds bring private equity, credit, and structured products on-chain with familiar regulatory frameworks. Tokenization reduces friction in secondary trading and allows fractional ownership, while yields remain attractive from 8% to 12%. Additionally, on-chain settlement transparency appeals to institutional compliance teams. The catch: liquidity is issuer-dependent. Most secondary markets rely on redemption mechanisms controlled by fund managers rather than open order books. A 2025 academic analysis found that tokenized assets exhibit low trading volumes despite growing market caps. Until more venues offer compliant secondary trading, institutional funds will scale through issuance rather than true market-making. Tokenized commodities grew from approximately $1.06 billion to nearly $4 billion, driven almost entirely by gold. PAXG and XAUT account for over 80% of commodity activity, as demand spiked 227% as precious metals hit record highs. Tokenized public stocks reached $801.36 million, up from roughly $250 million, a 218% gain. Ondo Finance controls 51.6% by value. Monthly transfer volume hit $2.66 billion despite the modest market cap, indicating high turnover. Active addresses fell 26% over 30 days, suggesting participation is concentrating among fewer, more active traders. Corporate bonds total $193.31 million with 14,300 holders. Cashlink controls 62.49%, JPMorgan holds 25.86%. Non-U.S. government debt stands at $686.66 million, with Spiko accounting for 80.72%. These are proof-of-concept deployments where institutions test infrastructure before committing larger capital pools. Ethereum holds $12.6 billion, equivalent to 64.51% of the distributed RWA market. BNB Chain accounts for $2.02 billion (10.37%), Solana $924.59 million (4.75%), Stellar $829.48 million (4.26%), and Arbitrum $745.92 million (3.83%). Stellar grew 28.% over 30 days, the fastest expansion among major chains, while Solana gained 16.56% and BNB Chain 12.11%. Stablecoins are going mainstream, and Ethereum is positioning itself as the place those dollars ultimately settle. Ethereum's dominance reflects first-mover advantage and institutional familiarity. BlackRock launched BUIDL on Ethereum before expanding to seven other blockchains. Nevertheless, multichain strategies are accelerating. Nearly 70% of BUIDL's assets now sit outside Ethereum, deployed where users and liquidity congregate. Interoperability providers like Wormhole enable seamless cross-chain transfers, which matters when liquidity fragments across networks. Private credit illustrates RWA.xyz's methodological shift in 2025. The platform now distinguishes “distributed” assets, which are tokens that circulate on-chain and can be transferred between user wallets, from “represented” assets, which use blockchain as a recordkeeping layer without enabling open transfer. Private credit's $2.32 billion in distributed value represents the tradable, transferable portion of loan participation tokens. The nearly $20 billion in active loans represents the underlying lending activity tracked on-chain but not freely transferable. The amount in active loans grew from an estimated $9.88 billion in January 2025, representing a 100% gain. Cumulative loan originations totaled $36.29 billion across platforms such as Figure ($14.48B active), Tradable ($2.3B active), and Maple ($1.63B active). Borrowers pay an average APR of 10.14%. Figure dominates with 73% of active loans, operating on the Provenance blockchain. Tradable holds 12% on ZKSync Era, while Maple accounts for 8% across Ethereum, Solana, and Base. The distinction between distributed and represented matters because it reveals how tokenization serves different functions. Distributed private credit tokens allow secondary trading of loan participations, creating liquidity for an otherwise illiquid asset class. Represented assets use blockchain for transparency, reconciliation, and operational efficiency, without exposing loans to open-market trading. Most private credit remains in the “represented” category because lenders prefer controlled distribution over open secondary markets. Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters stated in late 2025 that the majority of transactions will eventually settle on-chain. Private credit tests that thesis. If loan origination, servicing, and settlement move fully on-chain with distributed tokens, efficiency gains are substantial. However, custody for debt instruments, collateral management, and legal enforceability in insolvency all require more clarity before the market scales beyond its current $2.32 billion distributed footprint. Distributed RWAs could reach $30.8 billion (bear), $41.4 billion (base), or $57.0 billion (bull) by end-2027, assuming annual growth of 25%, 45%, and 70%, respectively. Tokenized Treasuries would scale to $13.8 billion (bear) or $19.9 billion (bull). Private credit's distributed tokens could reach $3.6 billion (bear) or $6.4 billion (bull), while the underlying active loans, measured separately as represented assets, could reach $28.5 billion (bear) or $50.6 billion (bull). The bull case requires specific catalysts: clear pathways for tokenized fund distribution in major jurisdictions, more venues for compliant secondary trading, and deeper integration of Treasuries as collateral across on-chain credit protocols. Private credit's evolution from represented to distributed depends on whether lenders embrace open secondary markets for loan participations or prefer controlled, permissioned transfer mechanisms. Those catalysts are materializing. The UK's FCA signaled a September 2026 crypto licensing gateway. Barclays backed Ubyx for tokenized money infrastructure. Visa and JPMorgan are experimenting with Solana rails. Wyoming’s Frontier launch plus a Wall Street wrapper filing happened fast, and the real institutional bet is on settlement rails. The bear case assumes infrastructure lags and regulatory uncertainty persists. Custody challenges remain central. Traditional custodians are still building capabilities for digital wallets, smart contract governance, and interoperability with tokenization platforms. Four factors determine whether 2027 looks like the base or bull case. First, tokenized Treasuries must become standard collateral across major trading venues and lending platforms. BlackRock's expansion to eight blockchains and integration with Ethena's stablecoin infrastructure is the template. Second, tokenized funds must solve the secondary market problem. Institutional alternative funds are growing eight times faster than other segments, but liquidity remains tied to issuer redemptions. If regulated venues support order-book trading for tokenized fund shares, the segment accelerates. Third, the custody and settlement infrastructure must be professionalized. Institutions allocate to assets they can safely custody and audit clearly. Progress is happening, as Zodia, Copper, and Fireblocks build enterprise-grade solutions, but adoption takes time. Fourth, stablecoin integration must deepen. At nearly $308 billion, stablecoins are the liquidity substrate for RWAs. The GENIUS Act provided clarity, and platforms are embedding stablecoins as settlement rails. China announced it will pay interest on the digital yuan, explicitly targeting dollar stablecoin competition. If US stablecoins remain competitive, RWAs benefit. The $20 billion milestone is a marketing number. What matters is whether the infrastructure supporting that $20 billion can handle $50 billion without breaking. The past year proved that issuance scales fast when institutions commit. The next 18 months will test whether market depth, custody rails, and regulatory frameworks can support the weight.

Investing DIV holds 50 high dividend U.S. stocks and yields over 7% with a focus on low beta names. PFF invests in preferred stocks with over 65% in financials and holds more than $14B in assets. JEPI generates over 8% yield by combining large cap U.S. stocks with options selling strategies. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. For many, investing is about staying in for the long haul, especially if you want to generate a lifetime stream of income that will support you well into retirement. To reach this goal, many savvy investors turn to dividend paying stocks. These are stocks of companies that make regular payments to investors out of their profits. But you can also turn to dividend paying ETFs. These are diversified funds that can hold hundreds of dividend paying stocks hand picked by professionals from big names like JP Morgan and Blackrock. But there are also tons of dividend paying ETFs out there. And their yields vary. Some have low yields, while others have much higher yields. So to narrow down your search, we tracked down 5 dividend ETFs that pay 5%+ yields and can have a nice spot in a long term investor’s portfolio. So let’s take a closer look. Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV) is a popular dividend paying ETF among investors. It generates an impressive yield of over 7%. It does this by investing in 50 of the highest dividend paying stocks in the United States. But its fund managers go beyond just picking dividend stocks with high yields. They also screen for stocks with low betas compared to the S&P 500. This can give investors the benefit of low volatility. Moreover, the fund has net assets of over $657 million. And it’s delivered a five year return of around 2%. Plus, it also has a competitive expense ratio of 0.45%. The iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF (PFF) invests in preferred stocks with an aim to capture returns similar to high yield bonds combined with growth potential. Preferred stocks also generally have higher yields than common stocks, making this fund popular among income seeking investors. This ETF has a large weighting in financial institutions with more than 65 percent of its holdings resting in that sector. But it also has a significant exposure to the industrial and utilities sectors. Utilities are often seen as a defensive sector, meaning it is generally known to remain resilient even in times of market downturns. Moreover, the PFF holds net assets of more than $14 billion. And it has a competitive expense ratio of 0.45%. The Invesco S&P SmallCap High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (XSHD) The XSHD invests in 60 companies in the S&P SmallCap 600 Low Volatility High Dividend Index. These stocks have generally been known to offer high yields as well as experiencing less volatility, potentially making it suitable for low risk investors. This ETF and its corresponding invex are rebalanced and reconstituted semi annually on the last business day in January and July. It generates a high yield of more than 6%. It is largely concentrated in real estate including real estate investment trusts (REITs). These are companies that invest across a variety of income generating real estate like apartments and shopping centers. And it has a slightly lower expense ratio than other funds on this list at 0.30%. Additionally, this ETF holds net assets of around $70 million. The JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) functions a bit differently than other ETFs on this list. It generates income by investing in large cap U.S. stocks and selling options.

Stablecoins are going mainstream, and Ethereum is positioning itself as the place those dollars ultimately settle. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Stablecoins used to be a crypto convenience, a way to park dollars between trades without touching fiat. However, the industry has matured enough that BlackRock now treats them as foundational rails for the market. In its 2026 Global Outlook, the BlackRock Investment Institute argued that stablecoins are widening beyond exchanges and becoming integrated into mainstream payment systems. It also said they could expand in cross-border transfers and day-to-day use in emerging markets. That framing matters because it shifts the question investors ask, especially when it comes from a name as big as BlackRock. The point here isn’t whether stablecoins are good for crypto. The question is whether they’re on track to become a settlement rail that sits beside, and sometimes inside, traditional finance. If they do, which blockchains will end up acting like the base layer for final settlement, collateral, and tokenized cash? BlackRock puts the stakes bluntly. “Stablecoins are no longer niche,” the report quotes Samara Cohen, BlackRock’s global head of market development. They’re “becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity.” Stablecoins began thriving on crypto volatility. Markets swing, banks close on weekends, and exchanges rely on a patchwork of fiat rails for redemptions. Dollar-pegged tokens solved that operational problem by giving traders a 24/7 unit of account and settlement asset. BlackRock’s emphasis is that stablecoins have now outgrown that niche. The firm said integration into mainstream payment systems and cross-border payments is a natural next step, especially where latency, fees, and correspondent banking friction remain stubbornly high. One reason the timing feels right is regulatory. In the US, the GENIUS Act was signed into law on July 18, 2025, creating a federal framework for payment stablecoins, including reserve and disclosure requirements. The law is signed, but the real fight starts in rulemaking and phased rollouts through 2026–27. Here’s the timeline, the winners, and how flows could reroute crypto rails. That kind of legal clarity doesn’t guarantee mass adoption. But it changes the risk calculus for banks, large merchants, and payment networks that have to answer to compliance teams and regulators. The market’s scale is also no longer theoretical. Total stablecoin value stood around $298 billion as of Jan. 5, 2026, with USDT and USDC still dominating the stack. BlackRock’s report, using CoinGecko data through Nov. 27, 2025, notes stablecoins hit record highs in market cap even as crypto prices fluctuated. It highlights their role as the system’s primary source of “dollar liquidity and on-chain stability.” That combination of legal recognition and sheer size is why stablecoins have started to show up in places they never used to, like the back office of global payments. Visa offered a concrete example in December 2025. The company said it had launched USDC settlement in the US, allowing issuer and acquirer partners to settle with Visa in Circle’s dollar stablecoin. Visa said initial banking participants settled over Solana. It framed the move as a way to modernize its settlement layer with faster movement of funds, seven-day availability, and resilience across weekends and holidays. Stablecoins are moving into the part of finance that’s usually invisible until it breaks: settlement. If stablecoins are now effectively digital dollars, the next question is where those dollars live as the system scales. As stablecoins move toward more complex uses, such as collateral, treasury management, tokenized money-market funds, and cross-border netting, the base layer matters more than marketing. That layer needs predictable finality, deep liquidity, robust tooling, and a governance and security model institutions can trust for decades, not just a cycle. This is where Ethereum could step in. Ethereum’s value proposition in 2026 isn’t that it’s the cheapest chain for sending a stablecoin. Plenty of networks compete there, and Visa’s Solana pilot is a reminder that high-throughput chains have a seat at the table. The case for Ethereum is that it has become the anchor layer for an ecosystem that treats execution and settlement as separate functions. Ethereum’s own documentation makes that explicit in the context of rollups, where Ethereum acts as the settlement layer that anchors security and provides objective finality if disputes occur on another chain. So when users move fast and cheap on L2s, the base chain still plays referee. The more valuable the activity being settled, the more valuable the referee role becomes. BlackRock’s stablecoin section is also a tokenization story. The report describes stablecoins as a “modest but meaningful step toward a tokenized financial system,” where digital dollars coexist with, and sometimes reshape, traditional channels of intermediation and policy transmission. Tokenization turns that abstract idea into a balance-sheet reality. It means issuing a claim on a real-world asset, such as a Treasury bill fund, on a blockchain. Stablecoins then serve as the cash leg for subscriptions, redemptions, and secondary-market trading. On that front, Ethereum is still the center of gravity. RWA.xyz shows Ethereum hosting about $12.5 billion in tokenized real-world assets, roughly a 65% market share as of Jan. 5, 2026. BlackRock itself helped build that gravitational pull. Its tokenized money-market fund, BUIDL, debuted on Ethereum and later expanded to multiple chains, including Solana and several Ethereum L2s, as tokenized Treasuries became one of the clearest real-world use cases for on-chain finance. Even on a multi-chain footprint, the institutional pattern is telling: start where liquidity, custody integrations, and smart contract standards are most mature, then extend outward as distribution channels develop. JPMorgan has been moving in the same direction. The bank launched a tokenized money-market fund with shares represented by digital tokens on Ethereum. It accepted subscriptions in cash or USDC and tied the push partly to the stablecoin regulatory shift that followed the GENIUS Act. This suggests stablecoins don’t just need a fast network for payments. They also need a credible settlement fabric for tokenized collateral, yield-bearing cash equivalents, and institutional-grade finance. Ethereum has become the default answer to that need, not because it wins every benchmark, but because it has become the settlement court where the most valuable cases are heard. BlackRock’s outlook includes caution embedded in the opportunity. In emerging markets, it notes stablecoins could broaden dollar access while challenging monetary control if domestic currency use declines. That’s a political economy problem, not a tech problem. It’s also the kind that can trigger restrictive policy responses in exactly the places where stablecoins have product-market fit. There are also issuer risks. Stablecoins aren’t all the same, and market structure can turn on trust. S&P Global Ratings downgraded its assessment of Tether’s reserves in November 2025, citing concerns about limited transparency. It was a reminder that the stability of the system can hinge on what sits behind the peg. Despite a downgrade from S&P, Tether's gold and Bitcoin stockpile is seen as strength by crypto markets. Ethereum also isn’t guaranteed to be the only settlement layer that matters. Visa’s USDC settlement work shows large players are willing to route stablecoin settlement over other chains when it fits their operational needs. Circle positions USDC as natively supported across dozens of networks, a strategy that makes stablecoin liquidity portable and reduces dependence on any single chain. But portability cuts both ways. As stablecoins spread, the premium shifts to layers that can provide credible settlement, integration with tokenized assets, and a security model strong enough to persuade institutions they can park real cash and real collateral on-chain without waking up to a governance surprise. That’s why ETH is a likely wager on the settlement standard for tokenized dollars. If stablecoins are becoming what BlackRock says they are, a bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity, the bridge still needs bedrock. In the current architecture of the crypto market, Ethereum is the bedrock most institutions keep returning to.

Banks, private equity firms, hedge funds, and asset managers have been eager to use generative AI to boost productivity and reduce grunt work for workers. Business Insider has been reporting on how some of finance's biggest players are approaching artificial intelligence, from its potential impact on jobs and the creation of new ones, to the various ways firms are cutting costs and ramping up efficiencies. But first — if you work at a Wall Street firm and are using AI, we want to hear from you. How is AI really showing up in your day-to-day? Is it living up to the hype? AI is set to reshape roughly 44% of banking work by 2030, according to consulting firm ThoughtLinks — and Wall Street's biggest firms are racing to get there first.

JPMorgan Chase, the largest US bank by assets, is spending $18 billion a year on technology, with AI a central focus. CEO Jamie Dimon is a "tremendous" user of the bank's generative AI tools, which have now been rolled out to more than 200,000 employees. The bank is also replacing long-standing human processes with AI. Its asset-management arm announced plans to stop using external proxy advisers for US shareholder voting, instead launching an in-house AI platform, Proxy IQ, which will analyze data from more than 3,000 annual company meetings. Executives have said the bank is training employees to use AI in ways that deliver measurable productivity gains. Goldman Sachs is spending $6 billion on technology this year — a figure CEO David Solomon has said he wishes were higher. In an October memo outlining the latest phase of its OneGS initiative, the bank said AI would drive efficiency, slow hiring, and lead to a "limited reduction" in roles. Goldman has since rolled out internal AI tools, including an assistant now available to employees across the firm. More stories:7 Goldman Sachs insiders explain how the bank's new AI sidekick is helping them crush it at work Goldman is assembling a growing arsenal of AI tools. Here's everything we know about 5. Morgan Stanley, an early OpenAI partner, has focused on turning employee ideas into working AI products. One internally built tool, called DevGen.AI has already saved engineers more than 280,000 hours this year. Among interns, AI adoption is especially strong: 72% say they use ChatGPT daily or several times a week. Citigroup has also accelerated its push. Nearly 180,000 employees across 83 countries now have access to Citi's proprietary AI tools, which have been used almost 7 million times this year. CEO Jane Fraser said the bank's generative AI tools are saving about 100,000 developer hours a week through automated code reviews. Citi also began piloting agentic AI with 5,000 employees in September. Citi snags AI leader from Morgan Stanley to help turn around its wealth tech In the ultracompetitive world of hedge funds, being ahead on the latest technology is always a priority. In December, Citadel said its stockpickers are using an internal chatbot to speed up their processes and find new info at his $71 billion hedge fund. At the 2025 Global Milken conference, Andreas Kreuz, WorldQuant's deputy CIO, said the firm was using AI to expand the data it can bring into its models since it can restructure data from images and audio. Point72's CTO Ilya Gaysinskiy told BI about his big plans to ramp up Point72's tech organization and how AI will play into that expansion. Bridgewater launched a fund driven by AI in 2024. The fund's AIA Labs worked to replicate every stage of the investment process with machine learning. The firm's co-chief investment officer and chief scientist outlined the plans of the world's largest hedge fund. $29 billion hedge fund Balyasny has built an AI bot that it believes will be able to do the grunt work that typically falls to senior analysts — a potential huge timesaver for investment teams. The manager told Business Insider in 2024 that roughly 80% of the firm's staff use its AI tools, which include the internal chatbot BAMChatGPT, and recently hired Matthew Henderey, one of the CIA's AI developers, as a data science executive. Man Group and Viking Global have also developed their own internal offerings. Lucia Soares — Carlyle's chief information officer and head of technology transformation — talked to BI about taking on a new challenge: Bringing AI to the investment giant's 2,300 global employees. Private equity firms are no strangers to managing and analyzing copious amounts of data — but data is only helpful if you can find it. Blackstone has invested in improving its enterprise search and is also betting AI will give it a leg up in its pursuit to capture more of the insurance market. Swedish PE giant EQT built an AI engine called Motherbrain that has changed how its investors source deals. ChatGPT enables the investing giant to take the next step with its AI ambitions. As private equity firms turn to AI for a competitive edge, Thomas H. Lee says its engineers are up to 30% more productive with help from AI coding assistants. AI tools are changing how stock-pickers do their job. AllianceBernstein, BlackRock, and JPMorgan opened up on how their tools are speeding up portfolio manager workflows. BlackRock has introduced Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. Business Insider talked to Kirsty Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, who helped develop the tool. The multi-billion-dollar investment manager VanEck invested in a Toronto-based startup and is onboarding its technology to boost its ETF business. An executive and the fintech's CEO walked us through how AI will change the jobs of analysts and salespeople. Kraken's $1.5 billion acquisition of a retail trading startup made headlines last March. Less noticed was how the crypto exchange used generative AI to run due diligence on the target — a process its head of M&A now considers core to his team's work. At Block, Jack Dorsey's fintech behind Square, Afterpay, and Cash App, engineers built an AI agent that can write code faster — and in some cases better — than senior developers. The company ultimately decided to open-source the tool, even as it gives competitors a look under the hood. Chime has taken a similar in-house approach. In 2023, the neobank built a private, ChatGPT-style assistant to help engineers ship products more quickly and at lower cost. The company's CTO shared how the tool has become a key part of Chime's product-development playbook. Jump to

Title: Abu Dhabi steel group eyes takeover of Gupta's UK empire

Arabian Gulf Steel Industries is among a small number of parties which have approached the Official Receiver about buying the UK's third-biggest steelmaker out of insolvency, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Saturday 10 January 2026 09:08, UK A UAE-based steel company has made an approach to buy Britain's third-biggest steel producer, months after it was declared "hopelessly insolvent" and fell into the hands of the Official Receiver. Sky News has learnt that Arabian Gulf Steel Industries (AGSI), which is headquartered in Abu Dhabi, is among a small number of parties which have lodged proposals to take control of the Speciality Steels UK (SSUK) business which until last summer was owned by the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel empire. The business collapsed into compulsory liquidation in August, sparking a scramble in Whitehall to find a buyer for it as part of efforts to preserve the UK's steelmaking capabilities. The SSUK business operates sites at Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire, and across its operations employed close to 1,500 people when it collapsed last summer. This weekend, it was unclear how advanced any discussions were between AGSI and the Official Receiver, while the terms of any proposal were also unclear. One source suggested that AGSI might be keen to secure financial backing from Britain's National Wealth Fund to support a takeover of SSUK and fund a resumption of steelmaking at its sites in Yorkshire. AGSI describes itself on its website as "the epitome of Net Zero steel", and has pledged to produce five million tons of steel by 2030, while reducing carbon dioxide emissions by more than 95% compared to traditional steelmaking processes. The company is privately owned and run by its founder and chief executive, Asam Hussain. AGSI did not respond to an emailed request for comment, but one source expressed scepticism that it would ultimately acquire the Liberty Speciality Steels business. A number of other parties have also expressed interest in buying the operations in recent months. Mr Gupta himself had secured backing from third parties including Blackrock, the world's biggest asset manager, although the prospect of him being chosen to repurchase the business appears to be extremely remote. An Insolvency Service spokesperson said: "We can confirm that the Official Receiver continues to progress bids for the sale of Speciality Steel UK. "The sales process is ongoing, with the aim to complete a sale at the earliest opportunity." In response to an enquiry from Sky News, a government spokesperson said: "We remain committed to a bright and sustainable future for steelmaking and steelmaking jobs in the UK. "The independent Official Receiver is carrying out his duties as liquidator, while we also make sure staff and local communities are supported." The National Wealth Fund failed to respond to an enquiry from Sky News. The sale process for SSUK comes during a period of broader uncertainty for the British steel sector, against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's tariffs regime and a continued global glut of the metal. In November, Sky News revealed that ministers were drafting in bankers at Evercore to conduct a review of options for the industry. Peter Kyle, the business secretary, and UK Government Investments (UKGI), the Whitehall agency which manages taxpayers' interests in a range of companies, including the Post Office and Channel 4, are expected to consider whether to merge some of the remaining companies in the sector. These would include British Steel, the Scunthorpe-based producer which is legally owned by China's Jingye Group but which was seized by the government last April amid a threat to close its remaining blast furnaces. So far, the government has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on running British Steel. The government's move prevented the immediate loss of more than 3,000 jobs, although there remain questions about the company's viability as a standalone entity. "We continue to work with Jingye to find a pragmatic, realistic solution for the future of British Steel," Chris McDonald, the industry minister, said in a statement to parliament in November. "Our long-term aspiration for the company will require co-investment with the private sector to enable modernisation and decarbonisation, safeguard taxpayers' money and retain steelmaking in Scunthorpe." In 2024, ministers agreed to provide £500m in grant funding to Tata Steel, the Indian company, to install an electric arc furnace at its Port Talbot steelworks in Wales. The new facility is expected to be operational in 2027, but has been bitterly opposed by trade unions infuriated that the new funding was effectively used to drive through thousands of redundancies at the plant.

Title: Teens share their views on possible social media ban
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2026/0110/1552328-social-media-ban-ireland/

Sinéad Courtney One month ago, Australia implemented a world-first social media ban for those under the age of 16 in a bid to protect young people from harmful content. The move sparked conversation around the world with many countries, including Ireland and other EU member states, now examining whether they should follow suit. At the Stripe Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition in Dublin (YSTE), we spoke to teenagers from around the country about their views on whether Ireland should adopt similar social media legislation. "It probably would be a good idea, but I'm not sure how many people would be happy about it," Ewan Coulter, aged 16, from Castletroy College in Limerick said. "They’d probably struggle a bit at the start but after that it’d be fine, after the first few months" 16-year-old Ellen O’Shea from Ursuline College in Blackrock in Dublin thinks an all-out ban is drastic. "Instead of banning it, there should be better mediation of it," she explained. "I would make some content harder to access for younger children. I believe that sometimes through media, kids can be exposed to things they don’t need to be exposed, so I do see the point in it (a ban) slightly." Ellen said social media has been a valuable tool for her when it comes to education and preparing for YSTE. "Things like developing projects, schoolwork and all that, social media has really helped me, I wouldn’t be where I am today without it," she added. As a 15-year-old, Éabha McSorley from Gaelcholáiste Charraig Uí Leighin in Cork would no longer be able to use social media if a ban came in. "I think it would be a good idea. It could have positive benefits for people's mental health," she said. But Éabha would prefer to see platforms take more action to remove harmful content altogether as "then it would be a lot safer for children and teenagers to be online in the first place". Explained: Australia's social media ban for under-16s Barry Wilmot, aged 16, from Villiers School in Limerick does not believe a ban would actually stop under-16s from accessing social media. "I don’t think it would make much of a difference, especially if they were already using it prior to a ban, because there’s so many ways around these things," he explained. "I think that the amount of time it takes up from your life is a lot and there are better things you can be doing with your time, so maybe a limited use of social media or a controlled use would be better."

Round 10 being the reverse fixtures from round nine just three weeks ago, there will be a fair whiff of vengeance in the bitingly Baltic mid-winter air around the Energia All-Ireland League this weekend. After the Friday night resumption in a Dublin derby between third-placed Lansdowne and second-placed St Mary’s, the champions and festive Division 1A leaders Clontarf resume their campaign in a repeat of the recent Bateman Cup final against Ballynahinch. The Ulster side led for 67 minutes at Castle Avenue before Clontarf claimed their first Bateman Cup with a 21-16 win thanks to replacement Ivan Soroka’s late try. He now starts in the absence of Alex Usanov while Charlie Ward is recalled at tighthead and both Paul Deeny, brother of Leinster’s Brian, replaces Alex Soroka, and Luke Brady return to the backrow. Ballynahinch, who haven’t beaten Clontarf since 2020, have slipped seven points off the top-four playoff places, so their need is acute. They make just two changes, namely Quinn Armstrong at inside centre and Daniel Bennett on the wing. Fourth-placed Terenure, who lead Cork Con on points difference, are seeking to end a run of three successive defeats after their 30-24 loss to Old Belvedere last time out. They are without Joshua Kenny, who is starting for Leinster against La Rochelle, and hooker John McKee compared to the last meeting, with Aran Egan at outhalf in a reshuffled backline which is notable for the presence of ex-Munster centre Peter Sylvestre for the first time this season as he is home on holidays from Miami. John Devine is also making his Connacht debut in Montpellier, with Eddie Kelly – another former Sevens winger – replacing Kenny. Max Russell reverts to hooker, with ex-Ospreys flanker Will Hickey also returning. Belvo make just two changes, bringing in winger Johnny Kiely and former Ireland under-19s outhalf Donagh O’Dwyer. Con host UCD, having taken a 36-19 away win last time out in Belfield, and are boosted by the return of loosehead Mark Donnelly following his recent loan spell with Ealing Trailfinders, as well as Ireland under-20s centre Eoghan Smyth. Danny Sheehan starts at hooker and Mark Skelly comes into the backrow, while Darragh French shifts from centre to fullback. Young Munster, who sit four points further back after consecutive bonus-point wins, were due to welcome back Evan O’Connell and Ruadhán Quinn but both are now travelling with Munster to Toulon, missing the repeat Munster derby away to Nenagh Ormond. The Tipperary side, who lost 57-10 three weeks ago, welcome back Munster’s ex-Connacht centre Sean O’Brien. Division 1B leaders Old Wesley host Blackrock while in 2A, fifth-placed Corinthians host leaders Barnhall and the only other unbeaten side in the AIL, 2B leaders Galwegians, travel to Skerries. Division 1A: Lansdowne v St Mary’s College, Aviva Stadium Back Pitch, (7.30pm, Friday); Ballynahinch v Clontarf, Ballymacarn Park; Cork Constitution v UCD, Temple Hill; Nenagh Ormond v Young Munster, New Ormond Park; Terenure College v Old Belvedere, Lakelands Park. Division 1B: Instonians v City Of Armagh, Shaw’s Bridge (2pm); Dublin University v Queen’s University, College Park; Garryowen v Highfield, Dooradoyle; Old Wesley v Blackrock College, Energia Park; UCC v Naas, The Mardyle.

The last time Munster played Toulon away in the Champions Cup, two years ago this weekend, Simon Zebo was the red 15. Without a win in their opening two pool matches, Munster trailed 10-0 after 23 minutes and were skidding towards a ditch. The airbag turned out to be a pair of tries. Zebo got the second. The creative credits were shared between the outhalf and the fullback, producer and director. Zebo spotted a thin peninsula of space behind the Toulon cover and shouted at team-mate Jack Crowley to kick. His sumptuous chip greeted Zebo on the first bounce. Behind the try line Zebo was swamped by Munster players, but a photographer, Laszlo Geczo, got a clean shot of Zebo’s wild eyes and the rapture on his face. Great photographs are never silent and Zebo’s roar is the soundtrack of the picture. His top jaw and his bottom jaw are frozen at full stretch, like a hippopotamus’s. As a player this was his shtick: flashes of lightning. “The brighter the lights the better I play,” Zebo had said in an interview before the game. That was his 35th try in the Champions Cup, which put him third on the all-time list. It was also his last. By the end of that season his heart and his legs had reached a state of irreconcilable differences and Zebo retired. “I would have liked to think that I could have played another year, but definitely not two,” Zebo says now. “It wasn’t the matches. I could have played matches for another three years if it was just that. It was the weekly toll that was being taken. Getting to Saturday to play the match was getting harder and harder.” In retirement, though, the bright lights didn’t go dark. Television was drawn to him. He had charisma and knowledge of an ever-changing game and he excited a response. Not everybody was attracted to his innate bubbliness and his naked Munster bias, but that was part of his magnetism too. Television is competing for eyeballs in a bear-pit market. Broadcasters need pundits who can cut through the din. They can’t afford to serve lukewarm tea. While he was still playing, Zebo occasionally turned up in a TV studio, but this season he has been a consistent presence on Premier Sports. When Munster beat Leinster by 31-14 in Croke Park last October, Zebo’s first big outing for the station, his unbridled joy dominated the coverage. When the game finished, he was unleashed with a roving mike to conduct post-match interviews, and he didn’t try to conceal his emotion or defuse his giddiness or hide the fact that he was talking to former team-mates. What did viewers think? Nobody was ambivalent. Either you loved it or you didn’t. Before the match Zebo did a piece comparing the sides’ outhalves, Jack Crowley and Sam Prendergast. He expressed his marginal preference for Crowley with a series of cogent points that praised and criticised both players. But he made it clear how much he admired the Leinster 10. “I just want to put it on the record, Sam Prendergast is an amazing player – because there are a few Leinster crybabies in my inbox,” he said with a laugh. A post shared by Premier Sports (@premsportstv) That segment was shared on Premier Sports’ social media channels and generated nearly 1.5 million impressions, an astonishing number compared to their whistle-to-whistle TV coverage of the match, which reached a peak audience of 78,000. For every broadcaster now, the battle is on many fronts. “I’m always up for having a laugh,” Zebo says. “I want to bring that energy and just show as much personality as possible. I was never a big fan of the generic answers you were used to hearing over and over again. “I’m not afraid to show my personality. People watching want the pundits to be genuine and I think people see beyond the BS when people put up fake personas or pretend to be super polished and not have any loyalties. “I think if I was watching Man United and Man City I would want to watch people who have been in those changing rooms and understand the club, the culture, the history. “If the pundit doesn’t have that energy or connection with the club then I don’t think you will portray the energy needed for the viewer to enjoy the game. That’s where I’d be at. “I’m still trying to find my feet as well. I’m by no means any polished article. I’d love to be super comfortable, as if you were sitting down on the sofa with me watching the game. That would be the ideal scenario. “At the moment, I’m trying to be as insightful as I can and have a bit of fun with it at the same time.” Sky Sports gave up on the pretence of impartiality years ago. In their football coverage there will invariably be somebody in the studio with an affiliation to each club. Rugby was slower to go down that road. Historically, the punditry has been more urbane, as if a game bound up with such complexity required laboratory analysis. There must be a middle ground. When Leinster beat Munster by 13-8 in Thomond Park last month, Leo Cullen came to the post-match interview with a riff he had prepared about Munster having more Leinster ex-pats in their side than Limerick-born players. It was Cullen’s first television appearance as a stand-up. Though his point was made for general consumption, he aimed it at Zebo, who all of a sudden was trapped at the bottom of a ruck, taking a shoeing from a man not wearing studs. It was compelling TV and when Premier released it on their social media channels it attracted about a million impressions; their audience during their exclusive broadcast of the match had peaked at 163,000. “I had to take my medicine,” Zebo says. “As he was slagging me, I was actually counting the amount of [Munster players] who came through Leinster and I was just like, ‘I’m going to have to bite my tongue here’.” In the online world tongue-biting is not a skill much practised. “That’s always the case. I’m not afraid of them. I’ve had them all my life, don’t worry. You say things and you know you’re not going to please everyone. It’s being comfortable in your own skin and saying what you really believe anyway, regardless.” As a player that was his manifesto too: he was true to his instincts. As a rookie on Ireland’s 2012 tour of New Zealand, and a bolter picked for the first Test, he was asked in a press conference what he thought he would bring to the team? “I like to run with the ball,” Zebo said. “I like to attack a lot.” Even though he took a conventional path from Presentation Brothers College, through Cork Constitution to Munster’s academy, he successfully navigated the system without surrendering his individuality. On parallel tracks during his teenage years in Cork, Zebo continued to play hurling with Blackrock, Gaelic football with St Michaels and soccer with Avondale United. All of it fired his imagination. The hackneyed term for a player like Zebo would be “mercurial”, with all that suggests about unpredictability. That description is not always applied as a compliment. Across all team sports the tension between structure and risk is greater now than ever, and that was where Zebo pursued his career: in the febrile space between instruction and instinct, between safe and hairy. Zebo finished his career with 35 Ireland caps and the general feeling was that it left him short. When Joe Schmidt took over as Ireland coach he didn’t pick Zebo for the guts of a year. Schmidt was obsessive about structure and detail, and his successful Irish teams made very few unscripted movements. And yet, 29 of Zebo’s caps came on Schmidt’s watch, and in the last two seasons before he signed for Racing 92, he made 20 appearances for Ireland, 15 as a starter. Schmidt wasn’t blind to Zebo’s charms, but ultimately the issue was trust. When Ireland won the Six Nations in 2015, Zebo played every minute of the first four games until the last match against Scotland when he was omitted from the match day squad. That day, Zebo represented a risk that Schmidt wasn’t prepared to take. “It’s kind of hard. Joe had a game plan and it was an incredibly successful game plan. He was an incredibly successful coach, so it obviously worked. But different styles can suit different players. That doesn’t diminish Joe or his ability, but it was just my style might have better suited to Rob Penney, when he was at Munster – he was amazing. “And Rassie Erasmus as well – he was probably my best ever coach. He was the most incredibly detailed, inspirational man manager. He did everything – everything. He held the team to a standard like no other and he was by far the best for the culture around the club. He brought a family spirit to the club – he was amazing. You’d go to war for him any day. “As soon as he left Munster we were all gutted because we knew success with him was on the horizon. We were all thinking, ‘He’s definitely going to win the World Cup with South Africa’.” Moving to Racing 92 for three seasons in his late 20s ended Zebo’s international career in effect, but it satisfied his desire for adventure. The IRFU couldn’t match the offer on the table either. In 144 games in French club rugby, Zebo scored 60 tries. Racing 92 embraced the flamboyance and the risk. “It suited me brilliantly. The style of rugby I enjoyed was the French style of play. You’d love to have been still available [for Ireland]. I would love to have been rewarded for my form while I was in France. But they were just the rules in place. “I made my decision and I wouldn’t change that. In terms of experiencing the full journey [in my career] part of that was playing in the Top 14. That was very important to me. It’s something I look back on with enormous pride.” Zebo settled back in Cork with his wife Elvira and their four children. All of them are playing the sports that he did as a child. His eldest son and daughter play on an under-11 rugby team in Cork Con that Donncha O’Callaghan coaches. They all go to the same school as Peter O’Mahony’s children. Zebo plays five-a-side soccer with childhood friends who remained his best friends. His children hang out at Blackrock hurling club, just like he did at their age. His life in rugby went through so many cycles and returned him here, unharmed and unchanged. O’Callaghan tells a story about being on a players committee in Munster when Zebo broke into the first team squad. Even in that giant playground Zebo’s lust for fun was outside the norm. Eventually, somebody on the player’s committee said the smile needed to be knocked off Zebo’s face. Nobody ever managed it. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Wall Street’s crypto debate is over as banks go all-in on BTC, stablecoins, tokenized cash

Big banks aren’t debating crypto anymore — they’re building it. From tokenized cash to ETFs, Wall Street is quietly going onchain. Cointelegraph in your social feed For years, major banks treated cryptocurrency primarily as a risk to be contained. That posture is now giving way to a more deliberate form of engagement. Rather than debating crypto’s legitimacy, banks are increasingly deciding how and where to integrate it, from regulated investment products to blockchain-based payment rails. This shift is on full display in this week’s Crypto Biz. JPMorgan is extending its US dollar deposit token onto new blockchain infrastructure, signaling that tokenized cash is moving closer to production use within global banking. Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, is positioning itself to offer exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) through exchange-traded funds (ETFs), potentially bringing crypto investments to millions of wealth management clients. Barclays has made its first bet on stablecoin infrastructure, backing settlement rails designed to connect regulated issuers with financial institutions. And Bank of America has taken another step toward normalization by allowing advisers to recommend spot Bitcoin ETFs to clients. Together, these moves suggest the banking sector is no longer content to watch from the sidelines. JPMorgan announced plans to issue its US dollar-denominated deposit token, JPM Coin (JPMD), natively on the Canton Network, marking another step by Wall Street toward production-ready blockchain infrastructure. Digital Asset, the developer of the Canton Network, and Kinexys by JPMorgan will extend JPM Coin from its existing rails onto Canton’s privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain, enabling regulated digital cash to move across interoperable networks. According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, JPM Coin, described as the first bank-issued, US dollar-denominated deposit token for institutional clients, represents a digital claim on JPMorgan’s dollar deposits and is designed to facilitate faster, more secure movement of regulated money on public blockchains. “This collaboration brings to life the vision of regulated digital cash that can move at the speed of markets,” said Yuval Rooz, co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset. US investment bank Morgan Stanley is entering the cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund market, with proposed products offering exposure to Bitcoin and Solana, following the strong debut of spot crypto ETFs in the United States. The bank has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch two investment vehicles, the Morgan Stanley Bitcoin Trust and the Morgan Stanley Solana Trust, designed to provide passive investment exposure to the performance of their underlying digital assets. If approved, the funds could be made available to more than 19 million clients within Morgan Stanley’s wealth management division, significantly expanding access to crypto-linked investment products. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have ranked among the most successful ETF launches on record, attracting substantial inflows during their first two years of trading. Momentum has continued into the new year, with renewed investor demand driving fresh inflows during the first trading sessions. London-based banking giant Barclays has made its first investment in a stablecoin-focused company, signaling traditional finance’s growing interest in digital dollar infrastructure. The bank announced an undisclosed investment in Ubyx, a US-based stablecoin clearing platform that connects regulated issuers with financial institutions to facilitate settlement and interoperability. The move also marks a notable shift for Barclays, which in recent years has publicly emphasized the risks associated with digital assets. “This investment aligns with Barclays’ approach to explore opportunities based on new forms of digital money, such as stablecoins,” the bank said in a statement. Ubyx has previously raised $10 million in seed funding, backed by Galaxy and Coinbase. The company was founded by Tony McLaughlin, a former Citibank executive. US investors may soon receive recommendations to buy Bitcoin ETFs from Bank of America’s private bank and Merrill Edge platforms, adding to evidence of Bitcoin’s growing integration into traditional finance. The bank’s chief investment office has approved coverage of four U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including products offered by Bitwise, Fidelity, BlackRock and Grayscale. Collectively, the funds manage more than $100 billion in Bitcoin assets. The move comes roughly a month after Bank of America reportedly advised wealth management clients to allocate 1% to 4% of their portfolios to digital assets. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, told Yahoo.

Title: BNY Rolls Out Tokenized Deposits for Near Real-Time Institutional Settlement

© 2026 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BNY introduces tokenized deposit capability mirroring $55 trillion in institutional cash balances on its private blockchain for faster collateral settlement. BNY, one of the largest global financial services platforms with over $55 trillion in assets, has launched a tokenized deposit capability on its Digital Assets platform. This new feature mirrors institutional clients’ existing cash balances on a private blockchain. It enables near-real-time settlement. The service begins with collateral and margin workflows. BNY’s traditional core banking systems keep all official records in their own private blockchain. BNY launched this new service after deploying tokenization services for money market funds with Goldman Sachs, which was announced in July 2025. According to the company blog, BNY creates on-chain digital book entries that correspond 1:1 to clients’ existing demand deposit claims at the bank. It does not issue new money. BNY records these tokens on its private, permissioned blockchain, which provides a secure, internal network for authorized users. The bank maintains the legal deposits on conventional ledgers for regulatory and reporting purposes. When a client needs to meet margin calls or move collateral, participating institutions can transfer the mirrored balances on-chain in near real time. This setup aims to cut settlement frictions. It also supports an always-on operating model. According to their announcement, the system does not bypass bank supervision or existing risk controls.

This launch helps advance BNY’s ambitions to support programmable, on‑chain cash for institutional… pic.twitter.com/gQRiZuS0va — BNY (@BNYglobal) January 9, 2026 The rollout first targets collateral and margin workflows. Here, intraday liquidity needs and settlement timing are the greatest sources of sensitivity. Institutions shift tokenized balances across the network within seconds to meet margin requirements. They avoid reliance on legacy cut-off times or batch processes. “As institutional markets move toward always-on operating models, BNY is committed to innovating and helping define how cash moves across the modern financial system,” said Carolyn Weinberg, BNY’s Chief Product and Innovation Officer. BNY is not the only company launching tokenized products. BlackRock, another major financial company, has announced that the “tokenization of all assets” has begun. It expects to tokenize more than $4.1 trillion in traditional products. Standard Chartered launched a similar tokenized deposit product in December 2025. Goldman Sachs also continually investigates and develops new tokenized products. This new institutional trend follows the big impetus set in 2025, with the development of Real World Assets (RWA). Over the last year, the real-world use cases of RWA and related projects have grown explosively. Announcements like this show that this technology will likely remain trendy in 2026.

Title: Bitcoin’s next super rally could depend on this key data point

Long-term Bitcoin holders sold nearly $300 billion worth of BTC in 2025, but as this sell pressure declines, a bullish outlook for 2026 has emerged. Cointelegraph in your social feed Update (Jan.11, 2026, 7.35 UTC): This article has been updated to correct the LTH supply figure to 13.6 million BTC. Bitcoin’s long-term holders (LTHs) went through one of the most aggressive distribution phases on record in 2025. While the scale of selling rattled the market, onchain data analysis suggests that this pressure may be fading, possibly outlining the next bullish period for BTC price. Key takeaways: Long-term holders distributed about $300 billion in BTC in 2025, marking a historic supply reset. Heavy LTH selling has occurred near cycle peaks or during structural transitions, not at the start of new downtrends. With selling pressure stalling, the next phase may hinge on how early the long-term holder supply stabilizes. An amount of Bitcoin (BTC) that had remained unmoved for at least two years moved onchain sharply in 2025. Nearly $300 billion worth of Bitcoin that had been dormant for over a year re-entered circulation. The 30 days from Nov. 15 to Dec. 14, 2025, marked one of the heaviest long-term holder (LTH) distribution periods in more than five years. Since 2019, sharp declines in long-term holder (LTH) supply have rarely appeared in isolation. They have surfaced during phases when Bitcoin’s trend was already under strain, either approaching exhaustion or undergoing a structural shift. In 2018, the LTH supply fell to 12 million BTC from 13 million, with selling intensity peaking when the 30-day distribution reached 1.08 million BTC in December. At that point, Bitcoin had already spent months declining. Price bottomed near $3,500 in February 2019, before stabilizing and rallying to $11,000 by mid-year, illustrating how heavy LTH selling could precede recovery rather than mark its end. The 2020–2021 cycle unfolded differently. LTH supply dropped to 11.65 million BTC from 13.7 million BTC, while Bitcoin price rose to $61,000 from $14,000. The 30-day distribution peak of 891,000 BTC did not immediately halt the rally. Instead, selling persisted as prices rose, gradually eroding upside momentum before the cycle ultimately rolled over, a reminder that LTH distribution can accompany expansion before defining its limits. During the 2024–2025 bull run, supply declined to 14.5 million BTC from 15.8 million BTC, with the 30-day distribution peaking at 758,000 BTC. Price topped slightly earlier in March, and both metrics then moved sideways through Q2–Q3, reinforcing a familiar pattern: Price strength tends to fade as long-term holders step up distribution. The final phase in mid-to-late 2025 proved more abrupt. LTH supply briefly recovered to 15.4 million BTC in June, before collapsing to 13.5 million BTC by December, the sharpest decline on record. Price weakness appeared in October, but the most selling followed later, with the largest-ever 30-day distribution peak of 1.14 million BTC in November. That sequence suggests capitulation rather than orderly profit-taking, marking a reset rather than a continuation of the prior trend. Related: Bitcoin RSI hints at $105K BTC price rebound as bull signals multiply Since December, the LTH supply has stopped falling, currently around 13.6 million BTC, while Bitcoin has entered a sideways range. Additional confirmation comes from the long-term/short-term holder supply ratio. Every time this ratio has fallen to –0.5 or below, Bitcoin has either entered a base-building phase or rallied to new highs within weeks. In December, the ratio dropped to about -0.53, after which price volatility compressed and momentum stalled, consistent with a reset rather than trend continuation. Thus this combination, aggressive distribution followed by supply stabilization, has historically marked transition phases rather than trend continuation. If the trend repeats, the consolidation through Q1to Q2 could act as a base-building period, with any sustained rally more likely to emerge later, potentially into Q3.
