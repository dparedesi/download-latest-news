Join the 20th Anniversary Celebration near the Caverns of Time, spread your wings as a new Dracthyr Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, or Warlock, ascend with a new Shaman Ascendance form, and more. Join the celebration as World of Warcraft celebrates its 20th Anniversary with new activities and myriad ways to earn currency. When: October 22, 2024 – January 6, 2025 Where: Outside the Caverns of Time in Tanaris Here’s what you can look forward to during the 20th Anniversary Celebration: Players level 10 and up will receive the quest, “Another Timely Invitation,” inviting them to the celebration in Tanaris outside the Caverns of Time. You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. Take part in quests and activities to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens to spend on items during the 20th Anniversary Celebration, including returning items from previous anniversaries and new ones. Join Moira Thaurissan as the bronze dragonflight grants her a look back in history, guiding us all through a journey through eight epic boss raid encounters. Players can queue for this epic raid with the Raid Finder (Group Finder Hotkey I) or create their own groups of 10 to 15 players by speaking with Moira for Normal and Heroic difficulties. Paladin Death Knight, Hunter, Mage Warrior, Druid, Priest Monk, Shaman, Evoker Warlock, Demon Hunter, Rogue We’ve modernized some very classic Tier 2 sets for all classes, including those that didn’t exist at the time these sets were introduced—such as Monks and Evokers—for a total of thirteen class sets! Each set comes as an ensemble of 9 pieces, including a cloak, making sure you look the part from head to toe. Step back in time and show off your class pride when you purchase these appearances with Bronze Celebration Tokens earned during the 20th Anniversary Celebration. Take part in a new Timewalking event that will take you through the original version of Deadmines, Zul’Farrak, Dire Maul (east and west wings), and Stratholme’s living and undead dungeons for epic new rewards. Queue up via the Adventure Journal or the Group Finder with players level 10 and above. Players will have the option to visit special vendors to get new mounts, pets, and transmog appearances. Here are just a few items you will find on the Timewalking vendors starting with the 20th Anniversary: Blizzard employees earn special service awards during their time at the company. We’ve taken inspiration from these awards to create a new mount that is fully armored in a similar style—the Coldflame Tempest mount. This blue-flamed flying mount takes after its fiery cousin, the Ashes of Al’ar, and will let you show off your own years of service to Azeroth. Players can also earn appearances based on the employee sword, shield, and crown to show off in-game, along with a version of the employee ring as a toy. Stand out with a 20-Year balloon toy and two adorable baby doomlord pets—Lil’Kaz and Lil’Doomy— you can add to your collection. For a limited time, you will also see some returning Anniversary items that can be also purchased with Bronze Celebration Tokens when you visit Storekeeper Reginald in the Celebration Pavilion and peruse his inventory. This year’s celebration event has expanded, and the bronze dragonflight have taken the activities just outside the Caverns of Time with various new and exciting things to do. Show off your transmog at the Fashion Frenzy stage hosted by Althaea. Mount up to match Abigail Cyrildotr at the Mount Mania arena and show off your mount collection. Join Lorewalker Cho at the Storyteller stage for an epic tale you can’t help but join in on. Take a photo with guildmates, venture to epic vistas, disguise yourself as your pet, cosplay as famous heroes or villains, skate on the rink, or take a balloon for a lazy ride around the event space. There’s plenty to see and do as you join the celebration in Tanaris, and it’s available to players at level 15 and above. There are gate-crashers at nearly every party, and that’s true of our anniversary celebration. We’re bringing back some classic World Bosses from the past, including Doomwalker, Azuregos, Lord Kazzak, and the Dragons of Nightmare, along with a couple of additional party crashers in the sands of Tanaris— the Sha of Anger and Archavon the Stonewatcher. Players can join in bouncing them out of the celebration beginning at level 15 to earn some great rewards and anniversary currency. Chromie is up for any challenge, but due to her unique role, she has not kept her codex in order. When asked to put together time tours of the opening of the Ahn’qiraj gate, she’s discovered things are in a jumble. She’ll need help from Azeroth’s heroes to put things to rights once more and send out of place enemies in the sands of Silithus back to where they belong. Players can queue up using the Group Finder for this 10-20 player scenario beginning at level 15. Often a thankless job, guest relations has a new volunteer, Alyx, stepping into the role with the lofty hopes of doing a better job than their predecessor. As visitors pour into the celebration, Alyx is under pressure and could use a little help making it an event to remember. Thankfully, they have found a secret-sleuthing tuskarr family who have become the perfect helpers in getting players up to speed with the tools of the secrets trade. Assist Alyx each week with resolving new guest mysteries by using your new secret-finding skills, and be on the lookout for stolen celebration goods. Follow the rumors and solve the mystery— if you can. We’re counting on you, secret finders. Players can begin working on the initial secrets beginning on October 28 with additional secrets opening up on November 4. Run down your enemies, raze their fortifications, and exchange the tokens you loot from their corpses to summon mighty reinforcements in Korrak’s Revenge, a throwback Battleground inspired by the earliest days of Alterac Valley. Players who complete the quest, “Korrak’s Revenge,” will be rewarded one of two mounts based on your character’s faction: the Stormpike Battle Ram (Alliance) and the Frostwolf Snarler (Horde). Players taking part in the battlegrounds during the anniversary celebration can also click on the Alliance Armory or the Horde War Supplies located in the starting areas of battlegrounds to don the appearance of PvP sets from times past. Celebrate 30 Years of Warcraft with November’s Trading Post. Players will be able to fill the month’s bar to earn four iconic back appearance shields representing the factions of Warcraft III— Orc, Human, Night Elf, and Scourge. Spread your wings as a new Dracthyr Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, or Warlock. Undertaking one of these new classes as a Dracthyr will allow you to choose between fighting as a Dracthyr or fighting in Visage form by activating Visage, which switches you between forms. You can additionally choose to toggle on Chosen Identity, which will automatically shift you into Dracthyr form when entering combat and Visage form when leaving combat. Dracthyr Evokers will continue to use Dracthyr form during combat, as many of their abilities emphasize their draconic nature. With the addition of new classes to Dracthyr, we are making some further adjustments to their racials. Dracthyr players will also be able to learn a new Skyriding talent called Squadron in which up to two additional Dracthyr players can join you to fly in formation as you soar through the skies. But wait, there’s more! Shaman can also look forward to new Ascendance forms to express their elemental mastery. Restoration Shaman will get a new Water form, Elemental will get a new Fire form, and Enhancement will get a new Wind form. 1920x1080, 3840x2160, 1080x1920 We look forward to celebrating all things World of Warcraft with you. We’ll see you in Azeroth!

In today’s dynamic business environment, organizations are overwhelmed by vast amounts of data, yet the challenge remains in effectively leveraging this data to inform strategic decision-making. A recent report indicates that companies lose approximately $5.8 million annually due to inadequate data quality and analytics [1]. This alarming statistic underscores the critical need for accurate financial forecasting methods that are agile and capable of adapting to the rapidly evolving market landscape. According to the findings of a recent survey carried out by Finextra, more than two thirds of financial institutions anticipate that in five years finest artificial intelligence (AI) will have been incorporated towards improving risk management and forecasting. Traditional financial forecasting, which often relies on static spreadsheets and labour-intensive processes, is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of contemporary business operations. Therefore, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into financial forecasting is not merely advantageous but indispensable for organizations striving to navigate these complexities and achieve long-term success. The Evolution of Financial Forecasting The evolution of financial forecasting has shifted from labour-intensive, manual processes to dynamic, AI-powered methodologies Historically, financial professionals relied on the analysis of historical data and market trends to generate forecasts using fixed models. While this approach provided some degree of insight, it was inherently constrained by human error, delayed response times, and the inability to effectively integrate real-time data. AI has fundamentally transformed this landscape, allowing businesses to analyse vast volumes of data instantaneously, uncovering trends and making predictions that were previously unattainable. This transition from retrospective analysis to proactive forecasting is reshaping how organizations formulate their financial strategies. The most recent trend in this transition is the proactive rather than the traditional reactive forecasting approach made possible by making use of real-time predictive analytics and machine learning technologies available today in the financial services sector. For instance, JP Morgan’s AI-based COiN platform analysed billions of data points saving 360,000 hours of human labour in forecasting tasks done by population each year. There are changes in terms of operational excellence and exactness. Simply put, the importance of AI in the financial services industry is very high. (https://superiordatascience.com/jp-morgan-coin-a-case-study-of-ai-in-finance/ ) The Role of Predictive Analytics in Financial Forecasting Predictive analytics is central to this transformation. By utilizing historical data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques, predictive analytics enables businesses to anticipate market trends, identify potential risks, and uncover opportunities before they become evident .A key advantage of predictive analytics lies in its ability to enhance accuracy. Through the automation of extensive dataset analysis, AI significantly reduces the likelihood of human error and progressively improves the precision of forecasts. Moreover, AI-driven dashboards can seamlessly integrate real-time data from various sources, including internal accounting systems and external market indicators, ensuring that organizations have access to the most up-to-date information for informed decision-making. Key Benefits of Al-Driven Predictive Analytics Predictive analytics in financial forecasting offers several key advantages that significantly enhance decision-making processes The Future of Al-Driven Financial Forecasting As we look to the future, several transformative trends are set to shape the trajectory of AI-driven financial forecasting: Applications in Financial Services Several large banks and other financial organizations have gone a step ahead and implemented AI in predictive analytic models for financial forecasting. For example, Goldman Sachs has created an approach towards the trading of shares through the incorporation of an AI platform with machine learning thereby enabling the third part to predict prices in a fast changing market. A similar case applies to Blackrock which employs artificial intelligence to enhance the performance and risks of the holding of the investment various instruments it possesses. This is confirmed by one of the instances that tend to show how global companies are already integrating into their operations AI for sales forecasting, which they deem very important. Whether it is about changing the approach towards the management of the portfolio, or measuring the risk, or going back to the operational excellence that is being expected, or decreasing the risks of fraud, nothing is more effective than AI in financial services. (https://thesciencebrigade.com/btds/article/download/165/165/359 ) Challenges and Considerations Apart from the numerous benefits of AI, its use within the segment of financial forecasting also comes with concerns. One of such restraints is the quality of the data and its integration. This means that the models ensure much data is acquired, and such models perform well whenever the data used for their training is accurate and extensive. For financial institutions, this entails spending money on strong database systems which will permit the vertical aggregation of different types of data. Another challenge is the complexity of AI models. As AI systems become more intricate, some professionals in finance may have challenges grasping the reasoning hypotheses that generate some of the predictions. This highlights the importance of developing more understandable AI models as institutions follow AI-enhanced predictions since it helps customers understand the reasoning behind them. Next Trends in AI Systems for Financial Forecasting When trying to talk about the future, there are a number of aspects that can be able to shift the way we have been forecasting in Finance with the help of AI: (https://ijsret.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IJSRET_V10_issue1_138.pdf ) Conclusion AI-enabled dashboards are quite literally redefining the methods of predicting finances, thanks to advanced analytical abilities. Such enabling tools allow corporations, as well as the financial sectors, to fully utilize data in real-time whilst predicting trends more accurately and with better insight in order to make the decisions required. Even if challenges such as data privacy, data integration and data regulatory compliance still exist, the advantages offered by these technologies cannot be over risks. In a subsequent part of the report, companies that apply AI-enabled dashboards will enhance their competitive edge profitability in the course of trading activities in a market that is highly influenced by data. This will allow not only to enhance their financial operations and risk management but also to act in accordance with those rules. These novel perspectives will enhance the organisational financial decision-making capabilities and mitigate the operational risk associated with noncompliance. In this new age, the application of artificial intelligence tools in the analysis and planning of finances will become the new normal. Illegal barriers will be effectively mitigated by those able to embrace today’s technological changes. References 1.

The mTBILL and mBasis products, launched on Tuesday, have no minimum investment requirements. That opens them up to a wide range of investors, including retail traders who are often unable to shore up large sums of capital like their institutional counterparts. “Retail access to tokenized RWAs, like treasuries, is a game-changer,” Midas co-founder Dennis Dinkelmeyer told Decrypt. “This is about giving retail the same access to high-quality assets that institutions enjoy.” Many real-world asset tokenized funds are targeted toward institutional investors, requiring a minimum investment of $100,000. Midas bills itself as the only RWA issuer with a regulatory-compliant offering that has no minimum investment thresholds and investor accreditation process, however. Midas’ new product based on mBasis—the firm's yield-bearing token that tracks a delta-neutral basis trading strategy—offers investors exposure to a tokenized basis trading strategy that has offered up to 25% year-to-date returns, according to the firm. The product is the first to offer full DeFi composability of a permissionless token that is regulated, the firm said. Meanwhile, the mTBILL product offers holders exposure to a lower-risk investment based on U.S. T-Bills, offering a return of roughly 5%, Midas’ website shows. Both tokenized RWAs have secured regulatory approval in Liechtenstein, making them available to retail and institutional traders in various parts of Europe, according to Midas. Early investors in the mTBill and mBASIS products can participate in an incentive program to maximize their investment returns, according to Midas. The first 100 holders of mTBILL will earn 50% APY for a limited time, which will be paid in USDC stablecoin for the first 100 holders of either mTBILL or mBasis. RWA tokenized funds have exploded in popularity in recent months. Earlier this year, BlackRock launched its BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which holds more than $500 million in assets under management, according to Etherscan data. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton's Franklin On-Chain U.S. Government Money Fund, which launched several years ago, has seen its assets under management balloon to roughly $430 million, according to the investment firm's website. The firm has also expanded the fund to multiple additional chains, most recently Aptos and Avalanche. And beyond those traditional finance titans, other firms are launching RWA funds based on different underlying assets. Guggenheim Treasury Securities launched the first-ever commercialized paper fund on Ethereum earlier this month in partnership with blockchain infrastructure firm Zeconomy.

Title: Should You Buy Apple Stock Before or After a New iPhone is Released?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/apple-stock-and-new-iphone-release-8722477
Time Published: 2024-10-08T15:24:26Z
Full Content:
The launch of the iPhone 16 series in September 2024 once again put Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the spotlight. However, the stock had a muted reaction following slower-than-expected sales of the updated release. This raises an important question for AAPL investors: Does the stock go up when iPhones are released? In this article, we'll explore the relationship between iPhone releases and Apple's stock performance. Historically, Apple's stock has exhibited mixed reactions to iPhone launch events. In the lead up to a new upgrade, the stock may rise, but on the day of the announcement, the stock often underperforms the market or experiences a slight decline. This phenomenon can be attributed to the "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect, which reflects the market's tendency to price in expectations before major announcements (even positive ones). However, after the initial dip, product releases serve as catalysts for subsequent stock increases. This pattern suggests that while short-term traders might see volatility around launch dates, long-term holders often benefit from sustained growth following successful product updates or introductions. Investors should pay close attention to the days before and after a new product launch to gauge its demand. Positive reception and strong initial sales figures can drive the stock upward, while disappointment or production issues can lead to declines. Apple iPhone sales account for half of all revenues for the company. As the AAPL price chart above illustrates (using a logarithmic price scale), Apple's stock fluctuated around iPhone launch periods. While not every launch correlates with immediate stock growth, the trajectory has been positive, reflecting the company's continued market dominance. In fact, after some releases, the stock remained flat or declined for several months before continuing its broader bullish trend. This is because, while important to the company, the iPhone is just one part of Apple's overall portfolio. While new iPhone features grab headlines, investors are increasingly focused on Apple's services growth and its potential in emerging technologies like AI. Various products and services beyond the iPhone contribute to Apple's revenue and stock performance. These include the Mac lineup, iPads, Apple Watch, AirPods, and services like the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+ streaming service. The company's ecosystem creates multiple revenue streams, reducing reliance on any single product. Apple has also been attempting to derive a more significant proportion of its revenues from services since these are less reliant on the physical products that can be snarled by changing economic conditions, technological shifts, as well as inflationary, supply chain, and other pressures. In 2023, Apple services accounted for more than a fifth, 22%, of all revenues. This has helped keep Apple's stock price moving up over the years. The chart below shows its stock price and the change in the value of a $10k investment in Apple over 30 years. While iPhone and other product launches are significant events for Apple, here are other factors that influence the company's stock performance: The top holders of AAPL stock are institutional owners, which include the Vanguard Group, BlackRock Finance Inc. (BLK), State Street Corporation (STT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A). As of the fourth quarter of 2024, 32 out of 38 analysts covering the stock have a "buy" or "strong buy" recommendation on AAPL stock, with an average near-term price target of around 5% to 7% higher than the present share price. Apple usually releases its newest iPhone series in the Fall (September or October) of each consecutive year. The iPhone 16 was released in September 2024, so the iPhone 17 should be released in the Fall of 2025. For the most accurate information, keep an eye on official announcements from Apple. Apple's annual iPhone release, typically in September, often creates a buzz in the stock market. Investors closely watch these events, as the iPhone remains Apple's flagship product and a significant revenue driver. However, the stock's performance during this period isn't always predictable. While positive reception to new iPhone features can boost share prices, the stock sometimes experiences a "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect, where prices rise in anticipation but dip after the announcement. Several factors influence Apple's stock around iPhone launches. These include pre-order numbers, analyst projections, and broader market conditions. Supply chain issues or production delays can also impact investor sentiment. Apple's stock performance is increasingly tied to its growing services segment and other product lines, not just iPhone sales. Potential investors should consider Apple's overall financial health, competitive position, and long-term strategy rather than focusing solely on iPhone launch events. Michael M.

Title: ‘First US election where a stance on Bitcoin and crypto has an impact on election outcomes’ – Lyn Alden exclusive interview

Why Trust Tech Report Tech Report is one of the oldest hardware, news, and tech review sites on the internet. We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Kicking off our series of interviews is Lyn Alden: macroeconomist, engineer, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, and author of Broken Money: Why Our Financial System is Failing Us and How We Can Make it Better. Although her reputation as a macro rockstar and Bitcoin proponent precedes her, many will be surprised to learn that her advocacy comes from a deeply ethical place, namely financial freedom. Her work has been featured in publications such as the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal, and she regularly appears on CNBC and Fox Business programs as a trusted analyst. Her appearances on podcasts like What Bitcoin Did, Blockworks Macro have amassed hundreds of thousands of views, and I wholeheartedly recommend you check them out. We asked Lyn a variety of questions, ranging from the Fed aggressively cutting rates to the influence of crypto on the US election, the macro crypto lifecycle, and more. She was gracious enough to answer them all. I’m an introvert, so I never really expected my audience to be very large. I started my work as a long-term, passionate side hobby, and it grew into a business large enough that I had to leave my other roles. But I’m very appreciative of people who have enjoyed the work, and it has certainly led to a ton of enjoyment. If there’s one downside, it’s that, ironically, it can be kind of lonely work. My prior work setting was very much in-person, whereas now, my work is mostly remote. And so, while my personal brand reaches more people, my number of daily in-person connections has decreased. But that touches on the broader topic of remote work in general. Mary Sue characters still kind of annoy me. Hollywood and creators, in general, seem to have trouble fine-tuning this. On the one hand, it can be kind of lame to have a popular series of films, shows, or books without strong female leads, but on the other hand, sometimes creators will overcompensate, and so we’ll get a series of pieces where the female lead is just overpowered and uninteresting. The first season of Arcane nailed this really well, in my view; they had strong female leads that were deeply interesting and appropriately balanced, in addition to plenty of great male characters. I don’t know how season 2 will hold up, but we’ll see. Blue Eye Samurai also handled this pretty well. As she goes through the show, she really earns her skills and struggles along the way. Not particularly. As inflation has gradually come down while rates remained high, the Fed’s thesis is that without some cutting, they would gradually get more hawkish over time (i.e. higher real rates via no action). However, periods of fiscal dominance can lead to periods of mild or significant stagflation. A rising unemployment rate while inflation is still ‘sticky’ is kind of directionally stagflationary, even if not outright stagflationary (which would entail falling real GDP). I didn’t have a strong view either way on the 25 vs 50 bps rate cut question. There are periods where the market really overshot or undershot how many rate cuts will occur in the months ahead. This was the first FOMC meeting in a while where the market wasn’t practically sure going into it what the number would be. My base case for the rest of the year is two more 25 bps rate cuts, but this can change with incoming data. We did have a recession in 2020. I noted that the US was on the verge of recession in 2022 but showed unexpected resilience. I do think that US inflation export on the global economy contributed to it, but I’d note that I think the majority of that inflation came from monetized fiscal deficits. There was no persistent uptick in the rate of bank lending like there was in the 1970s. Instead, it was a permanent increase in the amount of broad money at an above-normal rate, combined with temporary supply chain bottlenecks. I think they are mostly anti-crypto. They’re generally supportive of the existing capital market and banking structure, are explicitly against privacy, and favor control over the movement of money. There are some competing interests in the US government. Some, for example, find stablecoins useful for soaking up a lot of government debt issuance. So, there are plenty of politicians or other members of government who are positive toward the industry. But the financial regulatory side, in general, I’d classify as mostly against it. I think this is the first US election where a politician’s stance on Bitcoin and crypto has a non-trivial impact on their election outcomes. The scale of lobbying from the industry is large and beneficial for those who support it. There’s very little votes or money to be had from explicitly not supporting it, but plenty of votes and money to be had from supporting it. I don’t expect particularly good privacy-related laws in the next four years, regardless of the election outcome. However, I think crypto-securities laws will be highly influenced by the election outcome. My opinion is no, which is where my ‘nothing stops this train’ meme comes from. And so, I do think that the 2% inflation target will be challenging to remain under. They’re not directly correlated, but they’re quite correlated. Broad money supply basically represents the denominator from which we measure everything else, and so periods where it’s going up more rapidly than normal tend to elevate the prices of other things, assuming that those other things didn’t start the period in a valuation bubble. I think social unrest is likely to remain elevated and potentially go higher in the West unless or until certain structural changes happen. A weaker dollar could be a positive catalyst for developing countries in the years ahead because it would ease their USD-denominated debts and potentially give them a positive liquidity cycle. If we don’t get that weaker dollar cycle amid rate cuts, then I would expect more developing market unrest as well. But overall, I might be a bit more favorable on developing market economies with a 3–5 year view. I think a Harris administration could be marginally better than the Biden administration for the industry, but that’s yet to be determined. As I mentioned before, there aren’t many votes to be had from being against it, but there are single-policy voters to be gained from embracing it. I don’t expect either of the potential upcoming administrations to be good for crypto privacy, although a Trump administration would likely be significantly better for crypto securities. Since there are a lot more votes and donor dollars to be gained from embracing the industry, I think it’s rational that the campaign embraced it more this time than they have previously. It’s a clear differentiator for them and seems like low-hanging fruit. I’m not generally supportive of tokens such as the World Liberty Financial token. Bitcoin options already exist elsewhere, but this can bring them to a large variety of traditional brokerages. It should be beneficial to the liquidity. I think the main benefit is to BlackRock in the sense that having the most liquid ETF and then the most liquid options market on an ETF supports the network effect. Because options have so many different strike prices and expiration dates, liquidity is fractured, and thus, it’s hard to build a lot of total liquidity. The ETF that can build a liquid options market around itself will entrench itself for a long time to come, and BlackRock is in a strong position to do that. The challenge was the sheer scale of the project. The book was over 500 pages, including references, which made it one of the biggest books on the subject. There was no shortage of high-quality short books on the subject, but I felt that a comprehensive book is what a lot of people needed, and that thesis turned out to be correct. And for me, this was a part-time project done in the span of a year since I was still running my core research business and participating in other business pursuits. Second editions of books, if they come out, usually come out several years after publication. I would personally wait 5+ years before considering a second edition. I think that can be partially accurate in the sense that I think Bitcoin is a good thing to exist and grow. I generally use the word proponent rather than evangelist. But this came about from years of studying it. My earlier work was more neutral on the topic, and over time, I became more positive toward it. A scenario where I have no ethical opinion on the asset and just predict price changes would put me more in the pure analyst camp. But because, for example, I’m a proponent of the Human Rights Foundation and other groups that support financial freedom and use Bitcoin and stablecoins as a tool for that, I’d say I go a step beyond analyst toward being a proponent. I do, however, try to separate my investment analysis from my ethical analysis. In other words, I’m an analyst when it comes to giving my thoughts on the next 12–18 months of price movements or when making venture investments. But when it comes to putting out educational material, I’m a proponent because I view it as a good thing for the public to be knowledgeable about so that they can create decent legal support for it. I think it has to be changed topic by topic over years. Just pure hard work, consistently. An area where there’s been significant progress is Bitcoin mining. Five years ago, major media and studies on Bitcoin mining were almost universally negative and low quality. But due to years of analysis and positive examples, the raw facts have become so obvious that studies and major media started to become more split on it, with continued negative examples but also plenty of positive ones. And it built on itself. Early advocates build material that I could draw from. Some of my articles then further amplified it. And then others drew from my content and built up on that. It takes a pretty strong snowball effect. Over time, the products themselves and those who are writing about and researching them can chip away at negative reputations and turn them positive, but it’s a long-term process. I advocate for Bitcoin self-custody for those who want it. People should be allowed to do so and should be educated on the benefits of doing so. Those with both larger amounts and a more self-reliant nature will generally gravitate more toward self-custody than those who are dabbling or who are happy to trust someone else and their government. Many people are more trustful of the system, have more money in retirement accounts, and so ETFs and MSTR are reasonable proxies for them to bet on the continued adoption of the network regardless of whether they want to hold it directly themselves. I think they’re certainly better than not having any exposure. I think it’s all of the above. The space has high volatility, which drives people out, and there are a ton of scams in the space. Things that take 100+ hours of study to understand and build a conviction in aren’t particularly viral. It requires an understanding of the technology and then also an understanding of money and the financial system. I think people underestimate the size of the network effects that the incumbents have. This isn’t like email replacing physical mail. This is a current system worth hundreds of trillions of dollars, with self-reinforcing network effects, and supported in its monopoly by all major governments, being chipped away at by a bottom-up industry worth a few trillion dollars. That kind of adoption takes a generation or two, not a decade. It took over 60 years to go from the Wright Flyer to the Concorde, and then aviation started to kind of flatline from there, with most of the improvements coming from the electronic elements rather than the aerospace elements. Bitcoin and the broader ecosystem are about 15 years in, and I think the overall adoption curve could take a similar amount of time due to the incumbent network effects they’re up against. So, I’d place the industry closer to the Wright Flyer than the Concorde. I think the Lightning Network is pretty different than Solana and Ethereum. In the broad space, we don’t see much medium-of-exchange usage outside of stablecoins. Stablecoins have been the killer app for that. The vast majority of the value in the Bitcoin and crypto space is in the store-of-value and trading/speculation/leveraging areas, with medium-of-exchange being important but smaller, except for stablecoins. For the next 5+ years, I continue to see a lot of this happening on stablecoins. There are now more ways to get stablecoins on the Lightning Network, so we’ll see what happens there. I’m reasonably optimistic about that. I don’t think there are any realistic scenarios where they are convinced to give them up. It just gets gradually taken from them over decades, if it happens at all. In developing countries, the dollar just keeps creeping in there from the bottom up. Local authorities do their best to use capital controls and other things to slow that process down, but they have inferior money and so their systems are inherently leaky. And stablecoins are a new avenue to keep getting in there. I think bitcoin, in the long arc of time, can pose a similar challenge to the dollar, euro, yuan, pound, yen, and other major currencies. If it grows 10x or 20x the size that it is now, becomes less volatile due to being widely held, it really starts to challenge the thesis of why anyone would own significant amounts of currencies or government bonds. People put less of their cash balance into them, only use them for brief working capital (higher velocity money), which reduces the government’s seigniorage over time. Ever since the dawn of the printing press and the telegraph, technology has generally led to the centralization of finance. We solved most frictions in finance via more layers of centralization. CBDCs are kind of the capstone on that idea. The final centralized forms of fiat currencies. So CBDCs are part of the information revolution, but I would place them at odds with bottom-up decentralized cypherpunk money. It’s not original, but I do think AI is going to change the way a lot of white-collar employees work over the next 5–10 years, including in the finance space. And I’d say there’s kind of two competing theses in the bitcoin/crypto space that are both partially right on different timeframes. The first thesis is de-financialization. Basically, when money is weak, we tend to financialize everything else. We turn property and large-cap stocks into default savings assets. If money becomes strong again because a global decentralized asset gains tens of trillions of dollars worth of market cap over time, it can de-financialize a lot of other areas. Rather than Chinese investors buying Vancouver property as a long-term savings asset, they could buy Bitcoin, for example. The hurdle rate gets harder when a really good money exists and is widely held, and so that can lead to the de-financialization of things that we have financialized out of necessity, like second or third homes or stock portfolios. The second competing thesis is more financialization. In other words, real-world asset tokenization. People can tokenize art, less liquid property, etc. More regions can get access to global financial markets. The overhead costs are lower. Stablecoins already did this for dollars; they basically compressed the overhead costs of offshore dollar accounts and thus made them available to the middle class. As these theses grow together, I think we’ll see a mix of both. The cost to securitize things will keep decreasing, but also the hurdle rate of why an investor would want to own a lot of these assets vs good money will get harder and harder. I think it’ll likely be double or more the size compared to what it is now and will become an increasingly political topic, both positively and negatively. Russia had a variety of high-quality, inexpensive companies, but they became uninvestable to citizens of many countries as a result of the war. This also brought a shadow on ownership of Chinese assets because an investor must consider the tail risk of asset seizure or other disruptions on those assets during their investment time horizon, in addition to their core fundamental nature. To start with diversification. Save in assets that are more scarce than fiat currencies, and educate yourself from there.

Stock markets opened higher on Tuesday as oil prices dipped, helping investors recover slightly after Monday's losing session. International crude prices fell 3%, with Brent down to $78.50 a barrel. US oil prices were also down 3% to $74.77 a barrel. Traders also appeared to shrug off the sluggishness in Chinese stocks. Though the country's soaring equities have recently stolen the spotlight, the rally stumbled on Tuesday after Beijing failed to announce fresh stimulus as many observers had been expecting. Instead, Wall Street is largely focused on earnings and upcoming inflation data, scheduled for release on Thursday. September's consumer price index has regained the spotlight as a factor that could determine whether the Federal Reserve can continue to cut interest rates this year after last month's jobs report was much stronger than expected. Economists project consumer inflation for September to come in at 2.3% year-over-year, down from 2.5% in August. However, any upside surprise could trigger stock volatility this week, as it could indicate the Fed may have to keep interest rates higher for longer, says Bank of America. Meanwhile, Tuesday marked the of the earnings season, kicking with PepsiCo. Shares in the beverage firm fell as the company cut its full-year guidance.

Title: Opinion: The children of Dublin 8 deserve better than the school numbers on offer

Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. LAST UPDATE | 18 hrs ago “I will need to apply to 10 schools purely because we aren’t in the catchment area for anywhere I’d send her so I need to be over-cautious.” THIS IS JUST one of the many testimonies from parents in Dublin 8, an inner city Dublin suburb that has been woefully neglected when it comes to secondary school provision. Half of the children in this area are without secondary school options. That means that by 2026 there will be 2,135 students from Dublin 8 commuting right across a packed, choked-with-traffic city every day. In a climate crisis. Despite there being five existing secondary schools in the area, the current provision does not reflect demographics. The latest census showed that the numbers in this country identifying as Roman Catholic are falling, yet there are no multi-denominational schools. We are a group of parents who set up the Educate D8 advocacy group in 2022, to tackle this issue head on. We realised that there have been decades of underinvestment in secondary schools here. Dublin 8 is a great location, it’s vibrant, multicultural and has a great community spirit, but when it comes to families, it has been treated as an afterthought by successive governments. Perhaps they viewed it as a transient population, one with few votes for the main parties. But that’s not the case anymore, Dublin 8 is changing. It has one of the fastest-growing youth populations in Ireland, with a 30% increase in children aged 10-19 from 2016 to 2022. As a group, our primary objective is to secure a much-needed, inclusive post-primary school for the children of the area. Last week’s Budget 2025 provided welcome increases in education funding for this country. There were many initiatives in the budget to be welcomed, and with an election in the offing, this government is keen to remind us just how much money there is sloshing around in those coffers. The debate around the €9 million funding for smartphone pouches has caught many headlines since. Whether you agree or not, it’s a sign that when the government prioritises issues like these, such as smartphone use and children’s mental health, they will tackle them with gusto and put their money where their mouths are. As parents of children with no secondary options, we are asking the government to do the same for us. Education Minister Norma Foley promised an education budget last week worth almost €12 billion, the highest ever amount. All we ask is that after being ignored for decades, we finally get our fair share of this with the provision of a new inclusive secondary school and much-needed upgrades to the existing schools in our area. There’s no question our capital city has had a tough time in recent years and there are many challenges facing Dublin now. There are issues around addiction, homelessness, neglect, traffic, the cost of living, antisocial behaviour and so on. Dublin dropped in the league of tables for liveable cities this year and there’s now an understanding that much needs to be done in relation to planning, transport and investment to help it grow into a truly liveable city, one that serves not only office workers and transient tourists but active, engaged, sustainable communities. Adequate provision of school places for families is a huge part of that. Advertisement Dublin 8 carries its own share of challenges, but it has the potential to play a huge role in supporting a new Dublin in the coming years. Inchicore, part of Dublin 8, was recently been voted by Time Out as one of the ‘coolest places to live’ so why is the government not backing the area with funding? The community of Dublin 8 is committed to living in the area, but the challenges facing families around school provision for their children are putting huge pressure on them. One Dublin 8 mother spoke to us, saying, “I grew up in the country and spent my entire childhood on a bus to school, hail rain or snow. Myself and my husband have lived in Dublin 8 for almost 20 years and are worn out paying a wildly high mortgage, like many other families in the area. That’s the price you pay for living in this city, but we told ourselves it would mean we could cycle to work and school and that it would bring opportunities for our children in relation to access to education”. “Now, it appears that the only feeder school from our primary is an Educate Together on the other city of the city, meaning our children would have to spend over an hour each way to school. This sends me into a rage, why is Dublin 8 such a neglected area and why are we working every hour of the day to live here to be left with no choice?” Another parent has just been through the process of applying for secondary schools and has had to settle for a school on the other side of the city, which is taking a huge toll on her 13-year-old daughter. More children travelling across the city adds to the already clogged Dublin commuter routes. Rolling News Rolling News “We applied for 14 different secondary schools for our child and attended multiple open evenings. As parents, we had an idea of the type of school our child needed and we also wanted specific subjects. We were on multiple waiting lists. We didn’t get an offer from two preferred schools closer to home and in the end, we picked the school we thought would best suit our child based on what we were offered. “However, it is an hour commute each day by multiple busses and more if one of the busses is delayed or cancelled (which happens regularly). We supplement by lifts where possible. My child attends an iPad school but their bag is extremely heavy regardless, which adds to the burden of the long commute. “The kids in the new school come from all parts of Dublin and there is no real sense of community so far. My child really misses their old friends and regularly asks why there wasn’t a local option for them all to go to. Becoming a teenager is stressful enough, why aren’t we making this transition smoother by keeping kids in their friendship groups in local secondary schools? One of the reasons we picked the new school was because it offered a particular subject however this option has now been cancelled due to teacher shortages.” Our group has had multiple interactions with the Department of Education and looks forward to meeting Education Minister Norma Foley this week to highlight the discrimination our children face and to plead our case for a new post primary school for the area. So far, the interactions with her department have highlighted what we feel is a lack of comprehension of how decades-old underinvestment has impacted the area. The department’s forward planning modelling system and responses to us assume that because children have traditionally been forced out of the area for secondary school, they are happy to continue to do so into the future. The group is meeting with Norma Foley this week. Rolling News Rolling News The assumption seems to be that we should be grateful and appreciative that there are options for us 30-60 minutes away, despite the fact that we are at the bottom of the pecking order for these options due to not living in the catchment area, and with no concern whatsoever for the physical and emotional impact long commutes or the breakup of communities and friendships has on our children.

It's inexcusable Chambers defends €9m phone pouch spend as opposition ask minister 'are you for real?' According to Dr JoAnne Mancini from Maynooth University, when planning where to build new schools, the Dept of Education considers a number of criteria. It looks at current and future population growth in an area. It looks at capacity in existing schools. It takes into account intake ratios — this is the ratio of children from primary school in a school planning area versus the number of children in secondary school. However, contrary to what you might expect, it actually gives preference to areas where MORE children attend secondary school in the area, than those that have huge gaps in secondary provision. For example, the intake ratio in Booterstown/Blackrock is the highest in the country at 305%. This means that there are three secondary school places in the area for every child that leaves primary school. In Dublin 8, the intake ratio is 55%, one of the lowest in the country, meaning that just over half of the children in the area continue to secondary school in the area. Even more incredulous is that the Dept of Education applies “a discount” to areas with a lot of fee paying schools. So, you can imagine our reaction in Dublin 8 when Blackrock was granted a new multi-denominational school ahead of us. Of course, we believe all children should have a choice and welcome this for the children in the area, but we struggle to understand how our area keeps getting ignored, while new schools pop up every year or two in the more affluent suburbs that are already well catered for with regard to secondary school provision. Harold’s Cross, Sandymount, Goatstown and Blackrock have all been provided with multi-denominational secondary schools in recent years. Dublin 2, 3, 5 and 8 are the only parts of the city left without fully inclusive secondary schools, despite these areas being the most diverse and having the greatest need. Recent census data shows that while 67% of Irish people identify as Catholic, this is much lower in Dublin’s Inner City, with fewer than one in four people across North, South West and South East inner city LEAs identifying as Catholic. In Dublin 8 only 38% of people are Catholic. Across Ireland as a whole, Norma Foley announced plans to increase the number of post-primary students now attending multi-denominational schools. Across Dublin, 42% of post-primary schools are now multi-denominational, reflecting the choice families wish to see. In Dublin 8, however, one of the least Catholic areas in the country, families do not have access to inclusive, multi-denominational secondary education and are forced to leave the area and wait at the bottom of a waiting list until a place becomes available in another catchment area. One Dublin 8 mum, Susie, said, “When I moved to this country I was shocked to learn that the majority of public schools are religiously affiliated. Having come from the US, where the separation of church and state – and secularism of schools – is enshrined in law, the Irish education system feels the wrong way around to me. “Having lived here for over 20 years now, I’ve learned that it’s not just me who feels this is outdated; the majority of my Irish friends and family, and my children’s classmates’ and friends’ parents would also like to see the system updated to reflect modern values. Most people I know want their children to be educated in an environment free from religious influence or affiliation. I’ve also learned that the ability to find that depends on where you live. Now that I live in Dublin 8, I understand we are at a huge disadvantage in terms of educational choice and, unless something changes soon, we like many others will have to travel outside of our local area when my children reach secondary level. Living in such a central part of the city, with its history, culture and community spirit, I find it astounding that Dublin 8 families are not supported to grow their community through their child’s school experience.” Louise Fitzpatrick is a spokesperson for the Educate D8 group.

Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk warns the U.S. could collapse under the weight of its $35 trillion debt pile, JPMorgan analysts have predicted a so-called "debasement trade" could fuel a bitcoin price boom going into the U.S. election—with Trump expected to add $7.5 trillion to U.S. debt.

"Rising geopolitical tensions and the coming U.S. election are likely to reinforce what some investors call the 'debasement trade' thus favoring both gold and bitcoin," JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients seen by Marketwatch. Gold and bitcoin could be boosted by "persistently high government deficits across major economies, to waning confidence in fiat currencies in certain emerging markets, and to a broader diversification away from the dollar," according to the analysts who said a Trump election win would likely reinforce the debasement trade. Trump is forecast to increase the federal debt by around twice the increase expected if Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris is elected, according to a report from the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Trump would raise federal debt by $7.5 trillion by 2035 if he retakes the White House next month while vice president Harris is estimated to increase the debt by $3.5 trillion over the same period. U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures. JPMorgan analysts later wrote the bitcoin price has "yet to see the ‘pop’ ... expected from lower rates since the Fed's September 18 cut," predicting in a note seen by The Block that the market may be waiting for more sustained stability before making a major move.

Despite Elon Musk's concerns about the out-of-control U.S. debt pile, Musk has doubled down on his endorsement of Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the first assassination attempt on Trump in July. Trump now leads Harris by six percentage points in the crypto-powered Polymarket's election contract, with 52% to 46%. Meanwhile, billionaire investor Mark Cuban has teased a plan floated by Trump to pay off U.S. national debt with bitcoin or crypto—and the Doge Department of Government Efficiency backed by Musk. "We don't know what Elon would actually do," Cuban said during an appearance on the All-In Podcast alongside fellow investors David Friedberg, Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis and David Sacks, responding to a question about how the U.S. could begin to tackle its huge debt pile. "Maybe [he'll] put doge in the Treasury, who knows, and that's how we make it all up," Cuban joked, referring to Elon Musk's on-again-off-again relationship with the meme-based bitcoin rival dogecoin. Earlier this year, Trump floated the possibility of using bitcoin to pay off the U.S.'s $35 trillion debt pile. " Crypto is a very interesting thing," Trump told Fox Business in August. "Maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion, hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion." One Community. Many Voices.

Title: One Of The Most Important Substances In The World Comes From An Area Of North Carolina Devastated By Hurricane Helene

October 8, 2024 By Michael Snyder Did you know that a little town in the mountains of North Carolina is the primary worldwide producer of a substance that makes our modern high tech way of life possible? Without the ultra-pure natural quartz that comes from Spruce Pine, North Carolina we would not have the ultra-sophisticated electronic gadgets that we enjoy so much and the global economy would collapse. So is it just a coincidence that Spruce Pine was absolutely devastated by Hurricane Helene? The two facilities that produce this ultra-pure natural quartz in Spruce Pine are both shut down at this point… Two North Carolina facilities that manufacture the high-purity quartz used for making semiconductors, solar panels and fiber-optic cables have been shut down by Hurricane Helene with no reopening date in sight. Sibelco and The Quartz Corp both shut down operations in the Appalachian town of Spruce Pine on Thursday ahead of the storm that swept away whole communities in the western part of the state and across the border in East Tennessee. The town is home to mines that produce some of the world’s highest quality quartz. Hopefully these facilities will be able to open again before the end of the year, because they are absolutely critical to the global economy. According to ABC News, it is estimated that somewhere between 70 percent and 90 percent of all crucibles that are used to make silicon chips worldwide are made out of natural quartz from Spruce Pine… “To make silicon chips, you need to first melt down a highly-purified material called polysilicon. That can only be done in crucibles that are themselves made of a material so pure it will not react chemically with the polysilicon and is also able to withstand enormous heat,” he said. “The best material for those crucibles is ultra-pure quartz. Spruce Pine is the source of the purest natural quartz ever found on Earth.” An estimated 70-90% of the crucibles used worldwide are made from Spruce Pine quartz, he said. Without this natural quartz from Spruce Pine, our way of life would change dramatically. The following comes from a Wired article entitled “The Ultra-Pure, Super-Secret Sand That Makes Your Phone Possible”… The wooded mountains surrounding it, though, are rich in all kinds of desirable rocks, some valued for their industrial uses, some for their pure prettiness. But it’s the mineral in Glover’s bag—snowy white grains, soft as powdered sugar—that is by far the most important these days. It’s quartz, but not just any quartz. Spruce Pine, it turns out, is the source of the purest natural quartz—a species of pristine sand—ever found on Earth. This ultra‑elite deposit of silicon dioxide particles plays a key role in manufacturing the silicon used to make computer chips. In fact, there’s an excellent chance the chip that makes your laptop or cell phone work was made using sand from this obscure Appalachian backwater. “It’s a billion‑dollar industry here,” Glover says with a hooting laugh. “Can’t tell by driving through here. You’d never know it.” This is a really big deal. If the facilities in Spruce Pine are offline for an extended period of time, the entire globe will feel it. Just consider what happened when a fire caused a quartz mine in Spruce Pine to shut down for a brief period of time in 2008… In 2008, a fire in Spruce Pine forced a local quartz mine to halt production, which “all but shut off the supply of high-purity quartz to the world market, sending shivers through the industry.” That fire impacted only one plant—the Unimin Corporation Quartz/Feldspar Plant, which has since been acquired by Sibelco—and its impacts were still felt industry wide. Today, demand for semiconductors is much higher than what it was in 2008 as they’re used to power newer technologies like artificial intelligence and 5G connectivity. Needless to say, what we are facing is far worse than the brief interruption that occurred in 2008. The mountains of North Carolina are also very important to the lithium industry. According to CBNC, a mining operation at Kings Mountain “could produce enough material to manufacture 1.2 million electric vehicles annually”… Kings Mountain could produce enough material to manufacture 1.2 million electric vehicles annually. The mine sits on one of the world’s richest deposits of spodumene ore, a source of lithium. There is currently only one operational lithium mine in the U.S. in Silver Peak, Nevada, which is owned by Albemarle. Albemarle does not have a precise date for when Kings Mountain will become operational, Norris said. The company is preparing to start the permitting process, which will take two years to complete. Construction will be a multiyear undertaking before the mine is operational, according to the company. Despite local opposition, Albemarle has been aggressively pushing forward with this project. And it turns out that Albemarle was recently given a 90 million dollar grant by the Biden administration… The Biden administration has made setting up a battery supply chain, supported by domestic lithium production and processing, a top priority to end dependence on China, which dominates the global market. Albemarle was awarded a $90 million grant from the Defense Department to support domestic mining, which the company is using to help reopen Kings Mountain. 90 million dollars is a lot of money. So there is a lot riding on the success of this project. Interestingly, BlackRock purchased more than 2 million shares of Albemarle less than 2 months ago… On August 31, 2024, BlackRock Inc., a prominent investment management firm, expanded its investment portfolio by acquiring an additional 2,220,059 shares of Albemarle Corp (NYSE:ALB). This transaction increased BlackRock’s total holdings in the company to 12,183,614 shares, reflecting a significant commitment to Albemarle, a key player in the lithium and chemicals industry. The shares were purchased at a price of $90.25 each, marking a strategic addition to BlackRock’s diverse investment portfolio. If you want to understand what is really going on out there, just follow the money. Meanwhile, vast numbers of deeply suffering local residents in the mountains of western North Carolina are still without clean water… Perhaps the greatest irony of Helene is the dire lack of potable water after the floods. The storm completely destroyed Asheville’s water supply system. Water mains and underground pipes were swept away as the ground itself was removed by the torrent. Not a single building in town can access running water, and citizens survive by the thousands of gallons of water being shipped in every day. “We need portable water … nobody can flush their toilets, nobody can take a shower, nobody can do laundry. We have no water and the infrastructure for that water is totally destroyed,” Dr. Carly Brown, a primary care physician in Asheville’s River Arts District, told The Epoch Times. “I haven’t had a shower since last Wednesday. I’m hearing horrible things about [others],” Wendy Feinberg, a 77-year-old retired schoolteacher in Asheville, told The Epoch Times. Many of the communities that have been destroyed by Hurricane Helene will never be rebuilt. We have never seen anything like this, and the federal response to this disaster has been extremely poor. But of course there seems to be plenty of money to send overseas. Just two days ago, Kamala Harris posted the following… The people of Lebanon are facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation. I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there. To that end, the United States will provide nearly $157 million in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon for essential needs such as food, shelter, water, protection, and sanitation to help those who have been displaced by the recent conflict. This additional support brings total U.S. assistance to Lebanon over the last year to over $385 million. How tone deaf can she possibly be? Enormous numbers of victims in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee are not getting the help that they need, but she wants to send 157 million dollars to Lebanon? Is she serious? Sadly, this is just the beginning of the chaos that is coming. More historic natural disasters are on the way, global war will intensify, and the upcoming election will cause a tremendous amount of turmoil. So I would encourage everyone to get prepared while they still can, because you never know when the next major crisis will strike.

Title: Bitcoin Is Here To Stay As Institutional Support Grows
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/08/bitcoin-is-here-to-stay-as-institutional-support-grows/

BlackRock Chairman and CEO Laurence Fink. Wednesday, March 26, 2014 in New York. (AP Photo/Mark ... [+] Lennihan) In the older, less polite trading floors of Wall Street there was an adage that may be paraphrased as money talks, male bovine excrement walks. When the buyside titans of the investment industry like Larry Fink from Blackrock get involved in something, then the money has spoken. Bitcoin Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are not going anywhere. On January 10th, there was a massive change in the institutional attitudes and legal categorization of Bitcoin when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs). The movement of Bitcoin into a traditional investment vehicle facilitates a potentially vast increase in the universe of bitcoin investors. Through the use of an ETF, an investor does not need to be concerned about how to actually purchase and store bitcoin, and instead can receive exposure to the bitcoin price movement through an instrument that trades in a standard equity brokerage account. The bitcoin ETFs were quickly sought out by institutional and retail investors alike. There are now 36 different ETFs traded on the U.S. markets, and total assets are now over $61 billion. Only gold ETFs have a larger total asset size than bitcoin ETFs. The stature of bitcoin ETFs was further enhanced on September 20, when the SEC approved the listing and trading of options for asset manager BlackRock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund on the Nasdaq. BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF has become one of the fastest-growing ETFs of all time, and now has almost $23 billion in assets. The BlackRock chief executive, Larry Fink, was previously a bitcoin critic, and in July 2024 he said he had been "wrong" about bitcoin and now believes bitcoin is "digital gold” and a "legitimate" financial instrument. Howard Lutnick (Photo by Rob Kim/Getty Images for The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund) Another supporter of bitcoin is Howard Lutnick, Chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald. In July he announced plans for his firm to launch a bitcoin financing business to provide leverage to investors who hold Bitcoin. He said, “We are excited to help unlock Bitcoin’s full potential and continue bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets.” When the leadership of firms of the stature of Blackrock and Cantor Fitzgerald get behind something, it is not going anywhere. The large financial institutions are driven by customer demand, which in turn generates revenues. These firms are likely responding to their customers and are reaping the financial benefits from being early institutional bitcoin supporters. The SEC approval of the ETFs also clarified the agency’s position regarding the proper characterization of bitcoin as a commodity. This clarity was welcomed by bitcoin proponents and will likely lead to further institutional support. Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), believed to be the world’s largest custodian bank, is approved to provide custody services for bitcoin ETFs and is expected to enter the market shortly. The bank is expected to also be servicing the second approved cryptocurrency ETF, ether. Perhaps the bank will even provide services for additional cryptocurrencies as the SEC chair Gary Gensler, in an interview with Bloomberg, suggested that the BNY crypto custody model could extend to numerous digital assets. Cautious and carefully other banks should be expected to support bitcoin as investor interest continues to grow. My own company, LevelField Financial, is seeking to acquire a chartered bank to, among other goals, serve customers who are interested in bitcoin and the digital asset class. Well managed financial institutions can safely and soundly support bitcoin while working within the framework of the U.S. banking system. Whether bitcoin is going to lead to a transformation of the global banking and payment industries is something still very uncertain. What is clear, however, is that bitcoin is part of a new digital asset class that is very much in demand by institutional and retail investors. Traditional banking and financial service companies have the opportunity to support bitcoin now, while adoption is still in the early stages, and to participate in wherever the path of adoption leads. The growth of bitcoin will result in changes, perhaps more of an evolution than a revolution, but it is not going away. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Round Treasury secures $2.1m in funding

Round Treasury, the all-in-one banking and treasury platform specifically designed to make life easier for founders and CFOs, today announces the closing of its $2.1 million pre-seed funding round. 08 October 2024 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. The investment round was led by Passion Capital (first investors in Monzo Bank, Tide Banking and GoCardless) with participation from Tiny VC, Ascension, Samos Investments and Entrepreneur First. The round also attracted support from prominent fintech figures, including Darren Westlake (founder of Crowdcube), Simon Taylor (11FS), Pranav Sood (GM of Airwallex), and former executives from Stripe and Starling. Several of Round's early customers also participated as angel investors, as a testament to the value of the company’s platform. The current status quo for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) managing their finances is bleak. Many SMBs are stuck between legacy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and basic Excel spreadsheets, leaving founders and CFOs struggling with cash management. Without a comprehensive treasury management solution, businesses struggle to optimise liquidity and maintain cash transparency. Additionally, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 was a wake-up call, pushing safeguarding and financial security of cash to the top of founders' priorities. Round CEO & Co-Founder Pac O'Shea's experience with fintech clients and as a previous Venture Partner revealed a crucial insight: existing financial tools were too rigid and complex for modern businesses. In response, Pac and his Co-Founder Hayyaan Ahmad, developed a solution to simplify cash management and protection. This new platform addresses the critical need for versatile, user-friendly financial management in the post-SVB world, where diversifying funds and ensuring accessibility is more crucial than ever for SMBs. Round was created to provide a platform where founders and CFOs could manage all their financial needs in one place. By consolidating banking, treasury, and cash management into one platform, Round allows founders and CFOs to manage their finances with minimal effort. At the heart of its offering is a treasury solution that helps startups extend their runway, grow their teams, by earning up to 5% yield with next-day liquidity through government security backed Blackrock money market funds. Round also offers a multibanking feature, which allows businesses to manage all their existing bank accounts in one place. Instead of switching between different banking apps, founders and CFOs can view a single, consolidated cash balance. Round also offers Vault Savings Accounts, which give businesses access to hundreds of savings accounts across UK banks, without needing to open individual accounts. This setup enhances FSCS protection, ensuring that deposits are spread across multiple banks and safeguarded against risk. Round plans to expand its team and continue refining its product to meet the evolving needs of founders and CFOs. The company is preparing to expand its services across Europe, bringing its simple, intuitive platform to more high-growth startups. Commenting on the investment, Pac O'Shea, CEO and Co-Founder of Round, said, "We kept seeing the same thing with high growth company founders—managing finances felt disjointed, with founders juggling too many platforms and tools just to keep track of their cash. Our mission is to make financial management easy, no matter how complex it seems. We're focused on building a product that founders and CFOs love because it saves them time, protects their funds, and helps them grow their businesses. Our goal is to make financial management as seamless as possible so founders can focus on building their businesses." Hayyaan Ahmad, Co-Founder, adds "A lot of founders don't realise how much cash they are leaving on the table by not following treasury best practices. We want to give founders and CFOs complete visibility and control without any of the hassle. Every feature is designed to be simple - whether it's automating withdrawals, or diversifying your cash across savings accounts. Managing your cash does not have to be a headache." “Round is doing for treasury management what Stripe and GoCardless did for payments—taking something complex and making it simple. Startups don’t need more complexity—they need clarity, control, and growth. Round delivers all of that in one platform. We’re excited to support their vision as they reshape the financial stack for the next generation of businesses and to ensure companies of all sizes have access to the best solutions and yield," said Eileen Burbidge, Partner at Passion Capital.

Title: China markets start like a lion and end like a lamb after Beijing stimulus comes up short

Shares in mainland China soared at the opening, as markets reopened after the Golden Week holidays. But they slid back as the stimulus plans provided by China’s economic planning agency seemed to underwhelm investors. China: Shanghai gives back huge early gains, and Hong Kong plunges Shanghai’s market opened up almost 10% but faded to close with a 4.59% gain, while Hong Kong shares gave up 9.41% after a period of torrid gains during the mainland China holidays. Beijing’s midmorning explanation of its stimulus plans—which offered few details and no new big measures—appeared to fall flat with investors. Japan: Nikkei slips with household spending data The Nikkei 225 slipped 1% as the yen gained slightly and household spending fell by 1.9%—the fastest rate since January, although less than expected by economists. Europe: Shares hit by Middle East worries and fading China optimism European stocks fell almost across the board Tuesday, as worries about Mideast tensions and fading China optimism took hold. Luxury goods took a special hit, with LVMH down almost 5%, Hermès off 3% and Gucci-owner Kering down more than 7%. The STOXX Europe 600 fell 0.85%, and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 1.27% in early trading. U.S. premarket flat after down day on Mideast and rate cut worries The three U.S. indexes were flat in premarket trading Tuesday, a day after all three fell as Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the summer and oil prices continued to climb amid Middle East tensions. Friday’s blockbuster jobs report had many investors questioning how slow the Federal Reserve will go with further rate cuts this year—or if it may even pause. And earnings season is here: PepsiCo kicks it off with its report today, followed by Delta Air Lines on Thursday, and JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock on Friday. CPI data for September will also be released before the bell on Thursday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Fidelity and BlackRock anchor substantial Bitcoin ETF inflows as Ethereum activity plateaus. On Oct. 4, Bitcoin ETFs recorded modest net inflows of $25.6 million. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF saw an inflow of $13.6 million, while Bitwise’s BITB ETF added $15.3 million. Ark’s ARKB ETF brought in $5.3 million, as did VanEck’s HODL ETF. However, these gains were partially offset by Grayscale’s GBTC, which saw outflows of $13.9 million. Other ETFs remained flat, including those from BlackRock, Invesco, Franklin, Valkyrie, and WisdomTree. By Oct.7, Bitcoin ETFs experienced a substantial influx of $235.2 million, marking a sharp rise in institutional activity. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF posted $103.7 million in inflows, while BlackRock’s IBIT ETF followed with $97.9 million. Bitwise’s BITB ETF and Ark’s ARKB ETF recorded inflows of $13.1 million and $12.6 million, respectively. Invesco’s BTCO ETF added $2.5 million, and VanEck’s HODL saw an additional $5.4 million. No outflows were reported across any of the major ETFs on this date. For Ethereum ETFs, Oct. 4 saw a total net inflow of $7.4 million. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF led with $14.7 million, while Grayscale’s ETHE experienced outflows of $8.2 million. Minor inflows of $0.9 million were recorded for Bitwise’s ETHW ETF, while other ETFs saw no significant activity. On Oct. 7, Ethereum ETFs saw no major inflows or outflows, and all products reported flat flows. Substantial inflows into Bitcoin ETFs on Oct. 7 indicate renewed confidence in the market, especially following a quieter session on Oct. 4. Ethereum ETFs, while positive on Oct. 4 due to BlackRock’s inflows, saw no further movement on Oct. 7, signaling a temporary pause in institutional interest in Ethereum.

Title: Wells Fargo stock upgraded by Wolfe Research on undervaluation and earnings potential
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/wells-fargo-stock-upgraded-by-wolfe-research-on-undervaluation-and-earnings-potential-93CH-3652482
Time Published: 2024-10-08T08:28:01Z
Full Content:
Tuesday, Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) stock received an upgrade from Wolfe Research, moving from a Peer Perform to an Outperform rating. The firm also set a new price target for the bank's shares at $65.00. The adjustment arrives amid expectations of challenges in the rate-sensitive financial sector, yet Wells Fargo's current valuation is seen as incorporating these risks adequately. Wells Fargo's stock is currently trading at less than 10 times Wolfe Research's estimated earnings per share (EPS) for 2026, which is more than a one-time turn discount compared to the target price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This discount is considered the most significant among the bank and broker stocks covered by Wolfe Research, excluding LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) Holdings Inc. The firm sees the potential for Wells Fargo's earnings to increase if the asset cap imposed by regulators is lifted, which could lead to approximately an 8% boost in EPS power. Recent developments suggest that Wells Fargo is progressing towards meeting regulatory requirements, as indicated by the submission of a third-party review to the Federal Reserve. Despite the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (OCC) enforcement actions raising concerns over delays in lifting the asset cap, Wolfe Research does not expect the cap to be removed until at least 2025. However, the firm believes that the potential benefits of the cap being lifted are not yet factored into consensus estimates or the bank's share price. Wells Fargo's journey toward regulatory compliance and the anticipated removal of the asset cap are seen as positive steps that could result in an increase in the bank's normalized EPS to over $6. The projection is based on the premise that the asset cap's removal will provide Wells Fargo with an opportunity to expand its assets and grow earnings accordingly. Wolfe Research's upgraded rating reflects a belief that the market has not fully appreciated this potential upside in the bank's stock valuation. In other recent news, investors are eagerly anticipating the upcoming corporate earnings season, with high expectations that the results will support the current high valuations of U.S. stocks. UBS equity strategists predict that S&P 500 earnings have risen by 4.7% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Major financial firms like JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo, and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) are scheduled to report earnings soon, providing crucial insights into the economy's health. In parallel, OpenAI has secured a $4 billion credit facility backed by a consortium of banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citi, and Wells Fargo. This significant financial resource will support the AI startup's continued growth and innovation in the artificial intelligence sector. Wells Fargo has maintained its Buy rating from BofA Securities, following reports that regulators may be nearing the end of their review regarding the potential lifting of the bank's six-year-old asset cap. Evercore ISI also maintained an Outperform rating on Wells Fargo shares, citing the bank's submission of a third-party review of its risk and control processes to the Federal Reserve as a positive step toward the potential lifting of the bank's asset cap. In the banking sector, U.S. bank stocks have shown an uptick following the Federal Reserve's decision to slash interest rates by 50 basis points. This rate cut is anticipated to lower deposit costs for banks and ease the financial burden on borrowers, potentially reducing the risk of loan defaults. These are the recent developments shaping the current state of the market and specific companies. Recent InvestingPro data aligns with Wolfe Research's optimistic outlook on Wells Fargo. The bank's P/E ratio of 11.62 and adjusted P/E ratio of 10.15 for the last twelve months support the notion that WFC is trading at an attractive valuation. This is further emphasized by a low PEG ratio of 0.57, suggesting the stock may be undervalued relative to its earnings growth potential. InvestingPro Tips highlight that management has been aggressively buying back shares, which could be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's future prospects. Additionally, Wells Fargo has maintained dividend payments for 54 consecutive years, demonstrating a strong commitment to shareholder returns. This is reflected in the current dividend yield of 2.8% and an impressive dividend growth of 33.33% over the last twelve months. The bank's financial health appears robust, with a revenue of $78.23 billion over the last twelve months and an operating income margin of 30.4%. These figures, coupled with the fact that analysts predict the company will be profitable this year, reinforce Wolfe Research's positive stance on Wells Fargo's earnings potential. For investors seeking more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips and insights. Currently, there are 8 more InvestingPro Tips available for Wells Fargo, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial position and market outlook.

Labour is racing to finalise the appointment of an investment minister ahead of Monday’s flagship conference in London, Sky News learns. City editor @MarkKleinmanSky Tuesday 8 October 2024 10:38, UK Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, will this week hold further talks with bank bosses amid industry anxiety that she will raise the tax burden on it at this month's budget. Sky News has learnt that Ms Reeves will meet the chief executives of Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest Group and Santander UK on Wednesday. It will be the latest in a series of discussions she has held with the sector since being named chancellor in the wake of Labour's election victory in July. Coming five days before the International Investment Summit and a fortnight before Ms Reeves's inaugural budget, the meeting will give bank bosses an opportunity to press their case for further investment in the economy and to challenge policies that they believe could jeopardise the government's growth agenda. Government insiders said they now anticipated that an investment minister would be appointed ahead of next Monday's summit in London, which will be attended by prominent global financiers including the BlackRock chief Larry Fink and Bruce Flatt, CEO of Brookfield. Three of the banks attending the talks with the chancellor – Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds – have also agreed to pay £175,000 to sponsor the summit.

Title: The Green Requiem, the triangular meetings, the Psychiko PASOK and the vote from Paris, the Americans and ELVO, and the big names at Spetsathlon

Greetings! So, yesterday, the “day after” PASOK’s first ballot, the atmosphere inside felt like Verdi’s “Requiem“. The general disappointment from the outcome isn’t just limited to Pavlos and Anna’s camps, but also to their 130,000 voters. While that’s significantly more than Androulakis’ 90,000 or Doukas’ 65,000, unfortunately, they ended up “split” in two and failed. And so, despite sharing a roughly common goal—the Geroulanos and Diamantopoulou voters’ vision of a serious PASOK that could stand up to the “spoiled government” playing alone, as they used to say—they ultimately canceled each other out. Who’s Voting for Whom?Now, as you can imagine, everyone will be talking to everyone for support, agreements, and generally political deals, because these people are politicians, and unfortunately, this is their main job (let’s not forget that). So, in the next few days, you’ll hear a lot about staff negotiations, backroom talks, promises for positions, vice presidencies, etc. But I seriously doubt that anything that will get agreed upon—if anything is agreed upon—will make much sense, because the four main players who competed in Sunday’s election each have a completely different mindset and political direction. As for their voters, especially those of the two who are out of the race (i.e., Geroulanos and Diamantopoulou), they’re more likely to vote for Mitsotakis than for Androulakis or Doukas. I’m told that today or tomorrow Geroulanos will meet with both Androulakis and Doukas, but he’ll make it clear that there’s no official directive. As for Anna, they say that Nikos promised her a vice-presidency or a role in drafting PASOK’s program (can you imagine the fun?), but, as I repeat, “you can’t take from someone who doesn’t have anything to give.” PASOK in Psychiko…I have a very illustrative example. At the PASOK polling station in Palaio Psychiko (A’ Square), a former PASOK minister (from the Andreas era) is patiently waiting in line to vote. The 65-year-old lady, thin, with short auburn hair, a member of PASOK’s electoral committee (looked like a supporter of Nikos, or maybe Haris), recognizes the former minister, approaches him, and starts ranting: “Look at what’s happening here, my minister. All the right-wingers came to vote and mess up our party, to get their own people elected (I assume she meant Anna). We should go to the next ND elections and get our own people elected too…”, the lady said, but of course, the minister looked at her a bit puzzled and politely avoided responding. Now, I’d have loved to tell her (if I were there), “my dear, if serious PASOK folks were relying on you, you’d have gotten Evangelos Meimarakis elected in 2016, and along with Pavlopoulos and Karamnlis, Tsipras would still be governing,” but, alas, I wasn’t there. Moral of the Story…So, don’t overthink it. The PASOK crowd is leaning towards Nikos A., who has a strong, organized party mechanism with an equally disciplined audience of 80,000-90,000 people who have firmly entrenched their position, and…Nikolas will keep winning. Lately, a new segment of PASOK-SYRIZA folks has also been drawn in, attracted by the scent of power, in this case, the Athens municipality. Androulakis has PASOK’s stamp of approval; he’s the president, and Doukas is the mayor trying to grab both seals. That’s why I think out of the 300,000 who showed up last time, almost half won’t return. At most, 200,000 will vote. M.M.Now that the champagne has run out at M.M. from the PASOK election results celebrations (so to speak), some are having second thoughts. “When you’ve got nothing to your left, it’s natural to look at what’s happening on your right,” says my source, adding, “Androulakis’ questions in Parliament will be a single column, while ours will make the front page because it’s a ‘sexier’ story.” And they’re right… Paris-KatrinisLet me wrap up with a hilarious tweet someone sent me from a troll named Koiniav, who posted the PASOK Paris election results. In the relevant chart, Katrinis is shown to have received exactly one vote. So, the troll says, “I want to meet the person living in Paris who went to the polling station on Sunday just to vote for Katrinis.” Me too! Will it Rain…National Bank Today?National Bank shares were credited to Greek investors yesterday, and today they can proceed with sales if they want. Usually, people sign up for more shares than they actually want, expecting that only a part of their demand will be met. In the case of the National Bank’s placement, Greek private investors received 76.8% of the shares they requested, so today’s session is expected to see some selling. However, reports indicate that some top foreign institutional investors, such as Wellington, Capital, RWC, Columbia Threadneedle, Blackrock, GIC, Robeco, Norges, Fidelity, and others, also took positions in the National Bank through this placement. Discussions with American Funds about ELVO – It’s been roughly three and a half years since February 12, 2021, when the ownership of the then-state-owned ELVO was transferred to the Israelis of PLASAN and SK Group, and minority shareholder A. Glynis for €3 million. That summer, the Hellenic Vehicle Industry (ELVO) got its second chance when it was passed to Thessaloniki businessman Ath. Kouimtzi. After acquiring ELVO, the Kouimtzi Group aims to showcase the potential of the Greek defense industry, and reports indicate that it plans to collaborate with an American fund to transform ELVO into a regional hub for factory maintenance and repair of U.S. Army vehicles in the Balkans and Southeast Europe. Next steps include restructuring facilities and modernizing production so that ELVO’s products can be internationally competitive. V. Lazarakou at FCA Today – Today, in London, the English supervisory authority FCA is holding its conference on international markets. The president of the Hellenic Capital Market Commission, V. Lazarakou, has been invited to participate in a discussion on the priorities of supervisory authorities alongside ESMA Chair V. Ross, FCA Executive Director S. Pritchard, CEO of Hong Kong’s regulatory authority J. Leung, and senior BIS executive G. Gelos. On the sidelines of the conference, V. Lazarakou will hold meetings on capital market issues. Entrepreneurs Who Stood Out at Spetsathlon – Despite some absences (with a few choosing to be involved in the PASOK race), last weekend’s Spetsathlon was a great success with high business participation. The one who impressed was Deputy Minister M. Themistocleous, who achieved an excellent time running 25 km and swimming 3 km. An “Iron Man” proved to be B. Haratsis of Beta Securities, who swam 1.5 km, ran 5 km, and took first place in the 60-64 age category. Deloitte’s CEO D. Koutsopoulos also stood out, running 25 km and finishing 11th in the 50-59 category. Alexandros Kikizas of Melissa ran 5 km, while L’Oreal’s CEO, Alessandra Delfini, proved to be a true dolphin, easily swimming the 3 km from Costa to Spetses beach. Aegean was represented by D. Gerogiannis, who ran 10 km. The “Spy” Auctions – Businessman Nikos Bogonikolos may have narrowly escaped the “clutches” of the FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies, as his case involving conspiracy charges against the U.S. and in favor of Russia ended well. However, it appears extremely difficult for him to evade the “clutches” of auctions here in Greece. The head of Aratos Technologies, who was arrested in May 2023 in Paris and later sent to the U.S., lost two of his company’s offices in Patras over the summer. On July 10, 2024, Cepal auctioned off two offices, 23 sq.m. and 55 sq.m., located on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the Kola Commercial Center, next to Georgiou Square in downtown Patras. The starting prices were €32,000 and €77,000, but the smaller office sold for €60,000 and the larger for €106,000. And there’s more to come… Cepal has scheduled another auction on April 23, 2025, for a second-floor apartment of N. Bogonikolos in Patras. The 87.11 sq.m. apartment, located on Maizonos Street, features three bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, a living-dining room, and balconies facing the eastern, northern, and southern uncovered areas. The starting bid is set at €129,000, but the property is burdened with liens, mortgages, and several seizures in favor of banks and the state. The moral of the story? You might escape a James Bond-style thriller, but your debts…never. Eurobank and the “Athenian Melathron” – Quietly last summer, Eurobank acquired one of the capital’s most historic buildings, the well-known “Athenian Melathron” at the intersection of Stadiou and Kolokotroni streets, for €52 million. The building belonged to the company ADEXA S.A., founded in 1937, which passed to the control of the Bamoutzali family from Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. After the sale, Philippos Karamanolis, General Manager of Central Operations and Functions of the Eurobank Group, took over as chairman and CEO of ADEXA. Eurobank is now absorbing ADEXA, and the merger plan has already been posted to the relevant authorities. All of ADEXA’s assets, including the iconic “Athenian Melathron” (formerly known as the Afentoulis Mansion), will be transferred to Eurobank, which plans to house a large portion of its administrative services there once the building’s renovation is complete. The location is clearly more prominent and spacious than the current Eurobank headquarters, which is somewhat “cramped.” Cenergy’s Capital Increase Begins Today – Cenergy kicks off its €200 million capital increase today, aiming to cover the order book by Thursday, as the process for Attica Bank’s capital increase begins on Friday. The new shares will be listed for trading on October 15. With this move, Cenergy not only strengthens its capital base but also increases the free float of its shares to 27.9%. Those who held shares until yesterday are eligible to participate in the capital increase. The 265 Shares of Karelia – The Karelia Tobacco Company is currently valued at just under €1 billion. It is a publicly traded company with healthy fundamentals, happy employees, good prospects, and a very strong cash reserve (hundreds of millions of euros). What it lacks, however, is free float (shares in open circulation) and agreement among its main shareholders on future strategic choices. On one side, you have Andreas (22%) and Stathis Karelias (21.2%), Victoria Karelia (7.149%), and the Karelia Foundation (7.149%). On the other side, there’s Ioanna Karelia (31.964%) and Asimina Spiropoulou (13.422%). Together, they control well over 90% of the company’s capital. As none of them are willing to reduce their stake, the stock barely moves on the exchange with minimal trading. Recently, however, there has been a slight increase in activity. Yesterday, for instance, 265 shares (!) changed hands at €350 per share, an unusually large(?) volume of trades. Sources indicate that both sides have engaged a specialized advisor to find a solution to improve the stock’s liquidity (as required by the new stock exchange regulations) without altering the existing shareholding balance. Yesterday’s activity seems to be tied to this effort… Markets Gone Mad – For the first time since August, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury exceeded 4%. Brent oil futures are flirting with $80 (the biggest weekly gain since January 2023). Stock markets are anticipating – have already priced in – the upcoming U.S. rate cut, but fear the ongoing military operations in the Middle East. The dollar is strengthening internationally as a “safe currency” despite massive public debt. Fifteen years ago, in 2009, the market capitalization of the U.S. stock market accounted for 30% of global stock market capitalization. Today, it’s close to 50%. The S&P 500 is recording the highest annual return since 1997. Tech stocks represent 32% of the S&P 500’s capitalization, just one percentage point below the Dot-Com bubble. If we include Communication Services stocks, the value of tech stocks accounts for 43% of the market, which is TWICE as much as the financial stocks bubble in 2007, just before the Lehman Brothers crisis erupted. How Rich Is the Top 1% of Americans? – As the U.S. heads into another election season, the debate over the notorious top 1% of Americans getting richer by the day, versus the 99% who – with varying income levels and subcategories – struggle to make ends meet in the wealthiest country on the planet, is heating up. The Federal Reserve (FED) has added some numbers to this discussion. According to the FED, the total net worth of the top 1% (those with wealth exceeding $11 million) increased by nearly $2 trillion, reaching a record high of $46.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2024. Obviously, not everyone else is poor. There’s a large middle class, and some people even own $10 million…which isn’t exactly peanuts. The conclusion, however, is that the wealth gap has widened significantly.

Title: Cryptoverse: Bored bitcoin seeks direction after big bang

By Medha Singh and Lisa Pauline Mattackal Bitcoin has been distinctly listless in the past three months after starting the year with a bang. The crypto leader has largely shuttled between $56,000 and $63,000 so far in the second half of the year - a contrast to the first six months when it jumped 45%, propelled by the launch of U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking its spot price. Market players are now eyeing possible new crypto catalysts heading into year-end and early 2025, beyond broader market-moving events such as shifts in U.S. interest rates and the American presidential election. Jake Ostrovskis, trader at UK-based crypto firm Wintermute, is anticipating the upcoming launch of options on BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s spot bitcoin ETF, a new product he believes could attract more U.S. retail money after its approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission last month. Because regulators view bitcoin as a commodity, though, such options may also need the green light from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees commodity derivatives, said Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining. "If successful ... (ETF options) could increase bitcoin's market sophistication and volatility, driving greater institutional and retail engagement," Yang added. It's been quite a run for crypto as the anticipation and approval of U.S. ETFs helped drive bitcoin activity globally. The total size of the cryptocurrency market has ballooned to $2.2 trillion as of Oct. 1 this year, from $8.3 billion at the start of 2023, according to CoinGecko data. "We've observed a significant increase in institutional on-boarding and trading activity," this year said Ostrovskis, adding there was a strong demand for platforms and services for digital assets that resemble traditional financial structures. Notoriously wild bitcoin's 90-day volatility has fallen to 42% this year from 67% in mid-2020, according to Deutsche Bank data. Market watchers cautioned that bitcoin still showed a strong correlation to other cryptocurrencies and was likely to be among the first assets dumped by investors retreating from uncertainty and risk; bitcoin slumped 5% on a new spike in hostilities in the Middle East last week, for example. BIGGEST CRYPTO COUNTRIES? Chainalysis' Global Adoption index, which tracks crypto use in 151 countries with measures including trading and payments, surpassed the 2021 crypto bull market between the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024. Crypto adoption is particularly strong in lower-income countries which often have less developed and accessible mainstream financial systems, the report showed. India took top spot, followed by Nigeria in Chainalysis' rankings, while seven of the other top 20 countries were Asian emerging markets including Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines. Crypto fans often point to uses in countries with high inflation and rapid currency depreciation - such as Turkey and Argentina - as evidence of digital money's real world use. Chainalysis also noted a significant increase in decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoin activity in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. "The value proposition for bitcoin and stablecoins in Latin America are intact," said Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of crypto loan provider Ledn. "Most of the emerging world wants to bank in dollars, but they don't necessarily trust their banks." The United States ranked fourth overall on the adoption ranking, while South Korea and China were 19th and 20th, respectively. In terms of crypto transaction volumes, the U.S. is the world's biggest market followed by India, according to Deutsche Bank.

Title: Analysis-US-based China ETFs get bumper influx, some investors optimistic tide is turning

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - Investors flooded U.S.-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that target Chinese markets with $5.2 billion in new assets in the past week when mainland China's financial markets were shut for a national holiday, and some asset managers are hopeful the optimism will be enduring. The influx came after an initial package of stimulus measures from Beijing that included interest rate cuts and changes to bank liquidity requirements was announced in late September, which culminated on Sept. 30 in the largest one-day rally that Chinese stocks have seen since 2008. Tuesday is the first working day in China after a run of holidays over the past week, and senior officials from China's top economic planning agency are expected to give information on steps to implement policies to promote economic growth. China's measures have driven some optimism that the support will sustain and extend the dramatic turnaround in investor sentiment. The $5.2 billion inflow for the week ended Oct. 4 compares to an average weekly outflow of $83 million to date in 2024, and an average weekly outflow of $27 million last year, according to data from Morningstar. "The market has been waiting for a credible commitment from China to get its economy going again," said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust, a Philadelphia-based boutique wealth management firm. "Now we need to see follow-through." Authorities also have announced plans to boost their investment in domestic ETFs. China's Securities Regulatory Commission announced plans in late September to rapidly approve new ETFs that would track China's "Star Market," a segment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange dedicated to technology companies, and direct more capital to ETFs based in mainland China, according to the Financial Times. "The China markets have been so oversold," said Jonathan Krane, founder and CEO of KraneShares. His firm's flagship ETF, KraneShares CSI China Internet, pulled in $1.39 billion in new assets last week alone, putting year-to-date flows back in the black, according to Morningstar. The $8.3 billion KraneShares ETF is just one of more than two dozen China-focused funds that posted double-digit one-week returns, gaining between 10% and 28% and outperforming the more than 3,000 other ETFs traded in the U.S. market last week, according to Paris-based data analytics firm TrackInsight. Krane believes the surge in share prices is just the start, as investors have low exposure to Chinese stocks after February's outsize nosedive by the benchmark CSI 300 Index, itself a reaction to growing fears about everything from a real estate slump, lackluster economic data, deflation and geopolitical events. "This is just a very small percentage of the world getting back in or saying I need to rethink China," Krane added. "This was just the early money." The vast majority of money in the past week has flowed into the biggest ETFs that offer broad exposure to a range of large-cap Chinese stocks. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s $7.99 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF saw inflows of $2.7 billion last week, according to Morningstar. "When you see moves that are so vast and violent, you see money flow into these (index-linked) products first," said Michael Barrer, head of ETF capital markets for asset management firm Matthews Asia. Still, assets in the $44.8 million Matthews China Active ETF have soared in the wake of net inflows of $11.7 million last week. For Chinese-focused ETFs to hang on to the new assets, Beijing will need to announce a package of detailed and high-impact reforms, said Jason Hsu, founder and CEO of Rayliant Global Advisors, an asset management firm. "The next bazooka that Beijing fires has to come in the shape of formalizing new stimulus proposals and adding a timeline," he said. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza said he saw the tide turning in investor sentiment. Roundhill launched Roundhill China Dragons ETF last week, focusing on nine of what Roundhill deems the largest, most innovative Chinese technology firms. It attracted net inflows of $35 million in its first two trading days, Mazza said. "We figured that at some point soon, the tide would turn and China once again would be investable," Mazza said.

Title: BlackRock Declares Bitcoin The New ‘Gold Alternative’ – Here’s Why

Time Published: 2024-10-08T02:00:49Z

BlackRock’s stance on cryptocurrencies—especially Bitcoin and Ethereum—has lately made headlines. While Ethereum is considered as a “technology bet,” the investment behemoth sees Bitcoin as a “gold alternative.” This point of view captures a major change in the way conventional finance is starting to welcome digital assets. The company’s findings show that people are becoming more and more sure that Bitcoin can protect against inflation, just like gold has in the past. BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer, Rick Rieder, recently said that Bitcoin is appealing to investors who want to protect their wealth in uncertain economic times because there is a limited quantity. Many investors who are growingly concerned about market volatility and inflation will find resonance in this mindset. For those looking for stability in the realm of finance, gold has traditionally been the preferred asset. BlackRock contends, though, that Bitcoin is filling in this function. As the company points out, Bitcoin’s limited supply and spread-out nature could make it a more interesting purchase than gold. Central banks around the world are printing money at rates that have never been seen before. This makes Bitcoin an even better way to save money. “More institutional investors entering the market will only speed up the acceptance of Bitcoin at an incredible rate,” says Rieder. With this new money coming in, demand will grow even faster, making Bitcoin even more of a digital gold standard. Additionally, BlackRock believes that with increased realization of worth and scarcity, the price of the blockchain will keep moving upwards. BlackRock considers Bitcoin a “risk-off” asset like gold. At a recent conference, BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick argued that Bitcoin might hedge against fiat currencies and government trust. Mitchnick said Bitcoin is a safe shelter for investors, especially during economic turmoil. As inflation, monetary devaluation, and banking crises develop, Bitcoin’s potential as a worldwide monetary alternative makes it important for financial security. Although Ethereum is seen via another perspective, Bitcoin attracts attention as a store of value. BlackRock sees Ethereum as a platform for innovation as much as a cryptocurrency. With its smart contract capability, developers may create decentralized apps (dApps), therefore transforming many sectors, including gaming and banking. Ethereum has great future potential. Ethereum demand may explode as more companies investigate blockchain technology. The analysts of BlackRock are positive about Ethereum’s future and indicate that its core technology might cause rapid increase in the coming years. With BlackRock continuing to invest in these types of cryptocurrencies, that spells massive influence for the financial market. The general financial market is responding in such a trend, with old-time investors now becoming conscious of the potential attached to such digital assets.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Global Crypto Fund Outflows Hit $147M—Here’s What’s Driving Investors Away
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/global-crypto-fund-outflows-hit-147m-heres/
Time Published: 2024-10-08T01:00:24Z

The latest report from CoinShares, a crypto asset manager, has revealed that digital asset investment products experienced a notable shift last week as $147 million in net outflows were recorded globally, ending a three-week streak of inflows. CoinShares revealed that this ended inflow streak isn’t ordinary, as it results from a notable trend in the macroeconomic space. According to CoinShares, the sudden outflow seen last week impacted major asset managers, including BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares, following nearly $2 billion in net inflows over the prior three weeks. The outflows were largely led by Bitcoin-based funds, which accounted for $159 million in net outflows. In contrast, short-Bitcoin investment products attracted $2.8 million in net inflows, indicating that some investors are betting on a further downward price movement for the asset. Ethereum-based products, on the other hand, which had just ended five weeks of outflows the previous week, resumed their negative trend, recording net outflows of $28.9 million. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, explained this was due to a “lackluster” investor interest in the asset. This indicates that while Ethereum had briefly stabilized in the eyes of investors, confidence in its performance has not been fully restored, resulting in continued outflows. Meanwhile, multi-asset investment products, which provide diversified exposure across a range of cryptocurrencies, went against the overall trend by attracting net inflows of $29.4 million. This marked the 16th consecutive week of positive flows for these products, with $431 million flowing into multi-asset funds since June. Butterfill noted that these products have gained popularity among investors who favor a diversified approach, representing roughly 10% of assets under management (AUM) at global crypto fund managers. Furthermore, regarding region, the largest negative flows were concentrated in funds based in the US, Germany, and Hong Kong, which lost $209 million, $8.3 million, and $7.3 million, respectively. However, these losses were partly offset by net inflows into products based in Canada and Switzerland, which saw inflows of $43 million and $34.9 million. Notably, the change in market sentiment, which resulted in millions of outflows, has been linked to stronger-than-expected economic data. James Butterfill, attributing the market reversal to this unexpected economic data, wrote in the report: Higher than expected economic data last week, reducing the probabilities for significant rate cuts are the likely reason for the weaker sentiment amongst investors. Butterfill added alongside these broader economic developments, noting: Trading volumes were up marginally by 15% to US$10 for the week in ETP investment products, while we have seen lower volumes in broader crypto markets.

Title: Hurricane Helene: A Case of State-Sponsored Murder

by Rhoda Wilson | Oct 7, 2024 | Headline News | 0 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Daily Exposé. Hurricane Helene which hit North Carolina on 25 September and was the second worst hurricane since Katrina, dumped 40 trillion gallons of water in a short amount of time, causing unprecedented flooding and mudslides, with the water having nowhere to go. The flooding has caused widespread devastation, with whole towns being washed away and over a million people still without power in North Carolina and South Carolina. Corporate media has been reporting a relatively low number of affected people, but the reality on the ground is much more severe. As one independent media report described it, the situation is “unprecedented” and “apocalyptic,” with many people experiencing flooding and devastation on a scale never seen before. Was Hurricane Helene caused by weather manipulation so the Government could grab the land from citizens? If so, why? As Dr. Peter and Ginger Breggin wrote: “Untold potential for riches are there for the taking in the mountains of Appalachia. The Americans living in the mountains are the only barrier. Murder always happens for a reason.” On Saturday, Truthstream Media published a report about Hurricane Helene. Thousands of people are missing in the flood-ridden areas of Western North Carolina and Eastern Tennessee, and it may take a while to determine the actual number of people alive or dead. Many people in the affected areas are currently without power, clean water, food, fuel, medicine, and other essential supplies. Many bridges are out, and people are stranded, with some areas only having one way in and one way out, making evacuation difficult. The situation is described as “apocalyptic,” with bodies floating down the river and people having witnessed neighbors dying, leaving many in shock and traumatized. There have been reports of children being found alone in the woods, with their parents nowhere to be found, suggesting that something may have happened to them. Many people are still trapped, and there is no coordinated central location for information on missing people, with citizens taking to social media to share pictures and information about their loved ones. Rescue missions are underway, but there have been reports of people being turned away from donating or volunteering, with some organizations only accepting approved donations. A civilian helicopter pilot was helping to rescue people stranded by the disaster but was threatened with arrest by authorities after landing to pick up an older couple who were waving for help. Many people in North Carolina have lost trust in relief organisations, believing they have been taken over by grifters and liars. Citizens are instead trying to help each other directly, only to be turned away or threatened with arrest by authorities. The federal response to the disaster has been appalling, with President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris not making any public statements for four days and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) not being present on the ground. And the Government’s response to the crisis has been slow. President Biden only approved a thousand soldiers on 2 October, days after the emergency declarations were made, even though the affected area is the size of Massachusetts. The initial emergency declarations only covered 11 counties, despite widespread devastation in up to 90 counties. Governor DeSantis of Florida is sending extra aid to North Carolina, while some people feel that their own governor is not doing enough. Today the Independent reported that Florida has been warned that a “once in a lifetime” storm is on its way and Floridians have been asked to brace for what could be the largest evacuation since Hurricane Irma in 2017. Naturally, questions are being asked as to what’s really happening. The United States government has been able to manipulate the weather since World War II, with the ability to control and even weaponize the weather since the 1960s to prove that the Government had the capability, in the 1970s, the US Congress introduced a bill to regulate weather manipulators, requiring registration and licensing for weather manipulation tools. And suspicions that the Government is attacking its own people for gain using weather warfare is not unfounded. After Hurricane Katrina destroyed New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, many people became rich as a result of the destruction, with 80% of the land in New Orleans being destroyed and purchased by property developers. Black residents of New Orleans were forced to leave their homes and land, which were then bought by casinos and property developers, with areas like Point Cadet in East Biloxi, Mississippi, being transformed into tourist destinations. Similar scenarios have played out in other areas, such as Maui Lahaina, where massive wildfires cleared the way for new resorts and tourist developments. Now residents of North Carolina are wondering if the US government had anything to do with the massive hurricane that just destroyed their state. In the video below, the hosts of Redacted, Clayton Morris and Natali Morris, discuss the history of weather manipulation in the United States, weather manipulation and land acquisition, weather warfare during the Cold War, and the recent Hurricane Helene and suspicions of it being the result of weather manipulation. Some believe that the government may be using this technology to control the weather and that the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene may be used as an excuse for the government to seize land and resources through eminent domain, the legal power of the Government to take private property for public use. One of the areas affected by Hurricane Helene is the world’s largest lithium deposit, which is set to be mined by a company that has entered into an agreement with the Department of Defence. By coincidence, BlackRock and Vanguard own the most shares in the lithium mine. The agreement is worth US$99 million and aims to have the mine up and running by 2030, but the area has been devastated by the hurricane, which may allow the government to use eminent domain to seize the land. If the video above is removed from YouTube, you can watch it on Rumble HERE. Appalachia: Murder Always Happens For A Reason “Something evil is going on in the North Carolina mountains” By Dr. Peter and Ginger Breggin (primary author Ginger Breggin) It is no less than mass murder. Reports of a complete absence of state or federal assistance in the devastated areas hit by Hurricane Helene are now crowding the social media airwaves. Bodies floating down the rivers. Bodies hanging in trees. Tangled in piles of debris. Utility company linemen are the first into most of the demolished areas. They report finding children as young as three wandering naked in the mud, crying for their parents, some with ropes dangling from where their parents lashed them in desperation to timber. The smell of death is everywhere. About 1 million souls lived in these Western North Carolina counties, with additional souls dying in the mountains of Eastern Tennessee. State and federal authorities have not been on site for the first week or so after the storm dropped like a bomb. There is no update on the number of dead and/or missing, and rescue of those who have survived other than local accounts. A report out of Asheville, the largest flooded-out community in North Carolina, says some FEMA workers have just arrived with porta potties for the local inundated hospital which is still without any electricity or any water. Volunteers, community members, and now some aid workers beginning to trickle in are bringing the dead to the privately owned Mission hospital in Asheville, which is now designated the place to bring bodies into the region. FEMA is quoted as saying they are too tied up at the border and won’t be sending refrigerator trucks for body storage. FEMA also was overheard saying “add a couple zeros” to whatever the body count is right now … One local report on X cites reports of over 900 bodies already at the hospital that haven’t been identified. A report out of Chimney Rock, NC said a “government official” has told residents at a town meeting that the federal government is seizing land, and the entire area will be bulldozed – bodies, still-standing buildings, and all. One local pastor was going door to door with water and found there were so many bodies that they changed their delivery request to body bags. “They are not picking up the bodies. They don’t wanna identify the bodies and they’re just leaving them to rot in the streets.” And “Something evil is going on in the NC mountains.” The disaster region needs pilots with planes, helicopters, people with big equipment, and trucks. The 82nd airborne is still not ordered to participate in the rescue, their Apache helicopters are on the ground waiting for Title 10, the emergency order that is required to activate the 82nd airborne. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) is AWOL (absent without leave). The few FEMA representatives trickling in a week after disaster struck are actively disrupting volunteer efforts. Emergency supplies are being taken from volunteers and locked up, FEMA directs survivors to use non-existent internet or telephones, and some state and federal officials are threatening volunteers and survivors with arrest. Federal relief is reported to be loans – and the contracts required to state if funds are not paid back on time all property may be seized. Unverified reports state North Carolina police have now issued a statement that they will start arresting any federal employees trying to stop or hinder rescue operations, have been debunked. Survivors of the hurricane and the floods are still without power more than a week after the storm and the rains – there is no date for restoration in sight. Food and water are running out or gone and small communities are still cut off. Dehydrated and starving people with no cell phones or other means of communication have been abandoned. A Brannon Howse media interview with the non-profit Aerial Recovery organization confirmed the federal government’s absence and further confirmed that they were told not to conduct search, rescue, and recovery work in both Lake Lure and Chimney Rock when they arrived with former special forces volunteers, equipment, chain saws. The volunteer rescue crew was stopped and ordered to leave by the local police. Elon Musk posted a video of the devastation filmed by some of his Space X engineers flying into North Carolina to deliver Starlink terminals and supplies. Musk said “My blood is boiling” because FEMA would not let the Musk company helicopter land to deliver the critical supplies. Columnist Leo Hohmann reminds us that this region of the US is Trump country: If your house is destroyed and you are literally trying to survive in an atmosphere with little or no food, water and shelter, and your cell service is out, will you be thinking about voting? What if you are fine but you haven’t heard from a family member since the storm hit? You are searching for them, wondering if you will find them dead or alive. Will you be thinking about voting? I don’t think so. So, we have to wonder if this is not only a humanitarian tragedy being left unattended by the federal government but whether it may also be a concentrated voter suppression effort. Most recently the Biden-Harris administration has announced the release of $750 per person in FEMA funds for hurricane victims. Colonel Douglas Macgregor exposed to Tucker Carlson that illegal immigrants coming over the border are being given $2,200 per month. FEMA has been transformed into emergency aid for illegal immigrants, paid for by US taxpayers. Infrastructure is another critical survival matter that is suddenly in short supply. In our last column, we documented the ILA (International Longshoremen’s Association) strike that started over the weekend. Docks across the Eastern Seaboard and the Gulf are closed. Steel, heavy equipment, building supplies, and replacement parts for everything from rescue equipment to heavy electrical transformers come in by boat. There is a massive shortage of transformers in the US, with wait times for replacements of up to five years. So those heavy transformers knocked out by the hurricane are not going to be replaced any time soon. North Carolina has over 360 substations out of commission in its Western region. As of 4 October, the striking ILA port workers are returning to work until mid-January after negotiations settled on a wages agreement. But the high voltage transformer shortage will not be remedied anytime soon. In January of 2024, the federal government transferred two high-voltage power transformers to Ukraine to “enhance the reliability of Ukraine’s Integrated Power System and ensure its maintenance during this and following winters.” This was done despite the shortage of that equipment to ensure US electrical grid reliability. Now we are without the backup supply of transformers needed to repair the grid in the damaged part of Western North Carolina. North Carolina lawmaker Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.) reported: The flooding provides a unique challenge not previously faced by substations in Western North Carolina …There is a high likelihood that the substations are not repairable, and replacement of the substation equipment will be necessary. Latitude Media, covering energy news, reported: Many substations [in Western NC] are reportedly completely flooded, leaving Duke Energy, the investor-owned utility that serves the region, unable to accurately assess the damage until the waters recede and the bulky equipment can be dried. Replacement, however, is a tall order. The disaster is coming in the midst of a shortage of electrical equipment, and especially of the transformers that substations use to switch power voltage from direct current to alternating current, or vice versa. As electricity demand across the US increases, so does demand for the equipment that renewable projects, electric vehicle chargers, and countless other things depend upon. And manufacturers are already at capacity – and expanding it further is made challenging by a tight labour market. Transformer prices have risen over 60% since 2020. The idea that some of the lightly populated regions of the heavily forested mountain region of North Carolina might not be rebuilt begins to make a diabolical kind of sense. The United States used to know how to do rescue. I wrote about traditional American rescue activities and contrasted them with the lack of assistance during the Maui/Lahaina “wildfire.” That signaled a blatant, unhidden disregard for the fundamental decency, traditions, and values of Western civilization: Americans Know What to Do When Disaster Strikes Americans know what to do when disasters hit. We have been doing rescue, survival, and restoration for as long as we have had communities, from the first small outposts dotting the East Coast to the spread and growth of towns and cities across this amazing land. We know how to “do” rescue. Many of us learned in our youth, during Scouts or other volunteer organisations. Many of us have served in the armed forces, as EMTs or police, or as a member of volunteer fire departments, or we have had training in CPR and first aid. My father was a member of the ski patrol in its infancy, in New York State. Now, most communities and certainly most regions have established Red Cross offices. Rescue begins when an alarm goes up. There is a fire, a tornado, a hurricane, a flood or some other disaster. People gather to help stem the damage, set up a central meeting place, start keeping a list of survivors (and those lost), gather supplies to sustain everyone, comfort the stricken and start the clean-up and the restoration. Temporary housing is arranged, care for children is established and the beginnings of a return to normalcy occur amidst the comforting of those who have been through the traumatic experience and loss of family, friends, community and home. This is not your Granddaddy’s rescue anymore. The burning question is why? “Never let a serious crisis go to waste” was known as Rahm’s rule. Rahm Emanual was chief of staff to President-elect Barack Obama when he issued that famous declaration. So, we ask what can be done with this massive disaster. We have touched upon the first action – condemn the lightly populated portions of North Carolina including the damaged electrical infrastructure meant to service the area. Suddenly the need for transformers is lessened. However, eliminating the need to replace key electrical grid infrastructure is only the beginning. There is so much more benefit to be gained by emptying these mountains of the American citizens who have lived and worked there. Some of the richest lithium sources in the world are located in Western North Carolina. Two lithium mines already exist in the mountainous region of Western North Carolina. Albemarle Kings Mountain is one mining operation and is touted as one of the world’s most advanced lithium material sites. They describe their mining as a lithium ecosystem: The Kings Mountain, North Carolina, site represents Albemarle’s mine-to-market strategy, encompassing all elements of the lithium ecosystem needed to power everything from consumer electronics and electric vehicles to life-saving medical devices … The Kings Mountain site has one of the world’s richest lithium depositions, representing an essential part of the global clean energy transformation. Albemarle Corporation has been working hard to resume open pit mining at the Kings Mountain site which has been idled since the early 1990s. The Department of Defence (“DoD”), entered into a $90 million agreement in September 2023. The funds are earmarked to help support “Albemarle’s planned re-opening of their Kings Mountain, N.C. lithium mine to increase domestic production of lithium for the nation’s battery supply chain.” BlackRock Inc. wants a bigger piece of the mine, too. The largest investment firm in the world, BlackRock, increased its ownership in Albermarle Corp by buying over 2 million shares on 31 August 2024, less than a month before Hurricane Helene hit the mountains. The coincidences just keep piling up. Piedmont Lithium’s North Carolina operation is located 30 miles west of Charlotte in Gaston County. Piedmont Lithium has interests in Tennessee, North Carolina, Ghana, and Canada but “industry headwinds are causing major changes at the startup company.” The term headwinds means in layperson, making company growth more difficult. The company had much higher and active value until mid-2023 when it ran into local opposition and was having trouble with expansion plans in Tennessee. But in August 2024, they scrapped their proposed processing facility in Etowah, Tennessee, and they will now be “incorporated into the company’s proposed Carolina Lithium project, covering a 1,548-acre tract in Gaston County.” The company declared “Carolina Lithium is one of only two significant projects in the US Based on published technical studies, we expect Carolina Lithium to be a low-cost producer … and a key contributor to US energy security.” Their mining permit was just finalized in May of 2024 after the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Energy, Mineral and Land Resources approved the permit application in April 2024. Hurricane Helene has arrived just in time to clear out the property owners local to the mining interests in Western North Carolina. Piedmont Lithium was heavily opposed in Gaston County by local residents and commissioners. But now it appears the opposition has been eliminated. Two quartz mines in Spruce Pine, NC produce “the world’s purest quartz, which formed in the area some 380 million years ago. The material is a key component in the global supply chain for semiconductor chips, which power everything from smartphones and cars to medical devices and solar panels.” According to the two companies, Siblelco and The Quartz Corp, that separately manage the two mines, they are making strides in getting their mines up and running again. The largest delay may be the specialized workers most of whom have been displaced by the storm and floods. Semiconductor manufacturers may run into extended delays until these two mines are up and running once again. CNN Business reports: “You’re building these incredibly complicated chips that have, in some cases, 100 billion transistors, 100 billion tiny little machines, on a chip that is the size of your thumbnail … One atom being out of place could mean a defect that breaks the chip,” said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani Centre for AI and Advanced Technologies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. And while quartz is abundant around the world, the kind of ultra-high-purity quartz mined in Spruce Pine is not. The Spruce Pine mines provide an estimated 80% to 90% of the world’s high-purity quartz – experts say the exact amount is proprietary and unknown – supplying semiconductor manufacturers like chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Other quartz sources in the US and around the world require purification processes that are time-consuming and far inferior to the special quartz found, so far, at these two mines in North Carolina. The mines are considered a national strategic asset. I have discovered another company in the same affected region – Land & Mineral Company – Gusher Knob which is currently developing joint venture and extraction partners to begin mining the Gusher Knob land tract containing another ultra-high purity quartz deposit. I expect their business will pick up rapidly now in the wake of property damage from Hurricane Helene. Asheville, NC is the largest town in the damaged reason and it has suffered grave damage too, as we’ve reported above. There have been plans going back over eight years to convert Asheville into a Smart City. Because of the damage including lack of electricity and water, the opportunity now presents itself to implement the smart city plans for Asheville. Because of its size, Asheville may survive and become the regional hub for the future plans of Western North Carolina. The Federal government can seize land. The power of eminent domain, explained as the seizure of private property for public use, has been exercised for a variety of reasons over the decades. Expanding rail and roadways, creating parks and many other reasons have been used to seize land. There is a legal requirement that the landowner be compensated “fairly.” The technique of condemnation cases was acknowledged by the Supreme Court and has been used to appropriate property for public uses from the establishment of a post office to the building of a railroad. The ‘History of the Federal Use of Eminent Domain’ describes the legal issues and development of this federal law. Rock Creek Park, running through Washington DC and into Maryland, was developed using eminent domain. I have touched on the growing demand and national security significance for globally scarce lithium and precious quartz, both of which have traditionally been mined in this region. But there is an even greater value, at least to the federal government over time, in this great swath of the Appalachians to those who wish to embrace globalist values enshrined in the United Nations 2030 and 2050 Goals. I do not embrace globalism, as it has demonstrated an utter disregard for individual sovereignty, freedoms, Constitutional values and basic American rights. But the Biden/Harris US administration has completely embraced globalism, doing all that it can to increase the US globalist transformation. The UN has established a Global Biodiversity Framework that calls for a 2050 goal of all ecosystem integrity being advanced, with “an increase of at least 15% in the area, connectivity and integrity of natural ecosystems, supporting healthy and resilient populations of all species …” In layman’s language, this means people are no more important than “all” species and non-humans, i.e. natural ecosystems need to be expanded. In other words, remove the human influence on the region. The International Institute for Sustainability (“IIS”) is “a Brazilian private non-profit organization whose mission is to develop transformative solutions for a sustainable world, based on Science [sic] and other forms of knowledge.” The IIS partners with the UN and other international biodiversity organizations and has organized the Nature Map Explorer that identifies and maps a huge quantity of information about terrestrial habitats, human impact, species richness, biomass carbon density, and more, along with the areas of global significance for conservation. One of the richest areas of “global significance for conservation” in the US is the exact region of Western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee that has been devastated by Hurricane Helene. It appears from rumors coming out of Chimney Rock and surrounding areas that a condemnation seizure is ongoing. Brutal, illegal, immoral and downright evil in the abandonment of the local citizens – but I have also seen this in Lahaina on Maui before and there is a long history of eminent domain. The lands in Western North Carolina already have several state and federal parks and forest lands, and if many of the communities are now abandoned or condemned, nature could be encouraged to regenerate in the region, just as is hypothesized in government and academic papers. If the mountain area is returned to the wild and becomes unpopulated by humans, the future owners of the land – federal or state governments and their agents – will have reclaimed a natural forest wilderness that becomes a powerful carbon sink, which absorbs more carbon than it produces. Owners of carbon sinks can become part of the formal carbon exchange which allows companies that produce a lot of carbon (say in their manufacturing business or their operation) to buy credits offsetting their excess carbon. The forest terrain itself becomes a kind of commodity exchangeable for money. For example, a reforestation project that involves planting trees to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere can produce carbon credits based on the amount of carbon that the trees sequester over time. Once a third party verifies these projects, the resulting carbon credits can then be sold to individuals or companies seeking to offset their emissions. I expect a few specialized, high-value mines will be able to co-exist in such an environment. The State of North Carolina, the US federal government, the mining industries, the future carbon credit investors, academics, and environmental non-profits will be able to profit from the damage done by the historic hurricane Helene. In a forthcoming column, I will be examining the weather conditions and control that steered this massive, once-in-a-thousand-year storm directly to the Appalachians. For the rest of us, the citizens, the regular folks. There are just too many of us, and depopulation is underway. But we refuse to give up on the plans of the global predators. We urge citizens everywhere to work with their local counties, their municipalities, their counties, and their states to preserve individual liberties, freedoms, and property rights. Work with your federal Congressmen and Senators also but focus especially on all your local representatives. May God protect us all against the diabolical carelessness and cruelty of our captured governments.

Title: One Of The Most Important Substances In The World Comes From An Area Of North Carolina Devastated By Hurricane Helene

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Did you know that a little town in the mountains of North Carolina is the primary worldwide producer of a substance that makes our modern high tech way of life possible? Without the ultra-pure natural quartz that comes from Spruce Pine, North Carolina we would not have the ultra-sophisticated electronic gadgets that we enjoy so much and the global economy would collapse. So is it just a coincidence that Spruce Pine was absolutely devastated by Hurricane Helene? The two facilities that produce this ultra-pure natural quartz in Spruce Pine are both shut down at this point… Two North Carolina facilities that manufacture the high-purity quartz used for making semiconductors, solar panels and fiber-optic cables have been shut down by Hurricane Helene with no reopening date in sight. Sibelco and The Quartz Corp both shut down operations in the Appalachian town of Spruce Pine on Thursday ahead of the storm that swept away whole communities in the western part of the state and across the border in East Tennessee. The town is home to mines that produce some of the world’s highest quality quartz. Hopefully these facilities will be able to open again before the end of the year, because they are absolutely critical to the global economy. According to ABC News, it is estimated that somewhere between 70 percent and 90 percent of all crucibles that are used to make silicon chips worldwide are made out of natural quartz from Spruce Pine… “To make silicon chips, you need to first melt down a highly-purified material called polysilicon. That can only be done in crucibles that are themselves made of a material so pure it will not react chemically with the polysilicon and is also able to withstand enormous heat,” he said. “The best material for those crucibles is ultra-pure quartz. Spruce Pine is the source of the purest natural quartz ever found on Earth.” An estimated 70-90% of the crucibles used worldwide are made from Spruce Pine quartz, he said. Without this natural quartz from Spruce Pine, our way of life would change dramatically. The following comes from a Wired article entitled “The Ultra-Pure, Super-Secret Sand That Makes Your Phone Possible”… The wooded mountains surrounding it, though, are rich in all kinds of desirable rocks, some valued for their industrial uses, some for their pure prettiness. But it’s the mineral in Glover’s bag—snowy white grains, soft as powdered sugar—that is by far the most important these days. It’s quartz, but not just any quartz. Spruce Pine, it turns out, is the source of the purest natural quartz—a species of pristine sand—ever found on Earth. This ultra‑elite deposit of silicon dioxide particles plays a key role in manufacturing the silicon used to make computer chips. In fact, there’s an excellent chance the chip that makes your laptop or cell phone work was made using sand from this obscure Appalachian backwater. “It’s a billion‑dollar industry here,” Glover says with a hooting laugh. “Can’t tell by driving through here. You’d never know it.” This is a really big deal. If the facilities in Spruce Pine are offline for an extended period of time, the entire globe will feel it. Just consider what happened when a fire caused a quartz mine in Spruce Pine to shut down for a brief period of time in 2008… In 2008, a fire in Spruce Pine forced a local quartz mine to halt production, which “all but shut off the supply of high-purity quartz to the world market, sending shivers through the industry.” That fire impacted only one plant—the Unimin Corporation Quartz/Feldspar Plant, which has since been acquired by Sibelco—and its impacts were still felt industry wide. Today, demand for semiconductors is much higher than what it was in 2008 as they’re used to power newer technologies like artificial intelligence and 5G connectivity. Needless to say, what we are facing is far worse than the brief interruption that occurred in 2008. The mountains of North Carolina are also very important to the lithium industry. According to CBNC, a mining operation at Kings Mountain “could produce enough material to manufacture 1.2 million electric vehicles annually”… Kings Mountain could produce enough material to manufacture 1.2 million electric vehicles annually. The mine sits on one of the world’s richest deposits of spodumene ore, a source of lithium. There is currently only one operational lithium mine in the U.S. in Silver Peak, Nevada, which is owned by Albemarle. Albemarle does not have a precise date for when Kings Mountain will become operational, Norris said. The company is preparing to start the permitting process, which will take two years to complete. Construction will be a multiyear undertaking before the mine is operational, according to the company. Despite local opposition, Albemarle has been aggressively pushing forward with this project. And it turns out that Albemarle was recently given a 90 million dollar grant by the Biden administration… The Biden administration has made setting up a battery supply chain, supported by domestic lithium production and processing, a top priority to end dependence on China, which dominates the global market. Albemarle was awarded a $90 million grant from the Defense Department to support domestic mining, which the company is using to help reopen Kings Mountain. 90 million dollars is a lot of money. So there is a lot riding on the success of this project. Interestingly, BlackRock purchased more than 2 million shares of Albemarle less than 2 months ago… On August 31, 2024, BlackRock Inc., a prominent investment management firm, expanded its investment portfolio by acquiring an additional 2,220,059 shares of Albemarle Corp (NYSE:ALB). This transaction increased BlackRock’s total holdings in the company to 12,183,614 shares, reflecting a significant commitment to Albemarle, a key player in the lithium and chemicals industry. The shares were purchased at a price of $90.25 each, marking a strategic addition to BlackRock’s diverse investment portfolio. If you want to understand what is really going on out there, just follow the money. Meanwhile, vast numbers of deeply suffering local residents in the mountains of western North Carolina are still without clean water… Perhaps the greatest irony of Helene is the dire lack of potable water after the floods. The storm completely destroyed Asheville’s water supply system. Water mains and underground pipes were swept away as the ground itself was removed by the torrent. Not a single building in town can access running water, and citizens survive by the thousands of gallons of water being shipped in every day. “We need portable water … nobody can flush their toilets, nobody can take a shower, nobody can do laundry. We have no water and the infrastructure for that water is totally destroyed,” Dr. Carly Brown, a primary care physician in Asheville’s River Arts District, told The Epoch Times. “I haven’t had a shower since last Wednesday. I’m hearing horrible things about [others],” Wendy Feinberg, a 77-year-old retired schoolteacher in Asheville, told The Epoch Times. Many of the communities that have been destroyed by Hurricane Helene will never be rebuilt. We have never seen anything like this, and the federal response to this disaster has been extremely poor. But of course there seems to be plenty of money to send overseas. Just two days ago, Kamala Harris posted the following… The people of Lebanon are facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation. I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there. To that end, the United States will provide nearly $157 million in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon for essential needs such as food, shelter, water, protection, and sanitation to help those who have been displaced by the recent conflict. This additional support brings total U.S. assistance to Lebanon over the last year to over $385 million. How tone deaf can she possibly be? Enormous numbers of victims in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee are not getting the help that they need, but she wants to send 157 million dollars to Lebanon? Is she serious? Sadly, this is just the beginning of the chaos that is coming. More historic natural disasters are on the way, global war will intensify, and the upcoming election will cause a tremendous amount of turmoil. So I would encourage everyone to get prepared while they still can, because you never know when the next major crisis will strike.

Title: Bitcoin News: Fewer And Fewer People Willing To Sell BTC

Bitcoin is a deflationary asset with a fixed supply, unlike Ethereum, whose supply increases or decreases yearly depending on network use. There will be only 21 million BTC in circulation, and a decent portion, exceeding 4 million, is irrecoverable. Now, recent data shows that fewer and fewer people are willing to part with their BTC. According to on-chain data from the Bitcoin long—and short-term holder supply cycles, less than 10% of holders were eager to sell as of October 2024. This percentage is much lower than the 26% of around mid-2021 and the 64% in 2013. Interestingly, this trend shows that long-term holders, those who bought their coins over six months ago, and short-term holders, or those who bought their BTC in less than 155 days, are willing to let go of their coins. This position is even though Bitcoin, like any other crypto asset, is volatile, posting sharp price gains or dumps over time. To put this position in perspective, Bitcoin is down 15% from its all-time high of March 2024. However, it is also up nearly 150% year-to-date after rising from around $27,000 in October 2023. 2022 Bitcoin prices plunged to below $16,000 after soaring to nearly $70,000 in November 2021. The cyclic nature of Bitcoin isn’t, looking at hard data, dissuading traders who sell whenever prices dump, for example. This shift in trend over the years shows that more holders are positive about the coin’s long-term potential and even as a store of value. There could be multiple factors behind this trend, but among the top is the engagement from institutions, especially after approving the first spot of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States early this year. According to Soso Value, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers in the United States manage over $57 billion of BTC. BlackRock controls more than $21.5 billion of user assets, while Grayscale, which is unwinding its GBTC, has seen over $20 billion in outflows since the launch of the derivative product in January. Meanwhile, Adam Buck, the CEO of Blockstream, observes that there are no options–both call and put–that are longer than a year. The CEO adds that this is because most options traders are unwilling to sell their calls since, if they do, most of them will be bought in a flash. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

This week’s Future of Work Summit examines the fallout from Amazon’a RTO push, the challenges of leading through disaster and a conversation about AI and work with Handshake’s Valerie Capers Workman. This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday! Biltmore Village in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene on September 29, 2024 in Asheville, North Carolina. (Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images) October is here, and the sprint to the end of the year is fraught with distractions, disasters and disengagement that will be challenging for anyone managing workplaces and teams. A tight, polarizing election has workers unsettled and anxious—and could drive more conflict in the office. An escalating crisis in the Middle East brings increasing tensions over geopolitical issues, uncertainty about planning ahead and more concerns for employees with family in the region. Add the devastation of a massive hurricane across the Southeast, and it’s been an unparalleled season of disruption for many leaders and workplaces. Hurricane Helene has disrupted operations at a quartz mine in western North Carolina, washing out roads and cutting power to an area critical to semiconductor manufacturing. Some employers across the region are working hard to help workers struggling without power, water or even homes—while others in Tennessee face inquiries from the state Bureau of Investigation over allegations that they ignored warnings about Helene and required employees to report to work, leading to deaths and missing workers. Asheville, which had prospered with an influx of remote workers, entrepreneurs and new business owners, now faces an unprecedented challenge to rebuild. Amid all the chaos is the human cost—and a humanitarian crisis. Disaster relief is inherently hard to execute well, and the people leading it will need support. If you want to help, my colleague Kelly Phillips Erb has a rundown over what you need to know about tax deductible donations and where to donate. Read on for more in today’s newsletter about how Amazon’s RTO push remains in the headlines, Friday’s blockbuster jobs report and an interview with Handshake’s chief talent engagement officer about AI and jobs. September job growth shattered economists’ predictions, as U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs last month, according to nonfarm payrolls data released Friday by the Labor Department. It was the biggest month for jobs growth since March, sprinting past average economist estimates of 150,000 and prompting the unemployment rate to dip to 4.1%, compared to projections of 4.2%, where it stood in August. Investors cheered the news with big stock gains Friday. Striking dockworkers and port employers reached a tentative agreement Thursday, ending a strike that began earlier in the week and lifting concerns over the potential impact to the U.S. economy. The tentative agreement includes a 62% wage increase over six years, according to the Wall Street Journal, and will temporarily relieve Democrats fearful of the strike’s impact on the November election. The big issue still up for negotiation? Automation, as workers remain concerned about the potential for layoffs and fewer jobs for humans in the future. The fallout over Amazon’s decision to require full-time office work has remained in the headlines even several weeks after the tech giant made the announcement. Dell has since mandated that salespeople come back to the office five days a week, while McKinsey is also reportedly asking staff to be onsite more often. Will the trend continue? Contributor Ann Kowal Smith sees Amazon’s move as the “canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem,” noting “the relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration.” Meanwhile, contributor Ryan Anderson suggests the continued disappointment leaders feel in one-size-fits-all hybrid policies could mean a different approach would be better for workplace flexibility. The most sweeping attempt so far to regulate artificial intelligence, a California bill that could have set a precedent for other laws, was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom last week. “I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public,” Newsom said, according to the New York Times. If the California bill had been signed into law, writes Forbes contributor Owen Tedford, it would have predominantly focused on improving AI safety, with businesses that create large AI models required to perform safety tests and publicly disclose how they’d prevent the models from being manipulated. Tedford examines what could come next, suggesting the bill could be changed and reintroduced in future sessions. Handshake Chief Talent and Engagement Officer Valerie Capers Workman. Forbes caught up with Valerie Capers Workman, chief talent engagement officer at student careers platform Handshake, about how AI is shifting jobs as we know them, a recent book she published and addressing the gender divide in AI. Excerpts from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity. How is AI changing jobs? I'm going to use my son as an example. He entered school in 2018-2019, he was going to be a data scientist. Data science was the career: You’re going to get a job the second you hit junior year, you're going to be flooded with internships and you're going to be employed. Enter A.I. The ability of A.I. to take on so much of the preliminary data science work [means] you need to be a masters or PhD in data science to skip over what A.I. can do. [He realized] 'I need to go back to school.' He is now applying to universities for artificial intelligence master's degrees. He loves having the skill set, but A.I. enables more companies to do what he was doing. What message did you want to share in your book? The most important concept that I was raising is that the requirement to be superhuman; the requirements of EQ are more important in the age of AI than all the pundits are saying. My point is, yes, you can get an entry level job, but you're not moving up without the EQ, without the combination of AI plus liberal arts skills, the critical thinking skills, you’re going to stay right there. The ability to move and progress in your career? You're going to have to do both. [“AI skills”] are the ability to ask great questions and understand whether or not you've got a great answer and then utilize that answer to do the work you’re doing. The ability to ask great questions? That requires critical thinking skills, language skills, reading comprehension skills, historical context, ethical understanding and understanding of biases. Generative AI is what is going to differentiate the general workforce from the executive workforce track, if you will. I think it was a COO from BlackRock who said [they want] to hire finance or tech employees who have liberal arts or history majors? That’s what I’m talking about. If you're hiring, how do you assess that AI skill? If I'm interviewing someone on my team, I'd ask them: ‘I have this issue. Give me an AI prompt that will help me. Give me a prompt that you would use to help me finish this project for me in five days.’ Are you pulling on the right threads to understand what types of questions you need to ask? If I find someone who knows how to frame a question, I can train you how to do that better. I can’t train you how to think. Do companies have a responsibility to retrain their people who work in fields where jobs will be replaced, such as customer service? That's a great societal question. What is the responsibility of the employer to reskill its current workforce if a set of roles can now be done by AI? I like to put it this way: The companies that understand how to repurpose their workforce for the higher order skills that need to be done by humans—that can't be done by A.I.—are the companies that are going to win. We’re hearing more about how women are not developing the AI skills at the same pace and could get left behind. What can be done to help with this? In higher education, they need to have required courses, period. Just required. It cannot be optional because women are not taking the AI courses at the same rate as their male counterparts. It can't be optional. … The societal issues that caused them to run away from a phrase like prompt engineering go all the way back to when they were in third grade. So, required courses.

Title: Bitcoin: 3 key narratives that could influence BTC prices this week

Rising volumes and price gains suggest traders could be buying into several narratives that could drive prices. Bitcoin [BTC] has traded rangebound between $60,000 and $64,500 in the last seven days. The choppy price movements with no clear trend show a state of market uncertainty. However, BTC could be headed for a volatile week ahead as trading volumes had jumped by 55% at press time per CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin has also gained by 2.5% in 24 hours to trade at $63,435. The rising volumes and price gains suggest that traders could be buying into several narratives that could drive prices this week. The US Federal Reserve is set to release its minutes for the September monetary policy meeting on 9th October. Last month, the Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates for the first time since 2020. The September minutes could shed light on possible rate cuts during the November and December meetings. September’s 50-basis point reduction played a role in driving BTC prices last month. Data from the CME FedWatch Tool shows that 97% of investors anticipate that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in November. Source: CME FedWatch Tool A further reduction in interest rates will stir interest in risk assets like Bitcoin. Therefore, if the Fed minutes show a more dovish stance, it could spur BTC gains. The US inflation data for September is set for release on 10th October. Markets anticipate that the annual inflation rate will come in at 2.3%, a drop from 2.5% reported in August. Additionally, the Core Inflation Rate year-on-year is expected to cool down to 3.1%, a drop from the 3.2% reported in August. The Producer Price Index (PPI), which is also used to predict inflation will be released on 11th October. Economists forecast that the year-on-year PPI data will drop from 1.7% to 1.3%. If the inflation data comes in as expected or falls below expectations, it could drive gains for Bitcoin. On the other hand, if this data comes in hotter than expected, it could lead to Bitcoin’s volatility and cause a drop in prices. $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock, which is one of the issuers of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), will release its quarterly results this week. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holds 367,000 BTC valued at $22 billion. Therefore, the strength of its Q3 earnings could influence prices. JPMorgan will also release its Q3 results later this week, after which it will make 13-F filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealing its exposure to Bitcoin ETFs. In Q2, JPMorgan’s 13-F filing revealed it held $760,000 worth of Bitcoin ETF shares. Given that it is the largest US bank, a change in its Bitcoin ETF holdings could drive volatility. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2024–2025 These three narratives are already driving activity in the Bitcoin futures market. BTC’s open interest has increased to the second-highest level this month to $34 million at press time per Coinglass. This increase shows there are more traders opening positions and participating in the market.

AN ELECTED REPRESENTATIVE of Kildare County Council who was convicted of criminal damage to a property in south Dublin two years ago in a dispute over payment for work has told a court he was a victim of “gross fraud.” Tom McDonnell (62), a self-employed builder and father of five from Lakeside Park, Newbridge, Co Kildare, had been remanded on bail to appear before a sitting of Dún Laoghaire District Court today to address the issue of compensation. However, McDonnell was ordered by Judge Anne Watkin to return again next year with an additional sum of €1,250 to the €1,000 in cash that he had brought to court. The accused, who was elected as an independent member of Kildare County Council in the local elections in June, had been convicted at an earlier court hearing of causing damage to windows at the rear of a house in Rockville Crescent, Blackrock, Co Dublin on 6 September 2022, contrary to Section 2 (1) of the Criminal Damage Act 1991. Counsel for the defendant, John McCoy BL, told Judge Watkin today that the question of compensation was complicated by a related “civil matter.” McCoy pointed out that a claim for damages had been settled by an insurance company for €16,900. However, Judge Watkin pointed out that the injured party had lost a no claims bonus which the court heard had cost him €2,250 this year and an uncertain amount in the future. In response to McCoy’s repeated insistence that his client was unsure what to do because of the uncertainty about the estimate of future losses and the civil matter, the judge retorted: “I don’t think you understand what you are doing here.” She added: “I’m not concerned about the civil matter.” The court heard McDonnell believed that the injured party had already been compensated with a sum that exceeded the damage that was done. Following a brief consultation with his client, McCoy said the defendant was prepared to increase his offer of compensation of €1,000 to the amount of the value of the no claims bonus that had been lost. Judge Watkin pointed out to the barrister that the whole situation had arisen from the position the injured party had been left in by McDonnell. Advertisement Asked to confirm his willingness to pay compensation of €2,250, the defendant said he would but claimed it was “gross fraud.” “I’m owed €23,000. This is fraud,” McDonnell added. The judge observed that McDonnell was accusing his victim of fraud “after what you did to him.” Asked what he was going to do to show remorse, McDonnell said he would require two months to pay the additional amount of compensation. The case was adjourned, with the defendant ordered to appear before a sitting of the same court in January. McDonnell was elected as an independent councillor for the Newbridge local electoral area of Kildare County Council this summer. He received 548 first preference votes which equated to 4.7% of the total valid poll. McDonnell was elected on the 11th and final count to the last of six seats without reaching the quota. The Kildare man is a co-founder of Éire Saor – an unregistered umbrella group of independent candidates who contested the local elections in Kildare on an anti-immigration platform and to oppose planning permission being granted for centres to house international protection applicants. Following his election, McDonnell generated widespread controversy over comments he made in which he claimed Irish people were in danger of dying out because Irish women were not breeding enough. He subsequently expressed regret for his choice of words but explained they were due to his farming background. McDonnell added that he supported tax incentives being given to working women to have more children. In a newspaper interview, he stated his belief that a secret cabal of “Khazarian Jews” are running the world and trying to flood Europe with immigrants as part of a plot to replace Irish people. McDonnell, who is planning to contest the upcoming general election, has denied that he is a far-right politician or anti-immigration but stressed that he was against mass uncontrolled immigration.

MILAN (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has derivative positions in UniCredit equivalent to a 6.7% stake in the Italian bank as of Sept. 30, mostly swap and future contracts as well as call options, a regulatory filing showed on Monday. The position, held through Goldman Sachs International and another nine subsidiaries, if exercised would make the U.S. bank a top investor in UniCredit whose single biggest shareholder is fund manager BlackRock with 7.02%. Filings with Italian market regulator Consob also showed that Barclays holds shares and derivatives as of Sept. 30 in Italian bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, which if combined and exercised would give it a 5.3% stake in the lender. The positions are held through Barclays Capital Securities Limited, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Inc. They comprise a voting stake of just 0.92% while another 4.2% is long positions to be settled in shares. (Reporting by Valentina Za; Editing by Susan Fenton) Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Wall Street's hacks and habits to stay on top of their game
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-hacks-that-keep-wall-street-rising-stars-mentally-sharp-2024-10
Time Published: 2024-10-07T15:44:25Z

Call it superstitious, but Mark Zhu, a 34-year-old managing director at Blackstone, likes to start every day the same way. He has two Trader Joe's yogurt cups, one banana-flavored and one blueberry-flavored, eaten in the same order, followed by his supplements, which also have their specific sequence. "Those are just examples of how I bring a level of consistency and sequencing to my life," he said. "Because you know the moment after 9 o'clock, the days can get chaotic." Similarly, the 90 minutes between 5:30 a.m. to 7 a.m. are precious to Craig Kolwicz. The Moelis investment banker uses that time to put himself in control for the rest of the day, whether by going to the gym, meditating, or reading a book. "You're not getting pulled in all different directions with your deals, your transactions, or just things in life," said the 35-year-old managing director. "It's sacred time to me — anything before 7 a.m. is my time." It's no secret that working on Wall Street is demanding. Finance giants from Blackstone to Goldman Sachs attract some of the brightest and most driven people, and to climb the ranks is no easy feat. When we asked top up-and-comers on Wall Street about the habits or routines they followed to keep themselves mentally sharp, no one mentioned cold plunges, 10-step facial rituals, or biohacking trends that tout themselves as life hacks that instantly make you more attractive, healthier, smarter, and more balanced. Most of these high performers featured on Business Insider's 2024 list of rising stars of Wall Street are spending time with their families, keeping physically and mentally healthy with reasonable workout and sleep routines, and finding opportunities to recharge. Here's what we learned about the hacks, habits, and routines that help top talent on Wall Street stay on their game. Chicago-based Bank of America investment banker Corey White is another early riser. He relies on his Apple watch to wake him up gently, with a little vibration at 5 a.m. The 35-year-old works out. He's partial to weight lifting but recently took up running thanks to his twin brother, who works in private equity. He sends his kids off to school and listens to a podcast on an hour-long commute into the office. "My mornings are super important to me to have a nice, kind of slow start to the day. And I found it's regulating," he told BI. The routine helps him stay present with his home life as well as work, he added. Nina Gnedin, a San Francisco-based portfolio manager from Man Group, starts her day at 4:30 a.m. because she works East Coast market hours. "I wake up. I do my face. I do my skincare. I brush my teeth. I drink my double shot of espresso. I do all my morning work rituals, where I check the trades. I check on the portfolios around 7, 7:30. I get coffee again." Her "very regimented" workday ends at 3 p.m., which allows her to get outside and enjoy the outdoors. "There's no day of the year where the sun's down when I'm done with work," she said. Bridgewater Associates deputy chief investment officer Blake Cecil likes to push himself (and his team) to meet deadlines that might be arbitrary on paper but give him a mental goal to chase. The 32-year-old overpromises on projects intentionally to " trick" himself into working more efficiently and diligently. One example is he will ask his team and himself this hypothetical: "Let's imagine we had to deliver this in 24 hours — how would we do that?" Often, this leads to creative and innovative work, he told BI. BlackRock's Chi Chen, 34, winds down her weekends with a Sunday evening reading ritual that helps her "distill my brain." It's a two-hour affair, starting with one hour of the books she's reading. The fixed-income portfolio manager is a fan of non-fiction and just read "Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst" by Robert Sapolsky. After that, she turns back to the markets. She reads external and internal research and prepares for the week. Since starting at Bank of America, Justin Elliott has had a daily regimen designed to take up his 20-minute commute to work. "It's really around my faith — I do a devotion. Read a Bible scripture, pray. Come into the office and listen to a gospel song," the 29-year-old vice president on the institutional rates sales desk at Bank of America told BI. "That's my every morning routine for getting me centered for the day. It's about reminding me why I'm here and what it's all about." He also goes to the gym two to three times a week and has recently been doing sound baths and meditation with his wife. Listening to music on her drive to her Boston office helps Fidelity Investments' Palmer Osteen, 31, take her mind off what's about to come and what's ahead so she can start her workday with a clear head. It also works for her way home. Music "helps me reset and decompress and not go to bed with a hamster wheel in my brain," she said. KKR's Alissa Song, who grew up in Silicon Valley but now lives in New York, uses the time to touch base with family and friends. "It just keeps me connected to the people I care about," the 31-year-old industrials investor told BI. "I've been doing this since my college internships." "Part of it is just that we came to the US when I was really young, and so here it's just the four of us here, my two parents and my brother. And so we're really close," she added. "That's been a way that I've kept in touch." Similarly, making time for quality time with friends and family keeps Daniela Cardona, 29, grounded. "I work a ton," the RBC investment banking vice president said, but "most important is I've never lost sight of my friends, my support system." Bank of America's White has a family day every Saturday with his wife and two young sons. "We go to the museums, go to the zoo, go to the water park, wherever it is, we just fully, deeply focus on our family," he said. "And I think being able to give 100% to whatever you're focused on is really important for just productivity, but also for the mental side of I'm here right now in the moment with my family and being fully immersed in that." Ben Carper, who finished his Padi open water certification a couple of years ago, tries to take a trip or two a year with his wife that focuses on diving. Along with a chance to see exotic locations, it's a chance to completely unplug. "It's a change of scenery, and it's kind of hard to think about work when there's a 25-foot manta ray swimming nearby," Carper, a 34-year-old managing director on Jefferies' Private Capital Advisory team, added. His last dive was in the Maldives, and he's eyeing Thailand next. Matthew Eid-Holm, a principal at Ares Management, skis or scuba dives at least every 6 months. "A few hours of these activities that require 100% focus on the present are very effective at resetting," the 32-year-old told BI. Also, on the ocean theme, Moelis' Kolwicz is a pretty avid surfer. "Being out on the ocean, getting that physical activity — it's easy to zone out." There are ways to decompress and relax on land, too. Melissa Ding, an infrastructure investor at BlackRock, likes to engage in meditative activities like cooking, pottery, or tending to her terrace garden to give the 33-year-old a "little bit of mental reset." "When I need a little bit of rest time, there are just things that I do that where I can kind of zone out." Her garden consists of flowers, including dahlias, and a recently planted fig tree. Wells Fargo's Annie Cheslin, 34, recently learned how to play the centuries-old strategy game mahjong, which she's become "obsessed with." The managing director in high-grade municipal trading joined a club that meets twice a month to play. Physical challenges are a way to distract yourself from the day-to-day and counterbalance the time you spend in front of computer screens or client dinners. Margaret Williams, a 31-year-old executive director at Morgan Stanley, said she exercises in some form or fashion every day. Williams will do anything, from a run in Central Park to weightlifting to laps at a hotel pool on the road to late-night walks with the dog. "It's a part of staying balanced, physically and mentally," she said. Being disciplined about daily workouts is also how Apollo's Austin Anton, 32, clears his head. "I find that when I go for a run, I have my most creative ideas, and I love to run, and I tend to do that every other day," he said. "So I find that very helpful in terms of clearing my head and allowing me to think through something." Erica Wilson's workout of choice is weightlifting, which "has become a real stress reliever over the last couple of years," she told BI. The 31-year-old vice president at Blue Owl's daily habit has evolved into a competitive hobby. She participated in a power-lifting competition last year through Tone House — she deadlifted nearly twice her body weight — as well as Hyrox, a fitness race featuring eight separate physical exercises, such as sled pulls or burpee broad jumps, with a 1-kilometer run in between each. For Harrison DiGia, morning is the best time to get a workout in. "I try to wake up and move my body. I do some sort of workout every morning, whether it's strength training, playing tennis, or even stretching or yoga," the 31-year-old General Atlantic vice president said. "I'm a huge tennis player. I like using that time in the morning to clear my mind. It helps me reset and gets me ready for the new day ahead." Patrick Lenihan, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, has a strict bedtime. "There's some nights where you need to get things done, but I try to have a hard cutoff. Let's just say 9:30— that's lights out." That gives him 30 or 45 minutes to wind down and ensure he gets his sleep, not just for physical health, but mental, too. He also makes a point to stay active. He played hockey his whole life, but after a few surgeries, he now does lower-impact exercises like pilates and barre at least three or four times a week. "Now that I'm on paternity leave, I've been lucky enough to do it, get in a little bit more. But I think those two things help me to at least stay recharged and stay ready each day," he said. Luckily, his infant son is a great sleeper and has not disturbed Patrick's rest so far. "I definitely think getting sleep is important," Elizabeth Stone Redding, a principal at TPG, told BI. "It's certainly something I have realized as I've matured in my career, that you really need to use your brain, and you need to get a decent amount of sleep for that." The 33-year-old also habitually sets priorities to stay on track and not get overwhelmed. "It's very easy to obviously be overwhelmed with a large list of things, but narrowing it down and saying, 'Okay, these are the two or three things I really want to do today,' helps me a lot," Stone Redding said. "I try to have — even if it's just in my head — a list of two or three things I want to accomplish in a given day." Matt Gilbert, a 35-year-old managing director at Thoma Bravo, started working with an executive coach a few years ago. He was surprised when the coach pushed him to pull back at work. "I would say, in general, workaholic or 'Type A' people tend to try to grasp more and more responsibility," he said. "And I actually think ultimately that was the case for me." Gilbert now spends more time with his family. He has made a habit of watching TV with his wife every night and dropping his oldest daughter at school. "I think I fill up my cup in terms of personal fulfillment so that my time that I'm at work, I can really, really focus and dedicate to that and kind of maximize the time that I have here." Gidan Dan's key ritual at work is consistently staying in touch with his clients, but at home, the Citadel Securities senior vice president takes the chance to relax. "A lot of my colleagues are really good runners and they work out and everything. I'm completely different," he said. "I think I work long enough hours, so I don't want to exhaust myself too much. So I would just go home, and taking care of my kids is enjoyable but exhausting stuff," Dan said of his two daughters, aged 1 and 4. Feroz Khosla, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, isn't just looking for work-life balance, but "work-life harmony — which just means, when you look back at your career, you feel as if there was harmony between work and life," he told BI. "Sometimes, you do need to have the power to say no, but do it gracefully," he said. "Maybe the answer is sure, but not right now—and being able to do that without disappointing people is super helpful." Jump to

Title: Layer raises $6M to make incorruptible foundations of the internet

October 07, 2024 10:00 ET | Source: Layer Layer New York, Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A well-functioning internet is something we get to take for granted, thanks to the built-in security protocols carefully designed underneath. Without them, no data could be securely transferred from place to place at the incredible speed required to support the tech industry’s biggest products. Today, the existing security protocols are struggling to protect users from even bigger threats, specifically the threats posed by large companies, cyberattackers, and AI that manipulate our online experience and erode trust. Blockchain technologies, like smart contracts, are a real hope to restore trust in the internet. However, smart contracts can only use a small amount of compute, putting limits on what they can support. To build great user experiences on a trustworthy Decentralized Web, we need a way to verify computations outside of blockchains, and make unstoppable applications that, once released, cannot be tampered with. Recently founded startup Layer aims to extend the functionality of Ethereum by making the first developer tools that support full-stack decentralized applications with Web Assembly. The company has raised a $6M seed round led by 1kx, with participation from Fabric Ventures, Arrington Capital, Stake Capital Group, and IOBC. Notable angels include Sreeram Kannan of EigenLayer, Rok Kopp and Mike Silagadze of Ether.fi, and Paul Taylor, formerly of BlackRock. Layer founders: (L to R) Sam Cassatt, Jake Hartnell and Ethan Frey Typically, smart contracts are small programs, specially packaged to be run by trustworthy “validators” on the blockchain. However, to power major software products, like web platforms, smartphone apps, and AI models, smart contracts would need to run thousands of lines of software at speeds you would find on a personal device or datacenter server. While many teams are optimizing the performance of blockchains like Ethereum, smart contracts alone are not capable of meeting the high computational demand of many applications. Layer utilizes Web Assembly, which allows developers to write applications in languages like rust, that can run anywhere – even on your iPhone. Layer’s upcoming product, the “Layer SDK”, will allow developers to build new layers on top of Ethereum that run full-stack blockchain-based applications consisting of smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, UI, and verifiable off-chain services (AI agents, ZK provers, serverless functions, decentralized messaging servers, and more). This means, for the first time, a software developer can launch sovereign, incorruptible versions of their software products without any sacrifice to the user experience. The founders, Sam Cassatt, Jake Hartnell, and Ethan Frey are three of the most seasoned builders in the blockchain space. Their combined experience has been instrumental in the proliferation of blockchain technologies like MetaMask wallets, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and cross-chain protocols. By making the decision to band together, the founding team hopes to use all the lessons they have learned in blockchain to fulfill one of its biggest promises – to make all experiences on the internet inherently trustworthy, from the UI down to the functionality, through the shared security mechanisms of smart contracts. “All three of us have realized that, while smart contracts have given us a foundational layer of trust, they aren’t enough to support a full decentralized version of the Internet,” Sam Cassatt, Co-Founder of Layer explains. “We wanted to complete the full narrative arc of decentralized architecture, and give the world the tools necessary to build any application, with any performance requirements in this trust-minimized way.” They predict this original ideal, espoused by blockchain’s true believers, will soon be seen as an essential solution to existential threats in our digital world. According to Sam, Jake, and Ethan, the only way to verify the software and data you interact with online has not been manipulated by its creator, its host, a cybercriminal, an AI model, the government, or any other powerful actor would be with a protocol that guarantees trust. “We are thrilled to back Jake, Sam, and Ethan on their mission to build out the next generation of blockchain infrastructure.” says Wei Dai, Research Partner at 1kx, “Traditional smart contract platforms rely on replicated execution which limits scalability. Layer’s platform and SDK offer the best-in-class scalability, programmability, and configurability for shared-security applications.” Richard Muirhead, Managing Partner, Fabric Ventures commented: “We at fabric have long been excited to back teams expanding the boundaries of what is possible in crypto and Lay3r are doing exactly that. By defining a new category of shared economic security that spans hybrid off-chain and on-chain worlds, we believe Lay3r can be a Schelling point for new teams looking to build applications taking advantage of these core primitives.” - The team believes tools like Layer SDK will be the key to mitigating these incredible threats, and make the Decentralized Web the dominant web, complete with all the exciting products the founders have helped to pioneer in blockchain over the last 14 years.

Title: Heliene Partners With Transition Equity Partners to Expand Domestic Solar Manufacturing Capacity

October 07, 2024 08:00 ET | Source: Heliene, Inc.; Transition Equity Partners Heliene, Inc.; Transition Equity Partners MOUNTAIN IRON, Minn., Oct. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heliene Inc., a leading North American solar PV module manufacturer, is pleased to announce closing a strategic equity investment up to $54 million from Transition Equity Partners (“TEP”) in collaboration with a consortium of limited partners, including affiliates of Hamilton Lane. The investment will support the expansion of Heliene’s industry-leading operations, which have served the North American solar market through multiple market cycles over the past 14 years, making Heliene one of the longest tenured solar manufacturers in North America. This strategic investment from TEP follows the $170M in capital that Heliene raised in 2023 from Orion Infrastructure Capital (OIC) and several of Heliene’s key customers. This capital infusion will support the development of a new 550MW production line in Rogers, MN, and the creation of 150+ new full time jobs at the facility. Heliene’s MN #3 manufacturing line will boost the company’s total U.S. based manufacturing capacity to ~1.5GW per year. Heliene has industry leading partners underpinning this expansion, including a 2.0GW supply agreement with Excelsior Energy Capital and 1.5GW supply agreement with Nexamp, touted by U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm as an investment that would “boost American manufacturing and create American jobs, while lowering families’ energy bills.” By leveraging the Inflation Reduction Act, Heliene is set to capitalize on the 45X production tax credit, whilst Heliene’s customers can unlock significant incremental value through the Domestic Content Adder (DCA). This creates strong tailwinds for Heliene, while offering its customers a decisive competitive edge in the renewable energy market. Heliene has leveraged the IRA to build a leading domestic solar supply chain, partnering with Suniva for U.S. made solar cells starting in Q3 2024, SOLARCYCLE for US made solar glass, OMCO Solar as a domestically produced racking partner, Premier Energies to pursue a cell manufacturing JV and NorSun for domestic wafer production among other initiatives to expand the United States solar supply chain and energy security. Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of Heliene, stated “This investment from Transition Equity Partners is a key milestone in Heliene’s growth journey. It empowers us to expand our capacity to deliver high-quality, bankable, domestically produced solar modules that power the clean energy transition. We are proud to play a pivotal role in strengthening North America’s renewable energy supply chain and contributing to the global energy transition.” TEP believes Heliene’s proven track record and strategic positioning make them particularly compelling among US solar companies. Michael Allison, Partner at TEP, commented: “Heliene’s operational excellence and strong market position, combined with the support of the Inflation Reduction Act, make this a rare opportunity to invest in U.S. solar manufacturing at an attractive entry point. Our investment reflects our confidence in Heliene’s leadership and its growth potential as the demand for clean energy continues to surge." Stifel served as exclusive financial advisor to Heliene in connection with the entire transaction. ABOUT HELIENE Heliene, Inc. is one of North America’s fastest-growing domestic module manufacturers serving the utility-scale, commercial, and residential markets. With an in-house logistics team and remarkably responsive support staff, Heliene delivers competitively priced, high performance solar modules precisely when and where customers need them to accelerate North America’s clean energy transition.

Title: Wall Street futures slip as markets reprice rate path ahead of busy week

By Sinéad Carew and Lisa Pauline Mattackal (Reuters) -Wall Street's three major indexes closed down around 1% on Monday while Treasury yields rose, as traders tamped down bets for Federal Reserve interest-rate easing and worried about the Middle East conflict's impact on oil prices. While waiting for quarterly earnings season and fresh economic data, investors also braced for another big hurricane, Milton, which is expected to hit the United States this week. Relief efforts are under way after Helene, a Category-4 hurricane, killed more than 200 people across six states. Further dampening sentiment on Monday was an order from a U.S. judge for market heavyweight Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google to overhaul its mobile-app business to give Android phone users more options. Analyst reports also spurred selling of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). After Friday's stronger-than-expected jobs report, traders pulled back from bets for a 50-basis-point rate cut in November. They were pricing in an 86% chance of a 25-basis-point cut and a roughly 14% chance the central bank would not cut rates at all, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. The change in rate-cut expectations caused U.S. Treasury yields to rally, with the yield on benchmark 10-year notes exceeding 4% for the first time in two months. Besides next month's Fed meeting, investors are waiting for the Consumer Price Index inflation reading for September and the kickoff of third-quarter earnings season with reports from banks, both due this week. "It's a combination of things over the last couple of days: the jobs report, the hurricane damage, the elevated energy prices and negative comments about some of the large-cap tech names," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. "All of that combined just makes for a nervous day, and the Google headlines tipped things over to more aggressive selling in the last hour." James pointed to the Middle East conflict as a concern for U.S. investors who are worried about the war's economic impact, including rising oil prices. Investors continue to fret about how Israel would respond to Iran's missile strikes. On Monday, Lebanon's armed group Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel's city of Haifa while Israeli forces looked poised to expand ground raids into south Lebanon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 398.51 points, or 0.94%, to 41,954.24, the S&P 500 lost 55.13 points, or 0.96%, to 5,695.94 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 213.94 points, or 1.18%, to 17,923.90. The CBOE Volatility index, Wall Street's fear gauge, closed up 3.4 points at 22.64, marking its biggest one-day points gain in more than a month and its highest closing level since Aug. 8. Among the S&P 500's 11 major industry indexes, only energy advanced, finishing up 0.4%. U.S. crude futures settled up 3.7% in their fifth-straight advance on concerns about Middle East supply disruptions. [O/R] The biggest industry laggard was utilities, down 2.3%, followed by communications services, which was under pressure from Alphabet's 2.5% drop. The benchmark S&P 500's biggest drag from a single stock was from Apple, after Jefferies assumed coverage with a "hold" rating, sending the stock down 2.3%. Amazon.com finished down 3% after a Wells Fargo downgrade. Among the benchmark's biggest gainers was Generac Holdings (NYSE:GNRC), which added 8.52% as investors bet on solid demand for backup power generators because of the pending hurricane. Shares of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) rose 2% after a report that activist investor Starboard Value has taken a roughly $1-billion stake in the drugmaker. Air Products and Chemicals (NYSE:APD) closed up 9.5% on a report that activist hedge fund Mantle Ridge has built a position in the company. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.73-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 222 new highs and 55 new lows. On the Nasdaq, 1,292 stocks rose and 2,988 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.31-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and two new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 118 new lows. On U.S. exchanges, 11.39 billion shares changed hands compared with the 12.06-billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Investing.com -- US stock futures edge lower following a Friday spike on Wall Street that was fueled by a strong jobs report. Markets are now gearing up for fresh inflation data which could provide more clarity on the path ahead for Federal Reserve interest rate policy in the coming months. Elsewhere, global miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) confirms a takeover bid for US-based Arcadium Lithium . 1. Futures lower US stock futures pointed lower on Monday following a rally in the prior session sparked by a bumper September employment report. By 03:28 ET (07:28 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 89 points or 0.2%, S&P 500 futures had fallen by 13 points or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had dipped by 46 points or 0.2%. On Friday, the main averages on Wall Street jumped after Labor Department figures showed that the US economy added far more jobs than anticipated last month. The numbers bolstered hopes that the the world's largest economy was on solid footing heading into the fourth quarter. Although the reading dented projections that the Federal Reserve would roll out another jumbo 50-basis point interest rate reduction at its final meetings this year, it served to boost the idea that the central bank was on course to achieve a so-called "soft landing" -- a scenario in which elevated inflation is successfully quelled without a igniting a wider downturn in the economy or jobs market. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a record closing high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 1.2% and the benchmark S&P 500 grew by 51 points or 0.9%. The increases also helped the major indices eke out a fourth consecutive positive week. 2. Data, earnings ahead this week Investors will have more economic data to pour over this week, as well as a raft of new quarterly corporate earnings. Thursday’s consumer price index (CPI) data for September is expected to show that price pressures continued to moderate at the end of the third quarter. The data, coming on the heels of Friday’s robust jobs report is likely to shape expectations around the size and pace of Fed rate cuts in the coming months. Producer price inflation data on Friday is also expected to point to tamer inflationary pressures. “CPI for September will be a key data release. If prices rise faster than expected on top of the stronger labor data, chances for the Fed to skip the November meeting will increase,” analysts at UBS said in a recent note. Meanwhile, US third-quarter earnings season is about to kick into gear, in what will be a test for a stock market near record highs and trading at lofty valuations. Major financial firms -- including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) -- are all due to report on Friday. 3. Rio Tinto confirms approach to acquire Arcadium Lithium Mining giant Rio Tinto (LON:RIO) has made an approach to purchase lithium producer Arcadium Lithium (NYSE:ALTM), the companies announced in separate statements on Monday. Both groups said the approach was "non-binding," adding that they would divulge more about a potential deal when they had "news to share." Should it be completed, the agreement would make Rio Tinto one of the world's biggest producers of lithium, the ultralight metal essential in powering electric vehicle batteries and power storage. Prior to the announcement, media reports had speculated that Rio may pursue a bid following months of slumping lithium prices due in part to oversupply in China and weaker EV demand. No financial details were provided, but Arcadium Lithium has a market capitalization of around $3.3 billion. Shares in the Philadelphia-based firm surged by more than 24% in premarket trading. Reuters previously reported the discussions on Friday, saying that Arcadium could be valued at between $4 billion to $6 billion or higher. 4. Activist investor Starboard Value takes stake in Pfizer - WSJ Activist investor Starboard Value has taken a stake in Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) worth around $1 billion as part of a bid to overhaul the pharmaceutical company, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Starboard has approached two former Pfizer executives -- ex-CEO Ian Read and ex-CFO Frank D'Amelio -- to help in the process, the paper added, citing people familiar with the matter. The report comes as Pfizer's leadership team is facing growing calls to turn around its recently flagging performance. The drugmaker was a key COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer during the pandemic, but it has struggled to plug a subsequent sales gap as the health crisis has abated. In late-2023, Pfizer issued a revenue warning and a disappointing 2024 outlook, along with a $3.5 billion cost-cutting drive. Shares in Pfizer, which are now trading below pre-pandemic levels, were higher in premarket dealmaking following the report. 5. Oil jumps Oil prices jumped on Monday following hefty gains posted in the previous week, as traders eye ongoing tensions in the Middle East. By 03:28 ET, the Brent contract had risen by 0.5% to $78.47 per barrel, while U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.8% higher at $74.94 a barrel. Oil prices last week recorded their biggest weekly gains in over a year on the mounting threat of a region-wide war in the Middle East. Israel has sworn to strike Iran for launching a barrage of missiles at the country in retaliation for the assassination of the leader of Tehran-backed Hezbollah.
