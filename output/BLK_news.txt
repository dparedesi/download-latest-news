Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is advancing 5% after the huge, Taiwan-based chip manufacturer reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results today. A Look at TSM's Q4 Results and Statements The company's Q4 sales jumped 37% versus the same period a year earlier to $26.88 billion. That was $890 million above analysts' average estimate. Further, TSM's earnings per share rose to $2.24, compared with $1.44 in Q4 of 2023. Analysts, on average, had expected the firm's Q4 EPS to come in at $2.23. "With our strong technology leadership and differentiation, we are well-positioned to capture the multiyear structured demand from the industry megatrends of 5G, AI, and" high-performance computing (HPC)," CFO Wendell Huang asserted on the company's Q4 earnings call. HPC accounted for 53% of its Q4 revenue, versus 43% in Q4 of 2023. For Q1, the chip maker provided revenue guidance of $25.0 billion to $25.8 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected the company's sales to come in at $24.75 billion. “Moving into first quarter 2025, we expect our business to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand.” Huang said in a statement. The Price Action of TSM Stock In the last month, the shares have advanced 11.5%, while they are up 5.5% in the last three months.

Title: Italy's Largest Bank Takes First Step into Bitcoin with $1 Million Purchase

More Info Italy’s biggest bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, has made history by becoming the first Italian financial institution to buy 11 bitcoins for a "test" purchase worth $1 million. Initially a widespread rumor, Bloomberg has confirmed that Italy’s largest banking giant has indeed dipped its toes in Bitcoin. According to an internal memo, the financial institution completed its first proprietary Bitcoin trade, investing the funds into the world’s largest digital currency. “It’s very small amounts, considering we have 100 billion euros in our securities portfolio,” Intesa CEO Carlo Messina told reporters on the sidelines of an event in Milan on Tuesday. “It’s an experiment, a test.” Intesa set up a proprietary trading desk for digital assets in 2023 and started handling spot trades with cryptos last year. The news first surfaced when the bank’s employees leaked an internal email on the image-sharing platform 4Chan. Following the leak, Niccolo Bardoscia, Intesa Sanpaolo’s head of digital assets trading and investment, officially confirmed the acquisition in an email to the media, revealing that the bank now holds 11 BTC. While Bardoscia confirmed the purchase, the executive did not reveal exactly why the bank had acquired BTC. Therefore, it is still unclear if the purchase was to diversify Intesa Sanpaolo’s investment portfolio or if it was a pilot to offer crypto services, according to CryptoRank. The acquisition is not the bank’s first foray into blockchain. In July last year, Intesa Sanpaolo pioneered a $25.7 million digital bond issuance on the Polygon network in collaboration with state-owned bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA. In addition, Intesa Sanpaolo broadened its crypto desk to allow spot trading. Before then, it only offered clients crypto options, futures, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Intesa Sanpaolo’s purchase came as Europe eased regulations. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory guideline came into full effect in December, a milestone that’s expected to pave the way for more digital-asset adoption among financial companies. While Intesa is currently only prop trading — buying and selling using its own balance sheet rather than on behalf of clients — the crypto desk’s activities fit with the bank’s broader blockchain projects, and it may be a stepping stone for eventually trading digital assets for institutional customers. “We won’t become a Bitcoin provider but we need to know how to do so if our bigger clients ask us to,” Messina told reporters on Tuesday. Intesa carried out the Bitcoin purchase through Boerse Stuttgart Digital’s institutional trading platform, a spokesperson from the German exchange group said in a statement. After rallying in the wake of Donald Trump’s US election win in early November, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have had a shaky start to the year, hurt by concerns that persistent inflation will curtail the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy easing. Bitcoin briefly slid below $90,000 on Monday — a drop of almost 5% from the start of 2025 — before a rebound that left it slightly up for January. The largest cryptocurrency soared to a record high of $108,316 last month. This BTC acquisition signals a shift in sentiment within Italy. As the country’s largest bank leads the way, other financial institutions may follow suit, potentially accelerating adoption. The move stands out in Italy, where the central bank governor, Fabio Panetta, has consistently cautioned against digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, describing them as “unsecured.” That said, the bank has a long way to go to catch up with its US peers: BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has amassed $51 billion in assets in the spot Bitcoin ETF it launched a year ago, and is pushing to have its money-market digital coin more widely used as collateral for crypto derivatives trades. JPMorgan is preparing to offer instant settlement for foreign-exchange conversions between the dollar and the euro through its blockchain platform. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s value continues to surge, with optimism growing about easing regulatory hurdles under incoming U.S. President Donald Trump. Some analysts expect it to more than double in value by the end of this year.

Title: Is Applied Materials (AMAT) the Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) stands against other best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. The NASDAQ, heavily comprised of technology stocks, has been on a consistent upward trajectory for some years. In 2023, it experienced remarkable growth, marking its best performance since 2020 with an increase of over 43%. In 2024, the index continued to surpass market expectations with a 28.64% gain. This impressive performance is largely driven by the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence, which has significantly boosted major tech stocks and the broader market throughout 2023 and into this year. Analysts suggest that the NASDAQ could be the index of the future, as its companies have shown a strong ability to adapt to evolving market trends. NASDAQ’s consistent outperformance can be observed over several years. According to a report by Invesco, since January 1, 2008, the Nasdaq-100 Index has delivered a cumulative total return of 750%, significantly outpacing the broader market’s 315% return. This success is largely attributed to the innovation driven by tech companies, which continues to attract investors. For instance, the technology sector in the broader market has achieved an annualized total return of 20.65% over the past decade, compared to 12.80% for the market. This leadership is understandable given the rapid adoption of technology in recent years. The Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) noted that the Nasdaq-100 has approximately 55% exposure to the tech sector, in contrast to about 32% for the broader market. READ ALSO: 12 Monthly Dividend Stocks with Over 5% Yield and Warren Buffett’s 10 Cheap Stock Picks Tech companies are not only driving innovation but are also swiftly adjusting their dividend strategies. In 2024, many prominent tech firms began issuing dividends, significantly boosting the overall dividend pool. Although dividends are traditionally linked with value stocks rather than the high-growth companies fueling the AI surge, analysts suggest this shift broadens the appeal of these stocks to new investor groups while putting surplus cash to use. Typically, growth-focused companies prioritize reinvestment over returning earnings to shareholders. However, experts like Ted Mortonson from Baird argue that these dividend payments won’t undermine the companies’ future dominance. Here are some other comments from the analyst: “I don’t view it as a problem. I view it as they’ve won. They’ve won the technology side. They’ve won on the business-model side, and they’re going to win on the Gen AI cycle.” Overall dividends are becoming increasingly popular among investors, with many US companies either raising or maintaining their payouts. Howard Silverblatt, a Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, suggested that with an anticipated reduction in interest rates by the FOMC in 2025, coupled with record earnings forecasted for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the entire year of 2025, companies might allocate more funds towards substantial dividend hikes in the upcoming year. He further mentioned that February, traditionally the peak month for dividend increases, is expected to see even more significant growth as some firms may look to compensate for previous conservative strategies. In 2024, the large-cap companies in the broader market outperformed many others, achieving record levels in earnings, sales, and dividends. For 2025, a projected 8% rise in dividend payments is expected, up from a 6.4% increase in 2024. For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds as of the third quarter of 2024 and selected companies that are trading on the NASDAQ exchange and also pay dividends to shareholders. From that list, we picked 15 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors and ranked in ascending order of hedge funds’ sentiment toward them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician in a clean room assembling a semiconductor chip using a microscope. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) is a global leader in semiconductor equipment manufacturing, supplying critical tools for creating advanced chips used in AI, data centers, automotive technology, and other sectors. The global semiconductor manufacturing equipment market is projected to more than double by 2032, with Applied Materials likely to be a major beneficiary of this growth. Beyond just selling its equipment, the company has seen a significant boost in revenue from its equipment servicing segment. As manufacturing equipment becomes more complex and specialized, the demand for expert maintenance continues to rise, contributing to this fast-growing part of the business. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by over 16%. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) reported revenue of $7.05 billion, which showed a 5% growth from the same period last year. The company’s net income for the quarter came in at $1.73 billion. Its diverse range of products and services strategically positions the company to support its customers in advancing AI and energy-efficient computing. As these critical areas of semiconductor innovation gain prominence, the industry’s progress increasingly relies on materials engineering, a field where Applied Materials holds a leading position. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) also showed a strong cash position in FY24. The company reported an operating cash flow of $8.68 billion during the year. Its free cash flow amounted to $7.5 billion. Moreover, the company returned approximately $5.01 billion to shareholders, including $1.19 billion in dividends. It is one of the best dividend stocks on our list as the company has been growing its payouts for seven consecutive years. Currently, it offers a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.89%, as of January 15. Vltava Fund highlighted Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its recently published Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “In the quarter just ended, we added to the portfolio two new companies from the technology sector: Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) and Lam Research. Both are in the same industry as is another of our investments that we have held for some time, KLA Corporation. This industry is termed semiconductor devices and materials. One chapter in Hidden Investment Treasures is devoted to investing in technology companies and, among other things, the controversy over what really constitutes a technology company. As investors, we try to view technology companies not according to the industry into which they are formally classified but by whether the technologies and technological processes used in the production of their products and services are an essential element in value creation or if they are a source of long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Among the companies that are formally categorized as technology-based and fall into either the Information Technology or the Communications Services sector, we find some that can be said to be just that but also others for which this classification is at least debatable. Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it. In the cases of Applied Materials and Lam Research, there can be no doubt that these are technology companies not only as a formality but also in fact. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 74 funds held stakes in Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), compared with 77 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is over $4.6 billion. Overall, AMAT ranks 6th on our list of best NASDAQ dividend stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential for AMAT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How Hola Prime Is Changing The Future Of Prop Trading
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hola-prime/2025/01/16/how-hola-prime-is-changing-the-future-of-prop-trading/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T17:39:08Z

For decades, proprietary trading firms have been cloaked in opacity, leaving traders in the dark about critical processes like pricing, risk management, and payouts. Hola Prime is challenging the status quo. With users across 175+ countries and a suite of innovative features, the firm is redefining the future of prop trading by prioritizing transparency and creating an ecosystem tailored to the needs of modern traders. In prop trading, traders can showcase their skills without risking their own capital. They begin by participating in a firm’s challenge, trading in a demo environment to meet profit targets while staying within risk limits. Once they succeed, traders gain access to a “Funded Account,” where they trade with the firm’s capital and share the profits. Traders just pay a small fee, while the prop firm provides the platform. The firm’s business model revolves around identifying disciplined traders and mirroring their trades. By scaling up the trade volume, the firm can double the potential profit, benefiting both the trader and the firm. Hola Prime is transforming the prop trading industry by creating a transparent and trader-focused ecosystem that sets new benchmarks in the prop trading industry. Leading Hola Prime is Mr. Somesh Kapuria, the firm’s Managing Director and CEO, whose extensive experience in Forex and securities spans decades. A former senior executive at Citibank, New York, and Blackrock, Mr. Kapuria consistently drove revenue growth and spearheaded innovations widely adopted by Wall Street asset managers. “When we launched Hola Prime, it wasn’t about starting just another prop trading firm,” Mr. Kapuria shares. “It was about giving traders a fair shot, free from hidden costs and confusing practices. We’re not just fixing problems; we’re reshaping the future of trading. When traders win fairly, we win too.” Prop trading is not a regulated industry, as of today. But Hola Prime has taken a proactive approach by establishing a dedicated Risk and Compliance Department. This is unheard of in the industry. The purpose of this Department is to ensure that the internal policies at Hola Prime are as robust as they can be, and are always complied with. This Department ensures that there are Daily Accounts Reconciliations, payouts are always accurate and available for processing, and there are always additional funds available for cushion. It also ensures strong KYC and AML implementation, seamless Order flow management into live markets, along with effective management of the firm's market risk, at all times. This approach helps in building a sustainable business with a solid foundation, and builds deep trust with the customers. Prop trading has historically faced criticism for its lack of clarity, especially in pricing and execution. Traders often question whether they’re being treated fairly, but finding answers has been difficult. This absence of transparency erodes trust and causes trust deficit. Recognizing this gap, Hola Prime stepped up with an innovative solution - the Price Transparency Report. By providing traders with tick-by-tick data compared against market benchmarks, Hola Prime empowers them to verify the integrity of pricing and execution. “We are proud to be the first and the only prop firm to publish a Price Transparency Report,” says Mr. Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Risk and Compliance at Hola Prime. “This report is just as crucial for us as it is for our traders, as it guarantees that our liquidity providers offer prices that are in line with the market, fostering accountability at every level,” he adds. “We share this report with all active traders, and we’re proud to report a 99.63% match rate between our data and leading market benchmarks,” Mr. Ashutosh continued. “With over 10 million price ticks analyzed every month, we ensure that our pricing accuracy and transparency remains unmatched in the industry.” Unlike many competitors, Hola Prime was designed by traders who have experienced the pain points of traditional prop trading firsthand. This insider perspective has enabled the firm to create solutions that directly address these challenges - from delayed payouts to insufficient risk management tools. Mr. Somesh Kapuria, Managing Director and CEO, Hola Prime “Our mission is simple - to eliminate uncertainty for traders and empower them to focus on strategy and execution,” says Mr Somesh Kapuria. “Every feature we’ve developed is rooted in feedback from our global trading community” he adds. Payout delays have long been a sore spot for prop traders. Hola Prime tackles this head-on with its industry-leading 1-hour payout system, with over 99% success rate. For traders, this means no more waiting days to access their hard-earned profits. “We follow a 10-point payout system and complete our calculations at the end of each day to ensure payouts are ready promptly,” says Ms. Sumedha, CFO at Hola Prime. “Our average payout time is just 45 minutes. Our partnerships with PSPs, including Paypal, Rise and some crypto PSPs, are integral. These PSPs offer fast and reliable transfers, enabling quick multi-currency and multi-network payments for traders who prefer crypto withdrawals" she adds. Furthermore, Ms Sumedha reveals, “Hola Prime has launched Hola Prime Visa Cards, now available as a standard payout withdrawal method for all traders. The cards provide effortless access to earnings, allowing traders to make online purchases, shop in-store, and withdraw cash from ATMs. This innovative payout method is designed to provide a smooth and hassle-free experience for all Hola Prime traders.” Hola Prime is committed to providing traders with the tools they need to succeed in a competitive market. The firm offers funding options of up to $300K, with the potential to scale accounts to $4 million, ensuring traders have access to the capital they need to execute their strategies effectively. The firm emphasizes a lot on education and continuous improvement. Through extensive training resources and expert guidance, Hola Prime equips traders with the knowledge and skills to refine their strategies and make informed decisions. Hola Prime’s innovative features extend beyond technology. The firm has introduced a 95% reward structure and a 200% fee reimbursement policy, designed to reduce financial risks and foster a supportive trading environment. “Our focus is on creating a safer and more reliable trading environment,” says Mr. Kapuria. “By integrating advanced risk management measures and leveraging technology, we aim to support traders in their journey of growth and success.” The prop trading industry has long operated in a cloud of ambiguity, leaving many traders uncertain about fairness and reliability. Hola Prime is addressing these challenges head-on, redefining the industry with its emphasis on transparency, efficiency, and trader empowerment. With a clear and equitable framework, Hola Prime offers traders access to industry-leading platforms, innovative tools, and unparalleled support systems, in addition to 24/7 Live Human Customer Support. By prioritizing fairness and innovation, the firm is setting many new standards for prop trading — that benefit traders and the industry as a whole. Hola Prime’s transformative approach to prop trading is paving the way for a more transparent and equitable future. By combining cutting-edge technology, proactive risk management, and a commitment to trader success, the firm is empowering traders to thrive in an ever-evolving market.

By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -TikTok's fortunes took a positive turn on Thursday as a growing number of U.S. officials said its Chinese owner should have more time to sell the app and stop it from being banned ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House. Trump's incoming national security adviser said the new Republican administration will keep the social media app used by 170 million Americans alive in the U.S. if there is a viable deal and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer urged President Joe Biden to extend by 90 days a deadline to shut it down on Sunday. A law passed in April mandates TikTok's owner, ByteDance, divest TikTok's U.S. assets by Sunday to a non-Chinese buyer, or be banned on national security concerns. "We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark," U.S. Representative Mike Waltz told Fox News, pointing to a provision in the law allowing for a 90-day extension if there is "significant progress" toward a divestiture. "Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going," said Waltz, who was picked by Trump to be his national security adviser. A White House official said on Thursday the Biden administration does not plan to enforce the ban on Sunday leaving it up to the Trump administration, though it is not clear if the app will remain online absent a formal extension. "Given the timing of when it goes into effect over a holiday weekend a day before inauguration, it will be up to the next administration to implement," the official said. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday absent a divestiture, overturn the law or pause it to give the justices more time to make a decision. The court said it may issue rulings on Friday, but as is customary, did not state which case or cases would be decided. Trump once supported a ban on the app but changed his stance last year. His shift came amid growing signs of support for his presidential campaign among tech executives and overtures from Republican donor Jeff Yass, who owns a big share of ByteDance. In a sign of warming ties between Trump and TikTok, the video app's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, will attend the presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 and be seated on the dais among other high-profile invitees, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. BIPARTISAN SHIFT "It's clear that more time is needed to find an American buyer and not disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans,” Schumer said on the Senate floor, adding that Democrats tried to pass a bill extending the deadline to find a solution to 270 days. "I will work with the Trump administration and with both parties to keep TikTok alive while protecting our national security," he added. The comments by Schumer, who was a strong supporter of the law to force a sale, are a sign of the growing concern among prominent Democrats about the potential impact and political fallout of shutting down TikTok. The New York Times (NYSE:NYT) reported Trump is considering an executive order that would seek to allow TikTok to continue operating despite a pending legal ban until new owners are found. It was not immediately clear if Trump has the authority to do so given the legal divestiture requirements imposed by Congress. TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Trump transition, Karoline Leavitt, said, "President Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to save TikTok, and there's no better deal maker than Donald Trump." 'TALKS A BIG GAME' Still, several Republicans and Democrats remain concerned about Chinese ownership of the app, worried the Chinese government could use it as a tool to collect data on U.S. citizens and to spread propaganda to the public. "Trump talks a big game on China & wanted to ban TikTok - just like many Republicans voted to do," Representative Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, wrote on the social media platform X. "But now he's inviting TikTok's CEO to sit beside him at his inauguration even though TikTok is linked to the CCP & is a threat to our national security. What message does this send?" The prospect of a TikTok ban has already triggered some users to seek alternatives, with Chinese social media app RedNote gaining nearly 3 million U.S. users in one day earlier this week, according to analytics firm Similarweb (NYSE:SMWB). Reuters reported that TikTok plans to shut U.S. operations of its social media app on Sunday barring a last-minute reprieve, according to people familiar with the matter. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States.

US stock indexes were slightly lower on Thursday after posting strong gains on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid around 75 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite gave up early gains to edge lower shortly before 10:00 a.m. ET. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday: The mixed performance comes after the indexes posted sharp gains on Wednesday, with the Dow up over 700 points to mark the best trading day since a euphoric post-election rally in November. Stocks benefited from encouraging inflation data and strong earnings beats from big financial firms including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and BlackRock. Results from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley rounded out strong big bank results before Thursday's opening bell, both reporting that profits more than doubled last quarter. Meanwhile, fresh data showed retail sales climbed 0.4% in December, coming in slightly below consensus forecasts of a 0.5% increase. In Europe, indexes traded higher as luxury stocks finally got some relief, posting strong gains after Cartier's owner Richemont announced a quarterly sales record. Luxury stocks had largely struggled in 2024 amid weak consumer demand in China, with companies like Kering posting a 40% decline. Here's what else is happening: Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Worried old husband hugging anxious wife How are we feeling about the stock market, my fellow contrarian? More importantly, should we have an opinion on the market-at-large at all? I don’t think so. Trump 2.0 will create a “market barbell” of big winners and sad losers. Let’s focus on the dividend payers that will be propelled higher—and step over the laggards. There are some dandy dividends ready to dart higher. Today they sit in the bargain bin thanks to investor reservations about the Federal Reserve. When Chairman Jay Powell took the stage in December, he delivered a sober discourse to investors: Don’t expect as many rate cuts as you were hoping for. The lecture was not well received and seriously scared the herd. Fear is prevalent, per CNN’s Fear and Greed Index (FGI): Fear Greed Index Here at Contrarian Outlook we tend to fade the FGI. When emotions are running scared, we buy the bargains from the weak hands. They always have a reason for selling low. Granted, the narrative usually crumbles in the rearview mirror with the passage of time. But the vanilla financial websites must publish some reason that stocks are down today. These days, it’s the hawkish Fed. But is this really bad news? The 10-year Treasury yield has been (paradoxically) rising with each Fed rate cut. That’s not supposed to happen. This is the bond market screaming at Jay that there is no need for these cuts. The economy is fine. It absorbed the rate hikes, and we have seen neither a hard nor safe landing. In fact, we have seen no economic landing at all! Last Friday’s strong jobs report showed this. The unemployment rate fell once again to 4.1%. Remember the August pullback, when pundits and Fed officials alike were sure that we were heading into a recession? It triggered the “Taylor Rule”—a formula that is supposed to predict a recession. Last summer the Fed members seemed to hold the Taylor Rule as Gospel. The Taylor Rule is newer than the Gospel, however. It has been around since… 1992. That surprised me too, as it’s spoken of as if handed down in biblical times. I’m in favor of most trend comebacks from the 90s, but the Taylor rule should have stayed behind. So, the economy is humming, and the Fed finally admits it. Short-term rates will stay “higher for longer.” If this helps “contain” the 10-year yield below 5%, then I’m all for it. Higher short-term rates should contain the economy from overheating. (The path of constant rate cuts combined with “no landing” was not going to do it.) Which brings us to President-Elect Trump, who takes office in five days. The most Dow-friendly president in recent history takes office with a healthy dose of fear in the markets. It is tempting to buy the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average and be done with it—but we can do better. I’ve been running the numbers on how certain stocks performed during Trump 1.0 for clues how investing history may “rhyme” for the next four years. There are a few surprises not appreciated by the mainstream narrative. First, conventional wisdom says to dump healthcare stocks. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be running the Department of Health and Human Services. Sell ‘em all, right? Wrong! The top five holdings of this discounted 14%-paying dividend fund returned 126%, 141%, 179%, 227% and over 1,000% during Trump’s first administration, benefiting from lower regulation and a strong economy: BMEZ Holdings Yet the BlackRock Health Sciences Term Trust (BMEZ) fund sits at an 11% discount to its net asset value (NAV) on fears that RFK Jr. will obliterate the entire sector. Let’s take a deep breath. RFK does not determine what the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) does, which traditionally operates on its own independent of politics. Plus we have sector blue chips like UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) who are likely to roll along merrily as they did in Trump’s first term. UNH and ABT sailed 135% and 199%. Their businesses were good then, and they remain good now! UNH/ABT Total Returns What about energy? Crude oil rallied last Friday on the latest round of US sanctions against Russia. Is reduced supply coupled with a strong economy bullish for energy, or does Trump’s “drill baby, drill” mantra ultimately put a lid on prices? I’ve heard from careful readers concerned that Trump “drilled so much in the first term, he tanked oil.” It’s true that energy prices trended down all four Trump years, but the bear market in oil started in 2014—two years before 1.0—triggered by the US shale oil supply boom that began years prior. So, by the time Trump was inaugurated in 2017, these trends were already in motion. So I would not draw many conclusions from these two ugly charts, which feature two of our favorite dividend growers in the energy patch, EOG Resources (EOG) and EQT Corp (EQT): EOG/EQT Total Returns We must deal with government contractors on a case-by-case basis. The new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, is looking to eliminate $500 billion in spending. This is a potential headwind for federal-powered gravy trains. It’s possible we see a “peace dividend” as well. Trump may cut a deal with Russia to end the war in Ukraine or with China to ease tensions in the Pacific. Given these headwinds contractors are now generally in “stay away” territory. One exception I am making is for General Dynamics (GD), which is a backdoor play on AI automation at the federal government level. GD flatlined during Trump 1.0 but we have higher expectations this time around given the AI angle. AI plays a central role in General Dynamic’s IT strategy. It has deployed a Luna AI system that uses machine learning to draw insights from large reams of data. Luna is designed specifically for government and defense applications. The “Luna lift” is evident in GD’s new orders and total sales backlog. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: How blowout bank earnings and a promising inflation report gave the market a much-needed boost

Time Published: 2025-01-16T14:14:52Z

Hello there! A product going viral can be a double-edged sword for retailers. Just ask Walmart. The big-box store's e-commerce marketplace got a boost from an imitation Hermès' Birkin bag making the rounds, but dupes also cause headaches for brand relationships. In today's big story, US banks' impressive earnings and a hopeful inflation report have stocks back on the rise. What's on deck Markets: Anthony Scaramucci offers some economic predictions for Trump's second term. Tech: The VC world is starting to heal as Insight Partners raises a massive new fund. Business: Billionaires are booked and busy next week thanks to a scheduling conflict between the inauguration and Davos. But first, we're so back. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's alive! After a slow start to the year, the stock market finally showed signs of life thanks to blowout bank earnings and better-than-expected inflation data. The S&P 500 finished Wednesday up 1.83%, while the Dow (1.65%) and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite (2.45%) posted strong days. Let's start with Wall Street. Big US banks represent the unofficial kickoff to earnings season, and they didn't disappoint. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all beat analysts expectations. JPMorgan saw a 50% year-over-year increase in profits for the fourth quarter while Goldman's profits jumped an incredible 105%. The banking boom was largely driven by classic Wall Street businesses like corporate dealmaking, capital raising, and trading. December's inflation report also put extra wind in the market's sails. At first glance — inflation rose for the third straight month — the reading might not seem great. But a closer look showed the consumer price index's year-over-year increase matched consensus expectations, which is good. What's even better, though, is core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was slightly below expectations. It also came in lower than November's number. Before you get ahead of yourself, don't expect a slew of rate cuts. Instead, the data calmed investors' nerves by slowing the troubling rise of the 10-year Treasury yield, which dropped 0.14%. "Core Inflation isn't accelerating and that's the story. The market may have had its hair on fire about inflation running away again, but the data do not support that conclusion," said Jamie Cox, Managing Partner for Harris Financial Group. So what's next for Wall Street? In the short term, bankers might finally enjoy some healthy bonuses after a few slim years. Workers are starting to find out about their year-end comp. Bigger picture, it's more momentum for the industry's job market. After a lull in activity, firms are bolstering their ranks across the board for what appears to be an active 2025. The private markets are one area that'll remain in the spotlight. The sector, which includes less-liquid investments like private equity and private credit that come with higher fees, is of particular interest to BlackRock. The $11.6 trillion asset manager sees it as the key to its next stage of evolution, according to CEO Larry Fink. One evolution Fink didn't discuss was who will take over when he's gone. That's despite the recent departure of executive Mark Wiedman, which reignited questions about what life after Larry will look like at BlackRock. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was a little bit more forthcoming with his own retirement plans … sort of. When asked by an analyst who his successor was, Dimon said there are a number of great candidates, but a decision hasn't been made. And even if the bank did have someone in mind, there's no guarantee things won't change, Dimon added. 1. One of Trump's opps is feeling good about the economy. Despite being a longtime Trump critic, Anthony Scaramucci is pretty optimistic about the economy under the incoming 47th president. He sees Trump's pro-growth policies and potential crypto legislation as an economic boon — but he's still concerned about some of Trump's other promises. 2. Hindenburg Research is tapping out. Nate Anderson, founder of the short-selling firm, said he's disbanding it, once they've completed all outstanding projects. Hindenburg gained fame for its forensic financial research, often focusing on what it argued to be fraudulent or misleading corporate behavior. Anderson said he plans to share the firm's investigation tactics publicly. 3. Dividend stocks are so back. Large-cap stocks have dominated the market, but a change could be coming, according to Morningstar. As their valuations continue to climb, dividend stocks might become more palatable. Morningstar highlighted dividend stocks in four specific sectors savvy investors should pay attention to. 1. Mark Zuckerberg lost $60 billion in five years — and he's going to keep spending. Despite persistent predictions that the VR and AR headset market will boom, consumers just aren't interested. Meta lost big on the tech in the last few years, but that hasn't deterred Zuck, who keeps telling investors they should expect more losses in the future. 2. Exclusive: Insight Partners raises $12.5 billion for its newest set of funds. It's the largest sum raised by a venture capital firm in over two years, according to PitchBook data. Insight's $12.5 billion may be less than its initial funding goal, but it's still an impressive get as the industry looks to mount a comeback. 3. "TikTok refugees" flock to Chinese app RedNote. While some Americans are coping with a possible TikTok ban through memes, competitors like Texas-based app Clapper are seizing the moment. Other Americans are heading to the Chinese app Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote. It might be worth learning how to use it — but some members of Congress are already taking aim. 1. WFH + Fridays = OOO. For some remote workers, the W in WFH Friday is a bit of a stretch. They're turning every weekend into a three-day weekend, and they don't feel particularly bad about it, either. 2. Home Depot cofounders were investigated by the FBI in the '70s and '80s, new public records show. The FBI was investigating Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank over claims they used a slush fund in an attempt to bribe California Handy Dan employees to decertify their union, newly obtained records show. The investigation ended in 1983 when a prosecutor determined the case was too old and evidence was "insufficient." 3. Double-booked billionaires. January 20 is not only Trump's inauguration but also the first day of the World Economic Forum's high-profile conference in Davos, Switzerland. Conflicted guests will have to choose between missing potential face time with the new president or a day of brushing shoulders with the global elite. Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi won't be missing out on Trump's big day. Boeing's dismal 2024 deliveries show just how much of a challenge CEO Kelly Ortberg faces. UnitedHealth Group, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley report earnings.

Title: No Country For Young Fintechs: The U.K.’s Debanking Of Crypto Blockchain And Web3

Access denied rubber stamp. A survey of U.K. fintech and crypto firms found that 50 percent of the firms surveyed have been rejected from opening a bank account or had an account closed by a major U.K. bank. Only 14 percent managed to successfully apply for a bank account with one of "the CMA 9” - the nine biggest mainstream banks in the U.K. - without it being closed at a later date. These figures will shock policymakers following a decade of promoting the U.K. ecosystem as the global home of fintech and crypto, as well as the new Labour Government, with its stated intention of supporting innovation and digitization. The lack of access to this basic universal service has meant that firms from across the fintech, crypto, blockchain, and Web3 ecosystems have faced challenges in innovating and scaling, limiting their capacity to introduce new products and services while remaining competitive on a global scale. Katie Harries, who leads Stand With Crypto’s U.K. initiative commented, “The growing difficulties firms face is a huge barrier to growth. It’s not an issue reserved for start and scale-ups but also one medium and large companies face too. We are hugely supportive of Labour’s ambitious growth and investment plans but we currently have a situation where some of the U.K.’s most innovative companies are effectively being deprived of access to basic banking services – hampering these objectives.” The survey, conducted by the Startup Coalition , the U.K. Cryptoasset Business Council (UKCBC), and Global Digital Finance (GDF) found that 81 percent of respondents were legally based in the U.K. with 98 percent having activities in the U.K. “These challenges pose a significant threat to the U.K. Government's ambition to lead the global race in digital assets, as highlighted by the City Minister in a recent speech. Without meaningful action and progress in tackling barriers such as this, this vision will fall short,” commented Simon Jennings, executive director of the UKCBC. On the debanking crisis, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) stated in their report in September last year, “given the limitations of the data, [they] had not been able to draw detailed conclusions on the types of personal or business customers affected by suspensions, terminations and declines.” One firm surveyed and rejected by HSBC indicated on their survey response that they were “[rejected because of our] business profile (despite that we are an FCA Regulated firm).” The survey found 81 percent of firms agreed that difficulties accessing banking services are a significant barrier to their company succeeding in the U.K. and 70 percent had found that this made it more likely they would leave the U.K. “This obstacle has pushed many U.K. based firms to consider expensive alternatives like setting up accounts in locations such as Estonia, Poland, and Bulgaria,” says Marcus Foster, head of policy campaigns at the Startup Coalition. Adds Foster, “In the absence of adequate banking services, these firms are being pushed to seek out riskier financing and banking options. This also makes the U.K. a less attractive place to found a crypto or Web3 startup.” In France, the law governing cryptoasset regulation has a specific provision for the treatment of Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) or crypto-related businesses, to ensure that they cannot be discriminated against in terms of banking services. The law specifically states that they cannot be denied a bank account by virtue of being a designated VASP. Elise Soucie, executive director of global policy and regulation at GDF says, “Beyond France, other jurisdictions have implemented clear policies to enable access to banking for fintechs. For example, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has issued guidance stating that banks should endeavour to support licenses virtual asset service providers (VASPs) their legitimate need for bank accounts in Hong Kong, and the incoming U.S. administration has also made it clear that they plan to support the crypto and broader tech industry.” The U.S. crypto industry was prepared, to some extent, for regulation by enforcement in 2023, following the collapse of FTX, but evidence of Operation Chokepoint 2.0 sent a chill down the spines of crypto CxOs and financiers. Yet, in the past year, with Blackrock and a growing list of financial institutions launching hugely successful bitcoin ETPs and strong crypto overtures from a new incoming U.S. administration, positive changes appear afoot in the U.S. In public remarks leading up to the election, President Elect Trump made his stance clear vowing to create a “bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council.” A promise he has already delivered on with the nomination of David Sacks, the crypto and AI czar and Bo Hines as executive director of the incoming administration’s new “Crypto Council.” “The rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry,” stated Trump. If the U.S. does create crypto and fintech friendly rules, the U.K. risks falling further behind and losing firms, not only due to lack of clear regulatory frameworks, but also due to lack of access to basic needs such as a bank account. The U.K.’s 2021 ban on crypto derivatives, which was in contrast to industry consultation data including its own consumer survey data, and also in contrast to U.S. policy that saw the CFTC approve bitcoin options contracts on the CME in 2017, was a setback for the U.K. in it claim to be a global fintech hub. A clumsy start to the FCA's crypto registration scheme was another significant setback. Following the optimism for fintech created by the competition mandate granted to the FCA more than a decade ago, in response to the Great Financial Crisis and the failure of two of the four big U.K. banks, there is again much work to do in the U.K. to make Digital Britain attractive to fintechs and crypto firms across both retail and wholesale markets. Legislative progress has been made to promote the growth of digital assets. The Financial Services and Market Act (FSMA), 2023 aims to reform the capital markets, bring payment stablecoins into the scope of regulation, and strengthen the objectives of the financial services regulators including international competitiveness and growth. A new Property (Digital Assets Etc.) Bill, seeks to clarify that certain digital assets, such as crypto tokens, can be recognised as property, even if they do not fit into the two traditional categories of personal property in English and Welsh law. The Digital Securities Sandbox is also a positive development by the Bank of England and the FCA to help to deliver a smooth transition to the issuance, trading and settlement of digital securities in the U.K. While progress has been made laying the legal foundation to position the U.K. as a leading financial hub, much of this new policy and legislation often appears to favour incumbents, especially when taking into account that the U.K. fintech and crypto debanking issue is driven by the nine biggest banks in the U.K. This month, and following significant industry advocacy, HM Treasury amended a law to clarify that crypto staking doesn’t fall under the definition of a “collective investment scheme,” which is typically heavily regulated. While this is a welcome step, more is needed to close the crypto gap with other jurisdictions. Let's get back to first principles: For the U.K. to position itself as a hub for new fintech innovators in crypto, blockchain, and Web3, and to deliver on the promises of growth from the new Government, the debanking problem must be effectively addressed, and now. Fixing fintech debanking is Labour's opportunity to make a tangible change for digital innovators so that they will commit to build and grow new and transformational businesses in the U.K. Following the election, the Labour government now has their chance to fix this problem and fix it for good. With U.K. fintech funding down by a reported 68 percent in 2023, and global fintech funding down a further reported 20 percent in 2024, the U.K. is going to have to increase its incentives to fintechs and digital firms to attract both more homegrown talent and foreign interest and investment. A key action to remedy the debanking problem is to promote transparency, competition, and growth, and to mandate U.K. banks to move away from using generic statements justifying account refusal, especially on the grounds of being engaged with innovative digital technologies. This is especially relevant to innovative digital firms that have already demonstrated their compliance with regulatory and registration requirements. The big concern for fintechs is, that despite the progress the U.K. is making to deliver greater legal and regulatory as it relates to digital assets, it is being undermined as fintechs are further debanked and the crucial on-ramp from fiat to digital assets is choked off. As importantly, fintech debanking is making a mockery of the U.K. Government and its agencies, including the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), with the U.K.'s claim to be the “home of global fintech”, "crypto friendly", and "a global digital hub”. It appears none of these now, if it ever actually was. A web search of the top ten global fintech, crypto, blockchain, and Web3 companies is telling. The U.K. is likely to have future challenges competing for fintech talent and capital in the global digital space race, especially in crypto, blockchain, and Web3, where the largest market players are domiciled or headquartered outside of the U.K. This is not going to be made easier now that the U.K. Government has shifted its digital priorities to Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the digital solution to transform the economy and the lives of its citizens, where the big players are U.S. based. U.K Prime Minister Keir Starmer this week set out a blueprint to turbocharge AI with the promise that AI will deliver a decade of national renewal. While governments and their agencies are always keen on big new and exciting announcements, the fintech industry is set on holding the U.K. Government's feet to the fire on the debanking issue. It is time to fix fintech and crypto debanking in the U.K., now. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 68.42 points, or 0.2%, ending at 43,153.13. The S&P 500 index lost 12.57 points, or 0.2%, ending at 5,937.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 172.94 points, or 0.9%, closing at 19,338.29. A rough patch for stocks has left the Dow up only 2.2% since the Nov. 5 election, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Its peak "Trump bump" close of 45,014.04 on Dec. 4 had the index up 6.6% from its Nov. 5 close. Shares of Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. both fell more than 3% Thursday, even as longer 10-year Treasury yields logged a three-session decline of nearly 20 basis points. That was its biggest such drop since Aug. 5, according to Dow Jones Market Data — with the August three-day decline coming on the heels of a drastic unwind of the Japanese yen carry trade. The 10-year yield fell to 4.606% Thursday, retreating from its one-year high of 4.802% set on Monday. But a cautious tone remained in markets, with investors focused on what policies might be a top priority under the incoming Trump administration — and the Treasury market's likely reaction to them.

AAPL (U.S.: Nasdaq) Tesla TSLA (U.S.: Nasdaq) 21 hours ago By Joseph Adinolfi (SpotGamma) On Friday, options traders will face the first expiration of monthly contracts of 2025. Contracts tied to $4.2 trillion worth of stocks, ETFs and indexes will either be exercised, or expire worthless, according to data from SpotGamma. The $4.2 trillion figure is smaller than December's record-breaking "triple witching" expiration, which came in at $6.6 trillion, according to data from Asym 500. Still, SpotGamma founder Brent Kochuba pointed out that the value of single-stock options expiring is "unusually large," owing to Wednesday's strong stock-market rally. He added that the expiration could mark a near-term top for the market. "Relative call values surged due to yesterday's large rally, and the expiring of these calls may mark a short-term top in the market, particularly ahead of the inauguration and FOMC," Kochuba said in emailed commentary. 21 hours ago By Vivien Lou Chen U.S. government debt rallied for a third session on Thursday, pushing yields to their lowest closing levels in weeks, after Fed governor Christopher Waller opened the door to the possibility of three or four rate cuts in 2025. The 2-year yield ended at 4.237%, the lowest since Dec. 12. The 10-year rate finished at 4.606%, the lowest since Jan. 3.

Small-caps, utilities and real-estate stocks were being bought on the back of easing Treasury yields. The same wasn't the case for rate-sensitive technology stocks, including megacap names like Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. "We do think equity markets will continue to move up," said Luke Tilley, chief economist and head of economics, asset allocation and quantitative services for Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors, in an interview. But Tilley is also cautious on large-cap stocks due to uncertainty about policies from the second Trump administration that could drive the 10-year Treasury yield higher. He also expects the labor market to weaken from here and for inflation to ease further, opening up the potential for 100 basis points of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts in 2025.

AAPL (U.S.: Nasdaq) Tesla TSLA (U.S.: Nasdaq) Russell 2000 Index RUT (US Composite) U.S. 10 Yr BX:TMUBMUSD10Y (XTUP) 22 hours ago By Joy Wiltermuth The big three U.S. equity indexes were modestly lower Thursday, but small caps were bucking the trend. The Russell 2000 index was up 0.1% in the final hour of trade, but also outperforming its large-cap counterparts with a 3.5% gain so far this week, according to FactSet. The S&P 500 was struggling to secure a fourth straight day of gains Thursday, and was up 2.1% so far in the week. S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) Russell 2000 Index RUT (US Composite) 23 hours ago By Joy Wiltermuth Bank earnings set a positive tone this week as more major corporations gear up to roll out their quarterly results. Net interest margins, credit trends and overall consumer and business lending look very solid, said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. "I think that’s given investors a needed catalyst to say: Things are okay," he told MarketWatch. But any big disappointments in earnings, especially from highflying tech stocks, could deliver a shock to markets, he added. So could any aggressive rollout of tariffs by the Trump administration or any strong retaliatory response from U.S. trading partners, Saglimbene said. Inflation progress might be stalling in some areas, but Saglimbene said that isn't his main concern for 2025.  DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) 23 hours ago By Christine Idzelis An equal-weight measure of the S&P 500 was rising Thursday afternoon, even as major U.S. stock indexes traded down. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which tracks an index that equally weights stocks in the broad U.S. large-cap equities index, was up 0.6% in afternoon trading, according to FactSet data, at last check. The ETF was outperforming the S&P 500, which has heavy exposure to stocks in the information-technology sector. The S&P 500 was down 0.1% in afternoon trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%, according to FactSet data, at last check. S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF RSP (U.S.: NYSE Arca) DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) 23 hours ago By Joy Wiltermuth The tech-driven selloff in stocks was gathering some steam in afternoon trade, leaving the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 near their session lows. Dow was off about 115 points, or 0.3%, near 43,101. S&P 500 was 0.3% lower, near 5,932. Nasdaq Composite shed about 160 points, or 0.8%. S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) 1 day ago By Joy Wiltermuth Investors were "holding tight" as the nation's biggest banks kicked off fourth-quarter earnings season on a positive note and ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Management. "Basically, it's a bit of sideways movement" in stocks on mixed economic data and as the "earnings season is getting off to a good start," Cardillo told MarketWatch. The parade of earnings due to get under way next week could be a catalyst for a pullback — or it could pave the way for fresh record highs for stocks, he said. The bond market, however, has been paying close attention to Thursday's Senate confirmation hearing for Scott Bessent, the nominee for Treasury secretary, in order to get a sense of the incoming Trump administration's policy priorities. "He's making a big pitch for the extension of 2017 tax cuts," Cardillo said of Bessent. S&P 500 SPX (S&P US) DJIA DJIA (Dow Jones Global) Nasdaq COMP (Nasdaq) U.S. 10 Yr BX:TMUBMUSD10Y (XTUP) 1 day ago By Joy Wiltermuth Stocks and bond yields were meandering Thursday afternoon as investors tuned in to a Senate hearing for Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent for clues about the policy priorities of the incoming Trump administration. Standouts, however, in stocks were the S&P 500's rate-sensitive utilities and real-estate sectors, which were up 2.1% and 1.5%, respectively, according to FactSet. The broader S&P 500 was up less than 0.1%. The sharp rise in longer Treasury yields since November pulled both sectors lower. But they were getting a nice bounce as the 10-year yield pulled back to about 4.6% from a high of 4.8% earlier in the week.

Title: Flockerz Presale Hits $10.2M Before Launching in Less Than a Week. Next Meme Coin to Explode?

Things have never looked better for the crypto sector. According to CoinMarketCap figures, the global crypto market cap sits at $3.5T, with a 20.37% increase in the 24-hour trading volume and over $800M in EFTs net flow over the past 30 days. This new bullish movement comes after a series of Trump’s pro-crypto policies and upcoming TradFi innovations like Clearpool’s upcoming real-world asset (RWA) blockchain, Ozean, which are accelerating blockchain technology adoption. This blockchain integration with traditional finance (TradFi) could see RWA tokenization hit $50B in 2025 — an increase in liquidity that could drive growth across not only Bitcoin and stablecoins but also altcoins and emerging crypto projects. We’ve seen this positive trend extending to the meme coin sector, which has seen an 8.79% increase in market cap over the past week. New presales like Flockerz ($FLOCK), which already surpassed its $10M milestone, even have some traders speculating 100x returns post-listing. According to Clearpool CEO Jakob Kronbichler, for Decrypt, tokenized treasuries and stablecoins currently dominate the RWA sector. However, we could see other assets like commodities and real estate gain traction soon. As more use cases for RWA crop up and big companies like Clearpool and BlackRock pioneer the adoption of blockchain technology, it’s only a matter of time before other TradFi providers join in. For the broader crypto market, this could mean increased trust and widespread adoption of blockchain technology, as well as a bridging of the TradFi and DeFi sectors. This could increase adoption and liquidity in the DeFi sector, lifting new DeFi crypto projects to new heights. Upcoming crypto projects like Flockerz ($FLOCK) are already capitalizing off of the DeFi wave. $FLOCK, the project’s utility token, surpassed $10.2M in presale, attracting investor interest with its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and Vote-to-Earn system. According to the project’s whitepaper, Flockerz plans to redefine decentralization, giving all members of the FlockTopia (the project’s DAO) a voice in all project decisions, like: So far, the project has aced the first step of its roadmap, securing audits from both Coinsult and SolidProof and garnering the attention of thousands of followers on X and Telegram. Considering the presale’s momentum and Flockerz’s partnership with the upcoming DeFi product Best Wallet, some crypto traders and influencers think the token is poised for 100x returns post-listing in 2025. The meme coin could follow a similar trajectory to other DeFi meme projects before it, like $AI16Z, which saw an 84,500.95% one-year rise since its all-time low in October 2024, or $PENGU, which is still up 575.16% since its listing in early December. The Flockerz presale will end in six days (January 22), when $FLOCK will be officially listed on exchanges, after which the price is expected to boom. Until then, investors can buy $FLOCK at the current price ($0.0066883) and enjoy staking rewards of up to 271%. To join the presale, you just have to connect a hot wallet to the presale widget on the official Flockerz website. You can choose among hot wallets like Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, and Best Wallet, or use Wallet Connect to buy with any other compatible wallet. You can pay using $ETH, $USDT, or $BNB. Input the number of $FLOCK tokens to buy and confirm your transaction. Then, sit back and wait for the presale to end so you can claim your tokens. Just remember to save some crypto for the gas fees when the time comes. If you don’t yet have a crypto wallet, you can also set up a free Best Wallet account through Flockerz’s page. Considering the hype surrounding DeFi projects, meme coins, and a potential altcoin season, Flockerz could indeed become the next meme coin to explode in 2025, joining the ranks of other successful projects like $AI16Z and $PENGU. So far, the project’s presale success and marketing efforts suggest strong engagement and community support. But remember that crypto is a highly volatile market, and the trajectory of new tokens post-listing is often unpredictable.

Title: Carlyle lines up bankers for possible sale of British fund network Calastone, sources say

By Amy-Jo Crowley LONDON (Reuters) - Carlyle has lined up bankers to explore a sale of its British funds network and data business Calastone, which would be the latest deal in a sector that has attracted billions of pounds from investors, four people familiar with the matter said. The U.S. buyout group is working with Barclays (LON:BARC) to explore a sale of the London-headquartered business, a marketplace for trading and settling investment funds underpinned by blockchain technology, the people said. It also provides data on fund flows. The process is in its early stages and Carlyle is expected to proceed with an auction before the summer, two of the people said. It could fetch more than 20 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, or 600 million pounds ($731.52 million), in the event of a sale, based on deals in the wider financial technology and data sector, one of the people added. The four sources said a deal was not certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Carlyle and Calastone did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Barclays declined to comment. Calastone is expected to attract attention from global exchange and market infrastructure groups as well as private equity firms, three of the people said. A sale would mark the latest in a series of deals for companies that provide specialised financial technology and data to clients including banks, asset managers and investment groups, and that have changed hands at elevated valuation multiples. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) agreed to buy Preqin last year for 2.55 billion pounds. Calastone's customers span 4,000 fund distribution and fund manager clients in 57 countries, processing 270 billion pounds of investment value each month, the group's website said. It uses blockchain among other technologies to automate manual tasks including order routing, settlement and transaction reporting for asset and fund managers, which have been hampered by rising costs and inefficiency in the past, according to its website. Carlyle, which has $447 billion under management, bought Calastone from venture capital investor Octopus Ventures and Accel in 2020 for an undisclosed sum. Management, led by CEO Julien Hammerson (LON:HMSO), hold a minority stake in the business. Revenues at Calastone were 68.3 million pounds in 2023, up from 60.3 million pounds a year earlier, according to Companies House filings. ($1 = 0.8202 pounds)

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Pizza Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where YUM! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) stands against other best pizza stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Pizza is one of the most popular foods in North America. According to the Global Pizza Analysis Report 2024 released by Research and Markets, the global pizza market size was valued at around $148.6 billion in 2023. It is expected to reach $222.5 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.59% between 2023 and 2032. The primary reasons behind this growth are the shifting consumer dietary patterns influenced by rapid westernization, the increasing popularity of online pizza ordering platforms, and the introduction and popularization of healthier product variants, such as gluten-free, vegan, and low-calorie pizza options. Pizza Today surveyed 748 pizza business owners from across the US to develop the Pizza Industry Trends Report 2024. The report showed that online ordering was becoming the most popular norm in the industry, with 24.91% of respondents investing to upgrade their online ordering technology. In addition, pizzeria owners are directing around 78% of their advertising budgets to social media apps to boost growth and prominence. Around 65% of business owners surveyed showed signs of optimism regarding their annual sales, expecting growth in the next 12 months. Frozen pizzas are also a significant force in the industry due to their ease of availability, affordability, and convenience. According to Grand View Research, the US frozen pizza market was valued at $6.62 billion in 2022 and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% between 2023 and 2030. Consumers are increasingly shifting to this variety due to hectic lifestyles and other factors such as increased disposable income and a rise in the standard of living. In addition, frozen pizzas are becoming popular because they offer the same varieties as fresh pizza options, such as cheese pizza, meat pizza, veggie pizza, and more. Gluten-free frozen pizzas are also increasing in popularity due to the growing health consciousness among consumers and the increasing prevalence of gluten allergies, celiac disease, gluten intolerance, and other health reasons. The gluten-free segment is expected to grow with the fastest CAGR among all pizza categories, increasing by 9.2% between 2023 and 2030. Chicken dominated the toppings segment in the pizza market, with the highest share of more than 30% in 2022, according to statistics by Grand View Research. Companies offering chicken produce and toppings are benefitting from this trend. The popularity of chicken topping has also been supported by the increasing preference for healthier eating and the growth of fast-casual restaurants. However, the fastest growing segment remains to be bacon. The bacon segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.5% between 2023 and 2030. The regular/restaurant-style pizza segment dominated the market with the highest share, 55%, as of 2022. Furthermore, supermarkets and hypermarkets are the most prominent distribution channels for the pizza market. They had the highest share, more than 30%, in 2022. The primary reason behind this trend is the increasing convenience and variety offered by these channels. We sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 30 pizza stocks. We also considered cheese and flour stocks. We then selected the top 12 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey’s database. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders that have stakes in them as of fiscal Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Hedge Fund Holders: 34 YUM! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) operates around 58,000 restaurants in 155 countries and territories under four operating segments: Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell, and The Habit Burger Grill Divisions. Its Pizza Hut concept specializes in the sale of ready-to-eat pizzas. Although the company is facing a complex consumer environment due to the conflict in the Middle East, it grew profits by 3% year-over-year. Taco Bell US and KFC International are the two primary growth engines for the company. In fiscal Q3 2024, Taco Bell US outperformed the industry on comparable sales, and KFC International outperformed on unit growth. YUM! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) attained another milestone by surpassing 60,000 restaurants across the globe in fiscal Q3 2024. It increased its unit count by 547 units, reflecting 482 closures and 1,029 gross openings. It added 63 units to Pizza Hut in fiscal Q3 2024, driven by 292 gross unit openings. New unit openings for the brand were led by India, China, and the United States. YUM! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) is increasing its deployment of AI-driven capabilities to drive growth. This includes consumer feedback dashboards, One Touch labor scheduling and inventory management, quality control monitoring, and AI-driven marketing. It launched AI-driven marketing campaigns in fiscal Q3 2024, increasing consumer engagement and purchases. This innovation has the potential to improve the company’s marketing return on investment and increase its visibility. Overall, YUM ranks 3rd on our list of the best pizza stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of pizza stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

While policymakers have, since late September, cut interest rates and announced broad stimulus plans, details on highly anticipated fiscal support won't likely come until an annual parliamentary meeting in March. Official GDP figures for 2024 are due Friday. "China's fiscal stimulus is not yet enough to address the drags on economic growth ... We are cautious long term given China's structural challenges," BlackRock Investment Institute said in a weekly report Tuesday. The firm, which is modestly overweight Chinese stocks, indicated it was ready to buy more if the circumstances changed. Of growing urgency in the meantime is the drop in domestic demand, and worries about deflation. Consumer prices barely rose in 2024, up by just 0.5% after excluding volatile food and energy prices. That's the slowest rise in at least 10 years, according to records available on the Wind Information database. "Consumer spending remains weak, foreign investment is declining, and some industries face growth pressure," Yin Yong, Beijing city mayor, said Tuesday in an official annual report. The capital city targets 2% consumer price inflation for 2025, and aims to bolster tech development. While nationwide economic goals won't come out until March, senior economic and finance officials have told reporters in the last two weeks that fiscal support is in the works, and issuance of ultra-long bonds to spur consumption would exceed last year's. China's announced stimulus will begin to take effect this year, but it will likely take time to see a significant impact, Mi Yang, head of research for north China at property consultancy JLL, told reporters in Beijing last week. Pressure on the commercial property market will continue this year, and prices may accelerate their drop before recovering, he said. Rents in Beijing for high-end offices, called Grade A, fell 16% in 2024 and are expected to drop by nearly 15% this year, with some rentals even nearing 2008 or 2009 levels, according to JLL. New shopping centers in Beijing opened in 2024 with average occupancy rates of 72% — previously such malls would not be opened if the rate was below 75% or much closer to 100%, JLL said. Within a year, however, the new malls have seen occupancy rates reach 90%, the consultancy said. Unlike the U.S. during the Covid-19 pandemic, China has not handed out cash to consumers. Instead, Chinese authorities in late July announced 150 billion yuan ($20.46 billion) in ultra-long bonds for trade-in subsidies and another 150 billion yuan for equipment upgrades. China has already issued 81 billion yuan for this year's trade-in program, officials said this month. It covers more home appliances, electric cars and an up to 15% discount on smartphones priced at 6,000 yuan or less. Consumers who buy premium phones tend to upgrade and recycle their devices more frequently than buyers on the lower end of the market, indicating the government may want to encourage a new group to shorten their upgrade cycle, said Rex Chen, CFO of ATRenew, which operates stores for processing smartphones and other secondhand goods. Chen told CNBC on Monday he expects the trade-in subsidies program can boost recycling transaction volumes of eligible products on the platform by at least 10 percentage points, up from 25% growth in 2024. He also expects the government to carry out a similar trade-in policy for the next few years. However, it's less clear whether the trade-in program alone can lead to a sustained recovery in consumer demand. Nomura's Chief China Economist Ting Lu said in a report Tuesday that he expects the sales boost to fade by the second half of this year, and that tepid new home sales will limit demand for home appliances. Real estate and related sectors such as construction once accounted for more than a quarter of China's economy. When central authorities started cracking down on developers' high debt levels in 2020, that had ripple effects on the economy, alongside the Covid-19 pandemic. China shifted its stance on real estate in September following a high-level meeting led by President Xi Jinping that called for halting the sector's decline. Measures to prop up the sector include using a whitelist process to finish construction on the many apartments that have been sold but yet not been built due to developers' financial constraints. New apartments in China are typically sold ahead of completion. Jeremy Zook, lead analyst for China at Fitch Ratings, said the real estate market had yet not reached a bottom, and that authorities might provide more direct support. He pointed out that it was difficult for the economy to transition away from real estate, despite China's wishes to reduce its reliance on the sector for growth. The government's latest measures have helped the broader stock market rally, and lifted sentiment slightly. Sales of new homes in China's largest cities over the last 30 days have surged by nearly 40% from a year ago, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a Jan. 5 report. But they cautioned that high inventory levels in smaller cities indicate property prices "have further room to fall" and that homebuilding is "likely to remain depressed for years to come." In the relatively affluent city of Foshan — near Guangzhou city in southern China — housing inventory could take 20 months to clear in one district, and seven months in another district, according to a 2024 report from Beike Research Institute, a firm affiliated with a major housing sales platform in China. The city overall saw floor space sold last year fall by 16% to the lowest in 10 years, the report said. Complicating China's economic challenges are tensions with the U.S. Similar to Washington's export controls, Beijing has also made efforts to ensure national security by prioritizing domestic players in strategic sectors such as technology. That stance has pressured an increasing number of European businesses in China to localize — despite added costs and reduced productivity — if they are to retain customers in the country, the EU Chamber of Commerce in China said in a report last week. Official Chinese statements have also emphasized coupling security with development. A slogan for part of Beijing's efforts to support growth is an effort to build "security capabilities in key areas," pointed out Yang Ping, director of the investment research institute within the National Development and Reform Commission. She was speaking at a press event Wednesday. This year, "boosting consumption has been prioritized ahead of improving investment efficiency," Yang said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. "Expanding and boosting consumption are the main focus of this year's policy adjustment." She dismissed concerns that the impact of trade-in subsidies on consumption would fade after an initial spike, and indicated more details would emerge after the March parliamentary meeting.

A close-up of a cryptocurrency mining rig in a large warehouse facility. Shares of Hut 8 Corp. (NASDAQ:HUT), a Bitcoin mining firm, increased by 10.06 percent on Wednesday to finish at $26.26 apiece as investor sentiment was buoyed by positive developments surrounding the cryptocurrency industry ahead of the Trump administration. Hut 8 Corp. (NASDAQ:HUT)’s stock price rallied in line with higher Bitcoin prices, which as of Wednesday was retesting its resistance level of $100,000, over news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is set to begin overhauling cryptocurrency policies as soon as President-elect Donald Trump assumes office next week. Among the measures likely to be considered are initiating a process that could result in clearer guidance and rules on when the agency deems a cryptocurrency to be a security, as well as reviewing pending crypto enforcement cases in the courts. The news sparked optimism for a stronger cryptocurrency market and the potential end of regulatory crackdowns, particularly with the appointment of pro-cryptocurrency former SEC official Paul Atkins to lead the commission. Overall, HUT ranks 6th on our list of Wednesday’s top gainers that lead rally. While we acknowledge the potential of HUT as a leading investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Photo Credit: Reuters RIL Chairperson Mukesh Ambani first hinted at a blockchain integration plan for Jio in August 2023 Jio Platforms Ltd. (JPL) has announced a partnership with the Polygon blockchain as it plans its venture into Web3 technology. Reliance's telecom subsidiary, Jio is looking to introduce features that rely on Web3 technology, on its existing features that are available to over 450 million users. JPL is looking to explore new capabilities offered by Web3 technology and offer an enhanced digital experience to its users, according to the company. Over the last eight years, Reliance Jio has expanded from offering telecom services to like online and offline shopping stores, media streaming platforms, video conferencing, a web browser, cloud gaming service, and security services. Jio and Polygon have yet to reveal which of the operator's applications and services will be the first to be upgraded with blockchain capabilities. It is expected to be one of the biggest efforts to integrate Web3 technology with existing services in the country. Speaking to Gadgets 360, Aishwary Gupta from Polygon said this development marks a big move for Web3 in India. Gupta is the global head of payments and fintech at Polygon. “This is one of the biggest partnerships we have in India and the idea for us is to help Jio to enable Web3 components in its existing product suite,” Gupta said. “There are a couple of products we are working to integrate on as we speak. From an Indian perspective it's a big move where we want to get India web3 enabled and this helps us in that direction,” he added. RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani first hinted at a blockchain integration plan for Jio in August 2023. During the 46th annual general meeting of Reliance Industries, Ambani had said that the Jio Financial Services (JFS) will be the brand's point of entry into the Web3 sector. At the time it was disclosed that through JFS, Reliance will offer management services for digital assets. Details about JFS' foray into Web3 have not been out since. Last year, media reports suggested that JFS and BlackRock were planning a wealth management venture and had filed with the National Stock Exchange of India in April 2024. While Reliance has chosen not to expose its users to services around volatile crypto assets, the company has worked with other Web3 technologies. In 2023, Reliance General Insurance said it had begun accepting the eRupee CBDC for premium payments. The same year, Reliance Retail had also announced that it would let shoppers pay via the eRupee CBDC across its stores in Mumbai. Commenting on the partnership with Polygon, JPL CEO Kiran Thomas said in a prepared statement that, "Joining forces with Polygon Labs marks a significant milestone in Jio's journey towards digital excellence. We are excited to explore the boundless possibilities of Web3 and bring unparalleled digital experiences to our users."

January 16, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: SAGA Metals Corp. SAGA Metals Corp. VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Jan. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SAGA Metals Corp. ("SAGA" or the "Company") (TSXV: SAGA) (OTCQB: SAGMF) (FSE: 20H), a North American exploration company focused on critical mineral discovery, is pleased to provide a complete overview of the Radar Titanium-Vanadium (Ti-V) Project as equipment, fuel, diamond drill and personnel begin to arrive in Labrador for the maiden drill program set to commence in a weeks time. Radar Titanium-Vanadium (Ti-V) Project – Labrador, Canada The Radar Ti-V Property is located 10km south of Cartwright in Labrador, Canada. The project spans 17,250 hectares and benefits from road access, supporting efficient exploration and development. Radar’s Hawkeye zone is the most prospective target on the property. Detailed geophysics and surface samples are suggestive of a complex and multi-phased layered mafic intrusion that may be upwards of 1km wide, 4km long and potentially over 600m deep. Recent geophysics completed on the property show very detailed correlation to the rock samples and observed phase changes in the system. SAGA aims to complete a 1,500m drill program at the Hawkeye zone over the area encompassing the anomalous TiO2 and V2O5 surface samples. Radar Project Surface Assay Highlights Include: Radar Project Target Zones: Radar Project and corresponding geophysics highlight multiple anomalies across the property Assay results have confirmed the magnetic anomalies within both the Hawkeye and Trapper zones are mineralized, establishing a combined strike of just over 8km in length between the two zones. Preliminary indications suggest a possible connection between the trends through a transitional zone, which increases the mineralized strike to ~9.5km through verified samples. Maiden Drill Program Q1 2025: Drilling is scheduled to commence this month with a minimum 1,500m program at the Radar Ti-V Projects. The Hawkeye zone is the most advanced zone with both surface samples and detailed geophysics creating clear drill targets. Assays have returned consistent values between 2.5 - 11.1% TiO2 and 0.2 - 0.66% V2O5, confirming the presence of high-grade titanium & vanadium across a potential 1km wide and 4km long trend further confirmed with geophysics. Recent Geophysics of the Hawkeye Zone Highlights: SAGA Metals successfully completed a detailed magnetic and electromagnetic (EM) survey over the northwest section of the Hawkeye Zone at the Radar Project. Utilizing ground-based equipment on a tightly spaced grid, with 25 meters between stations and 50-meter line spacing, the survey delivered high-resolution magnetic and conductivity data. This effort has proven highly effective in mapping magnetite-rich zones within the Gabbro Norite host rock, a key indicator of titanium (TiO₂) and vanadium (V₂O₅) mineralization. The magnetic survey was so successful that the high-resolution imagery combined with sample assays and field observations can be used to map some of the most distinguishing features of the system throughout this zone. Spanning nearly 1km in width with a near-vertical orientation the Hawkeye zone is the most prospective target on the property with geophysics now defining the phases of a layered mafic intrusion sampled in the 2023-2024 field programs. The results of this survey provide exceptional clarity, combining high-definition imagery with sample assays and field observations to identify distinct geological phases within the Hawkeye Zone. The eastern portion of the zone is characterized by alternating silica-rich (magnetite-depleted) bands and high-grade magnetite layers, with titanium and vanadium grades ranging from 5 to 11% TiO₂ and 0.3 to 0.66% V₂O₅. Moving westward, the system transitions into gabbro norite rocks containing disseminated magnetite. These rocks exhibit consistent but lower grades, averaging 3 to 5% TiO₂ and 0.1 to 0.2% V₂O₅. Geophysics completed over a targeted area within the Hawkeye Zone increasing width to 1km and a projected 4km strike Magnetic Inversion Interpretation: SAGA continued to update its geophysics with the magnetic inversions of the Hawkeye zone. Completed by Chris and David Mark of Geotronics, the magnetic inversions can project, with a high degree of certainty up to 400 meters in depth, what the mineralized magnetic body looks like beneath the surface. Magnetic inversion of the Hawkeye zone looking north-northeast. Range of > 0.02 susceptibility cut off. Same magnetic inversion of the Hawkeye zone looking east at profile cross section with > 0.02 susceptibility cut off. Petrographic Analysis at the Radar Ti-V Project: Recent petrographic work completed by Dr. Al Miller on rock samples from the Hawkeye zone have increased the understanding of the mineralogical host of titanium and vanadium mineralization at the Radar project. This sets the foundation for the metallurgical work the team hopes to be able to build on during the 2025 drill programs. First look at the petrography of the Hawkeye zone reveals more than one composition of magnetite; evidence which contributes to the hypothesis of multiphase mineralization events. Additionally, petrographic evidence reveals that much of the titanium and vanadium mineralization occurs within magnetite with a lack of ilmenite in many of the layers. This is key to understanding how these elements are locked up together and ultimately how they’ll separate during extraction. These layers have assayed high TiO2% and V2O5% leading to the use of Vanadium Titanomagnetite (VTM) classification of several mineralized layers of the Hawkeye zone. Ilmenite with exsolution lamellae of the magnetite was observed but only in a few cases. This has contributed to what can be called differential compositional layering and multiple mineralization magmatic layering events. VTM’s are a mineralization style that has not received much attention in North America but is a pivotal piece of China’s iron, titanium and vanadium mining and production industry. Trapper Zone Shows Promising Titanium and Vanadium Anomalies Despite Limited Exposure: The Trapper Zone spans a strike length of ~4.3km, slightly longer than the Hawkeye Zone, though it has significantly less surface exposure. The lack of outcrop and subcrop initially posed challenges for the exploration team; however, the implementation of an extensive soil grid successfully yielded the first geochemical confirmation of the Trapper Zone’s correlation with previously identified geophysical anomalies. Key findings from the Trapper Zone include: Although only 30 rock samples were collected due to limited exposure and ground cover, the consistent anomalies found in both soil and rock samples provide compelling evidence to justify targeted exploration in this zone. Further work, including additional surface sampling, trenching, and geophysical surveys, is planned to unlock the full potential of the Trapper Zone in 2025. Transition Zone Presents Key Opportunity for Further Understanding of Radar Ti-V System: A possible third, transitional zone, located between the Hawkeye and Trapper zones, presents a significant opportunity for further exploration. While its relationship to either zone remains unclear, this transitional area could help determine whether the Hawkeye and Trapper zones are folded limbs of the same system or represent different phases of a multi-phase, complex layered mafic intrusion. Comparable Projects in the Grenville Geological Province: A Map of the Grenville Geological Province The Grenville Geological Province is known for its significant deposits of iron, titanium, vanadium (Fe-Ti-V), and Platinum Group Metals (PGM). A key comparison point is North America's largest titanium-vanadium project, located at Lac Tio in Quebec, just southwest of SAGA's Radar Project. Notably, both projects share the same rich geological setting. Strategic Resources is a Montreal-based development company focused on vanadium, high-purity iron ore and titanium with their BlackRock project located in Quebec west of Lac Tio right on the Grenville Front (as seen in the map above). Like, the Radar Ti-V project, these projects all have basement rock dated over 1 billion years old, and all share components of the deep-rooted mafic rock of the Grenville Province. Strategic Resources completed an amended feasibility study1 on March 26, 2024, on the Southwest deposit hosted within the BlackRock project confirming a proven and probably reserve of 127.8Mt with 0.46% V2O5, 40.2% Fe2O3 and 7.8% TiO2. The Southwest deposit spans 2.5km in length and averaging 110m in mineralized thickness with a projected mine life of 39 years. The projected financial outcome of the mine estimates after-tax cashflows of C$12.055 billion with a 5.4-year payback period including an after-tax net-present-value (8%) of C$1.932 billion and an 18.2% after-tax internal rate of return. Michael Garagan, CGO & Director of SAGA Metals Corp. commented: “All the final preparations are underway in Labrador. Equipment and fuel have been shipped and will arrive any day. Core logging and on-site lay down areas are being prepared. Our team, including myself, and the drilling contractors are all set to arrive early next week with our first diamond drill turning shortly thereafter. This project is a testament to our corporate mandate of completing the necessary due diligence and robust investigation to find exploration worthy grass roots projects. Radar has the potential of unlocking value with our first zone; one of potentially multiple zones on our property confirming high-grade mineralization at surface in a 1km by 4km area and potentially over 600m at depth. Needless to say, we are very excited to commence drilling on two projects in Q1.” About SAGA Metals Corp.

Title: Stocks surge after US inflation eases

Asian markets extended a global rally Thursday after below-forecast US inflation provided a much-needed shot of relief to investors and revived hopes for interest rate cuts this year. Strong earnings from Wall Street banking titans and a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas added to the optimistic mood on trading floors. Still, there remains a certain amount of caution ahead of Donald Trump returning to the White House next week, having promised to ramp up tariffs on imports, and slash taxes and regulations that many fear could reignite inflation. Data on Wednesday showing core consumer prices rose less than expected in December helped spur a surge in New York-listed stocks led by tech giants including Nvidia, Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet. The S&P 500 and the Dow piled on more than one percent and the Nasdaq more than two percent, putting them back in the green for 2025, with healthy earnings reports from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon also lifting sentiment. The inflation figures tempered worries that the Federal Reserve might not cut rates this year — or possibly even hike them — following a blockbuster jobs report on Friday. Swap traders are now eyeing a reduction in July, having been looking at September or October at best. New York president John Williams also provided some soothing comments, saying “the process of disinflation remains in train”. Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, said: “Data on economic growth has continued to roll in stronger than expected, contributing to the upward revision in our 2024 expectation. “However, strong growth has helped generate a large rise in bond yields. If it persists, higher borrowing costs will seriously degrade (gross domestic product) growth in 2025 and 2026. “Still, we expect the Fed to respond adroitly to decelerating growth in 2025 and 2026 with hefty rate cuts, ultimately triggering a growth rebound in 2027 and 2028.” Asian markets rose across the board. Hong Kong, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei, Manila and Jakarta all piled on more than one percent, while there were also gains in Shanghai, Singapore and Wellington. Tokyo also edged up but was limited by a pick-up in the yen against the dollar after the inflation data and as investors assess the chances of a rate hike by the Bank of Japan at its meeting next week. Oil prices also extended a surge this week fuelled by fresh US-UK sanctions on Russia’s energy sector and amid fears Trump will ramp up measures against key producer Iran when he takes the Oval Office. Meanwhile, data Wednesday showed US inventories fell for an eighth week to their lowest since April 2022, with the International Energy Agency saying a colder winter has pushed global demand higher.

Still, there remains a certain amount of caution ahead of Donald Trump returning to the White House next week, having promised to ramp up tariffs on imports, and slash taxes and regulations that many fear could reignite inflation. Data on Wednesday showing core consumer prices rose less than expected in December helped spur a surge in New York-listed stocks led by tech giants including Nvidia, Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet. The S&P 500 and the Dow piled on more than one percent and the Nasdaq more than two percent, putting them back in the green for 2025, with healthy earnings reports from Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and Bank of New York Mellon also lifting sentiment.

Title: Meta just flipped the switch that prevents misinformation from spreading in the United States
URL: https://www.platformer.news/meta-ends-misinformation-enforcement-zuckerberg/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
The company built effective systems to reduce the reach of fake news. Last week, it shut them down I. Last week, Meta announced a series of changes to its content moderation policies and enforcement strategies designed to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration. The company ended its fact-checking program in the United States, stopped scanning new posts for most policy violations, and created carve-outs in its community standards to allow dehumanizing speech about transgender people and immigrants. The company also killed its diversity, equity and inclusion program. Behind the scenes, the company was also quietly dismantling a system to prevent the spread of misinformation. When the company announced on Jan. 7 that it would end its fact-checking partnerships, the company also instructed teams responsible for ranking content in the company’s apps to stop penalizing misinformation, according to sources and an internal document obtained by Platformer. The result is that the sort of viral hoaxes that ran roughshod over the platform during the 2016 US presidential election — “Pope Francis endorses Trump,” Pizzagate, and all the rest — are now just as eligible for free amplification on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads as true stories. In 2016, of course, Meta hadn’t yet invested huge sums in machine-learning classifiers that can spot when a piece of viral content is likely a hoax. But nine years later, after the company’s own analyses found that these classifiers could reduce the reach of these hoaxes by more than 90 percent, Meta is shutting them off. Meta declined to comment on the changes. Instead, it pointed me to a letter and a blog post in which it had hinted that this change was coming. The letter was sent in August by Zuckerberg to Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. In it, Zuckerberg expressed his discomfort with the Biden Administration’s efforts to pressure the company to remove certain posts about COVID-19. Zuckerberg also expressed regret that the company had temporarily reduced the distribution of stories about Hunter Biden’s laptop, which Meta and Twitter had both done out of fear that they had been the result of a Russian hack-and-leak operation. The few hours that the story’s distribution was limited would go on to become a Republican cause célèbre. As a kind of retroactive apology for bowing to censorship requests in the past, and for the company’s own actions in the Hunter Biden case, Zuckerberg said that going forward, the company would no longer reduce the reach of posts that had been sent to fact checkers but not yet evaluated. Once they had been evaluated, Meta would continue to reduce the reach of posts that had been designated as false. In hindsight, this turned out to be the first step toward killing off Meta’s misinformation efforts: granting hoaxes a temporary window for expanded reach while they awaited fact checking. That brings us to the blog post: Joel Kaplan’s “More speech, fewer mistakes,” which was published last Tuesday and among other things announced the end of the company’s US fact-checking partnerships. Buried toward the bottom were these two sentences: At the time, Kaplan did not elaborate on which of these demotions the company planned to get rid of. Platformer can now confirm that misinformation-related demotions have been eliminated at the company. The company plans to replace its professional fact-checking program with volunteers from the user base appending information to posts in a system modeled after X’s community notes. But Meta has offered few details on how the program will work, and has not said when it will become available. As a result, Meta has chosen to open a window for viral hoaxes to spread unchecked on its properties while it works to build a new system to mitigate their impact. II. Meta’s efforts to detect misinformation had their roots in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election. In response to outrage over the spread of “Pope endorses Trump” and other hoaxes in the run-up to Trump’s election, Meta promised lawmakers and regulators around the world that it would take steps to improve the quality of information on its platforms. From the start of that initiative, Meta’s integrity teams worked hand-in-hand with the third-party fact checkers it hired after the election. In a 2018 blog post, the company explained the variety of signals it used to determine whether its ranking algorithms might be showing you something false: Notably, none of these changes actually eliminated anyone’s freedom of expression. Instead, they restricted what the technologist Aza Raskin has termed “freedom of reach.” Fact-checking and down-ranking obviously false stories allowed liars and hoaxsters to express themselves but sought to limit the negative effects of those lies on Meta’s customers. In May 2020, at the height of the pandemic, Meta boasted about how well this effort was working. In a blog post, the company said that 95 percent of people who saw labels warning that a post contained misinformation declined to view it. The company said that in March 2020 alone, it displayed warnings related to COVID-19 on 40 million posts. Going forward, Meta will instead ask users to add their own annotations to these and other posts. Academics, journalists, lawmakers, and other interested parties will undoubtedly still conduct their own reviews of viral posts on Meta platforms in the coming months to assess the misinformation landscape. But they’ll be doing it without a critical tool they used in the past: CrowdTangle, a free services that exposed what posts on Facebook and Instagram were most popular via searchable real-time dashboards. Meta killed off CrowdTangle in August, directing users instead to an alternative that lacks many of CrowdTangle’s core features. In publishing this story, I realize that I may be giving ammo to those who believe that misinformation is a root cause of our polarization in the United States. As Joe Bernstein wrote in Harper’s 2021, discussions of misinformation sometimes lend too much credence to the idea that algorithms are all-powerful shapers of reality, and fail to reckon with the fact that people will always seek out information that aligns with their worldview. Their demand for that information, whether it is true or false, may be the most important factor leading to its creation and its spread. But it’s possible to believe that a total fixation on misinformation is counterproductive and also believe in the idea of harm reduction: that sophisticated systems that accurately identify hoaxes and then show them to fewer people ought to be left in place, at least until their replacement has been rolled out and evaluated for its effectiveness. For now, these changes only apply to the United States — though you get the sense that Zuckerberg would happily roll them out anywhere else he’s allowed to.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Experian's significant retail investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 37% ownership Institutions own 48% of Experian Every investor in Experian plc (LON:EXPN) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 51% stake, retail investors possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Meanwhile, institutions make up 48% of the company’s shareholders. Institutions often own shares in more established companies, while it's not unusual to see insiders own a fair bit of smaller companies. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Experian, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Experian Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Experian does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Experian's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Experian. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 4.8% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 4.7% and 4.4% of the stock. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Experian plc. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own UK£61m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a substantial 51% stake in Experian, suggesting it is a fairly popular stock. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Experian better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 2 warning signs with Experian , and understanding them should be part of your investment process. Ultimately the future is most important.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Defy Market’s Bullish Momentum. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS) stands against the other stocks. Wall Street's main indices all finished in the green territory on Wednesday, as investors cheered an unexpectedly slower inflation rate in December. The Dow Jones jumped by 1.65 percent, while the S&P surged by 1.83 percent. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite index soared 2.45 percent. Ten companies under mixed sectors bucked an overall positive market sentiment amid a series of negative factors weighing on investor sentiment.

A healthcare worker in a lab coat, holding a microscope and reflecting on the diagnosis of a patient. Viatris Inc. (NASDAQ:VTRS), an American global pharmaceutical and healthcare company, registered a 2.82-percent drop in its share prices on Wednesday to end at $11.39 per share as investors sold off positions following analyst remarks that the company already entered the oversold territory. The news further dampened investor sentiment. Viatris’ (VTRS) shares dropped by 4.92 percent in the past week alone, by 9.10 percent during the past month, by 3.06 percent over the past year, and by a whopping 47.41 percent in the past five years alone.

Title: Is Tokenization The Future Of Index And Exchange-Traded Funds?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/01/15/is-tokenization-the-future-of-index-and-exchange-traded-funds/
Time Published: 2025-01-16T03:52:51Z
Full Content:
Index and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the landscape of investing over the past few decades. They have opened the markets to millions of investors, offering accessible investment solutions. In the past decades, technological and financial innovations have been greatly interlinked, and it seems that the next step in financial innovation is the tokenization of these funds. Based on research, policy papers, and initiatives from leading international organizations and financial institutions, such as the World Economic Forum, Franklin Templeton, or Deutsche Börse, it is highly plausible that tokenization will be the next major development in the financial world, as Larry Fink (and other) envisioned. “ETFs are step one in the technological revolution in the financial markets. Step two is going to be the tokenization of every financial asset.” – Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock In this article, we will explore the evolution of ETFs from their origins as index funds, analyze the factors contributing to their widespread popularity among investors, and discuss the potential advantages of transitioning ETFs into tokenized formats. SUQIAN, CHINA - MAY 1, 2024 - Illustration ETF, Suqian, Jiangsu province, China, July 1, 2024. ... [+] (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) The rise of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is closely connected with the history of index investing. Index investing allows investors to diversify and ultimately apply well-known portfolio investing strategies, minimizing their risks. Back in the 1970s, the idea of index investing came around. Influential works like Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street (1973) argued that most investors would be better off with a low-cost, diversified portfolio that tracked a broad market index rather than attempting to beat the market. This concept laid the foundation for what would become a major shift in investment strategy. Shortly after the book came out, in 1973, Wells Fargo and American National Bank launched the first index mutual funds for institutional customers. Just a few years later, Vanguard, led by John Bogle, introduced the First Index Investment Trust, a fund that tracked the S&P 500. Initially starting with only $11 million, this fund was met with skepticism and mockingly dubbed "Bogle's folly." However, the fund's long-term success, now known as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, proved its critics wrong and remains one of the largest and most successful mutual funds in history. This marked the beginning of a shift toward passive investing—investing in a portfolio that tracks market indices rather than actively trying to outperform them. Innovation often finds its roots in financial crises, as seen with the emergence of Bitcoin following the 2007–2008 financial meltdown, the same was the case for the birth of ETFs after the 1987 stock market crash. During the 1987 crash, institutional investors identified a critical need to trade large stock volumes quickly and on an intraday basis. In response, a Los Angeles-based firm, Leland, O'Brien, and Rubinstein, proposed a novel idea in 1990: grouping stocks into a “basket” and placing it on an exchange to trade it as a single unit. This concept materialized as the SuperTrust fund. Despite its innovation, SuperTrust struggled due to high minimum investment requirements and fizzled out after a few years. When ETFs were officially introduced in 1993, they debuted quietly, drawing little attention from average investors. For nearly a decade, trading activity remained minimal, with ETFs only surpassing 1% of fund trading volume by 2000, despite their growing recognition among major investors. Today, ETFs are among the most popular investments for institutional and individual investors, usually accounting for between 26% to 30% of the daily trading volume in the U.S. in recent years. With further DLT innovation, we see more and more affinity towards the tokenization of financial assets and, potentially, of ETFs. Tokenization of ETFs is not the same thing as the Crypto ETFs In 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin ETFs and ETPs and approved the sale of spot ETFs in the United States. The SEC combined proposals from the Nasdaq, NYSE, and CBOE exchanges, which requested changes to existing rules to allow the trading of Ethereum Exchange-Rraded Products (ETPs) and ETFs. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are financial instruments tracking Bitcoin’s price by holding the actual cryptocurrency in reserve and backing each share of the ETF with real Bitcoin. These ETFs allow investors to invest in Bitcoin without the need to buy, store, or manage Bitcoin themselves in a specific crypto wallet. They function similarly to traditional ETFs but focus specifically on BTC as the underlying asset. As of December 2024, there were twelve spot Bitcoin ETFs available in the United States. Within nine months of launch, these products accumulated over $49 billion in assets across the top providers, demonstrating strong market demand for regulated crypto investment vehicles. The SEC's approval of options trading for BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust in September 2024 further legitimized this new asset class within traditional financial frameworks. However, the tokenization of classical ETFs is different from Bitcoin ETFs. Tokenization of ETFs changes not the underlying financial asset but the underlying technology. It promises to enhance their value by transforming them into decentralized digital assets that can be created more swiftly and cost-effectively. Decentralizing enables instant trading without the need for traditional intermediaries, thereby reducing or eliminating associated institutional fees. Such advancements increase accessibility, improve liquidity, and streamline transactions for investors, but might be concerning from the perspective of investors’ protection and sufficient oversight and control over the trading. The financial industry is experiencing a transformative moment as it navigates the intersection between traditional financial systems and emerging blockchain technology. According to Franklin Templeton's survey conducted in November 2024, financial institutions face significant challenges in their efforts to tokenize traditional assets such as equities, bonds, and funds. The existing technological infrastructure and deeply entrenched systems have proven resistant to wholesale replacement, requiring a more gradual approach to transformation. Rather than attempting an immediate transition to fully tokenized assets, the industry is adopting a staged evolution toward a digital financial ecosystem. The initial phase of this transformation, commonly referred to as "ETF-ization," is already gaining momentum across the financial sector. ETFs have emerged as the ideal vehicle to bridge traditional and digital finance, primarily due to their inherent flexibility and well-established regulatory framework. This strategic approach offers several significant advantages for the industry's digital transformation. ETFs excel at facilitating the efficient “bundling” of diverse assets, allowing for seamless integration of both traditional and alternative investments within a single instrument. This capability has proven particularly valuable as institutions seek ways to incorporate non-traditional assets into conventional portfolio structures. Furthermore, ETFs provide an excellent testing ground for new technological infrastructure, allowing financial institutions to experiment with digital innovations while operating within familiar regulatory boundaries. The transition toward tokenized ETFs presents complex technical challenges that require careful consideration and innovative solutions. The industry must develop robust systems that can reliably track ownership and maintain secure custody of assets across both traditional and digital platforms. A fundamental requirement for tokenized ETFs is the implementation of sophisticated ownership tracking systems that can seamlessly integrate with both traditional financial infrastructure and blockchain networks, which is not an easy ask. These systems must maintain accurate asset ownership records while ensuring secure custody arrangements that meet regulatory requirements. Financial institutions are developing new security protocols to protect against emerging threats unique to the digital asset space. One such threat is "dusting" attacks, where malicious actors send minimal amounts of cryptocurrency to wallet addresses in attempts to deanonymize their owners. Understanding and mitigating these new forms of security risks is crucial for the industry's evolution. The success of tokenized ETFs depends heavily on achieving seamless interoperability between traditional financial systems and blockchain networks. This requires the development of standardized data formats and communication protocols that can facilitate efficient information exchange across different platforms. Smart contract capabilities must be integrated thoughtfully to ensure automated processes maintain the same level of security and reliability as traditional methods. The expansion of tokenized ETFs introduces several significant challenges, as outlined in the recent OECD Policy Paper on Tokenisation of Assets and DLT in Financial Markets, which must be carefully managed to ensure market stability and investor protection. The introduction of tokenized ETFs could alter existing market-making models. Traditional market makers may need to adapt their strategies and systems to accommodate tokenized assets, which may temporarily affect market liquidity and price discovery mechanisms. A particular concern is the potential fragmentation of liquidity between traditional and tokenized markets. When the same asset trades in both tokenized and traditional forms, there's a risk of creating separate liquidity pools that could operate with different pricing dynamics. This bifurcation could be particularly pronounced during periods of market stress, potentially leading to pricing discrepancies and arbitrage opportunities. Price discovery mechanisms may also evolve as tokenized ETFs gain prominence. While DLT offers enhanced transparency for transaction data and asset characteristics, the potential for trading across multiple platforms—both on-chain and off-chain—could create challenges for efficient price discovery. This is especially relevant for "real-world assets" that maintain both traditional and tokenized representations. Financial institutions must develop robust cybersecurity frameworks specifically designed for tokenized assets. These frameworks need to address not only traditional security concerns but also blockchain-specific vulnerabilities. Regular security audits and updates will be crucial to maintaining system integrity. Regulatory compliance presents another significant challenge, particularly given the global nature of digital assets. Institutions must navigate varying regulatory requirements across jurisdictions while ensuring their tokenized ETF offerings maintain compliance with all applicable rules. This may require sophisticated compliance monitoring systems and regular engagement with regulatory authorities, While the Financial Stability Board's 2024 analysis indicates that tokenization currently poses minimal systemic risk, the growing adoption of tokenized ETFs could introduce new considerations for financial stability. The success of this transformation will largely depend on several key factors: Market acceptance and adoption will ultimately determine the success of tokenized ETFs. The suggested pathway to full asset tokenization through ETFs represents a measured and pragmatic approach to modernizing financial markets. By starting with familiar investment vehicles like ETFs, the industry can build experience and confidence with tokenization while maintaining market stability and security. As market participants gain expertise with tokenized ETFs, they will establish the foundation for broader asset tokenization initiatives, potentially revolutionizing how financial assets are traded and managed in the future.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Wall Street equities finished lower Thursday following a mixed US retail sales report, while European luxury stocks pushed higher following strong results from Cartier owner Richemont. Major US indices spent part of the day in positive territory but were unable to extend Wednesday's rally in a session Briefing.com described as "lackluster." US retail sales grew 0.4 percent from November to December, a slower pace than in November but still a solid increase. In a separate report, the National Retail Federation estimated the growth in US holiday sales at four percent for 2024, topping estimates. The retail figures came on the heels of Wednesday's consumer price index figures, which eased concerns that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates high. After major indices gained around two percent Wednesday, all three finished lower on Thursday. But bourses in Europe and Asia pushed higher. The Paris stock market surged more than two percent after Cartier owner Richemont reported record quarterly sales. The Swiss luxury firm ended the day more than 16 percent higher. Sales in Richemont's Asia-Pacific region fell seven percent in the third quarter, dragged down by an 18 percent drop in China, Hong Kong and Macau. But the company enjoyed double-digit increases in Japan, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. "It seems that despite the challenging situation in China and in watches, Richemont has never been stronger," said Jean-Philippe Bertschy, analyst at investment firm Vontobel. In Paris, shares of Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Gucci owner Kering rose, while Burberry forged higher in London. London rose more than one percent even as data showed the UK economy expanded at a slower pace than expected in November. "It is a sea of green in the European equity space..." noted Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB trading group. "There are threats to inflation down the road, but they are concerns for another day. "For now, stocks are playing catch up, bonds remain stable and the weakening in the dollar in recent days has helped to boost risk sentiment." Still, there remains a certain amount of caution ahead of Donald Trump returning to the White House on Monday. The Republican has promised to ramp up tariffs on imports, and slash taxes and regulations, something that many fear could reignite inflation. - Key figures around 2130 GMT - New York - Dow: DOWN 0.2 percent at 43,153.13 (close) New York - S&P 500: DOWN 0.2 percent at 5,937.34 (close) New York - Nasdaq Composite: DOWN 0.9 percent at 19,338.29 (close) London - FTSE 100: UP 1.1 percent at 8,391.90 (close) Paris - CAC 40: UP 2.1 percent at 7,634.74 (close) Frankfurt - DAX: UP 0.4 percent at 20,655.39 (close) Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.3 percent at 38,572.60 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 1.2 percent at 19,522.89 (close) Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.3 percent at 3,236.03 (close) Euro/dollar: UP at $1.0306 from $1.0289 on Wednesday Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2237 from $1.2242 Dollar/yen: DOWN at 155.17 yen from 156.47 yen Euro/pound: UP at 84.18 pence from 84.04 pence West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 1.7 percent at $78.68 per barrel Brent North Sea Crude: DOWN 0.9 percent at $81.29 per barrel burs-jmb/dw Sign in to access your portfolio

UPDATED 20:06 EST / JANUARY 15 2025 by Mike Wheatley Data center operator Aligned Data Centers LLC said today it has raised a massive $12 billion in funding in order to accelerate the buildout of its artificial intelligence-focused infrastructure. The money came from two sources: $5 billion in primary equity from funds managed by Macquarie Asset Management and $7 billion in new debt commitments. Aligned, which is based in Plano, Texas, said it will use the money to construct more than 5 gigawatts of future AI computing capacity across North America and Latin America in order to meet skyrocketing demand from its customers. Aligned Chief Executive Andrew Schaap said his company is uniquely positioned to meet the growing demand for AI compute capacity, as it has more than a decade of experience in deploying the innovative cooling solutions required for the graphics processing units that power most AI workloads. “This investment will fuel our continued growth, enabling us to deliver cutting-edge solutions that meet the evolving demands of our customers today and in the future,” he said. Aligned operates a number of colocation data centers that rent capacity to customers, and it also builds data center facilities for hyperscale and enterprise firms. It currently operates data centers in Chicago, Dallas, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Northern Virginia, and its building additional sites in Illinois, Maryland, Ohio and Virginia. In addition, it has a massive operation in Latin America, having acquired a company called OData in May 2023, which has facilities in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. It’s also an investor in the Canadian data center operator QScale SEC, which gives it a foothold in that country as well. The rapid growth of AI over the last couple of years, driven by the popularity of large language models and chatbots like ChatGPT, has led to rising demand for high-capacity data centers that can cluster thousands of GPUs together in order to run those workloads. Aligned’s business has grown tremendously as a result of this demand. Big tech firms such as Microsoft Corp. and Google LLC are also spending billions of dollars to build out their AI compute capacity. Last week, Microsoft revealed that it’s planning to invest as much as $80 billion into its data center building program in fiscal 2025 as it strives to maintain its leadership in AI innovation. That came after it revealed in September that it’s collaborating with BlackRock Inc. to create a $100 billion fund that will fuel the development of new data centers and energy projects. Energy is just as important as the data centers themselves, which explains why Microsoft, Google and Amazon.com Inc. have all expressed an interest in nuclear power sources recently. There are many specialist firms operating in this industry too. For instance, Crusoe Energy Systems LLC, which is focused on providing clean energy for data centers, last month closed on a $600 million funding round.

Title: Trump Considers Suspending TikTok Ban Enforcement For 60 To 90 Days: Report

TikTok plans to shut U.S. operations of its social media app used by 170 million Americans on Sunday, when a federal ban is set to take effect, barring a last-minute reprieve, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The Washington Post reported President-elect Donald Trump, whose term begins a day after a ban would start, is considering issuing an executive order to suspend enforcement of a shutdown for 60 to 90 days. The newspaper did not say how Trump could legally do so. The law signed in April mandates a ban on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores if Chinese parent ByteDance fails to divest the site. Users who have downloaded TikTok would theoretically still be able to use the app, except that the law also bars U.S. companies starting Sunday from providing services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of it. The Trump transition team did not have an immediate comment. Trump has said he should have time after taking office to pursue a "political resolution" of the issue. "TikTok itself is a fantastic platform," Trump's incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News on Wednesday. "We're going to find a way to preserve it but protect people's data." A White House official told Reuters Wednesday President Joe Biden has no plans to intervene to block a ban in his final days in office if the Supreme Court fails to act and added Biden is legally unable to intervene absent a credible plan from ByteDance to divest TikTok. U.S. Senator Ed Markey on Wednesday sought unanimous consent to extend the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok by 270 days but Republican Senator Tom Cotton blocked the proposal. If it is banned, TikTok plans that users attempting to open the app will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the ban, the people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is not public. "We go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down," TikTok lawyer Noel Francisco told the Supreme Court last week. The company also plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, the sources said. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday, overturn the law, or pause the law to give the court more time to make a decision. Shutting down TikTok in the U.S. could make it unavailable for users in many other countries, the company said in a court filing last month, because hundreds of service providers in the U.S. help make the platform available to TikTok users around the world - and could no longer do so starting Sunday. TikTok said in the court filing an order was needed to "avoid interruption of services for tens of millions of TikTok users outside the United States." TikTok had said that the prohibitions would eventually make the app unusable, noting in the filing that "data centers would almost certainly conclude that they can no longer store" TikTok code, content, or data. The sources said the shutdown aims to protect TikTok service providers from legal liability and make it easier to resume operations if President-elect Donald Trump opted to roll back any ban. Shutting down such services does not require longer planning, one of the sources said, noting that most operations have been continuing as usual as of this week. If the ban gets reversed later, TikTok would be able to restore service for U.S. users in a relatively short time, sources said. TikTok and its Chinese parent, ByteDance, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. U.S. tech publication The Information first reported the news late on Tuesday. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States. President Joe Biden last April signed a law requiring ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets by Jan. 19, or face a nationwide ban. Last week, the Supreme Court seemed inclined to uphold the law, despite calls from Trump and lawmakers to extend the deadline. TikTok and ByteDance have sought, at the very least, a delay in the implementation of the law, which they say violates the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech. TikTok said in the court filing last month it estimated one-third of its 170 million American users would stop accessing the platform if the ban lasted a month.

At the outset, RWA tokenization represents real-world assets such as bonds, real estate, or private credit as digital tokens on a blockchain, enabling these traditionally illiquid assets to be traded and managed more efficiently. In effect, tokenization allows traditional financial institutions to fractionalize ownership, automate compliance, and access markets around the clock. “RWA tokenization has made significant strides recently. The real question for 2025: How many assets will integrate into this system, and how quickly will global adoption unfold?” Moataz Elsayed, co-founder of non-custodial wallet Okse, told Decrypt. Total value locked in tokenized assets reached over $176 billion in 2024, marking a 32% increase year-to-date, with non-stablecoin assets growing by 53%, a 2024 report from the Tokenized Asset Coalition (TAC) shows. RWA tokenization is “transforming finance” with BlackRock “driving adoption” through stablecoins and other permissioned services, Neal Wen, head of global business development at Kronos Research, told Decrypt. “Real estate, treasuries, and other assets are becoming liquid on the blockchain, unlocking over $18 billion in market value with significant growth potential on the horizon.” BlackRock launched its tokenized fund in March last year, followed by other institutions such as Franklin Templeton launching on Arbitrum, an Ethereum Layer-2 network. Major institutions such as McKinsey claim that tokenization presents financial institutions with a "strategic advantage" while cautioning them about "pessimistic and optimistic scenarios" that could range between $1 trillion to $4 trillion valuations for the sector by 2030. Major financial institutions entering the space further evidenced the sector's growth. Standard Chartered projected $30 trillion in tokenized assets by 2034, while Boston Consulting Group estimated $16 trillion in tokenized illiquid assets by 2030. Decentralized credit marketplace Clearpool shared with Decrypt that Ozean, the RWA-focused protocol it is building, has onboarded over 368,000 unique accounts for its Poseidon testnet. “While tokenized treasuries and stablecoins currently dominate RWA use cases, the future promises growing traction in real estate, private credit, and other asset classes like commodities,” Clearpool CEO and co-founder Jakob Kronbichler told Decrypt in an interview. Clearpool claimed in its Q4 report that it had processed over $650 million in total loans originated for Q4 2024 alone, achieving a 51% increase in total value locked. “BlackRock's credibility in the RWA movement is paving the way for other institutions to follow suit,” Kronbichler told Decrypt. Private credit has proven particularly hot, with Clearpool Prime garnering $124 million in loans since launching in December 2023. The surge mirrors a broader trend of traditional financial institutions warming up to tokenized markets, according to research from DeFi liquidity protocol Tren Finance. Executives across broader sectors are paying attention, too. Some 86% of Fortune 500 executives now see the benefits of tokenization, with 35% already cooking up tokenization projects, the TAC report shows. “Tokenization offers numerous advantages, solving a variety of problems in TradFi,” Kronbichler explained, citing use cases for liquidity, fractional ownership, automation, transparency, and programmability. Innovation in treasury products hasn't slowed either. Platforms are rolling out features that institutional investors have been craving, like round-the-clock redemptions and peer-to-peer transfers—making blockchain-based finance look increasingly attractive to the suit-and-tie crowd. Kronbichler also points to recent political shifts in the U.S. that he recognizes as catalysts that could push traditional finance “to engage with RWAs.” In December last year, President-elect Donald Trump named Paul Atkins to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Kronbichler noted that this appointment is crucial because Atkins “brings expertise that could drive regulatory transparency and accelerate institutional adoption.” Atkins is a member of the advisory board at Securitize, a Clearpool partner specializing in tokenization and collaborating with BlackRock.

Title: Chip Roy Warns That Republicans Will Break Migration Promises if Voters Stay Silent

Time Published: 2025-01-15T23:25:07Z
Full Content:
Citizens must pressure Republicans politicians to fulfill their campaign promises on migration, or the legislators will submit to donors and lobbyists, Texas Rep. Chip Roy (R) told a D.C. meeting on January 14. “Here’s my big bet [for 2025] … Republicans are going to kowtow to big corporate America, K Street lobbyists for cheaper labor, and for tax cuts while the American worker gets screwed — that’s what’s going to happen if people don’t stand up and try to change that,” Roy told a meeting hosted by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). Roy has worked on Capitol Hill since 2003, first as a Senate staffer. In 2019, he took his seat in the House and has since played a leading role in migration politics. Those two decades have given him an inside view of money-driven politics in the federal government. “We have utterly failed to address the problem,” Roy said. “If we set out to reverse the damage that’s been done over the next, say, four years of the Trump administration, what are the odds that we do that?” he asked the audience, adding: What are the odds that we actually remove all of the people that people are saying we’re going to remove? I have great faith in Tom Homan — he’s a good and dear friend. I’ve great faith in Stephen Miller. I have great faith in the president [who has] the motives, the desires to undo the damage of the Biden administration. But is anybody going to Vegas and bet up or down on whether we remove half of the people that have come here? Twenty percent? Would you go bet your life savings that we will remove even 20 percent of the people who have come here illegally? “I will be very surprised that the willpower of the average Republican is strong enough to do that,” he said after the event. Watch: The reality of hardball politics, Roy said, is that “big corporate interests want cheap labor at the expense of American labor, while the culture of our country is getting twisted around.” He continued: Open borders are being ignored, and while Republicans go out and campaign on securing them, [they] never fully secure them, and never undo the damage of the fact that they were unsecured in the first place. That’s the truth. How do I know this? Well, in 2006 and [200]7, when I was in the [Senate] judiciary committee dealing with all of those amnesty bills — that’s what they were — and working through those problems. Then fast forward to 2012 and [20]13 during the “Gang of Eight” [amnesty bill] … then fast forward to 2017 with Goodlatte, we have utterly failed to ever address the problem. And here’s the issue, right? We talk about all of the illegal numbers, yet we let in something like 3 million people a year into our country legally — a million-ish green cards, a million-ish guest workers, a million-ish foreign students each year. Three million! we’ve let in more people than every country in the world combined. The annual legal inflow — not counting illegals — adds up to almost one permanent or temporary migrant for each of the roughly 3.6 million Americans that are born each year. That annual inflow includes roughly 800,000 foreign graduates for white-collar jobs sought by American graduates. For example, the federal government allows companies and their foreign hiring managers to import roughly 120,000 H-1B contract workers for jobs that would otherwise go to better-paid and more innovative Americans. Companies favor those workers, in part, because they are being paid by the government’s offer of green cards. In contrast, American professionals must be paid in cash, which reduces the companies’ stock values and executive bonuses. This hidden non-dollar economy helps to explain why investors — such as Elon Musk — are determined to protect the H-1B program from popular reforms implemented by Trump in 2020. The reforms were killed by President Joe Biden’s deputies, who have sharply increased the white-collar inflow. That huge inflow is blocking many young Americans from jobs. On January 15, the Wall Street Journal reported: Landing a professional job in the U.S. has become so tough that even Harvard Business School says its M.B.A.s can’t solely rely on the university’s name to open doors anymore. Twenty-three percent of job-seeking Harvard M.B.A.s who graduated last spring were still looking for work three months after leaving campus. That share is up from 20% the prior year, during a cooling white-collar labor market; the figure was 10% in 2022, according to the school. “We should freeze all inflow, probably with some notable exceptions,” Roy said after the CIS event, and continued: [A freeze] would put a whole hell of a lot of pressure on making sure Americans are given opportunities to work … If you look at the numbers, we are crushing the average American worker, and we’re subsidizing corporations to bring in cheaper labor at the expense of American workers … if wages go up on the average American worker, I’d say that’s probably a good thing. But GOP legislators, he said, “pretty much, what they do is the bidding of whoever’s in there yelling out the loudest saying, ‘I want cheap labor.'” For example, Republicans are not focused on the alternative economic strategy of raising Americans’ wealth-generating productivity with automation and training, he said. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. Fink oversees an investment portfolio of $10 trillion as he tries to stay ahead of China’s low-migration, high-tech manufacturing sector: That [less-migration strategy] is something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. In the United States, “75 percent of college graduates who majored in a STEM field are not employed in a STEM occupation,” he told the meeting. “For the last 50 years, we have jammed our foot on the accelerator through both legal and illegal immigration — anybody on K Street [or] anybody in corporate America, who tells you otherwise is lying,” he added. “I think the average American family who’s out there working hard, are being stepped on by a government that is more interested in corporate bottom lines than boosting them,” Roy said. “Hopefully the Trump administration will do something about that.” However, Trump has periodically slammed Roy over federal spending, which Roy prefers to reduce.

In addition, the hiring of Maddox, the former chief executive officer of Wynn Resorts, also brought to the surface rumors that Authentic may once again consider going public, a plan it set in motion in 2021 but pulled back after CVC Capital and HPS Investment Partners, along with its other shareholders, which include BlackRock, Simon Property Group, Leonard Green & Partners and others purchased significant equity in Authentic. Reviving those plans or finding new investors are both on the table, sources said, citing a recent report by Bloomberg that the investor group is in talks to buy BlackRock’s equity stake, which is valued at $3 billion or more. BlackRock’s Long-Term Private Capital Fund paid $875 million for the stake in 2019 but that fund is being closed.

Title: XRP Hits 7-Year High Above $3 as Large Holders Accumulate $3.8B of Tokens

XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger network closely related to Ripple, surged to a six-year high on Wednesday as bitcoin (BTC) rallied to $100,000, with traders encouraged by this morning's highly-anticipated U.S. CPI inflation data report. The token briefly topped $3 during early U.S. trading session for the first time since early 2018 January, before slightly paring gains. Recently changing hands at $2.95, it was 11% over the past 24 hours, outperforming bitcoin's (BTC) 3.6% and the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index's 6.7% advances during the same period. XRP has been among the best-performing tokens, with a 488% gain since Donald Trump's election victory. It has now become the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization behind BTC and Ethereum's ether (ETH), reclaiming its third ranking from Tether's USDT stablecoin. At $170 billion of market value, the token is now larger than the market capitalization of asset management giant BlackRock (BLK).The gain was fueled by anticipation of crypto-friendly policies and an overhaul of digital asset regulation in the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple have been in a legal battle for years over XRP token sales. "This surge is driven by a growing number of partnerships, the launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD, and speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF," Diego Cardenas, OTC trader and at digital asset platform Abra, said in a note shared with CoinDesk. Ripple President Monica Long said in an interview last week that she expects a spot ETF to be approved "very soon" as approvals with the incoming administration will accelerate. XRP also broke out of the consolidation pattern started in early December that CoinDesk markets analyst Omkar Godbole noted last week, paving the way for the next leg in the token's rally. Another 15% rise from current prices would mean fresh all-time highs above the 2018 January top of $3.4. Still, adjusting for inflation over the years, XRP has to surpass $4.24 for a new high, Galaxy head of research Alex Thorn said in an X post. Large investors' accumulating XRP tokens over the past two months could also fuel the rally towards new records. Analytics firm Santiment noted that addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million tokens increased their holdings by 1.4 billion coins — worth roughly $3.8 billion — since November 12, continuing the accumulation while prices consolidated following early December highs.Read more: XRP Interest Jumps as Brad Garlinghouse Meets With Trump Krisztian Sandor recently graduated from NYU's business and economic reporter program as a Fulbright fellow and worked with Reuters and Forbes previously.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks ripped higher on Wednesday as high hopes for bank earnings paid off and a crucial consumer inflation update showed key prices increased less than expected in December. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1.6%, or over 700 points. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared 2.5%. Stocks took a leg higher after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target in December. Read more: Stocks look to build on best day of 2025 Prices climbed 0.2% month-on-month on a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, an easing from November's 0.3% gain. Over last year, core CPI rose 3.2%. Until the latest print, annual core CPI had been stuck at a 3.3% gain for the past four months. December was the first time since July that the metric reflected a deceleration in price growth. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dropped over 13 basis points to trade around 4.65% after the cooler-than-expected reading. It had been up at its highest level in more than a year, serving as a headwind for stocks. The interest-rate-sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) soared in reaction, rising almost 2%. Traders still see just a 3% chance that the Fed lowers rates in January, per the CME FedWatch Tool. They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June now seen as more likely than not. Read more: What a Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Spirits also got a boost from Wall Street bank earnings reports, which brought surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record profit, while Goldman Sachs (GS) profit beat estimates. BlackRock (BLK), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) also booked bumper quarters. Financials led the sector action on Wednesday as surge in investment banking and trading revenues helped drive well received results for multiple big banks including JPMorgan (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Read more about their results here. Amid a massive stock rally on Wednesday, large cap tech is still a clear leader. All seven of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were up more than 1.5% or higher. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up more than 3.5%, far outpacing the gains in the three major averages. A large drop in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down to 4.65% has sparked renewed interest in risk assets on Wednesday. But as we've been highlighting, the 10-year's recent surge higher has been driven by a multitude of reasons, not just expectations of higher inflation. And one positive Consumer Price Index report doesn't give the all clear on the recent higher rate headwind for stocks, Wellington Management fixed income portfolio manager Brij Khurana told Yahoo Finance. Khurana said it's "still too early" to call a peak in bond yields for the time being, adding that if the new Trump administration brings more fiscal spending than anticipated, yields could start another move higher. Still, Khurana described Wednesday's market action as a "a welcome reprieve for the bond market." "There are two-way risks to bond yields," Khurana said. "It's not just one way." Wednesday's better-than-expected inflation reading showed one particularly promising sign for the Federal Reserve. The shelter index saw prices increase 4.6% compared to the year prior, the lowest level since January 2022. While the index still remains elevated, one of the sticker parts of the inflation story over the past several years continues to show the progress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has discussed in recent press conferences. "With housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought ... but it’s nonetheless steadily coming down," Powell said on Dec. 18. The additional progress in sticky areas of inflation like housing is why some economists believe interest rate cuts remain on the table in 2025. "The slowdown of the past few months is exactly what [Powell] was talking about, and should give the FOMC more confidence that they can continue to cut rates this year, even if they pause in the short-term," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Read more on shelter inflation here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) spiked after Wednesday's morning soft inflation reading, to reach just shy of $99,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency following the moves of the broader market has been an emerging trend in recent weeks. Read more on what's recently been driving bitcoin prices from Yahoo Finance's Ethan Wolff-Mann here. A reshuffling at JPMorgan (JPM) on Tuesday rose questions about when CEO Jamie Dimon will step down. The bank's leader said Wednesday it likely won't be anytime soon. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Jamie Dimon agreed Wednesday with an analyst's assessment that his "base case" for stepping down as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO is a few years from now. The new comments on succession came one day after the nation’s largest bank announced a management reshuffling that raised new questions about the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO. Read more here. Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as US crude inventories fell for an eighth straight week. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) popped more than 2.5% to trade around $79.50 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, spiked 2% to hover above $81. Oil rallied as US inventories fell by 1.96 million barrels last week to their lowest level since April, according to the latest Energy Information Administration data released on Wednesday. Meanwhile gasoline stockpiles hit their highest level in a year. Crude has been on the rise recently after the US announced broad-based sanctions against oil producer Russia in an effort to cut off Moscow's revenue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Bank earnings kick off the season in earnest, and a Consumer Price Index reading has investors on high alert. Here's a rundown: Economic data: MBA Mortgage Applications (week ending Jan. 10) Consumer Price Index (December); Real average hourly earnings (December) Earnings: BlackRock (BLK), BNY (BK), Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Synovus (SNV), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: JPMorgan notches another record year of profits Goldman Sachs profit surges as investment banking, trading fuel bumper quarter BlackRock profit jumps as it posts record $641B in client cash Wells Fargo earnings climb as investment banking shines Huang Bump Seen Fading for Nvidia-Linked Stocks Riding AI Rally Wall Street firms predict jolt in US stocks on inflation miss Investors pour billions into S&P equal weight fund as tech fears rise Chip industry groups slam expected rules in private letter to Biden Yours truly is getting ready to head out for another week of impactful reporting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland — which kicks off next Monday. I will have more to say on what we will be doing there in this Sunday's Morning Brief newsletter. I will quickly note that a source familiar with the matter tells me President Trump will be speaking by video feed on Thursday, just days after his inauguration (and perhaps a flurry of executive orders). But ahead of that fun, I thought WEF's annual global risk report that dropped this morning is an interesting read. The top risk is "state-based armed conflict." Other top risks include misinformation and disinformation (good to see Zuck no longer fact-checking at Meta...), extreme weather events, societal polarization, cyber-espionage and warfare. Thinking a lot of these risks aren't priced into Mag 7 stocks! "Rising geopolitical tensions and a fracturing of trust are driving the global risk landscape" said WEF managing director Mirek Dušek in a statement. "In this complex and dynamic context, leaders have a choice: to find ways to foster collaboration and resilience, or face compounding vulnerabilities." Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Bolt’s $450 Million Raise Is Locked In Legal Battle. But This Investor Is Cashing Out
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2025/01/15/bolts-450-million-raise-is-locked-in-legal-battle-but-this-investor-is-cashing-out/
Time Published: 2025-01-15T19:00:41Z
Full Content:
Bolt founder Ryan Breslow’s long-running dispute with shareholder Activant has ended but the fate of his plan to raise a $450 million for the struggling payments startup remains on ice. A Delaware court has given the greenlight for payments startup Bolt to settle with investor Activant over a dispute involving a $30 million loan to founder Ryan Breslow. In August, Ryan Breslow stunned investors with his plan to return to the helm of payments startup Bolt. But that shock quickly turned to anger when investors like Blackrock and Hedosophia realized Breslow aimed to effectively wipe out shareholders who didn’t buy into the $450 million raise. Blackrock and Hedosophia sued to block the round a month later. Six months later, the deal is still on ice. But one Bolt shareholder has managed to escape the turmoil. Delaware’s Court of the Chancery ruled in a December 16 hearing that Bolt investor Activant Capital could sell $37 million of its shares back to the startup. That ruling ends a legal battle that began in July 2023, when Activant sued Breslow, accusing him of saddling the startup with $30 million of debt to repay a personal loan after he defaulted on it. Breslow had used his shares as collateral to take out the loan but instead of allowing them to be cancelled to settle the debt, he repaid the loan using money from the company’s bank accounts, and then fired Activant founder Steve Sarracino and other Bolt board members who opposed the plan. At the time, Breslow’s lawyer said in a dismissal motion it was his “unfettered right” to remove Bolt’s directors, and called Activant’s suit “nothing more than sour grapes.” Bolt and Activant had struck a deal for the lawsuit to be settled back in May 2024 but this was blocked by an objection from a trio of Bolt’s largest backers — BlackRock, Hedosophia and Untitled Investments. Now the courts have allowed the settlement to move ahead. That means Bolt will pay Activant $37 million for its shares, and the same value of Breslow’s Bolt shares will be cancelled. "For the avoidance of doubt, to borrow a phrase from Activant, nobody is getting a 'gold star' here,” said Vice Chancellor Nathan Cook of Delaware’s Court of the Chancery in the ruling. “Far from it, particularly given the long sequence of events that got us here.” Activant declined to comment. Bolt declined to comment. The ruling is a win for the Connecticut-based venture fund that had sought to rein in Breslow, and to cash out its investment in Bolt, after leading its Series C round in 2019. By January 2022, Breslow had lined up a $355 million investment from Wall Street heavyweights like BlackRock, valuing Bolt at over $11 billion, and his own stake made him one of the world’s youngest billionaires. Weeks later he resigned as CEO after a Twitter tirade directed at Stripe, Y Combinator and Sequoia. Then came lawsuits from customers like Authentic Brands Group, claims of inflated metrics and an SEC investigation (which the agency later dropped). He returned in August with a plan to raise $450 million to turn Bolt into a WeChat-style super app. Investors balked over the terms of the deal, which valued Bolt at over $14 billion but returned Breslow as chief executive with a bumper salary and expenses package; entangled the startup with Breslow’s other project, the health marketplace Love; and gave investors just days to commit or see 70% of shares effectively wiped out. To top it all off, Forbes reported that the lead investor named in the round had never heard of Bolt, while at least $250 million of the round came in the form of “marketing credits” from an obscure fund. “They put forward extremely unusual press reports that, to say the least, seemed to contradict and undermine highly material assertions in the company's communications to investors,” noted Vice Chancellor Cook in the ruling. Breslow, Bolt and its remaining shareholders remain stuck in legal limbo, with the BlackRock lawsuit stalled. Bolt’s board has formed a special committee to find a fix for the conflict with its shareholders. But the committee is made up of just one person: Bolt director and video games developer Michael Carter, who is a close friend of Breslow’s. Investors have claimed that Carter is conflicted and pushed for new independent directors to be appointed to Bolt’s board and the special committee reviewing the deal, to no avail. Got a tip for us? Contact reporters Sarah Emerson at semerson@forbes.com or 510-473-8820 on Signal, and Iain Martin at iain.martin@forbes.com. Carter joined the Bolt board in 2023, after Breslow forced out a series of directors from Activant, Tribe Capital and WestCap in March 2023. They were replaced by three of Breslow’s friends: music producer Larrance Dopson, journalist Esther Wojcicki (mother to Susan Wojcicki and “Godmother of Silicon Valley”) and The Mighty Ducks child actor and crypto investor Brock Pierce. Carter and Dobson remain on the Bolt board with property developer Joel Schreiber, who faces contempt of court charges in his ongoing legal dispute with Starwood Property Trust over a $130 million debt. Schreiber did not respond to a comment request. Back in August, Breslow had billed the $450 million fundraise as essential to relaunch Bolt as he warned that the business was losing market share. That sense of urgency seems to have evaporated as Bolt struggles to answer questions about the strange deal. For investors who committed over $1 billion of capital to the one-time rising fintech startup, there was some good news on its financial health from the court hearing. Despite Bolt reportedly losing $310 million on just $27 million of revenue in 2023, Vice Chancellor Cooked noted: “the Company is now in a much better cash position and on better financial footing,” based on numbers revealed in disclosure hearings but not made public. This story has been updated to clarify Breslow’s response to Activant’s lawsuit.

Title: AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (AXS): Analysts Recommend This 52-Week High Stocks Now

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best 52-Week High Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) stands against the other stocks. After two years of substantial gains to record highs, exhaustion in the US equity markets is slowly kicking in. Pullbacks in various sectors have come into play amid growing concerns about overstretched valuations. Likewise, the pullbacks have come on bond yields surging to levels not seen in two months, triggering a selloff in growth-oriented stocks. The 10-year yield touching highs of 4.79% has once again triggered demand for bonds at the expense of stocks, given the yields on offer. Additionally, the surge in bond yields comes on stronger-than-expected jobs reports that cast doubt on further interest rate cuts. The stock market rallied to record highs last year amid expectations that the Fed will embark on an aggressive easing push that involves interest rate cuts. A spike in inflation levels amid a resilient US job market has once again averted the prospects of the Fed aggressively cutting interest rates. Consequently, the global rise in bond yields around the globe is being driven by expectations of fewer than expected interest rate cuts. READ ALSO: 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy for 2025 and Billionaire Israel Englander’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025. “With the 10-year yield potentially getting to 5%, I think it’s going to be very hard for the equity market to really gain any meaningful traction here until there’s — at minimum — stability in interest rates,” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. The sentiments echo serious concerns about stocks trading at 52-week highs after blockbuster moves last year. Given that valuations at 52-week highs often appear overstretched, there are growing concerns that some of the stocks could be the subject of significant pullbacks. Amid the concerns, Turnquist does not see the prospect of the market edging into bear territory even though the market appears to be in a correction phase. Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish about the equity market's outlook and believe there is not enough reason to back away from investing. Additionally, the analysts don’t expect 2025 to be a problematic year for equity investments. “Valuations are not a good timing signal. ... There’s no clear relationship between your starting valuation and the returns one year later,” Brett Nelson, head of tactical asset allocation for the group, said Goldman Sachs analysts expect the US economy to grow faster than Europe in 2025. A resilient US economy amid high interest rates should fuel stellar financial results characterized by revenue and earnings growth. “We do think that the earnings advantage that the U.S. has will continue,” said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer for the Goldman unit. The prospect of the US economy staying clear of recession even with the Fed leaving interest rates at current levels should offer much-needed support to stocks trading at all-time highs. Analysts also expect friendly regulations and deregulation from the upcoming Republican administration to act as a tailwind to fuel further gains in the equity markets. Our Methodology To make the list of best 52-week high stocks to buy according to analysts, we scanned various screeners focusing on stocks trading close to their 52-week highs. We then settled on stocks trading close to 52-week highs (0-10% below high), which analysts believe boast of 25% or more upside potential as of January 14, owing to their solid underlying fundamentals. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their upside potential. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A businessperson in a high-rise office building, demonstrating the protection of professional lines. 52 Week Range: $53.97 - $94.89 Current Share Price: $87.82 Stock Upside Potential: 25.62% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) is a financial services company that provides various specialty insurance and reinsurance products. It offers professional insurance products that cover officers' liability, errors and omissions, employment practices, medical malpractice, and other financial insurance. The company outperformed its peers significantly in 2024, delivering a 62% return, affirming why it is one of the best 52-week highs stocks to buy, according to analysts. Throughout 2024, AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) has proactively improved its primary casualty portfolio, anticipating stronger growth in 2025. This growth is supported by strategic changes and a consistent rise in casualty rates despite slower growth in the property segment. Additionally, AXIS Capital focuses on growth areas like lower middle markets and wholesale insurance to become a top specialty underwriter with a diverse portfolio, leadership roles, and expansion prospects positioning its insurance segment for success. Strategic initiatives have been driving improvement in its operating earnings over the past few years. Reaching a general and administrative ratio of less than 11% by 2026 should be possible with the help of streamlining the operating structure, delivering efficiencies, and leveraging productivity gains. AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE:AXS) has a strong dividend history. It has increased its dividend for 18 years in a row and now yields 1.9%. Overall AXS ranks 13th on our list of the best 52-week high stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AXS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AXS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: This Week in AI: Will Biden's AI actions survive the Trump era? | TechCrunch

If you want this in your inbox every Wednesday, sign up here. This week was something of a swan song for the Biden administration. On Monday, the White House announced sweeping new restrictions on exporting AI chips — restrictions that tech giants, including Nvidia, loudly criticized. (Nvidia’s business would be seriously affected by the restrictions, should they go into effect as proposed.) Then on Tuesday, the administration issued an executive order that opened up federal land to AI data centers. But the obvious question is, will the moves have a lasting impact? Will Trump, who takes office on January 20, simply roll back Biden’s enactments? So far, Trump hasn’t signaled his intentions either way. But he certainly has the power to undo Biden’s last AI acts. Biden’s export rules are scheduled to take effect after a 120-day comment period. The Trump administration will have broad leeway over how the measures are implemented — and whether to change them in any way. As for the executive order pertaining to federal land use, Trump could repeal it. Former PayPal COO David Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto “czar,” recently committed to revoking another AI-related Biden executive order that set standards for AI safety and security. However, there’s reason to believe the incoming administration may not rock the boat too much. Along the lines of Biden’s move to free up federal resources for data centers, Trump recently promised expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. He also picked Lee Zeldin, who has vowed to cut regulations he sees as burdensome to businesses, to lead the EPA. Aspects of Biden’s export rules could stand as well. Some of the regulations target China, and Trump has made no secret that he sees China as the U.S.’ biggest rival in AI. One piece in question is Israel’s inclusion in the list of countries subjected to AI hardware trade caps. As recently as October, Trump described himself as a “protector” of Israel and has signaled that he’s likely to be more permissive toward Israel’s military actions in the region. In any event, we’ll have a clearer picture within the week. ChatGPT, remind me to…: Paying users of OpenAI’s ChatGPT can now ask the AI assistant to schedule reminders or recurring requests. The new beta feature, called Tasks, will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week. Meta versus OpenAI: Executives and researchers leading Meta’s AI efforts obsessed over beating OpenAI’s GPT-4 model while developing Meta’s own Llama 3 family of models, according to messages unsealed by a court on Tuesday. OpenAI’s board grows: OpenAI has appointed to its board of directors Adebayo “Bayo” Ogunlesi, an executive at investment firm BlackRock. The company’s current board bears little resemblance to OpenAI’s board in late 2023, the members of which fired CEO Sam Altman only to reinstate him days later. Blaize goes public: Blaize is set to become the first AI chip startup to go public in 2025. Founded by former Intel engineers in 2011, the company has raised $335 million from investors, including Samsung for its chips for cameras, drones, and other edge devices. A “reasoning” model that thinks in Chinese: OpenAI’s o1 AI reasoning model “thinks” in languages such as Chinese, French, Hindi, and Thai sometimes, even when asked a question in English — and no one really knows why. A recent study co-authored by Dan Hendrycks, an adviser to billionaire Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI, suggests that many safety benchmarks for AI correlate with AI systems’ capabilities. That is to say, as a system’s general performance improves, it “scores better” on benchmarks — making it appear as though the model is “safer.” “Our analysis reveals that many AI safety benchmarks — around half — often inadvertently capture latent factors closely tied to general capabilities and raw training compute,” the researchers behind the study write. “Overall, it is hard to avoid measuring upstream model capabilities in AI safety benchmarks.” In the study, the researchers propose what they describe as an empirical foundation for developing “more meaningful” safety metrics, which they hope will “[advance] the science” of safety evaluations in AI. In a technical paper published Tuesday, Japanese AI company Sakana AI detailed Transformer² (“Transformer-squared”), an AI system that dynamically adjusts to new tasks. Transformer² first analyzes a task — for example, writing code — to understand its requirements. Then it applies “task-specific adaptations” and optimizations to tune to that task. Sakana says the methods behind Transformer² can be applied to open models such as Meta’s Llama and that they offer “a glimpse into a future where AI models are no longer static.” A small team of developers has released an open alternative to AI-powered search engines like Perplexity and OpenAI’s SearchGPT. Called PrAIvateSearch, the project is available on GitHub under an MIT license, meaning that it can be used largely without restriction. It’s powered by openly available AI models and services, including Alibaba’s Qwen family of models and the search engine DuckDuckGo. The PrAIvateSearch team says that its goal is to “implement similar features to SearchGPT,” but in an “open source, local, and private way.” For tips to get it up and running, check out the team’s latest blog post.
