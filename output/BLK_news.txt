It’s no longer terribly surprising when Donald Trump says completely weird, inappropriate things in public, even when they’re surprisingly terrible things. It’s also not surprising that his supporters are willing to overlook his habitual admiration for Hitler and other dictators. He’s quirky, no big deal. But at a Trump rally hosted by Turning Point USA rally in Duluth, Georgia, Wednesday, former Fox News creep Tucker Carlson managed to out-weird the Great Man himself. In a disturbing metaphor, Carlson compared Trump to a “Dad” who needed to severely and painfully discipline a rebellious underaged girl by giving her a “vigorous spanking” because she was such a naughty “bad little girl,” VOMIT. Worse, the crowd loved it and chanted “DADDY’S HOME!” when Trump took the stage, because they’re all a bunch of weirdos who want to see their enemies punished and humiliated. Also, aren’t these the people who are freaked out about George Soros and Hillary Clinton’s nonexistent child trafficking ring? Weird fantasies about spanking little girls is fine though, as long as it’s Daddy. We don’t kink shame, but for fuckssake, keep the roleplay in the bedroom, not in the spotlight of a presidential campaign where nobody can say the safeword and make it stop. Wonkette is is a big fan of human bondage and other Somerset Maugham classics, as long as it’s consensual. Support us with a paid sub-scription if you can. Here, for those of you who may feel you need chastisement, is the weird freaky video (if you click “play” that’s consent, OK?) In the video, Carlson railed disjointedly about how Kamala Harris is completely incompetent, and claimed that if she wins the 2024 election, well that is automatically a crime because she has no right to “lecture” you, and “It’s too much! We can’t allow that! It’s an offense against the truth, against reality, and against Justice itself!” Then it was time for the weird daddy stuff, where he said when Trump returns to office, all the people who have ruined America will get their comeuppance, because he’s the daddy and we need to be set straight. Nothing fascist about saying the Great Leader is the stern national parent, heavens no! The Left’s misbehavior mustn’t be tolerated a moment longer, because “if you allow it, you will encourage more of it. If you allow people to get away with things that are completely over the top and outrageous …” Here we thought maybe he was talking about letting people try to overturn an election without facing legal accountability, but no, he was talking about all us troublemaking children in the USA: “If you allow your 2-year-old to smear the contents of his diapers on the wall of your living room and you do nothing about it, if you allow your 14-year-old to light a joint at the breakfast table, if you allow your hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter to slam the door of her bedroom and give you the finger, you’re gonna get more of it and those kids are going to wind up in rehab! “It’s not good for you and it’s not good for them. No, there has to be a point at which Dad comes home.” (enthusiastic applause) And then, the spankings will begin, and we do wish to remind you again that this is not from a sleazy porn fantasy, it is Serious Political Thought, in which Trump is like both Dad and the Old Testament version of the Almighty chastising his wayward children. “Yeah, that's right! Dad comes home. And he's pissed! Dad is pissed! He’s not vengeful. He loves his children, disobedient as they may be, he loves them because they’re his children. They live in his house. But he’s very disappointed in their behavior and he’s going to have to let them know. “‘Get to your room right now and think about what you did!’ And when Dad gets home, you know what he says? “You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl and you’re getting a vigorous spanking right now. And no, it’s not going to hurt me more than it hurts you. No, it’s not. I’m not going to lie. This is going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. And you earned this. You’re getting a vigorous spanking because you’ve been a bad girl.” Just a very normal, not at all creepy explanation of how a loving father should correct the behavior of a “hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter” who is also America. If it helps, Carlson insisted Daddy wouldn’t spank his underaged daughter in a spirit of hate or vengeance, because it’s simply justice and it must be done, OK? If you think anything he said sounds skeevy, that just proves you’re the degenerate. We simply need to stop the “party of weak men and unhappy women” from destroying America. Nothing against Harris or Tim Walz or even Pete Buttigieg (hey, why him we wonder), these people are all interchangeable, “and they need to have limits set for them.” Oh, it gets worse. When Trump came to the stage, the crowd shouted “Daddy’s Home” and “Daddy Don,” and that too is just about as wholesome and normal as it gets. For the sake of due diligence, we skim-watched Carlson’s full 20-minute introduction, especially the minutes leading up to this clip, to see what specific “crimes” Carlson said we had all committed. Guess what! It took a very dark, antisemitic turn! This is also not terribly new for Carlson, but with all the weirdly pervy stuff, it seems to have been overlooked by virtually all the outlets that reported on the spanking stuff. At first it seemed like the same Culture Wars/White Grievance shtick that Carlson has always pushed, although he framed it as a wonderful thing that these days, rightwing Trump supporters, the only true Americans, have shut themselves into a bubble, because it’s the real reality, and everyone in media and politics and nonTrump America is denying reality. But along the way, he insisted that “almost every single person” on MSNBC has “a personal life so grotesquely weird [that] if you knew the details, you’d call for their arrest.” (We knew that Rachel Maddow does catch-and-release fly fishing and Chris Hayes loves his e-bike, but wow!) Carlson explained that such horrible freaks can’t be allowed to define the terms of the national conversation, no way. He also was mad about immigration and called it the greatest crime in US history, then explained that Real America is a very nice, tolerant place that, because it’s so decent and tolerant, has “put up with this crap for too long” from “people who never built anything in their lives” who tear down statues and “spit on the graves of your ancestors, and (((who on earth could he be talking about)))? It’s unjust, he said, for the “majority” to “reward the most parasitic, useless, violent, nasty, aggressive people in your country. You can’t make them the richest. It’s just wrong!” Gosh, he never said the bad guys had hooked noses, so maybe it wasn’t an antisemitic dogwhistle. But then, Carlson named only example those America-destroying parasites who actually run the country instead of its hardworking honest decent smartest talented majority: Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock. He happened to be the one usurper whose name came to Carlson out of the blue. So yeah, the name of a Jewish investment banker just happened to immediately precede the clip above, right before “Kamala Harris.” We appear to be the only source calling attention to it, because the weird kinky pedo overtones certainly are more sensational. But it’s right there, 12 minutes into the full video. All perfectly normal and not Nazi, you degenerates, how dare you say such a thing the end.

Landlord Marc Godart has been hit with fines of more than €25,000 arising from failing to register tenancies and knowingly giving false reasons to tenants for why they had to leave their apartments. The latest list of sanctions and court orders published by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) includes seven entries for the Godart company, Green Label Property Investments Ltd, in relation to six apartments at Reuben House, Reuben Street, Dublin 8. Last year The Irish Times reported how tenants had been evicted from the apartments on the basis that the owner wanted to sell, only for the apartments then to be advertised for short-term letting on Airbnb. On Tuesday, another company owned by Mr Godart, Reuben Street Hot Desks Ltd, was fined €1,500 in the District Court for the short-term letting of the same apartments without the required planning permission over the year to April, despite having been instructed to desist. The company was also ordered to pay costs of €3,601 in the case, which was taken by Dublin City Council. The latest list of sanctions published by the RTB shows that Green Label Property Investments, a company that holds property on behalf of Mr Godart’s business, was hit with monetary sanctions ranging from €500 to €13,000. It is the first time the RTB has imposed sanctions on Mr Godart’s business, though tenants have brought successful complaints against him to the RTB and received monetary awards. The latest sanctions and court orders published by the RTB include cases where landlords were sanctioned for failing to comply with the rent pressure zone laws that control rents in designated areas. Landlord Anuj Katyal, of Amstelveen, the Netherlands, was given a monetary sanction of €15,000 for failing to comply with rent pressure zone requirements in respect of a property at Liffey Place, Liffey Valley Park, Lucan, Co Dublin. Landlord William Byrne, of Blackrock, Dublin, was sanctioned €5,000 in respect of an apartment on Bachelors Walk, Dublin 1. Landlords Thang Viet Dam and Ngoc Minh Nguyen, of Clonee, Dublin 15, were sanctioned a total of €22,434 in relation to two tenancies, at Premier Square, Finglas Road, Dublin 11, and Ongar Village, Dublin 15; and Michael and Claire O’Donoghue, of Clonpet, Co Tipperary, €4,608, in respect of an apartment at Cois Luachra, Dooradoyle, Co Limerick. Eamon Dunphy, of Tramore, Co Waterford, was sanctioned €4,000 in respect of a tenancy at Bracken Grove, Old Tramore Road, Kilcohan, Waterford; Anna Sweeney, of Dublin 4, €2,000, in respect of a tenancy at Loreto Road, Maryland, Dublin 8; and George and Joanne Murphy, of Tullow, Co Carlow, €2,500, in respect of a tenancy at College Gardens, Carlow. Landlord Pat Deasy, Dublin Pike, Co Cork, got a monetary sanction of €6,500 in respect of a tenancy at Ardross Estate, Pouladuff Road, Cork, while Cloncose Ltd, of Terenure, Dublin 6W, got a sanction of €7,000, in respect of a tenancy at Brookfield Green, Kimmage, Dublin 12. Cloncose, a property investment company, reported a pretax profit of €445,649 in 2023, according to its most recent set of accounts. It is owned by David Jones, Templeogue Road, Dublin 6. Landlord Orla Conlon, of West Yorkshire, England, was sanctioned €4,500 in respect of a tenancy at Kelly’s Bay Promenade, Skerries, Co Dublin; Kevin Curley, Skerries, Co Dublin, €2,116, in respect of Kelly’s Bay Heights, Skerries, and Bernadette Malone, of Foxrock, Dublin 18, €2,688, in respect of Griffin Glenpark, Lucan, Co Dublin. Synergy Facility Services Ltd were given a €5,000 sanction for giving an incorrect reason for terminating a tenancy at an apartment in the Beacon South Quarter, Dublin 18, while landlord Stacey Tivnan, of Kilcolgan, Galway, was given a monetary sanction of €2,400 for failing to offer a tenancy back in Newtown, Grange, Co Sligo.

Title: A contested election that leads to weeks of uncertainty is a risk being overlooked by markets
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-presidential-election-trump-harris-outlook-volatility-stock-sell-off-2024-10

Investors are dismissing the risk of a disputed US election, BlackRock Investment Institute head Jean Boivin told Bloomberg TV on Thursday. "For us, the main thing to watch is really more the contested election scenario that could be weeks of very disrupting legal battles," he said. Boivin added: "I don't think that's in the price and that's where if you want to prepare for some scenario where you need to react, I think that's one of those scenarios that could be bad for markets." The possibility is not far-fetched, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris locked in a razor-close contest. Recent battleground state polling shows a race too close to call with the election less than two weeks away. Overall, he considers it a "fool's errand" to try and trade on what happens come November. However, that hasn't stopped investors from trying: recent weeks have seen the so-called "Trump trade" rise on the prospect that the Republican candidate will win, as suggested by betting markets. Other market strategists have echoed in recent weeks Boivin's concern over what an election dispute would mean for markets. According to Morgan Stanley, delayed results have historically triggered short-term volatility. The CBOE Volatility Index — also known as the stock market's fear gauge — spiked 40% during the 2020 election. The measure only eased when a winner was officially declared days later. In another example, Stifel's chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner noted that the equity market sold off during the 2000 election dispute between George W. Bush and Al Gore. The S&P 500 fell approximately 5% between Election Day and December 13th, when the Supreme Court ended the legal challenges. However, Gardner points out that macroeconomic backdrops might play a hidden role in these scenarios. In 2000, stocks were steering through the dot-com bubble's rupture. Meanwhile, stocks rose during Trump's election dispute in 2020, likely due to signs that the COVID-19 pandemic was ending. "The main takeaway for investors is that the dominant economic and market conditions at the time drove the financial markets rather than political events," he wrote on Tuesday. As of now, current macroeconomic strength has shifted outlooks on the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting path, leading the bond market through a steep sell-off.

Title: Tucker Carlson Reveals He Has Daddy Kink in Weirdest Trump Speech Ever
URL: https://newrepublic.com/post/187485/tucker-carlson-daddy-trump-spanking-speech
Time Published: 2024-10-24T14:40:06Z

Speaking at a rally on Wednesday night, Tucker Carlson likened Donald Trump to “daddy” and described him coming home angrily to give a “bad little girl” a “vigorous spanking.” Carlson delivered the disturbing speech at a Turning Point Action rally in Duluth, Georgia, alongside his fellow MAGA acolytes Charlie Kirk, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and others, as well as Donald Trump himself. In his address, Carlson went on a manic rant encouraging his audience, whom he described as “an incredibly gentle and tolerant majority,” to fight back against those whom he sees as “parasitic, useless, violent, nasty, aggressive people,” like Kamala Harris, protesters who tore down Confederate statues, and weirdly, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. But that was the least strange part of his speech. Carlson then launched into a Freudian soliloquy by listing made-up scenarios of parents being too permissive, as a metaphor for how he sees America. If you allow a baby to smear poop on the walls or a “14-year-old to light a joint at the breakfast table,” or, he continued, “if you allow your hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter to slam the door of her bedroom and give you the finger, you’re going to get more of it. Tucker Carlson’s vision of a Trump presidency is that “dad comes home” and says to America,“You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl and you’re getting a vigorous spanking, right now. … It’s going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me.”pic.twitter.com/fh25KmyYmG “There has to be a point at which dad comes home. Yeah, that’s right. Dad comes home. And he’s pissed. Dad is pissed,” said Carlson. “He’s not vengeful. He loves his children. Disobedient as they may be, he loves them. Because they’re his children. They live in his house. But he’s very disappointed in their behavior. And he’s going to have to let them know.” The crowd of thousands went wild for his comparison, chanting “Daddy’s home” as Trump took the stage. Talk about weird. And Carlson, again, didn’t stop there. “When dad gets home, you know what he says? ‘You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl, and you’re getting a vigorous spanking right now. And no, it’s not going to hurt me more than it hurts you. No, it’s not. I’m not going to lie. It’s going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. And you earned this.’” Carlson’s speech at the Turning Point rally is not out of the ordinary when it comes to the way MAGA talks about children and women as something you own and can punish. Just last month, Trump creepily promised he will be women’s “protector.” Meanwhile, in states like Missouri and Oklahoma, Republicans have supported corporal punishment in schools, as part of a long evangelical and right-wing obsession with hitting their kids. This also isn’t the first time that the right has talked about spanking on the main stage. In 2016, Chris Christie threatened Hillary Clinton, promising to “beat her rear end,” and Senator Ted Cruz asked voters to give Clinton “a spanking.” But invoking the image of Trump as “daddy” or as a punishing God and having that message embraced by the frenetic crowd, who also cheered that “Christ is King,” is enough to make any normal person squirm. Donald Trump made up a fictional war with France Wednesday, and then claimed to have stopped it. During a speech in Duluth, Georgia, Trump—who previously touted himself a “wartime president” but now lies about how peaceful and safe his time in office was—was bragging about his record when he falsely claimed he really had prevented an international conflict. “You have no idea what I did in the White House. I stopped wars … with France!” Trump said. “France, you know the France story? They were gonna charge us, think of this, 25 percent to all Ameri—I have to protect American companies, whether we like ’em or not. Some of ’em I didn’t even like. You know Google is treating us much better, did you notice that? What happened to Google? They’re treating us much better. “They say McDonald’s was one of the most viewed things that they’ve ever had,” Trump cheered. Trump: "You have no idea what I did in the White House. I stopped wars with France."His brain then flits to Google and McDonald's. All of this in about 30 seconds. pic.twitter.com/yxgYlycUCM While there was obviously no threat of war with France, it’s possible that Trump was referring to a trade skirmish with France from his time in office. Paris passed a digital services tax on large tech companies, including Google, Facebook, and Amazon, in 2019. In response, Trump threatened to place tariffs of up to 100 percent on French goods, such as champagne and luxury bags. Undeterred, France ordered the tech companies to pay up in 2020. After Joe Biden entered the White House in 2021, he suspended Trump’s plan for retaliatory tariffs against France. So the “war” Trump stopped wasn’t a war, it was a trade fight. And he didn’t even stop it. If anything, he escalated it. But this might explain his incoherent weave from France to Google and back to his favorite subject: himself. A former model is alleging that Donald Trump groped her in 1993 in a “twisted game” between him and Jeffrey Epstein, The Guardian reports. Stacey Williams first met Trump in 1992 after being introduced to him by Epstein at a Christmas party. The model dated Epstein for a few months after that. The groping incident occurred in the winter or spring of 1993, when Williams and Epstein were on a walk and he suggested they stop by Trump Tower to visit the real estate mogul. Shortly after they arrived, Williams said that Trump pulled her toward him and started groping her, putting his hands “all over my breasts,” her waist, and her buttocks. She said that she froze, feeling “deeply confused,” and believed she saw Epstein and Trump smiling at each other. After the incident, she left Trump Tower with Epstein, and she felt that he was angry at her. “Jeffrey and I left, and he didn’t look at me or speak to me, and I felt this seething rage around me, and when we got down to the sidewalk, he looked at me and just berated me, and said: ‘Why did you let him do that?’” Williams said on a “Survivors for Kamala” Zoom call Monday, which included actress Ashley Judd and law professor Anita Hill, among others. While Williams has shared the story in parts on social media before, she gave specific details on the call. “He made me feel so disgusting, and I remember being so utterly confused,” Williams added, saying the incident appeared to be part of some “twisted game.” “I felt shame and disgust and as we went our separate ways, I felt this sensation of revisiting it, while the hands were all over me. And I had this horrible pit in my stomach that it was somehow orchestrated. I felt like a piece of meat,” Williams told The Guardian in an interview. The two broke up shortly after that. Williams said she had no idea about Epstein’s pattern of sexual abuse and pedophilia. Williams said that she later received, through her agent, a special postcard from Trump in 1993 showing an aerial view of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, including a handwritten note in his trademark black marker. It read “Stacey—Your home away from home. Love Donald.” Trump’s campaign denied the allegations in a statement, with his press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying, “These accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false. It’s obvious this fake story was contrived by the Harris campaign.” But it fits a pattern of behavior for Trump, an associate of Epstein for many years. At least 26 other women have accused the former president and convicted felon of sexual assault or misconduct. Plus, he was found to have sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s in a civil trial last year. With the election in just a few weeks, Trump’s predatory behavior will matter to many of the voters he needs to return to the White House. Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie has called for the United States to stop funding Israel, as it targets civilian infrastructure in Lebanon. Massie posted a video on X Wednesday that showed an Israeli missile strike leveling an apartment building in Beirut, Lebanon. “If Israel insists on destroying civilian targets in Lebanon, let them buy and build their own weapons. American taxpayers should not be funding this,” the Republican lawmaker wrote. The U.S. has spent at least $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since it began its catastrophic military campaign in Gaza after the massacre on October 7. Massie, a far-right Republican, has been outspoken against America’s unwavering support of Israel’s unchecked military activity in the Middle East, challenging the notion that opposing to pro-Israel policies is a position held solely by those on the far left. Massie boycotted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress in July, calling it a “war rally.” He openly criticized the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on attack ads trying to unseat him. He also voted against censuring Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib over her comments criticizing Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians. Israel carried out a series of air strikes Sunday that targeted branches of the Al Qard Al Hassan association, a financial association that Israel claims is helping Hezbollah fund its activities, according to the BBC. The strikes against nonmilitary targets hit civilian areas in Beirut, as well as south and east Lebanon. Israel has killed at least 1,800 people in Lebanon in the past five weeks, since expanding military operations there. In the year since launching its military campaign in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 41,000 people and injured more than 96,700, according to ABC News. This week, the Israeli government began a campaign to empty out (ethnically cleanse) northern Gaza, reportedly cutting off supplies and targeting homes, shelters, schools, and hospitals with airstrikes, displacing thousands of civilians. In just a handful of hours, Donald Trump’s MAGA allies have gone from arguing that his recent comments about Hitler were misconstrued to just outright claiming that the whole story was completely made up. During an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Florida Representative Mike Waltz completely rejected the evidence of his eyes and ears, claiming that the Republican presidential nominee’s comments praising Hitler and expecting undying loyalty from his top commanders were phony. “It doesn’t make sense to me. I find the timing suspicious,” Waltz said. “And it just completely is divorced from the man that I’ve come to know in Donald Trump, and how he’s dealt with Gold Star families, how he has been caring, how he’s been compassionate,” Waltz continued, referring to the military status given to families who have lost a loved one during their military service. Rep. Mike Waltz on CNN suggests John Kelly is lying about Trump praising Hitler pic.twitter.com/jotsK0PhCC The far-right revision comes after Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, retired military General John Kelly, told The Atlantic that his ex-boss fit the description of a fascist. Kelly recalled a disturbing exchange he had with the former president while he was still in office, in which Trump expressed frustration over a perceived lack of loyalty from the military. “I need the kind of generals that Hitler had,” Trump said in a private conversation in the White House, according to two sources that spoke anonymously with The Atlantic. “People who were totally loyal to him, that follow orders.” Another time, while in a frustrated discussion with Kelly, Trump reportedly asked, “Why can’t you be like the German generals?” forgetting that Hitler’s top generals had themselves defied him and made several attempts toward the end of World War II to kill him. Kelly, trying to correct the president, informed him that German generals “tried to kill Hitler three times and almost pulled it off.” Kelly recounted that when Trump had raised the matter of “German generals,” he responded by asking, “Do you mean Bismarck’s generals?” “I mean, I knew he didn’t know who Bismarck was, or about the Franco-Prussian War. I said, ‘Do you mean the kaiser’s generals? Surely you can’t mean Hitler’s generals?’” Kelly told The Atlantic. “And he said, ‘Yeah, yeah, Hitler’s generals.’ I explained to him that Rommel had to commit suicide after taking part in a plot against Hitler.” But Trump did not know who Rommel was, either. It’s at least the second time this month that Waltz has rejected the reality of Trump’s rhetoric. Last week, Waltz refused to acknowledge that direct quotes from Trump’s “enemy from within” comments were actually what he said. “I don’t think that’s what he said, John,” Waltz told CNN host John Berman, before pointing to civil unrest and mass protests during 2020. “I think that’s completely appropriate, the National Guard was rolled out then.… We cannot have, nor should we have, riots in the streets, business owners threatened, and Americans feeling unsafe.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s running mate, Nicole Shanahan, tried to pay a Washington Post reporter a hefty $500,000 to kill a profile she was writing on the Silicon Valley billionaire. The reporter didn’t respond to the offer, and the Post published its profile of Shanahan Wednesday morning, where the attempted bribe was revealed. Shanahan made the offer in June, texting one of her associates who was contacted by the Post that she would “pay your friend,” referring to the reporter, “half a million dollars to be a whistleblower” and name the sources for the story. In making the offer, Shanahan claimed that the sources were spreading false information about her. Shanahan would not respond to multiple requests from the Post beginning in April to sit for an interview, and ultimately the newspaper sent her a list of questions. Shanahan answered that she didn’t agree with some of the Post’s reporting but didn’t provide answers to any of the questions. The Post’s story details Shanahan’s evolution from a Democrat to a MAGA star praised by the likes of Tucker Carlson. “I’m so sorry you feel it is appropriate to do this for political motivations,” Shanahan told the Post. “It’s a very sad state our country is in.” Kennedy drew headlines when he announced Shanahan as his running mate in March. Many suspected that he chose her due to her wealth and the fact that she was Google co-founder Sergey Brin’s ex-wife. Later revelations showed that she has extreme views on in vitro fertilization and that she shares Kennedy’s opposition to vaccines, using the example of her autistic daughter as proof of their danger. In August, she and Kennedy dropped their independent presidential campaign and endorsed Donald Trump, spearheading a “Make America Healthy Again” initiative to back the former president. Such a wealthy benefactor supporting Trump signals that she might be involved in his administration if he wins the election, and doesn’t bode well for public health in America, either. The fact that she tried to bribe a reporter means she shares the former president’s lack of ethics. Donald Trump’s supporters are angry over an article that isn’t even real—and they keep spreading it online. At issue is an image circulating online appearing to be a screenshot of an article from The Atlantic with the headline “Trump Is Literally Hitler,” distorting an article published Tuesday with the headline “Trump: ‘I Need the Kind of Generals That Hitler Had.’” The Atlantic published a press release Wednesday refuting the existence of an article with the headline reading “Trump Is Literally Hitler,” after MAGA fans wouldn’t stop sharing it on social media, including Trump’s wealthiest fan, X CEO Elon Musk, who got hit with the Community Notes feature on the platform he owns. Utah Senator Mike Lee also shared the screenshot before deleting it later. Several other right-wing influencers jumped on too. The screenshot appears to have been a creation of X user Indian_Bronson, who admitted it was a fake in a follow-up post. As the election draws closer, it’s not surprising that fake news is being shared and picking up steam on social media. It’s not the first time that Musk has shared false information that supports his political views either, and it’s probably not the last. In this case, X’s Community Notes feature and The Atlantic caught the screenshot, but not before it got millions of views. In the next two weeks, how bad will the misinformation be, and will it be corrected quickly enough? A new Trumpian super PAC has hit the market—just in time for its donor details to remain secret until after the November election. The America First Action Fund was organized on October 18, just late enough in the game to skirt donor disclosures until after Election Day, independent journalist Roger Sollenberger reported Wednesday. The move will prevent any transparency around exactly which individuals are fueling Trump’s campaign this late in election season. The freshly minted super PAC is tied to two separate dark money groups by way of its treasurer, Ashley Hayek, a 2020 Trump campaign staffer who also serves as the executive director of America First Works and the chief engagement officer of the America First Policy Institute. That latter group, like the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, is one of several in the running to offer staff picks and transition roadmaps for a potential second term under Donald Trump. But as a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit, America First Policy Institute can’t formally support a candidate for office. Instead, it’s been quietly focused on driving some of Trump’s chief policy goals, including deregulating the federal government. America First Policy Institute received Trump’s blessing even before it was founded in 2021, reported Politico. “For three and a half years, AFPI has focused on personnel and policy. It was formed by and is teeming with senior staffers from the first Trump Administration whose goal is to be ready on day one,” Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump adviser who chairs AFPI’s Center for the American Child, told Politico in August. “Linda McMahon, Brooke Rollins and the team have planned with precision and executed with put-your-head-down type humility.” Hit dogs holler. Marjorie Taylor Greene is spinning out about Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledging comments from John Kelly that Donald Trump is a Hitler-loving fascist. Harris responded Wednesday to two damning reports from The New York Times and The Atlantic, in which Trump’s former chief of staff recalled Trump’s praise of Hitler and his desire to have generals like the Nazi leader did. After Harris dared bring up Kelly’s remarks, Greene accused Harris of trying to get Trump killed. “Vice President Kamala Harris is desperate, dangerous, and lying about President Trump,” the Georgia representative wrote on X. Vice President Kamala Harris is desperate, dangerous, and lying about President Trump.Kamala Harris just compared him to Hitler.She is going to get him killed. pic.twitter.com/Y25V2Ul5AK You would think that Harris had just told Democrats to “stand back and stand by,” based on Greene’s description of the vice president’s spontaneous address. But Harris’s comments were simple and without dramatization. “It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of six million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans,” said Harris in her address, responding to Kelly’s allegations. “Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable, and in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities and his actions.” In the Times interview Tuesday, Kelly called Trump a “fascist” who would regularly praise Hitler and other dictators. Also on Tuesday, The Atlantic reported that two sources confirmed the Republican candidate declared, near the end of his term, “I need the kind of generals that Hitler had.” Greene will speak with Trump at a rally in Duluth, Georgia, Wednesday night alongside Charlie Kirk, Tucker Carlson, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and more in the nightmare lineup. At the campaign event, expect more whining about the attacks on her favorite president. Republicans are struggling to defend the report of Donald Trump’s wild comment pining for “the kind of generals that Hitler had”—and in some cases, they’re not defending it at all. New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu said Wednesday that a casual appreciation for Hitler’s Nazi regime was “par for the course” for the Republican presidential nominee. During an interview with CNN, Sununu was asked whether Trump’s alleged statement was a deal-breaker for the Republican governor. “No,” Sununu said, explaining that in the end, “it’s all about results.” Independent voters, he said, don’t care for “ultraliberal extremism” and just “need a cultural change coming out of Washington.” “Look, we’ve heard a lot of extreme things about Donald Trump from Donald Trump. It’s kind of par for the course. It’s really, unfortunately, uh with a guy like that, it’s kind of baked into the vote at this point,” Sununu said. Sununu showed just how quick he, and likely other Republicans too, have been to accept Trump’s extremist tendencies. But, as Sununu explained moments later, he was only doing it because it’s what everyone else was doing. CNN’s Kate Bolduan then asked Sununu whether he was OK with supporting a candidate who former chief John Kelly said fit “into the general definition of fascist” and “certainly prefers the dictator approach” to governing. “That is something you are supporting, is that something you are OK with?” Bolduan asked. “No, look I don’t think anyone should be OK with statements like that, of course,” Sununu said. “And if there’s ever anyone you don’t want any sort of comparison to, it’s Hitler and all of that sort of thing. “As we’ve discussed before, it’s not just what Chris Sununu is going for. I think most of America is gonna go this way,” he continued. So, while Sununu can acknowledge that Hitler is bad, it’s only from an optics standpoint. If everyone else is OK with it, it’s better to just get on board!

NEXT | When does Diablo 3 Season 33 start? Shadows move with the Shades of... The War Within patch 11.0.5 rolled out this week, and while I’ve been enjoying the anniversary the launch has been a bit rocky. The game is certainly playable, but there are more than a few bugs, and the anniversary Blackrock Depths raid is tuned such that you need a group geared better than what it drops to easily clear it. (Plus there’s not a single piece of gear inside that has mastery, if that happens to be your thing.) It’s a little less fun than expected. So perhaps patch 11.0.5 troubles are why the World of Warcraft servers went down for an off-schedule maintenance this morning from 7am – 8am pacific — but The War Within servers are now back online. Servers are stable, but no word on what (if anything) changed during the maintenance. We’ll keep our eyes open for any more news, but for now I’m off to adventure in Khaz Algar.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4. As LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission. Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove “horrendous” for LLMs in the short term. “The short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They’re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it’s measurable.” However, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they’d be enjoying. READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In The analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it’s competing with a lot of “big guns.” He quoted Oracle’s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a “proprietary” large language model. “So, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it’s a big raise for a private company that’s moving quickly, but they’re going to get acquired. They’re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.” For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Radu Bercan / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279 KeyBanc’s third-quarter 2024 survey of value-added resellers (VARs) has noted a rise in IT budget expectations. “For 2024, IT budgets saw a slight growth in expectations, but the bigger shift was in 2025, where budgets are now expected to grow by 4.4%, up from 3.2% just 90 days ago,” said KeyBanc analysts, led by Jackson Ader, in a detailed report to investors. Based on this survey, the firm gave bullish ratings to several stocks, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft’s target was increased to $505 from $490. DA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company’s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum. Luria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA’s, according to Luria. Following a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft’s dependence on NVIDIA. Luria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins. The analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities. The concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta’s Llama 3.1. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category – nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google’s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years. Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The French Connection to Online Bets on Ex-President...

Time Published: 2024-10-24T12:58:36Z

With the presidential race so tight, election watchers have become increasingly fascinated by political prediction markets, especially as the odds implied by wagers on their platforms suggest that Donald Trump is more likely to win the election. Questions have arisen about a group of four accounts on Polymarket, one of the most popular platforms, and whether they artificially inflated Trump’s odds there. The start-up told DealBook’s Michael de la Merced that it didn’t believe that to be the case, and provided more information about who’s behind the bets. The company said that one person was responsible, confirming online speculation. It said that a French national with “extensive trading experience and a financial services background” was the whale behind the accounts — Fredi9999, Theo4, PrincessCaro and Michie — dominating a particular bet about who will win the election. The collective size of the trading positions of the accounts was about $28 million as of Thursday morning, according to data on Polymarket. Polymarket added that it had made contact with the trader as part of an investigation that was being carried out with the help of outside experts. (DealBook understands the platform worked with Nardello & Company, an investigations firm.) DealBook hasn’t independently verified the details in Polymarket’s statement, though others have concluded that the four accounts are linked. Polymarket said it had found no evidence of attempted market manipulation. Instead, it said the trader was “taking a directional position based on personal views of the election.” By spreading out relatively small bets on Trump’s odds, the trader’s goal appeared to be buying up the contract but not suddenly pushing up its price. (Bloomberg Opinion’s Matt Levine has made a similar argument.) That said, Polymarket added that the person had agreed “not to open further accounts without notice.” Polymarket said that its contract’s performance was “generally consistent with the price movements on other prediction market platforms.” The contract shows the odds of a Trump victory at over 60 percent Thursday morning. By comparison, similar contracts on PredictIt and Kalshi reflect a slightly tighter spread between Trump’s and Harris’s odds. Worth noting: Polymarket doesn’t have a primary regulator. The company has been barred from allowing bets by Americans since 2022, as part of a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. A Polymarket representative said it hoped to be allowed back in the United States and to be regulated by the agency. Wagers on the presidential election have taken off in this cycle, especially after claims that these markets are better predictors of the White House race than traditional polls. More money has poured into them after a federal court cleared Kalshi to open up to American bettors. But the seeming disparity between polls, which show a neck-and-neck race, and the odds on prediction markets has raised questions about potential manipulation to paint an overly rosy picture about Trump’s prospects. Polymarket stressed in its statement that political prediction markets, which track the odds of a candidate’s victory implied by bets on a platform, aren’t the equivalent to polls, which show how people intend to actually vote. Southwest reaches a settlement with its activist investor. The airline said on Thursday that it would give Elliott Investment Management several board seats. The deal averts a potentially costly and distracting proxy fight. Apple and Goldman Sachs are fined nearly $90 million over credit cards. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused the two companies of failing to properly handle fraud and refunds related to Apple Card, as well as misleading customers about interest-free payment options for some products. The Group of 7 finalizes a $50 billion loan to Ukraine. Member nations agreed to give financing backed by frozen Russian central bank assets, essentially trying to force Moscow to pay for the damages of its invasion. The move gives Kyiv a financial lifeline without putting G7 nations’ taxpayers on the hook. U.S. home sales tumble, again. Sales in September fell 1 percent from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.84 million; that’s down 3.5 percent year-on-year. It’s the lowest rate since October 2010, and puts 2024 on track to be the worst for existing home sales since 1995, amid elevated mortgage rates, high house prices and rising insurance costs. DealBook wrote this week about normally outspoken business leaders staying mum about the presidential race. New developments suggest that doing so could lead to controversy. The Los Angeles Times’s editorial board editor, Mariel Garza, resigned on Thursday, after accusing Patrick Soon-Shiong, the newspaper’s billionaire owner, of blocking an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. “I want to make it clear that I am not OK with us being silent,” Garza told Columbia Journalism Review. Soon-Shiong pushed back on X, writing that the editorial board was allowed to essentially draw up a comparison of the policies of Harris and Donald Trump and let readers decide whom to support. The editorial board decided to pass, he wrote. (Garza told The New York Times that what he had proposed was “not an endorsement, or even an editorial.”) It’s another sign of corporate leaders’ cautiousness about publicly weighing in on the race, one shared by the likes of Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. There’s another potential addition to the list: Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post hasn’t yet endorsed a presidential candidate. (Status’s Oliver Darcy reports that inside The Post, employees believe a draft endorsement for Harris has been written.) Bezos has been attacked by Trump over the years, and stood up to him when he was president. But other outspoken business moguls are now staying silent, fearful of potential retribution should Trump win. In other political news: The Justice Department reportedly warned Elon Musk’s pro-Trump super PAC that its $1 million sweepstakes for registered voters in battleground states may be illegal. And some Trump backers are said to have criticized Howard Lutnick, the financier leading the former president’s transition team, about mixing his business interests with his political work. Tesla has largely missed out on the bull market run that has pushed tech stocks to records over the past year. But it’s making up some lost ground after Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker delivered blockbuster earnings and gave hints about how the company might capitalize on a potential Trump presidency. Here are the big numbers: Profits last quarter soared by 17 percent year-on-year on the strength of its battery storage and vehicle-charging businesses. The sale of regulatory credits to other car makers to meet their carbon emissions also helped. Car sales grew modestly, but Tesla warned — not for the first time — that it expected only “slight growth” in deliveries this year. Shares in Tesla, the first of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech companies to report results, jumped more than 10 percent in premarket trading — a surge that helped lift the broader S&P 500. Musk outlined what he might do in a Trump administration. He called for a federal approval process for self-driving cars rather than a state-by-state regime. Musk said he would push for it if Donald Trump creates a government efficiency agency, which Musk wants to run. “If there’s a department of government efficiency, I’ll try to help make that happen,” Musk told analysts. Tesla is trying to get approval for its autonomous robotaxis in California and Texas, and said that all of its models would eventually be self-driving. The company plans to introduce a ride-hailing app. That, too, would require regulatory approval, which Musk said he expected would be easier to first obtain in Texas. After that, the rollout plan is California and “other states.” Investors have Trump questions, too. Dozens of shareholders took to an online forum ahead of Wednesday’s earnings call to ask whether the company was taking into account the possible fallout of Musk’s advocacy of Trump. “How does Tesla address this, and can it confirm Musk’s actions are not harming sales or growth?” one post read. Boeing’s brand-new turnaround plan is already hitting major turbulence. Shares in the plane maker are down in premarket trading after the company’s largest union rejected a new labor deal just hours after the company reported a $6 billion quarterly loss. Here’s the latest: Members of the union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, will extend a nearly six-week strike after voting against a four-year contract on Wednesday. The proposed new deal would have raised pay by 35 percent but was rejected by nearly two-thirds of union members who voted. Inflation and pension concerns doomed the plan. The tentative contract left out a major union demand: the restoration of a defined-benefit pension plan that was frozen a decade ago. And one Boeing worker told The Wall Street Journal that the bump in pay was too low to bolster the “buying power” of members. The strike has essentially shut down production of some of Boeing’s best-selling airliners as the company’s losses mount, and as it tries to avert a crippling credit downgrade. Boeing is looking to tap the bond and equities market to raise as much as $25 billion to fund operations. It is reportedly also mulling a wider asset sale and warned that its cash burn would worsen next year. Boeing’s woes have reverberated throughout the industry, with some of its biggest airline customers, including Ryanair, warning that the production backlog will dent their growth. But the contract’s defeat is a major blow to the new C.E.O.’s plans. Hours before the vote result, Kelly Ortberg, who was hired this summer to revive the crisis-plagued manufacturing giant, delivered a cautious proposal to revive the company’s fortunes. Job 1: ending the strike.

(Bloomberg) -- R3, a blockchain company backed by investors including Bank of America Corp. and Intel Corp., is exploring strategic options including selling itself, people familiar with the matter said. Most Read from Bloomberg Robotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation Booming Cambridge Exposes England’s Widening Wealth Gap Oman Sees an Urban Future Distinct From Dubai and Abu Dhabi Argentina Drug Trafficking Hotspot Sees Murders Plunge Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion The New York-based company has held initial discussions with representatives from Ava Labs, the Solana Foundation and Adhara, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private deliberations. The talks, which have been happening for at least six months, included options ranging from a joint venture to a minority stake sale or an outright sale. Founded in 2014, R3 was one of the earliest and buzziest startups to focus on developing blockchain-based systems for banks and other financial firms. It initially led a consortium of large banks focused on building blockchain systems that could run some of their most complex processes. Some initial members including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley left the group as R3 sought external funding starting in 2016, according to news reports at the time. A spokesperson for R3 declined to comment, as did a representative for Adhara. The Solana Foundation and Solana Labs did not respond to repeated requests for comment. While its Corda technology is used by several live platforms like the Swiss stock exchanges’s digital-assets venue, some projects did not move beyond the testing phase, the people said. The company fired around a fifth of its workforce a year ago. It now has between 200 and 250 employees, one of the people said. R3 raised $122 million in a round completed in 2018 from more than 40 institutions, according to data provider Pitchbook. Investors in the round — one of the largest ever for a blockchain company at the time — included Barclays Plc, UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo & Co, Pitchbook data show. The company considered going public as early as 2018, Bloomberg News reported at the time. While blockchain adoption in traditional finance has been slower than expected, the people said, several large firms have continued to express interest in areas such as tokenizing traditional financial assets. BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest asset manager, in March unveiled its first tokenized mutual fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund. The firm is now pushing to have the fund’s native digital token more widely used as collateral for crypto derivatives, Bloomberg News reported this month. --With assistance from Emily Nicolle and Suvashree Ghosh.

Title: BlackRock launches three targeted ETFs for investors looking to diversify risks

By Niket Nishant and Manya Saini (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has launched three new exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including two that offer exposure to the largest U.S. stocks and one designed to avoid them, reflecting asset managers' efforts to provide more tailored investment options. The sustainability of the rally in mega-cap stocks has been one of the biggest talking points among investors. While advocates tout their outsized gains, critics are worried about frothy valuations and concentration risk. Offering various options will allow BlackRock to tap the demand for equities regardless of investor preferences. "The beauty of these ETFs is that they can be used by investors looking for more targeted exposure to mega-caps or those looking to diversify their exposure to large companies," said Rachel Aguirre, BlackRock's U.S. Head of iShares Products. The iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF will offer access to the 20 largest U.S. companies. The iShares Nasdaq Top 30 Stocks ETF will let investors hold the 30 biggest non-financial stocks, including mega-cap tech. It has secured backing from the University of California's investing arm. The third product, the iShares Nasdaq-100 ex Top 30 ETF, will invest beyond the behemoths in the hopes of capturing the growth of relatively smaller tech firms. The launch comes days after BlackRock debuted two ETFs to tap into the booming artificial intelligence space, leaning into thematic ETFs even as such funds lose their appeal. MEGA CAP RETURNS The top 20 companies in the S&P 500 have contributed more than two-thirds of the index's returns over the past three years, BlackRock said. Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which targets the so-called 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants, is up 40% in 2024. BlackRock holds a portfolio of over 1,400 ETFs under its iShares business with more than $4.2 trillion in assets under management, as of Sept. 30. ETF inflows have been key to its growth strategy in recent years.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Falling Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE:MUR) stands against other best falling stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Analysts at Goldman Sachs on October 21st released a note forecasting that the S&P 500 average annual return of 13% for the past 10 years might come down to just 3% for the next decade. The estimates by Goldman Sachs are far below Wall Street’s estimates as analysts on Wall Street expect the index performance to range from 4.4% to 7.4%, with an average of 6%. Analysts at Goldman Sachs based their forecast on the concern that market concentration within the S&P 500 has been at a record high in its 100-year history. They mentioned that the top 10 largest stocks of the index currently account for more than 36% of the overall index. These top 10 constituents of the index have increased in size due to exceptional earnings growth over the past 2 years. The Magnificent Seven alone have at least doubled their earnings year-over-year during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. However, analysts at the firm believe that historical evidence shows it is extremely challenging for companies to sustain high levels of sales growth and profit margins for more than a decade. They also noted that the sales growth of the Magnificent Seven has already started to fall from the accelerated pace of their growth during the past 2 years. On the bright side, analysts pointed out that growth is expected to pick up for the remaining stocks on the index. They expect double-digit earnings growth for these remaining 493 stocks over the next 5 quarters.

Sylvia Jablonski, Defiance ETFs CEO and CIO joined CNBC on October 22 for an interview to talk about the earnings season progress and also shared her point of view regarding the recent note from Goldman Sachs. She noted that we have seen around 14% of the S&P 500 that have reported their earnings and, out of those, 79% beat expectations. She thinks this is a solid start to the earnings season. Jablonski also mentioned that the bar for some of the companies has also come down, for instance in July analysts were talking about 6% to 7% year-over-year growth, and now we are looking at around 5% growth and companies have been achieving it for the most part. While talking about Goldman Sachs’s recent note, she mentioned that the shrink in annual return by the index depends on a few factors. While the valuations are high, the earnings are strong and profits are also growing, thereby the high valuations have started to feel justified. However, it only remains justified until the valuations become lofty again. Jablonski pointed out that while the Magnificent Seven stocks have been the top performers of the last decade, we are going to see a broadening of the market where the performance would come from the remaining stocks in the index. She thinks that this transition of growth from the top constituents of the index to smaller stocks might affect the annual returns. However, AI is going to drive the index for the next 5 to 10 years. Jablonski mentioned utility facilities and energy sector companies having grown in triple digits due to artificial intelligence. Lastly, Jablonski clarified that she is not bearing on tech or semiconductors but the leaders in the S&P 500 are expected to change with Magnificent Seven slowing down in terms of the stellar growth they have posted in the past. Our Methodology To curate the list of the 10 best falling stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Yahoo Finance. We defined falling stocks as those trading within 0% to 3% of their 52-week lows. Using the Finviz stock screener, we got an aggregated list of stocks that fit our criteria. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge funds holding each stock during Q2 2024, as per Insider Monkey’s database. All indicators were recorded on October 21st, 2024. Please note that the list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A large oil tanker being filled up in a refinery, a symbol of the company's vast energy production. 52 Week Range: $32.53 – $49.14 Current Share Price: $32.96 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37 Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE:MUR) ranks as the 8th best-falling stock to buy according to hedge funds. It is trading close to its 52-week low, however, 37 hedge funds held stakes in the stock in Q2 2024, as per Insider Monkey’s database, indicating bullish sentiment. The company operates as an independent oil and gas-producing company in the United States and Canada. The company searches for new oil and gas-rich areas at onshore and offshore locations to extract and sell energy resources. Murphy Oil Corporation (NYSE:MUR), has been actively managing its financial strategies and operational projects in recent quarters. Management has remained focused on achieving Murphy 3.0, which is a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing shareholder returns while maintaining a focus on reducing long-term debt. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the company repurchased $50 million of its senior notes as a move to bring its long-term debt to $1 billion. It also repurchased 56 million shares in the second quarter and an additional 44 million shares by early August, indicating its efforts regarding Murphy 3.0. In terms of production, the company produced an average of 181,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with oil making up 50% of that volume, exceeding their guidance. The second quarter revenue came in at $746 million with a net income of $128 million. Looking ahead, management plans on returning 50% of its adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and utilizing the rest 50% for improving its balance sheet to reduce debt. Overall, MUR ranks 8th on our list of best falling stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of MUR to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Take it outside, Deputy Speaker tells MPs duking it out over MAHB-GIP deal

Thursday, 24 Oct 2024 KUALA LUMPUR: Take your squabbles outside the House, warns Deputy Dewan Rakyat Speaker Alice Lau after a war of words erupted during the afternoon debates. This comes after Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin (PN-Putrajaya) challenged Howard Lee (PH-Ipoh Timor) to a debate over the sale of Malaysia Airport Holdings Berhad (MAHB) shares to BlackRock Inc. A visibly frustrated Lau then switched off their microphones and sternly ordered them to take things outside. ALSO READ: No foreign ownership, govt to retain full control of MAHB, says Finance Ministry “If any of you want to challenge each other (to debates), do it outside. Not here,” warned Lau on Thursday (Oct 24). When debating the Supply Bill 2025 earlier on Thursday, Radzi claimed MAHB was being “sold to BlackRock”. Lee interjected saying that Radzi’s statement was misleading. Radzi then said 30% of MAHB shares were being sold, with Lee arguing this meant 70% is still owned by Malaysia with the matter erupting into a shouting match. Earlier this year, it was reported that GIP planned to buy a 30% stake in MAHB’s privatisation move. GIP has since been acquired by BlackRock, a firm that is reported to have investments in Israel. The deal has been heavily criticised by opposition politicians as Malaysia strongly supports Palestine.

Title: BlackRock goes on Bitcoin buying spree when others flee

Share this article BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) keeps attracting investor interest, ending Wednesday with over $317 million in net inflows while most competing ETFs struggle to maintain their winning streak. Trailing behind IBIT, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust, the BTC fund, reported gains of nearly $5 million yesterday, according to Farside Investors data. In contrast, ARK Invest’s ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL, suffered a combined loss of nearly $130 million. With IBIT’s massive inflows and additional capital from BTC, the group of US spot Bitcoin ETFs reversed a negative trend yesterday, collectively drawing in around $192 million. These funds have shown mixed trends this week, unlike last week when there was no net bleeding reported. Flows turned negative on Tuesday after $294 million in gains on Monday. The ARKB fund, which enjoyed over $300 million in inflows last week, has been hit hard. The ETF has seen nearly $240 million in redemptions so far this week, almost wiping its gains from the previous week. Meanwhile, it seems that GBTC’s outflows have subsided; the fund saw only about $5 million in losses on Monday. The latest performance coincides with Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. After peaking at $69,500 last week, Bitcoin has pulled back, now hovering around the $67,000 level, per CoinGecko. Standard Chartered analysts are confident that the largest crypto will revisit its previous record high before the next president is selected, thereby boosting the chances of “Uptober.” However, recent declines may dampen the “Uptober” outlook, especially with the US presidential election just around the corner. Bitcoin may face a “sell-the-news” scenario ahead of the key event. As the election approaches, investors often speculate on how the results might impact various asset classes, including crypto. This anticipation can lead to increased volatility, with traders potentially selling off assets to lock in profits before election results are announced. Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations are more likely influenced by broader macroeconomic trends rather than direct political events. However, any significant news related to the election could trigger reactions from investors looking to adjust their portfolios based on perceived risks or opportunities. Some analysts predict that a Trump victory could lead to a surge in Bitcoin prices due to his pro-crypto stance. As soon as the election is over, the market is likely to take little rest as the next FOMC meeting occurs, when the Fed makes its interest rate decision. The central bank is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points as part of its ongoing monetary policy adjustments, which analysts suggest could further boost Bitcoin’s prices.

Title: India Bond ETFs To Draw Billions as Amundi to BlackRock Join Race

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Some of the world’s biggest exchange-traded fund providers are battling it out for the billions of dollars expected to flow into Indian bonds in coming years through their inclusion in key global indexes. Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion Oman Sees an Urban Future Distinct From Dubai and Abu Dhabi Transportation Policy Gets Left Behind in Presidential Race How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Booming Cambridge Exposes England’s Widening Wealth Gap BlackRock Inc., Amundi SA and Janus Henderson’s Tabula Investment Management unit are among those that have launched new ETFs on the sector since JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s decision to include Indian debt in its key emerging-market index last year. Such ETFs are set to attract $5 billion to $10 billion over the medium term, according to estimates by asset management firm DWS Group. “India is too big to ignore,” said Benoit Sorel, global head of ETF, indexing and smart beta at Amundi, the largest European ETF provider. “It’s becoming a key allocation within emerging-market debt. The first key interests are coming from professional investors, who are benchmarking their allocation.” Sorel, who worked for over a decade at BlackRock before joining Amundi last year, helped oversee the rollout of the company’s new Indian government bond ETF last month. India’s weighting in JPMorgan’s emerging-markets bond index will jump to 10% by March from the current level of 4%. The securities are also set to be added to developing-nation debt gauges owned by FTSE Russell and Bloomberg. That process is poised to bring billions into the largely domestic-led market, that has so far been largely insulated from global gyrations due to low overseas ownership. Rupee-denominated government bonds are currently the highest yielding in Asia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on the largest regional markets. Indian bonds have attracted $15.4 billion of inflows this year, the most in Asia behind China, South Korea and Japan, data compiled by Bloomberg show. ‘Compelling’ Case DWS sees plenty of scope for Indian assets to rise due to the country’s demographic makeup and their relatively low correlation with other global markets. “The strength of its equity market, the youth and level of education of its workforce, but also its lower exposure to geopolitical risks make the case of India compelling to both equity and fixed-income investors,” said Olivier Souliac, head of Xtrackers indexing at DWS in Frankfurt. “The strength of a passive product will, according to us, lie in its convenience,” he said. Not everyone is convinced this is an ideal time to buy Indian debt. “It’s too crowded,” said Shamaila Khan, head of fixed-income emerging markets & Asia Pacific at UBS Asset Management in New York. “India’s a positive story in the medium term, but right now there’s just too much good news priced in.” Dollar bonds from Sri Lanka and Pakistan, along with Chinese high yield debt look to be better bets, she said. PineBridge Investments said this month it’s avoiding Indian sovereign bonds due to the bureaucratic challenges of investing in the country and the company’s preference for the higher carry offered in Latin America. BlackRock says one of the advantages of buying Indian bond ETFs is that they will help investors sidestep any bureaucratic obstacles of investing in the country. “There are structural challenges for foreign investors to get their hands on any of these bonds easily,” said Hui Sien Koay, lead fixed-income-product strategist for Asia Pacific at BlackRock in Singapore. “The ETF gets rid of all those. ETFs are so accessible to everyone.” There are a number of reasons why investors won’t be able to overlook India for long, she said “It’s the last large market of over $1 trillion to enter widely followed indexes. It’s got the depth, it’s got the breadth, it’s got the different tenors, long and short, and that’s why we’re in the game.” (Updates inflows in sixth pagragraph, adds additional comment from analyst in ninth.

Title: Portfolio Update: Alliance Witan completes portfolio transition, brings in EdgePoint for Black Creek

October 24, 2024 02:00 ET | Source: Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC (the “Company”) LEI: 213800SZZD4E21OZ9W55 Portfolio Update: Alliance Witan completes portfolio transition, brings in EdgePoint for Black Creek Alliance Witan’s investment manager, Willis Towers Watson (“WTW”), is pleased to announce the completion of the transition of assets from Witan Investment Trust (“Witan”) to Alliance Witan following shareholder approval for the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan on 9 October. Blackrock Inc. has helped to manage the transition and keep the costs to a minimum. While Blackrock was completing the transition of assets, WTW took the opportunity to also make a manager change, replacing Black Creek Investment Management (“Black Creek”) with EdgePoint Wealth Management (“EdgePoint”). The appointment of EdgePoint follows that of Jennison Associates, previously one of Witan’s investment managers, which was announced at the start of the transition just over two weeks ago. EdgePoint, based in Toronto, is an employee-owned business, founded in 2008. It manages $25bn of client assets, as of 30 June 2024, and seeks to buy good, undervalued business and hold them until the market fully realises their potential. With the portfolio realignment now completed, the new manager allocations are as follows: The resulting risk profile of the portfolio is largely unchanged, with no excessive exposure relative to the benchmark to regions, sectors or styles, and most of the added value is expected to come from stock selection. The direct costs of the portfolio transition and manager changes, including BlackRock’s fee, trading commissions, tax and bid/offer spreads, will be less than 0.04% of the Alliance Witan portfolio, representing fair value for shareholders. Craig Baker, Chief Investment Officer of WTW and Chair of the Alliance Witan Investment Committee, said: “We would like to express our appreciation to the team at Black Creek for their contribution to the Company since their appointment in 2017. While we continue to rate Black Creek highly, a senior member of the team left in the last 12 months on health grounds, and we have been evaluating succession planning for some time. While Bill Kanko has no specific retirement date in mind and there are other experienced investors at the firm, we have taken the opportunity to switch to a manager in which we have high conviction, and which brings a fresh perspective to the new, combined portfolio. Baker added: “Now that Witan’s assets are fully invested, it is business as usual. We will be using the same proven investment approach we have always used for Alliance Witan, although we will be retaining a small number of Witan’s discounted investment trust holdings, which represent less than 3% of the portfolio, until such time that they can be sold at an attractive price for shareholders.” Ends About Alliance Witan (ALW) Alliance Witan aims to deliver long-term capital growth and rising income from investing in global equities at a competitive cost. Our investment manager blends the top stock selections of some of the world’s best active managers into a single diversified portfolio designed to outperform the market while carefully managing risk and volatility.

Title: Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): Revolutionizing Delivery with Record Speed and Prime Benefits

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 7 Best Delivery Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best delivery stocks to invest in now. The delivery and courier industry is diverse, encompassing a wide range of services that connect businesses and consumers through various shipping methods. Parcel delivery services are a major component, with companies offering both domestic and international shipping options, driven by the rise of e-commerce. Another significant segment is food delivery platforms. These platforms connect hungry customers with local eateries, creating a new business model that thrives on convenience. Overall, the delivery industry is evolving rapidly, with diverse players working to meet the growing expectations for speed and reliability in shipping services. According to Zion Market Research, the global on-demand delivery market was valued at $15.19 billion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20.90% during 2024-2032 to reach $83.82 billion by ​the end of the forecast period. In 2023, the Asia-Pacific region led the market in revenue and is projected to maintain its dominance throughout the forecast period. Read Also: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In This growth is fueled by increasing consumer expectations for fast and reliable delivery services, particularly same-day and next-day options. Experts highlight that the demand for quick deliveries has led to substantial investments in last-mile delivery solutions and advanced technologies, such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI). In 2024, consumers have continued to prioritize free and fast shipping for their online orders, according to recent data from Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights. A survey of 1,013 online shoppers revealed that 81.34% consider free shipping their top priority when receiving deliveries. Fast shipping follows closely, with 68.41% of respondents highlighting its importance. Additionally, 55.68% of consumers emphasized the need for retailers to keep products in stock and ready to ship. AI and automation are key trends that are significantly transforming the delivery services industry, making operations more efficient and responsive to consumer demands. For example, companies like DHL Express have introduced the DHLBot in Singapore and South Korea. The DHLBot is an AI-powered robotics arm that can sort over 1,000 small parcels per hour with 99% accuracy. This technology not only speeds up the sorting process but also reduces labor costs and minimizes errors, allowing for quicker deliveries. As the industry evolves, it is clear that AI and automation will play a crucial role in shaping the future of delivery services. Methodology To compile our list of the 7 best delivery stocks to invest in now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest delivery companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources. From an initial pool of more than 20 delivery stocks, we focused on the top 7 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 912 elite hedge funds. The 7 best delivery stocks to invest in now are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a major American technology company known for its extensive e-commerce platform, which offers a wide variety of products ranging from books to electronics. The company has grown to become the world’s largest online retailer and a leader in cloud computing through its Amazon Web Services (AWS). A key aspect of its business is its delivery services, which include fast shipping options like Amazon Prime, allowing members to receive their orders quickly through same-day delivery, one-day delivery, and two-day delivery service options. The company’s innovative logistics network continues to redefine online shopping and delivery experiences globally. At the end of July, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a remarkable achievement in its delivery service, reporting that over 5 billion items have already been delivered the same or next day globally this year, marking a 30% increase from the previous year. This record speed not only benefits Prime members by allowing them to receive products faster but also supports small and medium-sized businesses, with many of these deliveries made on behalf of independent sellers using the company’s Fulfillment by Amazon service. Since the launch of Prime in 2005, the selection of items eligible for free Prime shipping has expanded from just one million to over 300 million, with tens of millions available for Same-Day or One-Day Delivery. This means that Prime members now enjoy 20 times more options delivered much quicker than before, enhancing the overall value of their membership. In November 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) surpassed UPS in parcel volume in 2022 and surpassed FedEx in 2020, with expectations that this lead will continue to grow based on internal Amazon data. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is actively enhancing its services to provide even greater value to its Prime members, which makes it an attractive delivery stock to consider. In the first half of 2024, the company achieved record delivery speeds and this rapid delivery is supported by an expanded selection of products, including popular brands like Aéropostale and Kiehl’s. Additionally, Amazon.com Inc.

Chainlink nears breakout, boosted by whale activity and expanding real-world asset integration. Chainlink [LINK] neared a potential breakout as it approached a critical point in the market. At press time, LINK was trading within a falling wedge pattern on the weekly timeframe, and many traders anticipated a significant upward movement soon. These developments could push LINK’s price higher as it became an even more vital player in the crypto world. Looking at recent price action, Chainlink has gained around 0.5% over the past week. However, the last 24 hours saw a decline of 5.6%. Despite the short-term losses, LINK’s trading volume surged by over 10%, with approximately $290 million changing hands. The volume-to-market-cap ratio sat at 4%, indicating sufficient liquidity to support continued trading activity. As LINK moves toward a possible breakout, all eyes are on the $15 level. If LINK can break and hold above this resistance, it could trigger a rally that targets $50 by next year. Source: TradingView LINK is currently trading below the 50-day moving average, and flipping this level could reignite bullish momentum. Traders are closely watching for this signal, as it could confirm a breakout from the falling wedge pattern. If the breakout occurs, LINK could see a strong move higher, making it a top contender in the crypto market during the final quarter of the year. Large trades and whale orders are offering further clues about LINK’s future direction. On the K-line chart, large trades appear as circles, with the size representing the trade amount. Whale orders are marked by horizontal lines, with Chainlink’s big orders concentrated around the $11 zone. These trades suggest that large investors are positioning themselves for a move higher, as whales typically accumulate when they expect a price increase. The longer these orders remain unfilled, the more likely it is that they will drive LINK’s price higher. Source: Coinglass Chainlink’s expansion into real-world assets (RWA) and artificial intelligence (AI) is also setting the stage for a significant price boost. Chainlink’s role as a provider of secure oracles for smart contracts positions it perfectly for the upcoming tokenization of RWAs. As major financial players like BlackRock explore tokenizing stocks, bonds, and real estate, Chainlink could become a central infrastructure for these assets. Read Chainlink’s [LINK] Price Prediction 2024–2025 This integration could absorb massive amounts of liquidity into LINK, further driving its price higher. Chainlink is at a pivotal moment. If LINK holds key support levels and breaks above $15, the sky may be the limit.

Title: Is Blue Bird Corporation (BLBD) the Best EV Stock to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best EV Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Blue Bird Corporation (NASDAQ:BLBD) stands against the other EV stocks. After a swift rise in the EV industry over the years, we saw a slowdown in its progress, especially in Europe and the USA. Nevertheless, it is just a matter of time before the technology takes over the traditional internal combustion engines (ICE). While the growth has been slowing in the western part of the world, China has been working tirelessly to become the global leader in the EV industry. In a podcast episode of Everything Electric Show on October 20, Ford CEO Jim Farley discussed the ongoing transformation in the automotive industry. He noted that while EV adoption continues to grow worldwide, significant changes have occurred regarding market dynamics. He emphasized China's dominance in EV production, with 70% of global EVs manufactured there. A rapidly expanding sub-segment in China is electric vehicles with extended range (e-rev), which use a small combustion engine to power the batteries for longer trips. This shift is reshaping global supply chains, brand preferences, and jobs, with geopolitical factors further influencing the industry's future. Farley noted that these changes have become clearer over the past year. We also discussed the country’s dominance in our article about small-cap EV stocks to invest in. Here is an excerpt from the article: “While the growth in the US and Europe is slowing down, China is picking up a significant pace and dominating the EV landscape. According to a World Economic Forum report, Chinese EVs are much cheaper than their Western counterparts, with an average price of $34,400, compared to $55,242 in the U.S. The price gap is driven by lower labor costs, favorable government subsidies, and more affordable battery sourcing. Read Also: 7 Best Delivery Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable in 2024. The United States government acknowledges the potential of EVs in the future of mobility and is trying its best to push for its development. On July 11, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced $1.7 billion in grants aimed at converting 11 auto plants in eight states to produce electric vehicles and components. Reuters reported on October 22 that U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm announced that the DOE is working quickly to finalize $1.7 billion in grants. The funds include $500 million for GM’s Michigan plant and $334.8 million for Stellantis’ Belvidere plant, with additional funds for the latter’s Indiana facility. According to another Reuters report from September 23, Monroe Capital LLC announced plans to launch the Drive Forward Fund LP, aiming to raise up to $1 billion to provide loans to smaller auto suppliers transitioning from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs. The White House supports this initiative, emphasizing that it will offer affordable capital to help small and medium-sized auto manufacturers refinance, grow, and diversify and will benefit over 250,000 workers. Moreover, new U.S. tariffs on Chinese EVs and stricter emissions regulations are pushing automakers to adapt their supply chains. Monroe CEO Ted Koenig highlighted the fund's importance in cultivating growth and innovation among suppliers struggling to secure financing for EV production. Our Methodology For this article, we identified over 30 EV manufacturers using the Finviz stocks screener and narrowed our list to 8 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The stocks are listed in ascending order of their hedge funds which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 elite hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A group of school buses lined up in front of a large building, painted in bright colors. Number of Hedge Funds Holders: 24 One of the best EV stocks, Blue Bird Corporation (NASDAQ:BLBD) is an American manufacturer of school buses, specializing in low and zero-emission models. Its lineup includes traditional school buses, pupil activity buses, and specialized vehicles like security buses, ambulance buses, and blood donation buses. The company is committed to innovation and safety and transports around 25 million children daily. It currently operates over 20,000 low and zero-emission buses, including those powered by propane, natural gas, and electricity. In August, the company celebrated a milestone by delivering its 2,000th electric, zero-emission school bus. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Blue Bird (NASDAQ:BLBD) reported net sales of $333.4 million, representing a 13.3% increase from $294.3 million in the same quarter of the previous year. This growth was driven by changes in product mix, price adjustments due to rising inventory costs, and a slight uptick in unit bookings. Bus sales rose by $37.8 million, supported by a 13.2% increase in the average sales price and a 0.7% rise in booked units, despite ongoing supply chain challenges. Parts sales also saw a $1.3 million increase due to inflation-driven price hikes. Although the total cost of goods sold rose to $264.0 million, it improved as a percentage of net sales from 84.5% to 79.2%. Operating profit reached $39.7 million, significantly up from $19.4 million in the same quarter last year, thanks to a $23.6 million rise in gross profit, despite increasing operating expenses. On October 9, The Fly reported that BTIG initiated its coverage on Blue Bird (NASDAQ:BLBD) with a Buy rating and a price target of $55. The company ranks among the top three manufacturers of school buses and holds a strong position in the alternative fuel school bus market. According to the firm’s analyst, while Blue Bird also sells traditional diesel buses, it focuses on providing value rather than just selling a high volume of these buses. Despite the stock having doubled in value over the past year, BTIG remains optimistic about the company. It anticipates growth in the North American school bus market and expects a continued shift toward alternative fuels, which could help the company gain more market share. Overall BLBD ranks 6th on our list of the best EV stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of BLBD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLBD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The technology combines the high energy density of solid-state batteries with the practicality of traditional lithium-ion batteries, which improves vehicle performance and allows current owners to upgrade their battery packs for improved range.

URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sony-group-corporation-sony-among-014925074.html
Time Published: 2024-10-24T01:49:25Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Esports Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) stands against the other esports stocks. The esports sector is experiencing significant growth and transformation, driven by evolving trends and increased investment. According to The Business Research Company, the global esports market was valued at $1.63 billion in 2023. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4% during 2024-2028 to reach $3.48 billion by ​the end of the forecast period. Technological advancements continue to shape the future of esports. The integration of generative AI in gaming is creating more immersive experiences, while cloud gaming continues to gain traction. As these technologies evolve, they are expected to enhance player engagement and expand the esports audience. Another key trend is the rise of live streaming. This also offers exciting avenues for both content creators and advertisers looking to connect with a dynamic audience. Comscore's 2024 State of Gaming Report revealed that gamers spent 45 billion hours on online video content in 2023. Esports and live streaming are gaining traction, particularly among younger generations. The report shows that about 86% of Gen Z and 80% of Millennials who are aware of esports have watched it. Additionally, 53% of Gen Z and 61% of Millennials have engaged with live streaming. The report also highlights that 79% of viewers prefer watching esports with others. This indicates the social nature of esports. The rise of platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming has made esports more accessible, further fueling interest and participation. Additionally, the Middle East is emerging as a significant market for esports, thanks to initiatives like Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the country’s economy. Major events, such as the Esports World Cup held in Riyadh, have drawn thousands of participants and substantial prize pools, showcasing the region's potential. Here’s a short excerpt from our previous article “7 Best Gaming Stocks To Buy Now” that discusses this in more detail: “In July and August, the first-ever Esports World Cup took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, attracting over 1,500 players and offering a massive prize pool of $60 million. The event spanned eight weeks and included 23 competitions across 22 different video games, such as Call of Duty and Fortnite.” Overall, the esports sector is poised for continued growth. As organizations adapt to new market dynamics and leverage innovative technologies, the future looks promising for investors interested in this vibrant industry. Methodology To compile our list of the 8 best esports stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest gaming and esports companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources. We carefully verified our list to remove any companies that can not be classified as esports stocks. Next, from an initial pool of more than 20 esports stocks, we focused on the top 8 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 912 elite hedge funds.

I love the fact that the delicious bivalves are everywhere now, and that it’s a rare restaurant which doesn’t offer some kind of dressed oyster as a snack. But most places get their oysters from a single source, via a seafood supplier, and the majority offer just one type of oyster at a time. Not so at Sea Shanty in Blackrock, which buys its oysters direct from the farms and, on the night we visit, is offering a choice of oysters from Cromane in Kerry, Killough Bay in Co Down, Woodstown Bay in Co Waterford, Cooley in Co Louth, Connemara in Co Galway and Achill in Co Mayo. The only other place you’ll find Cromane oysters is Allta, and Sea Shanty is the sole Irish stockist of Killough Bay’s, and the only Dublin outlet for the oysters from Woodtown Bay.

As the cryptocurrency market emerges from a prolonged seven-month consolidation phase, following a parabolic uptrend for Bitcoin and various altcoins in the first quarter of 2024, crypto analyst OxNobler has boldly declared that today marks the start of the next significant altseason. In a recent post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), OxNobler shared insights on the Altcoin Indicator, which has just gone parabolic for the first time in three years. The analyst emphasized the cyclical nature of market phases, driven by capital inflows that shift from Bitcoin into larger-cap tokens before eventually reaching lower-cap altcoins, suggesting a growing liquidity movement that could fuel significant price surges across the altcoin landscape. Identifying key catalysts for the upcoming liquidity inflows, OxNobler pointed to several factors: the upcoming US election, where both candidates express support for Bitcoin, anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, the potential lifting of the cryptocurrency ban in China, and the expected payout of $16 billion from FTX in Q4 2024 to Q1 2025. By analyzing historical price movements and market cycles, OxNobler believes traders can position themselves for substantial gains in the months ahead. OxNobler has highlighted several altcoins that he believes are primed for growth in this new market phase.

Title: With 51% institutional ownership, Cochlear Limited (ASX:COH) is a favorite amongst the big guns

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Institutions' substantial holdings in Cochlear implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 45% ownership Insiders have bought recently If you want to know who really controls Cochlear Limited (ASX:COH), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 51% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Cochlear. View our latest analysis for Cochlear Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. Cochlear already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Cochlear's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Cochlear is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.2% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.7% by the third-largest shareholder. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Cochlear Limited. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own AU$74m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. With a 48% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Cochlear. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Cochlear better, we need to consider many other factors. I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

Title: ECB’s Anti-Bitcoin Propaganda Debunked In Scathing Academic Rebuttal
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ecb-anti-bitcoin-propaganda-debunked/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T22:00:04Z
Full Content:
As a response to the latest anti-Bitcoin paper by the European Central Bank (ECB), a new academic paper titled “Challenging Bias in the ECB’s Bitcoin Analysis” has been published. Authored by Murray A. Rudd, along with co-authors Allen Farrington, Freddie New, and Dennis Porter, the paper offers a comprehensive critique of a recent working paper by ECB officials Ulrich Bindseil and Jürgen Schaaf. Dennis Porter, CEO and founder of Satoshi Action Fund, who initiated the paper with a few days announced the publication on X, stating, “₿REAKING: Full Academic Rebuttal to the anti-Bitcoin ECB paper officially published.” The original ECB paper by Bindseil and Schaaf portrays BTC as a speculative asset with limited intrinsic value and significant risks. It criticized BTC’s volatility, lack of productive contribution, and wealth concentration, while advocating for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) as a superior solution for modern financial systems, as Bitcoinist reported. The rebuttal systematically addresses and refutes the key assertions made by Bindseil and Schaaf: Bindseil and Schaaf argue that the industry’s lobbying exerts disproportionate influence, skewing regulatory policy in its favor. The rebuttal counters this by highlighting the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. “not have a CEO, legal or marketing departments, or lobbyists: it is a neutral, global, leaderless protocol. Bitcoin advocates typically operate without the institutional backing enjoyed by the corporations that dominate the crypto industry,” the authors write. They point out that traditional financial institutions spend far more on lobbying than the nascent industry noting that in 2023, crypto-related lobbying expenditures in the US constituted less than 1% of financial sector lobbying expenditures. Addressing the claim that ownership is highly concentrated among a small number of large players, the rebuttal emphasizes that this view overlooks the widespread dispersion of BTC holdings. “Institutional and exchange wallets represent the holdings of diverse investors rather than single entities,” the authors explain. They note that many of the largest wallets belong to exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, as well as ETF issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity, who hold BTC on behalf of millions of users. The authors also challenge the notion that wealth concentration in coins is inherently unfair. “They imply that any form of inequality is unjust, yet fail to explain why this applies—a free market for Bitcoin has been available to all since its inception,” they write. “Unlike the vast majority of cryptocurrency tokens (‘altcoins’), Bitcoin had a fair and public launch. There was no pre-launch distribution of Bitcoin, no ‘founder shares,’ and no venture capital backers purchasing Bitcoin at a discount.” The ECB paper asserts that BTC’s rising price creates positive consumption effects for holders but does not increase overall productivity or economic growth. The rebuttal disputes this by highlighting BTC’s significant role in driving financial innovation and efficiency. “Bitcoin functions as a technological protocol, similar to the TCP/IP protocol that underpins the Internet, enabling the development of new financial services,” they argue. The authors also emphasize the impact in developing regions, particularly in the remittance market. “For countries that derive a large proportion of their GDP from remittances, slashing transaction costs could have dramatic impacts among the poorest households, who are traditionally excluded from banking services,” the paper notes. Bindseil and Schaaf suggest that Bitcoin’s price appreciation results in wealth redistribution, benefiting early adopters at the expense of non-holders and latecomers. The rebuttal counters that this argument disregards the voluntary nature of BTC markets, where participants freely choose to enter based on their own assessment of the asset’s potential. “Like early investors in stocks or venture capital, Bitcoin’s early adopters assumed significant risk in exchange for potentially high returns—an inherent feature of markets for emerging technologies,” they explain. They also highlight the broader implications of inflation, which redistribute wealth from savers to debt holders through inflationary policies. “Bitcoin’s fixed supply and deflationary characteristics counteract this erosion, offering a long-term store of value,” they assert. The ECB paper claims that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value and cannot be priced using traditional asset valuation models. The rebuttal argues that this narrow definition ignores the role that scarcity, decentralization, and utility as a store of value play in asset valuation. “Bitcoin operates similarly to gold, providing an alternative store of value, particularly in periods of monetary instability,” they state. They further assert, “Their argument is fundamentally flawed: they claim BTC cannot be considered money because it cannot be valued as a security, whereas the reality is that it cannot be valued as a security precisely because it is money.” Addressing the assertion that BTC’s price movements are indicative of speculative bubbles, the rebuttal points out that volatility is a characteristic of emerging technologies. “Bitcoin’s price appreciation is driven by its scarcity, adoption, network effects, and recognition of its utility as a hedge against fiat currency debasement,” they explain. The ECB paper contends that Bitcoin has not fulfilled its original promise as a global payment system due to high fees and scalability issues. The rebuttal counters this by highlighting technological advancements like the Lightning Network, which have dramatically improved Bitcoin’s scalability, reducing fees and increasing transaction speed. “By focusing on the early limitations, Bindseil and Schaaf fail to acknowledge the significant progress made in improving its scalability and efficiency,” they argue. They also address the authors’ critique of Nakamoto’s analysis of financial transactions, stating, “Nakamoto’s argument is not about the optionality of mediation in certain types of transactions; rather, it concerns the inherent costs and risks in a system where transactions rely on third-party credit institutions.” The authors also challenge the ECB paper’s framing of CBDCs as superior to BTC. They highlight the risks of centralization inherent in CBDCs, including concerns about privacy, political manipulation, and surveillance. “Bitcoin’s decentralized architecture ensures censorship resistance and financial sovereignty,” they assert, contrasting it with the centralization of CBDCs. The rebuttal raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to the authors’ roles within the ECB. Both Bindseil and Schaaf are deeply involved in developing the digital euro, a CBDC project that directly competes with decentralized digital currencies like BTC. “Their vested interest in advancing CBDCs likely skews their portrayal of Bitcoin as a speculative asset,” Porter et al. conclude. At press time, BTC traded at $66,465. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Michael Saylor reverses remarks on self-custody, calls it ‘a right for all’

Saylor said that the right to self-custody applies to all individuals and institutions, who have the freedom to choose the form of custody. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. MicroStrategy executive chair Michael Saylor backtracked on his recent remarks about self-custody and clarified that he supports it as a fundamental right. Saylor said that the right to self-custody applies to all individuals and institutions who have the freedom to choose the form of custody. He added: “Bitcoin benefits from all forms of investment by all types of entities, and should welcome everyone.” Saylor’s clarification and response come after significant backlash from leading voices in the industry for statements he made during a recent interview. Jameson Lopp, co-founder and Chief Security Officer of CasaHODL, replied that self-custody is not about being paranoid, and argued that Saylor’s stance has long-term “negative ramifications” as it convinces people to fully trust third-party custodians. Citing these negative ramifications, Lopp mentions the increasing systemic risk through centralizing BTC in fewer places and leaving Bitcoin holders out of network governance activities, such as running a node. He added: “Self-custody is not merely important to individual Bitcoin holders. It’s important for the continued strengthening and improvement of the entire network.” Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin joined the choir of voices contrary to Saylor’s statement, calling his comments “insane.” Buterin said that Saylor is arguing in favor of a narrative where trusting regulated public entities, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, might protect crypto from stringent rules and law enforcement. However, the Ethereum co-founder added that there is “plenty of precedent” for how this strategy can fail, and he does not believe that trusting entities is aligned with the crypto ethos. Other notorious Bitcoin proponents, such as Jack Mallers and Adam Back, criticized Saylor’s remarks by highlighting that self-custody is a core part of the financial freedom enabled by Bitcoin.

CareMax, Inc. (CMAX) stock has tumbled to a 52-week low, reaching a price level of just $1.5, as the company faces a tumultuous period marked by investor concerns and broader market headwinds. This latest price point represents a stark contrast to the stock's performance over the past year, with Deerfield Healthcare Tech Acquisitions, the parent of CareMax, witnessing a staggering 1-year change of -97.65%. The dramatic decline underscores the volatility and challenges within the healthcare technology sector, as well as the specific hurdles that CareMax has encountered in its operations and growth strategy. Investors are closely monitoring the company's next moves as it navigates through this low point in its market valuation. In other recent news, CareMax, Inc. has taken significant steps to manage its financial strain. The company has drawn $5 million from a loan to cover short-term operating expenses and secured a $20 million credit facility, which includes a $4 million term loan and an additional $16 million available through delayed draw term loans. Despite challenges impacting its adjusted EBITDA, CareMax met its full-year revenue targets and membership goals. In addition to these measures, CareMax has reached an agreement with its lenders, including Jefferies Finance LLC and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Financial Management, to extend the waiver on certain defaults under its credit agreement until various dates in 2024. This extension provides CareMax with additional time to address these defaults. Furthermore, analysts from Jefferies and UBS have adjusted their price targets for CareMax. Jefferies maintained a Hold rating but lowered the price target to $3.00, while UBS maintained a Neutral rating and revised its price target to $6.40. These are the recent developments in the company's ongoing efforts to manage its financial obligations. The recent plunge in CareMax, Inc. (CMAX) stock to a 52-week low aligns with several critical insights from InvestingPro. The company's financial health appears precarious, with InvestingPro data showing a market capitalization of just $6.29 million USD, reflecting the severe market devaluation mentioned in the article. InvestingPro Tips highlight that CMAX is "quickly burning through cash" and "operates with a significant debt burden," which may explain investors' growing concerns. The tip noting that the "stock generally trades with high price volatility" is evident in the dramatic 1-year change of -97.65% mentioned in the article. Moreover, CMAX's financial struggles are further illustrated by its negative gross profit margin of -3.31% and an alarming return on assets of -97.55% for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. These figures suggest deep-rooted operational challenges that the company must overcome to regain investor confidence. For readers seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips that could provide further insight into CMAX's financial situation and market performance.

In a Wednesday report from the global investment firm, analysts Gautam Chhugani, Mahika Sapra, and Sanskar Chindalia wrote that they believe the biggest digital coin will hit $200,000 by the end of 2025. And that’s being "conservative," they said. “With accelerating institutional adoption, we expect Bitcoin to triple from here to attain a cycle-high price of $200,000 by 2025 end,” the report read. Bitcoin is now trading for just under $65,750, dropping by nearly 3% in a seven-day period. At the weekend, it was priced above $69,000 for the first time in nearly three months. The asset hit an all-time high price of $73,737 in March. Bernstein analysts had previously predicted that Bitcoin could reach $150,000 in 2025 due to the huge demand for newly approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. They continued to argue in Wednesday’s report that demand for these products will push the asset higher. The ETFs—which trade on stock exchanges and allow investors to buy the digital asset through their brokerage accounts—have been hugely successful and allowed institutions such as Morgan Stanley to safely get exposure to Bitcoin. Last week, the funds—managed by Wall Street titans such as BlackRock and Fidelity—topped $20 billion in total inflows to date, despite only being approved in January. The report added that American Bitcoin mining companies and software firm MicroStrategy, which in 2020 added the cryptocurrency and now securitizes Bitcoin, would continue to rally. Such investments are used by investors to get exposure to the crypto world without owning Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is the largest corporate treasury reserve holder of Bitcoin in the world, with over $16 billion worth of BTC.

We recently published a list of 7 Best Delivery Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where DoorDash Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) stands against other best delivery stocks to invest in now. The delivery and courier industry is diverse, encompassing a wide range of services that connect businesses and consumers through various shipping methods. Parcel delivery services are a major component, with companies offering both domestic and international shipping options, driven by the rise of e-commerce. Another significant segment is food delivery platforms. These platforms connect hungry customers with local eateries, creating a new business model that thrives on convenience. Overall, the delivery industry is evolving rapidly, with diverse players working to meet the growing expectations for speed and reliability in shipping services.

In 2023, the Asia-Pacific region led the market in revenue and is projected to maintain its dominance throughout the forecast period.

Experts highlight that the demand for quick deliveries has led to substantial investments in last-mile delivery solutions and advanced technologies, such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI). In 2024, consumers have continued to prioritize free and fast shipping for their online orders, according to recent data from Digital Commerce 360 and Bizrate Insights. A survey of 1,013 online shoppers revealed that 81.34% consider free shipping their top priority when receiving deliveries.

New to the strategy was the online food delivery platform and logistics provider DoorDash Inc. (NASDAQ:DASH) Since its IPO in 2021, the company’s scale has grown to entrench it with customers and consumers, though we have been cautious about its high valuation. Recently, the company reported lower-than-expected guidance for future margins and that caused its shares to sell off. In our view, DoorDash was appropriately investing for future growth and absorbing recent increased wage costs. Believing this short-term price dislocation made for an attractive entry price, we began buying, and DoorDash was up 2% through the end of the quarter.” Overall, DASH ranks 3rd on our list of best delivery stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of delivery companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Building a Bond Ladder Barry Ritholtz: Over the past decade, or maybe even longer, No one’s accurately predicted which way rates were going. Are they going to rise? Are they going to fall? Are they going to stay steady? This creates a challenge for bond investors who are usually looking for a predictable income stream from their fixed-income holdings. One solution? Create a ladder of bonds of different maturity rates so that regardless of what occurs, you have a predictable yield series. You can lock in higher-yielding paper if rates fall, but you also free up more capital on an annual basis if rates rise, I’m Barry Ritholtz. And on today’s edition of at the money, we’re going to show you how to create a bond ladder. To help us unpack all of this and what it means for your fixed income portfolio, let’s bring in Karen Veraa. She is head of iShares US fixed income strategy for investing giant black rock. So let’s start simply by What is a bond ladder? Karen Verra: A bond ladder is a simple tool for investing in the bond market. You take your investing window, let’s say 10 years, and you equally wait every maturity across that 10 year period. So you’ve got bonds that mature in one year, two year, three years, and so on. It’s a very popular strategy because as you just mentioned, Barry, you, you don’t have to make bets on interest rate risk. You kind of have your investing horizon and you’ve got this more predictable stream of income as well as maturity is coming due each year where you can make a decision about. Going in the next rung on the bond ladder or doing something else with that money. Barry Ritholtz: We always seem to divide bond ladders into each rung is the same equity amount. What, what’s the thinking there? Karen Verra: We do see that as being the most popular. It’s because you can think through that. I’m going to have a certain amount of money. Let’s say I’ve got a hundred thousand dollars to invest and it’s a 10 year-ladder. I’ve got 10, 000 coming due each year. You can kind of think of it in chunks like that. We do see some people, who are laddering out amounts and retirement accounts, and they need to take those required minimum distributions where they will look at the IRS schedule of how much they have to pull out of the account. It’s not quite equal, but you can even ladder out those required minimum distributions. Um, you know, it’s about 8 percent instead of 10 percent in the first year, for example. And then you don’t have to sell anything inside your retirement account and you can just pull those out on schedule. So that’s another way that people weight their bond ladders when they’re seeking that goal of having those RMDs coming due every year. Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about what goes into bond ladders. I’m assuming a mix of US Treasury bonds, munis, investment grade corporates, even high yielding. Anything else go into the mix for bond ladders? Karen Verra: I’d say the most popular tends to be munis and corporate bonds and the investment grade side. We offer a suite of exchange traded funds that mature each year and they’re primarily used to build bond ladders. We have these in high yield as well for people who want to go out and add a little bit more income and credit risk to the portfolios. We even have them in the tips market. So these days you can build a bond ladder using all these different asset classes. I think some of the challenges with CDs is typically they’re limited in their term. They may only go out up to five years and sometimes the banks will have restrictions or penalties if you want to sell them early or try to get your money back early. So we’ve seen people migrate away from CD ladders, doing it more with bond and bond ETFs to build these ladders. Barry Ritholtz: How do investors determine what their timeline is? I think that’s a pretty interesting choice and most people just seem to assume it’s 10 years, but from what I’ve seen, there are a variety of timelines. Karen Verra: I think people can think about it if they have a liability that they’re managing to or a time based goal. Uh, we see people sometimes building ladders, let’s say three to seven years because maybe they have a cash portfolio for things the next couple of years, but then they don’t want to start their ladder out for a few years. One to five tends to be the most popular, um, based on data that we have around assets and those different account types. We rarely see people go out past 10 years. I do see people asking for 15 because I think with the bond ladder, you can accomplish most of your goals within that time horizon of having stability, having income, rolling it every year. We also see on the corporate side, corporate issues will issue 10-year bonds and they might do a 30-year bond, but there’s not really that much paper that’s actively being issued beyond 10 years. So what tends to happen is there’s just not that many new issues and it’s hard to find the bonds. So I think that’s another reason why that 10 year point tends to be the maximum for most people’s ladders. Barry Ritholtz: We never know what yields will be in the future. How can an investor lock in the best yields on the duration curve today and benefit over the next decade with their ladders? Karen Verra: Well, we do have an inverted yield curve right now. So we’ve seen a lot of people overweighting their ladders in that one to two year bucket trying to maximize income. Maybe they do might do an extra, you know, 40, 50 percent than what they would usually do. But I think one of the nice things you can do now is. Try to lock in the yields for the interim. We’ve been telling people on the corporate side, you can get about 5 percent by continuing to go out, 6 to 7 percent for high yield. And so we’re seeing people who are doing that right now, knowing that when the fed starts to cut rates, interest rates are going to come down and they want to put some of that cash to work and consistently be getting four, five, six percent, rather than have it dissipate, um, in those short term vehicles as soon as interest rates go down. Barry Ritholtz: I continue to see people who are waiting for inflation to re-accelerate. They’re warning that the Fed is, is looking at this incorrectly and that we should be expecting much higher yields. If that were to happen, didn’t someone who just set up a bond ladder lock in low rates or how does the ladder work in the face of that? Karen Verra: So when I think about the ladder, it’s going to be a more known investment result than some other more perpetual bond strategies. So you kind of know what your yield is going to be over that period. You can do a few things. You could use TIPs. So we have for example, tips, term maturity, ETFs, tips I bonds where you, you can get protected for the inflation. But you also have the periodic income payments kicking off the ladder that you can reinvest at higher yields, which will add income over time. And you also have that discrete point when something matures this year, you can go and grab more income. So what we see is as yields go up, you’re slowly walking that ladder up and, and recouping more of the income over time. Barry Ritholtz: What about the opposite group of prognosticators, the ones who have been forecasting a recession every year for the past three years that just hasn’t shown up? If there’s a recession and rates fall pretty radically, what happens then? What’s our reinvestment risk there? Karen Verra: So if you’ve got your ladder locked in at today’s yields and yields come down, that ladder income stream is worth more. So we’ll actually see the prices on the bonds go up in that situation. But then you’re right. When the money comes to, you’re going to be reinvesting at lower rates. And then over time that will, will get go down a bit. If you are worried about a recession, I would say, go up in quality, stick to treasuries, investment grade, the higher quality, even munis, the higher quality asset classes that you don’t have to worry about as much default risk and volatility if we do have a coming recession. Barry Ritholtz: I know you’re the strategist for iShares, which issues a lot of ETFs. When I first started in the 1990s, bond ladders were all individually owned papers and separately managed accounts. Everything was hand-selected. The minimums were pretty high. The cost structure was pretty high. The state of the art stayed that way for decades. It seems to have gotten a whole lot better, cheaper, faster, easier today. Tell us, what is the state of the art building a bond ladder using ETFs? Karen Verra: I think this is one of the innovations that has really come about in the last decade. No longer do you have to have a million dollars to create a bespoke bond ladder with an SMA manager. You can do it today for very little amounts of money. And so what we’ve seen is our I bonds have been popular inside smaller account sizes. If you’ve got, you know, a one-off account over here, or even if you have a lot of money, it’s just a very efficient way to do that. So our I bonds ETFs are term maturity ETFs. They have a maturity date, typically each December and they’re holding bonds that mature throughout the calendar year. And then when the last bond matures, The ETF will delist from the exchange and you’ll have cash hitting your account, just like a bond maturity. And we’ve got them now in treasuries, tips, munis investment grade and high yield. So five different sectors of the bond market. And then we’ve seen people really customize things for their income needs for their tax status. And they’re, they’re getting exposed to hundreds of bonds in a single ETF, as opposed to what we see with a lot of SMAs – is they might be limited to maybe 20 to 30 bonds at the most. So you’re getting diversification at a very low cost. And because they are exchange traded, if you change your mind and want to sell them, you can at any point where a lot of times with a bond, it’s really easy to buy it, but then maybe when you go to sell it, it’s hard to find a buyer or there’s large transaction costs associated with that. Barry Ritholtz: So I’m hearing diversification, lower costs, liquidity, you mentioned they all, the ETF will mature at the end of the year, so you have a defined maturity, obviously no callable bonds go into that. But it seems working with an ETF gives you – I’m doing a little bit of a commercial here, but my firm uses a lot of ETFs, we’re very happy with them, you get a lot of flexibility and professional management – this really seems to be much better than the bad old days when someone was handpicking dozens of individual bonds. Karen Verra: We still see people who are preferring that, let’s say you have special, you’re in a high-tech state and you want a special SMA dedicated to that. So we see people even using our iBonds alongside SMAs or alongside other strategies. Or maybe they’re whittling those down. Like we don’t tell people go out and sell your bond portfolio. You’re curated over decades. However, this is a great strategy, I think, to provide some liquidity, diversification, and low cost access to these different parts of the bond market. Barry Ritholtz: One of the advantages of working with various large firms like yourself, iShares, Fidelity, Schwab, whoever. You have a variety of online tools to build your own bond ladder. Tell us a little bit about what people can find if they want to just do it themselves. Karen Verra: If you go to iShares.com backslash iBonds, you’ll find our landing page and there’s a link to our iBonds ladder tool. And we designed this to be just like a report that you would get if you went to a bond manager and asked for a bond ladder, you can input your dollar amount, you can check the box on which sectors of the bond market you want to be invested in, and there’s even a slider where you can look at your maturities. And right away, it will give you an equal-weighted ladder. You can then customize that ladder. If you’d like, you can delete things you don’t want, and it will have some summary characteristics, the number of bonds, the duration, the yield, the cost, and I think it’s a, it’s a great way to just visualize those yields. Like we have people who will come in and they want to know what different Maturities of the bond market are yielding. They can go in and look in, see where the treasury curve is, the investment grade curve, the high yield curve. And I think it’s just a great source of information to even go in and see what the different parts of the market are yielding. Barry Ritholtz: So to sum up, investors that are looking for yield but are concerned about interest rates going up, down, and all over the place can solve for that problem by creating a ladder of bond ETFs, spreading it out over five to 10 years. So their interest rate risk is reduced. They’re locking in rates now and if rates go higher as things mature, they can reinvest it. And if rates go down, hey, well, at least you locked in a higher rate for the first half of that, um, of those investments. It seems to make a lot of sense and especially if you’re working towards a specific liability or a specific goal, uh, where you have an obligation down the road, this allows you with very little risk to hit those targets. Karen Verra: That’s right. We, we’re seeing. all kinds of investors using them for, for different goals and objectives, different, different terms. And I think it really empowers people to do it themselves and invest in the bond market. Barry Ritholtz: Thank you, Karen. This has been really interesting. I’m Barry Ritholtz.

Title: Is The Future Of BCI Right Under Our Nose?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/naveenrao/2024/10/23/is-the-future-of-bci-right-under-our-nose/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Neurotech startup Augmental has raised a $4m seed round to commercialize their wearable interface for people living with motor impairment and limited hand function. The “MouthPad” offers an unprecedented and convenient alternative to a brain-computer interface, or BCI, that circumvents the need for brain surgery by enabling users to control a mouse cursor using their tongue, breaths, head gestures, and soon, voice. Augmental's MouthPad, a new kind of interface that enables hands-free control of digital devices. It’s the brainchild of two engineers, Tomás Vega and Corten Singer, who met as undergraduates at Berkeley and reunited in Cambridge to found the company at the tail end of Vega’s graduate work at MIT in 2019. Over the pandemic, they formed Augmental and relocated to San Francisco, where they recently upgraded their garage-based R&D hub for a new office space that includes a clean room for commercial-grade manufacturing and distribution. The novel form factor belies Augmental’s importance to the future of neurotech markets. Their progress over the coming years represents a crystal ball for the success or failure of companies like Neuralink, Synchron, and many others in the crowded field of implantable BCI. To understand why, let’s look at product functionality, the state of the market, and the growing, global commercial ecosystem in BCI. Augmental operates under a banner known as “Assistive Technologies.” AT includes tools to help with typing, speech, smart home functionality, as well as wheelchairs, semi autonomous robots, prosthetic or robotic limbs and some stimulation devices. Estimates vary but analysts have pegged this at a $20 billion annual market opportunity that is growing quickly as our technophile society ages. New Mobility recently published a close-up on several AT tools, and included both the MouthPad and its early impact on end user Keely Horch, a 19 year old living with quadriplegia. From the article: “The MouthPad embeds a tiny touchpad in a dental-safe resin retainer, Bluetooth-enabled, for the tongue to manipulate like a finger would. At first it was a challenge grasping the relationship between tongue, touchpad and screen, but now Horch forgets the device is even in her mouth and uses it for five hours a day, controlling her cell phone and more easily editing the papers she dictates with voice recognition, which works alongside the MouthPad without a hitch. Settings are customizable, and she right-clicks by drawing air through her lips: It’s sip-and-puff without the straw.” Each MouthPad is custom-printed based on dental scans from a national network of over 90 partnered centers across the US. Augmental’s operation is becoming scalable now, after three years of working closely with nearly 100 people living with various disabilities such as spinal cord injury and neuromuscular disorders to design and develop a product that works intuitively. Investors backing the vision include SCI Ventures, Murata, Revere Partners, LivEdge Capital, Fen, Carao and Tesserakt, as well as individuals from Andreseen Horowitz’s Scout Fund and a group of Angel Investors that include notable consumer electronics experts such as Eric Migicovsky and Nirav Patel, as well as Neuralink’s Head of Next Gen, Joey O’Doherty. Horch, an engineering sophomore in college, uses the MouthPad to play games with her brothers and participate in class, stating, “I was able to unmute myself and raise my hand and type questions up…I was able to use different software, like graphing, and it was really helpful for visualizing things.” Analysts are confident that BCI will be a $400 billion market in 20 years, but they can’t measure how much digital autonomy is worth today for people who can’t move their hands. Augmental’s users who can move their head and neck can use head-tracking for cursor control, and perform clicks and other gestures with tongue movements. Those with more limited mobility can use tongue gestures alone for cursor control, clicks, swipes, etc. How does the Mouthpad compare to implanted BCI? With a pricepoint in the low four figures (currently $1,500 through the company’s early-access program) it is a magnitude of order more affordable than the estimated range of $30,000 to $60,000 for implanted BCI. Moreover, by circumventing surgery of any sort, users avoid possible complications, from infections to difficulties upgrading the device. Critically, the functionality is comparable. Vega shared that their “Bits Per Second” test, which is one technical measure of controlling a mouse cursor with BCI, clocks in at 7.85 BPS for their top-performing quadriplegic user. Compare this to 9.51, which was Neuralink user Noland Arbaugh’s top score at the time of this writing. Most importantly, the device is available for use today. 2024 represents a breakout year for Augmental. In addition to their seed round and new office, they have crossed $100k in direct sales, published user testimonials and brought on world-class engineers and experts to expand the range of actions available to MouthPad users, including building a voice-based UI for whisper speech, and eventually fully silent speech. Moving forward, the question is not whether the MouthPad is capable of helping people. It’s how Augmental can scale growth until qualifying their device for insurance reimbursement, which would expand access to hundreds or thousands of people seeking greater digital autonomy. The complexity of delivering affordable innovations into “the disability market” cannot be understated. As Augmental navigates the broken roads experienced by people living with serious motor impairment, they’ve entered the cottage industry of AT. Finding Reimbursement for novel devices involves a whack-a-mole quest through departments of rehabilitation, vocational programs, state Medicaid offices, county level disability support offices, and the like. Despite the challenges, the number of Mouthpad users has grown to 50, with as many devices in production. MouthPad users live across 28 states, and the waitlist for the device has surpassed 3,000 people. In the background, the company is pursuing a submission to the FDA for virtual control of electronic wheelchairs, which would qualify them for CMS reimbursement down the road. Meanwhile they are helping candidates access grant funding to pay for MouthPads and have forged alliances with nonprofits to promote and sponsor device purchase. Augmental is planning an in-house team to develop and cultivate relationships with these key institutions to broaden onramps to access by meeting patients in existing communities nationwide. One such nonprofit is BCI Pioneer Ian Burkhart’s foundation, which has sponsored a handful of MouthPads for users in Ohio. In April, Burkhart, who was implanted with a research version of Blackrock’s interface in a clinical trial that ran from 2014 to 2021, shared his experience of navigating health coverage and income caps for disability programs with The Atlantic: “The salary (an end-user would) have to make to cover both expenses and in-home care out of pocket, though, is much more than most jobs pay. A lot of people don’t have the opportunity to make such a giant leap. The system is set up to force you to live in poverty.” An affordable, risk-free BCI could change the conversation around value and productivity. What if enabling success in the classroom or the workplace is comparable to the cost of a new phone, rather than a new car? For now, philanthropy represents a stop-gap to drive access. It makes sense then, that SCI Ventures, born from the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation and operating as a strategic venture philanthropy, led Augmental’s seed round. In a conversation with me this summer, SCI Venture’s Managing Partner Adrien Cohen described Augmental’s approach as “extremely elegant,” adding “I’ve seen the impact it’s had on users' autonomy and independence. In a few minutes, you’re controlling your laptop, using your phone without assistance, without a caretaker. It’s a mindblowing innovation that needs to exist in the world.” The challenging opportunities facing Vega, Singer, and their team of ten engineers and designers could reveal several promising paths for Augmental in the coming months: What’s in it for the BCI companies? It comes down to competitive strategy. In a recent article, Burkhart, Jen French, and colleagues discuss the opportunities and gaps in building Assistive Technology. These include co-development of products and standards designed with end-users in mind. Beyond calling for tech companies to do the right thing by engaging people with lived experiences (including those who might not be eligible for implantation), they call for closer consideration of how inclusive design could attract cause-driven funders and improve adoption of frontier technologies, while facilitating scale-up through crowdsourcing. There are many BCI companies emerging, but few functional wearable control interfaces out there, ready to use and scale today. So, where can commercial leaders and investors find a revenue-generating, low-risk market opportunity to help people living with disability today, while generating unique insights on user preferences, habits, requirements, limitations, and ideas that could differentiate BCI roadmaps and strategy?

Title: Bitcoin Going to $200K by 2025 Is a ‘Conservative’ Estimate, Says Global Asset Manager Bernstein

Analysts at Bernstein, a leading research and brokerage firm that is a subsidiary of global investment firm AllianceBernstein (AB), have reportedly described their Bitcoin price prediction of $200,000 by the end of 2025 as “conservative.” They urged those skeptical about cryptocurrency to reconsider its potential, particularly given the rising U.S. debt levels. According to a report by James Hunt for The Block, Gautam Chhugani, who leads Bernstein’s digital assets division, sent a note to clients on Wednesday stating, “Bitcoin is on track to reach $200,000 by the end of this cycle, projected for 2025. We consider this a conservative estimate.” The forecast follows the recent release of Bernstein’s “Bitcoin Blackbook,” which is aimed at guiding institutional investors interested in the cryptocurrency. Legendary Research Broker Bernstein Has Just Published One of its Famed "Black Books" on #Bitcoin!160 Pages Explaining Why BTC Will Hit $200k by the end of 2025 and How Listed #Bitcoin Miners Will Continue to Consolidate the Industry. @gautamchhugani 👏 pic.twitter.com/lDnAvWeYIe Chhugani pointed out that, in a world where the U.S. national debt now stands at $35 trillion and inflationary risks persist, Bitcoin’s scarcity as a digital asset offers strong appeal as a “store of value.” He added that those who view gold as a solid investment should find Bitcoin an even more compelling option. For investors looking for indirect exposure to Bitcoin, Chhugani suggested considering companies like MicroStrategy, which holds the largest amount of Bitcoin on its corporate balance sheet, and Robinhood, which is growing its crypto offerings. Chhugani also pointed to the potential of U.S.-based firms such as Riot Platforms and CleanSpark, which are amassing significant energy capacity for Bitcoin mining. He noted that Core Scientific is leveraging its resources for both AI hosting services and Bitcoin mining, tapping into the growing demand for AI infrastructure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $66,349, down 0.7% in the past 24-hour period. The BTC price is down 9.5% from its all-time high of around 10% from an all-time high of roughly $73,737 set on 14 March 2024, but up 58.31% in the year-to-date period. On October 16, Real Vision’s Chief Crypto Analyst Jamie Coutts presented a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, citing the increasing backing from institutional investors. Coutts highlighted a notable change in asset allocation preferences, driven by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s public support for Bitcoin. He pointed out that BlackRock’s Aladdin platform, widely used by sovereign wealth funds and major asset managers for portfolio modeling, now integrates Bitcoin seamlessly via its ETF. This, Coutts argued, has cleared the way for Bitcoin’s price to rise significantly. He predicted that even a small reallocation of institutional investments from traditional assets like sovereign bonds to Bitcoin could see BTC surpass $500,000 by the end of the decade. With #crypto bro Fink endorsing #Bitcoin's portfolio-enhancing qualities, a seismic shift in asset allocation preferences is underway. @BlackRock's Aladdin platform, utilized by the largest sovereigns and money managers, provides the tools for modelling and attribution while… https://t.co/gxaxwBRdTP pic.twitter.com/FeNKnggUuf Featured Image via Pixabay The views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

Title: Caelan Doris confirmed as captain as Ireland’s squad for Autumn Series is named
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2024/10/23/caelan-doris-confirmed-as-captain-as-irelands-squad-for-autumn-series-is-named/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T13:22:44Z
Full Content:
And so it has come to pass. If historians ever come to revisit Andy Farrell’s squad announcement for the 2024 Autumn Nations Series its most notable aspect will probably be the passing of the baton as captain to Caelan Doris. He was only conferred as Leinster captain last month but he already looked like a prospective Lions king. Allowing for the Peter O’Mahony interregnum for last season’s Six Nations, and a deserving promotion it was too for someone who captained Munster for a decade, Ireland rugby teams have tended to have a go-to leader for the duration of World Cup cycles. Brian O’Driscoll was the captain for the 2007 and 2011 cycles, to be followed by Paul O’Connell (2012-15), Rory Best (2016-19) and Johnny Sexton (2020-23). Now we are entering the Doris era, and at 26 who is to say for how long. But certainly up until the 2027 World Cup in the USA and potentially beyond looks probable. One always had the impression that Farrell identified Doris as captain for this cycle quicker than the player himself did, and that being the modest type he is, Doris didn’t particularly aspire to the role. Farrell’s thinking was evident from the second round of last season’s Six Nations, when he named Doris captain ahead of James Ryan in the absence of O’Mahony. His thinking is entirely understandable, for whether or not Doris becomes a great orator in time, he leads by deed and, if fit and well, is a world-class player and is one of the first names on the team sheet. Perhaps the first. Doris also has an aura or presence about him, and just because his anointment was inevitable doesn’t make it any less of a landmark. Especially so in a largely predictable reprise of the 35-man squad initially named for last summer’s two-Test tour to South Africa save for five changes, all injury related. Where Dan Sheehan was one of the three hookers then, only to be replaced by Dave Heffernan, after his ACL injury in the first Test, now the Connacht man is named alongside Rónan Kelleher and Rob Herring. Despite both being sidelined, the expectation clearly is that Herring, and at a push Kelleher, will be fit for the opening game against the All Blacks. With Oli Jager injured, the other five props are retained, while the fit-again Iain Henderson is added to the other locks. Having been ruled out of the South African tour, Jamison Gibson-Park returns at the expense of Nathan Doak. The other two changes see the return of the Mack, in the guise the fit-again Hansen, and Hugo Keenan, after his secondment to the Ireland Olympic Sevens squad. The injured Jordan Larmour and Jimmy O’Brien miss out, as does the unlucky Jack Conan. Hence Cian Prendergast and the uncapped Cormac Izuchukwu are retained, as is the former’s brother Sam, who is the only other uncapped player. Farrell has an eye for prospective Test match players, witness the unhesitating promotion of Gibson-Park to the matchday 23 even when he was ostensibly number two at Leinster, and likewise Joe McCarthy, Hansen and Jamie Osborne, not least as a fullback. Although Farrell’s thinking at outhalf appears to have influenced Leinster this season, he doesn’t tell the provinces what to do, he shows them. Perhaps in part because of the increasing logjam at Leinster given Frawley’s conversion to 10 and the emergence of Sam Prendergast in addition to Ross and Harry Byrne, it almost seemed as if this season’s Emerging Ireland tour was devised more for the younger Prendergast sibling than any other player. He started all three games, was given his head in organising the team’s attacking play and received effusive praise from the stand-in head coach Simon Easterby, who will deputise for Farrell again in the Six Nations when Ireland seek a historic three titles in a row. Given Izuchukwu was also on both the senior tour and Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa, it seems reasonable to deduce that Farrell and Easterby also admire the athletic Ulster backrower, whose emergence may have happened sooner but for injuries. It therefore also seems reasonable to speculate that both Izuchukwu and Prendergast are being earmarked for Test debuts in this window, with the third game against Fiji looking like an ideal opportunity to do so. The absence of the unlucky Jack Conan again, after he suffered a hamstring injury in Leinster’s win over Munster and the likely absence of O’Mahony, until halfway through the window, reduces Farrell’s options in the backrow. For the opening game against the All Blacks, the likelier ploy is move Tadhg Beirne to blindside in accommodating Ryan and McCarthy in the secondrow, as in the second Test win over the Springboks, or picking two from those three at lock and start Ryan Baird in the backrow. Ciarán Frawley is putting pressure on Jack Crowley, but despite his mixed start to the season with Munster he is likely to be retained alongside the returning Gibson-Park. Bundee Aki’s extra sharpness and fitness could see him start against the All Blacks alongside Garry Ringrose, while the back three looks more competitive with the return of Hansen, Keenan, and not to mention the sight of Jacob Stockdale back to his attacking best. While he has earned some game time in this window, his problem is that James Lowe has become such an integral part of the team with his hefty left boot, physicality, offloading and finishing. Then there’s Osborne, outstanding at fullback in both Tests in South Africa and excellent for Leinster at inside centre this season, form and versatility which will be hard to resist in the matchday squad against the All Blacks. As well as an eye for prospective internationals, Farrell places great store by loyalty, with O’Mahony named despite being restricted to just 23 minutes of Munster’s URC round three fixture. There are also places for the other two current centurions, scrumhalf Conor Murray and Cian Healy as one of five props. Healy can, of course, also cover hooker in an emergency, an invaluable commodity in the modern era. Currently on 131 caps, Healy is thus in line to equal and perhaps surpass O’Driscoll’s all-time Irish record of 133 caps.

October 23, 2024 By Neenah Payne Downfall of The Legacy Media shows that the legacy media is rapidly declining because it lost the trust of many Americans. It failed to report accurately on so many issues including the Biden laptop, January 6, the open southern border, COVID, and the injuries and deaths caused by the COVID shots. That failure woke up a lot of folks who now rely on the Alt Media for reliable information. COVID-19 also woke up a lot of people including the following: 1 – Dr. Robert Malone was the inventor of the mRNA and DNA vaccine core platform technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID shots. Dr. Malone recommended against the use of the mRNA technology because it could not be used safely. So, when the mRNA Covid shots were released, he assumed the safety issue had been resolved. He got the shot which caused him many severe problems.However, Dr. Malone is now the President of the Global COVID Summit of 17,000 doctors and has gone around the world since 2020 frequently speaking in opposition to the COVID shots and globalization. He is the author of the 2022 book Lies My Gov’t Told Me: And the Better Future Coming. Dr. Malone is the Medical Director of The Unity Project, a group of 300 organizations across the US standing against mandated COVID vaccines for children.MRNA Inventor Says To Stop COVID “Vaccines” Now shows that when Dr. Malone was interviewed on 6/24/22 by Del Bigtree, host of The Highwire in mRNA PIONEER RAISES COVID VACCINE CONCERNS, Dr. Malone called for an immediate halt to the COVID shots. mRNA VACCINE INVENTOR CALLS FOR STOP OF COVID VAX says, “Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of the mRNA vaccine, sits down with Del to give his honest concerns about why this is the wrong technology to use against #Covid19 and, in particular, the extreme danger it poses to young people.” The Physicians Declaration Calls COVID Policies “Crimes Against Humanity” shows that Dr. Malone read the petition against the COVID shots signed by more than 5,200 doctors. On a trip to Europe, Dr. Malone met Dr. Mattias Desmet, a psychologist, a statistician, and a professor of clinical psychology at Ghent University in Belgium who is the author of the 2022 book The Psychology of Totalitarianism. In Mattias Desmet about Mass Formation and modern society, Tucker Carlson explained that during his interview on the Joe Rogan show #1757 on 12/30/21, Dr. Malone introduced Prof. Desmet’s theory of “Mass Formation” (psychosis) to explain mass compliance with the absurd COVID policies. Desmet says loneliness is the root cause of group think because compliance gives people a sense of belonging. Why Joe Rogan’s Interviews on Mass Psychosis “Broke The Internet” explains that on The Highwire show EPISODE 249: BREAKING MASS PSYCHOSIS on 1/7/22, Bigtree explained that Dr. Peter McCullough on December 18 and Dr. Malone on January 3 discussed the concept of “mass psychosis” on the Joe Rogan show. That sent an overwhelming number of viewers to the internet searching for more information to understand how COVID has been used to drive Americans crazy with fear. Del explained that in WHAT IS MASS FORMATION PSYCHOSIS? IS THE PUBLIC BEING GASLIT? . Kim Iversen showed on January 5 that the term “mass formation psychosis” trended on so many searches over the weekend that it “broke the internet”! When Google censored the information, she went to DuckDuckGo and found that the term came from Joe Rogan’s December 31 interview with Dr. Malone. COVID Mass Psychosis: Causes and Solutions discusses the situation further. Joe Rogan Video Banned from YouTube explains that YouTube censored the episode and it is no longer available! Why Doesn’t Google Want You to Know About ‘Mass Formation Psychosis’? Dr. Malone met former Blackrock Portfolio Manager Edward Dowd in Maui and introduced him to the world. Dowd is the author of Cause Unknown: The Epidemic of Sudden Deaths in 2021 and 2022 and 2023 and has since been widely interviewed. Ed Dowd: COVID Shots Are Causing Youth Democide explains that Dowd discussed shocking excess mortality. “The millennial age group 25 to 44 experienced an 84% increase in excess mortality into the fall. It’s the worst ever excess mortality, I think, in history”. 2 – Dr. Brett Weinstein initially wore masks during COVID. However, Game-Changing Tucker Carlson Interview! shows that when he spoke with Carlson in February 2024, he had become part of the “Dream Team” fighting “Goliath”! In Joe Rogan Experience #2198 Bret Weinstein on 9/4/24, Dr. Weinstein discussed Rescue The Republic – Join The Resistance which he had helped organize to save the West. It was held on The Mall in Washington, DC on September 29. 3 – Dr. Naomi Wolf: Shocking New Book: The Pfizer Papers discusses the 2024 book The Pfizer Papers: Pfizer’s Crimes Against Humanity by New York Times best-selling author Dr. Naomi Wolf. In The Crime of “Talking to Tucker Carlson”, Dr. Wolf explains how COVID woke her up and how that alienated her from much of her family and friends on the Left. 4 – World-renowned British cardiologist Dr. Aseem Malholtra recommended the COVID shot for his father and took it himself. However, when his very healthy father suddenly died at age 73, Dr. Malholtra came to the conclusion that it was because of the COVID shot. Documentary: First Do No Pharm! links to the new film by Dr. Malholtra. The documentary examines the vast amount of fraud in medical research designed to benefit big pharma at the expense of humanity. The following former Democrats have awakened and have left the Democratic Party. 1 – Mikki Willis is the filmmaker who released Plandemic 1 in 2020 which has been seen by over 1 billion people worldwide although social medial blocked it. Willis followed that with Plandemic 2: InDoctor Nation and Plandemic 3: The Great Awakening. See the Plandemic series. Willis is the author of the 2021 book Plandemic: Fear Is the Virus. Truth Is the Cure. Wills was an avid supporter of Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders until he realized Sanders is not a socialist, but a communist. 2 – Del Bigtree, was an Emmy award-winning member of The Doctors TV show for five years who produced 30 episodes He quit to produce the film Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe which went viral in 2016. Bigtree is now the host of The Highwire which airs online Thursdays from 2-4 ET with an audience of 30 million in six nations. Bigtree says his parents were hippies who still support the Democratic Party. However, he says he now feels politically marooned because the Democratic Party of today no longer supports the values it held when he was growing up.Now is the MOST Important Moment In Human History w/ Del Bigtree 3 – Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his candidacy for the US presidency in 2023, running as a “Kennedy Democrat” to align with the values of the Democratic party of his uncle President John Kennedy in 1963 and father Robert F. Kennedy who served as Attorney General and ran for the presidency in 1968. In 2024, RFK Jr. joined Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) campaign with a pledge to Make America Healthy Again (MAHA). Trump Adopts RFK Jr.’s War on Junk Food to Win Over His Fans. See Kennedy’s Plan To Restore America’s Health. 4 – Tulsi Gabbard: Are Democrats Waging War on America Now? explains that Tulsi Gabbard represented Hawaii in Congress from 2019-2021 and ran for the presidency in 2019 as a Democrat. Tulsi’s 2024 book: For Love of Country: Leave the Democrat Party Behind explains why she left the party in 2022 to become an independent. Yesterday, Gabbard announced that she is joining the Republican Party! Politico: Gabbard says what everyone knows National Review: Tulsi Gabbard Joins Republican Party, ‘The Party of Common Sense’ Time: A Brief History of Tulsi Gabbard’s Evolution—From Democratic ‘Star’ to MAGA Republican My Big Announcement at Donald Trump’s NC Rally 10/22/24 For independent-thinkers like myself, there is no home in the Democrat Party. However, there is a home for us in the Republican Party. The Republican Party of warmongering elite Dick Cheney is in the past. Trump’s GOP is a big open tent party of the people, equality, commonsense, and the party that is led by a President who has the courage and strength to fight for peace. Tonight I stood with President Trump and announced I am joining the Republican Party. President Trump is our best and only hope in this election to lead our country toward a future where every one of us can live in a truly free, peaceful, and prosperous nation. Now is the time for us to stand together, vote for Trump and save our country. Neenah Payne writes for Activist Post Top image: Katie Horton/YouTube Become a Patron!

Title: Could AI Help Employers Make Strides In Workplace Gender Equality?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/10/23/could-ai-help-employers-make-strides-in-workplace-gender-equality/
Time Published: 2024-10-23T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
Punnam Raju Manthena, Co-Founder & CEO at Tekskills Inc. Partnering with clients across the globe in their digital transformation journeys. The gender gap in the workplace remains a key business and economic issue. Back in 2015, a McKinsey report found that reducing the gender gap could add about $12 trillion to $28 trillion to the global GDP by 2025. In 2024, the chief economist for the World Bank stated that closing the gender gap "could raise global gross domestic product by more than 20%." For years, business leaders have been called on to deal with gender equality as an economic need and fundamental right, but progress is still stalled. According to findings from BlackRock, companies "with the most diverse workforces outperformed their country and industry group peers with the least-diverse workforces in terms of return on assets." Businesses with about 30% women in senior positions are 15% more profitable, as per the Victorian Government. This same report found that Australia's GDP would go up by 11% if the gender gap closed. All these point to a serious need for gender equality. So, not only is gender equality beneficial to business and society but equally importantly, gender inequality is detrimental to both. But, as an employer, how do you move toward gender equality? Can AI, the supposed game changer in the IT industry, help gender equality? The advent of AI could potentially open employment doors for women in a big way. AI, or AI-driven automation, is creating several jobs or roles that we did not think of earlier. Aside from technical skills, AI-related roles call for focused nature, communication, collaboration, adaptability, ability to learn, critical thinking, problem-solving, functional knowledge, etc. AI is data-driven and, hence, has the potential to be unbiased—but only if properly trained. Leveraging AI, employers could help develop more inclusive practices in hiring, appraising, awarding hikes, promoting and dealing with career breaks. This could help negate gender-induced interferences and discrimination. Employers could use AI to help rewrite pay-related policies or identify employees who may otherwise get passed over for promotions or those who may leave. Using AI, employers could gather data from multiple sources, viz. incidents, surveys, etc., to identify harassment possibilities, and provide for anonymous reporting, enabling more employees to report without fearing retaliation. This could help businesses build a safe online working environment with a focus on reducing workplace harassment. In doing so, organizations can create a supportive environment and prioritize mitigating the risks associated with workplace misconduct. That said, human intervention is crucial due to the risks associated with AI. However, gender bias in AI is still a very real issue and risk. Women make up only about 33% of the tech employees and only 8% of the managerial roles as per PWC, so have the representation needed to address these biases. A study by the Berkeley Haas Center for Equity, Gender, and Leadership analyzed 133 AI systems in multiple domains and saw that about 44% of them showed gender prejudice. There could be inherent and unintentional gender biases in systems, and since AI works with the available data, these already-existent prejudices may come into play. These prejudices, social barriers, notions, etc., are all hard to break and are difficult to get beyond. Therefore, AI ethics is paramount in this discussion. The tech industry needs to get more women in AI to counter this issue consciously. According to UN Women, "The AI field needs more women, and that requires enabling and increasing girls’ and women’s access to and leadership in STEM and ICT education and careers." To overcome these barriers, tech leaders need to eliminate these biases. We need to ensure women engineers, developers and coders are involved in the creation and training of AI systems. We need to ensure we're genuinely creating a level playing field in hiring, learning, upskilling, appraising and advancing opportunities. To turn things around and achieve greater gender equality at work, we need to prioritize inclusivity when developing these systems, and having many perspectives involved in developing and training AI models can help negate gender-oriented biases. Business leaders need to carefully monitor and advise when implementing AI in HR functions. Human oversight is key to the ethical use of the technology. Employers should ensure their HR teams develop clear and transparent goals, a mature data strategy, proper deployment (of proven tools, technologies and sources), awareness creation, and regular evaluation and course correction where necessary, etc. These guidelines should then be shared with employees at all levels to ensure the company is on the same page. Employers have the potential to create a level playing field in hiring, upskilling, appraising, etc.—to help achieve greater gender equality at work. AI could be a potential asset in a larger gender equality strategy. Those creating AI systems for employers need to develop and train these AI models to negate gender-oriented perspectives; it falls on employers to reframe policies, build a safe online environment and create a supportive environment.
