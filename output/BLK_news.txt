We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Wall Street Is Focusing on These 10 AI Stocks as New Year Begins. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that a slowdown in spending could be a “big problem” for major AI players in 2025. The analyst highlighted that when Satya Nadella was asked whether his company was facing a chip shortage, the head of the Redmond software giant said his company was facing a power shortage, not a chip shortage. Niles said this goes against the claims of Jensen Huang who has been pointing to unprecedented demand for AI chips. “If you look at the Magnificent 7 (except one) …. they are trading at a low 30 PE. The S&P 500 is trading at a 25 PE, but if you look at the midcap and small-cap stocks, which people have forgotten about because they’re not really AI plays, they’re trading at around 19 to 20 times. They’ve underperformed up until sort of mid-year when the performance picked up. If you look at stocks since June 30th, basically, the S&P is up about 8%, but the NASDAQ 100 is only up 7%. The Russell 2000 is actually up 10% after being only up 1% for the first six months of the year. So you’re already starting to see this broadening out, and I think with the new administration really focused on domestic manufacturing, deregulation, etc., that’s going to benefit the small midcap names more so than names in the S&P 500,” Niles said. Niles said stocks can face a “rough” time in the first quarter amid the changing posture of the Fed. “The Fed finally admitted inflation wasn’t transitory. I think that might have been the wakeup call, which is why I think Q1 could be a really rough time for a lot of the, you know, the market as a whole, but a lot of the mega cap stocks as well. As we have to kind of price in the fact that the FED might, you know, they might pause or they might even raise next year, which I think that’s a 50/50 shot of whether they cut, raise, or hold.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks analysts are talking about heading into 2025. With each company we have mentioned its number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Copyright: welcomia / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43 James E. Demmert from Main Street Research recently said during a program on Schwab Network that Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) surpassed Nvidia in terms of stock performance and it will do the same when it comes to growth in 2025. “I would say Nvidia for just the massive amount of demand that’s been there for their products. But you know, on a stock performance basis as we know Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) just, you know, got up and just took over and really like a turbocharger passed them in stock performance. And I think that says a lot about that, Nvidia’s growth, you know, a lot of it from the hyperscalers is maybe behind it and Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) growth may be ahead of it in 25.” What makes Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) one of the top AI stocks? Its technologies are actually solving the problems of businesses. Palantir’s data technology Ontology is solving the famous hallucination problem for AI systems, thanks to the company’s years of experience with military and defense systems. Earlier this year at an event with customers, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) shared some specifics on how its customers are being able to reduce costs and increase profits due to its artificial intelligence platform (AIP) that was launched about a year ago. Airbus accelerated A350 production by 33%, BP reduced costs per barrel by 60%, and Jacobs Connect cut power usage by 30%. Panasonic decreased waste by 12%, ESI Group sped up ERP harmonization by 70%, and PG&E reduced transformer ignitions by 65%. Eaton boosted productivity by 25%, while Tyson Foods achieved $200 million in cost savings. However, the company’s revenue growth is expected to slow over the next two years, with estimates suggesting a 22% YoY growth rate, potentially bringing revenues to around $4 billion by fiscal 2026. If Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) can improve margins by 100 basis points annually, it would be able to generate about $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income by FY26, with a present value of $1.3 billion when discounted at 8%. Applying an S&P 500-like growth multiple of 2.5 to 2.75 times earnings, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) would have a P/E of 46, translating to a price target of $27, significantly down from its current price of $42. Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Untimely ownership of Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) (+47%) also hurt the fund’s relative result. This software and services firm, which operates in both government and commercial segments, saw strong growth during the quarter, largely driven by its “AIP” – or Artificial Intelligence Platform – offering. In early August, the company reported Q2 financial results that mostly met somewhat lofty expectations. We established a sizable holding in Palantir Technologies during the quarter, and at quarter end it was the second-largest position and a slight overweight.” Overall, PLTR ranks 10th on our list of stocks Wall Street is focusing on as the new year begins. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Unity Software (NYSE:U) and Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) are two of the stocks advancing sharply on the first trading day of 2025. Unity's platform enables computer games to feature "real-time 3D content and experiences," while Rigetti develops quantum-computing products. A close-up of a consumer enjoying the company's games on their mobile device. Unity is climbing 13% after Roaring Kitty, who has inspired multiple meme-stock rallies through his social media contributions, included a depiction of musician Rick James in his post on X. James is known for performing a song called "Unity." Perhaps due to Roaring Kitty's post, the mentions of Unity Software on social media are surging tremendously this morning. Also noteworthy is that on Tuesday night there was a block trade of 1.32 million shares of U stock. Turning to Rigetti, the quantum-computing company's shares are jumping 8.5% after it was reported this morning that State Street, an investment bank, disclosed that it had acquired nearly 310,000 shares of the tech firm's stock in the third quarter. As a result, State Street's stake in Rigetti rose by 12.9% in the third quarter to 2.71 million shares. The bank owned about 1.4% of Rigetti as of the end of Q3, while State Street's position in Rigetti at that time was worth $2.125 million. In the last three months, U stock has gained 21%, while RGTI has zoomed 1,986% higher. While we acknowledge the potential of U, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than U but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Despite a lack of any real news, Unity Software (U) stock went on a tear Thursday morning. It appears to be a result of the latest tweet from Keith Gill, an investor who also goes by “Roaring Kitty.” During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to impose tariffs on certain Chinese imports, such as solar panels. Although economists still debate whether Trump's tariffs will benefit America's economy, domestic solar producers certainly ... Unity Software (U) was a big mover last session on higher-than-average trading volume. The latest trend in earnings estimate revisions might help the stock continue moving higher in the near term. Tesla shares sank Thursday morning after the electric vehicle maker reported fewer deliveries than analysts had expected for the fourth quarter. Despite all sorts of good news for nuclear energy stocks in general in 2024, the year was not a great one for uranium miners like Uranium Energy in particular. In the face of a stock market that gained more than 25%, Uranium Energy stock actually lost value in 2024, and the big reason for this was the falling value of the uranium it produces. Is Uranium Energy stock a buy? In the closing of the recent trading day, Reddit Inc. (RDDT) stood at $165.91, denoting a +1.51% change from the preceding trading day. Hasbro (HAS) closed the most recent trading day at $56.43, moving +0.93% from the previous trading session. Finding strong, market-beating stocks with a positive earnings outlook becomes easier with the Zacks Rank. Mosaic receives 111,012,433 shares of Ma'aden, valued at roughly $1.5 billion, by exchanging its 25% stake in MWSPC.

Title: New Year’s Resolution to Embrace CO2 Emissions and Benefits
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/01/02/new-years-resolution-to-embrace-co2-emissions-and-benefits/
Time Published: 2025-01-02T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change By Vijay Jayaraj Scientific advancement and agricultural technology have revolutionized food production, enabling humanity to feed more readily a ballooning population. And working behind these celebrated innovations is an unacknowledged but indispensable contributor to the world’s growing food security: rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The very molecule that has been wrongly branded as a doomsday gas has been contributing to increasing yields for essential crops like rice, wheat and soybeans. Food Security is Serious Business The 20th century’s Green Revolution demonstrated how scientific intervention – including the use of fertilizers – could dramatically boost crop yields. The late 1960s saw a huge turnaround in yields across the globe, thanks to Norman Borlaug’s high-yielding, drought-adaptive, disease-resistant varieties of food crops. Nations that had suffered severe poverty and famine became agricultural giants within a decade or so. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, two nations that were once pleading for international aid to rescue their people from malnourishment and starvation. Despite being criticized by some, agricultural advancements in the use of fertilizers, pesticides and gene editing have been vital. Without them, feeding our growing global population would be impossible. But they’re not the complete story. Also driving higher crop yields has been an increasing concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere that began in the 19th century as the Industrial Revolution accelerated. The rate of increase rose further with global industrialization following World War II. C3-C4 Divide: Understanding the Difference Having an especially efficient photosynthetic pathway are C4 plants, which have a four-carbon sugar molecule produced during photosynthesis. These plants, which include corn and sugarcane, have an evolutionary adaptation from millions of years ago that was a response to an atmosphere relatively low in CO2. Thus, C4 crops are already operating near peak efficiency when it comes to CO2 utilization under suitable environmental conditions like that of the present era. In contrast, C3 plants that developed during a time in the distant past when CO2 levels where many times higher than today’s show dramatic responses to increased atmospheric levels of the gas. C3 plants, named for their three-carbon sugar molecule, have a relatively inefficient photosynthetic process. Their stomata – tiny pores on leaves that allow gaseous exchange – must remain open longer to capture sufficient CO2, which leads to greater water loss through transpiration. Higher ambient CO2 levels allow C3 plants to photosynthesize more efficiently while losing less water. The benefits of elevated CO2 aren’t merely theoretical, as proven in field studies that have confirmed laboratory findings. These studies, conducted in real-world conditions, show consistent yield increases across various C3 crops. Wheat yields increase by 20-30% under elevated CO2 conditions, while rice shows increases of between 15-32%. Soybeans, another crucial C3 crop, exhibit yield increases of up to 46% in some studies. Perhaps nowhere is the CO2 effect more evident than in greenhouse cultivation. Modern greenhouse operators routinely boost productivity by elevating CO2 levels to 800-1,000 parts per million (ppm), which are well above current atmospheric levels of around 420 ppm. The results are striking: tomato yields increase by 40-50%, cucumber production rises by 30-40%, and growth of lettuce and other vegetables accelerates significantly. In addition, it has now come to light that even C4 crops – like corn and sugarcane – can benefit from elevated CO2 under conditions of drought and low soil nitrogen. This is big revelation for tropical Asian countries where sugarcane farmers often struggle with insufficient water for their plants. Further research could reveal that the 21st century’s elevated CO2 levels have been aiding crop production there. Understanding CO2‘s role in crop productivity should inform the policy landscape, where governments and corporate entities like Blackrock and Vanguard have incorrectly promoted the reduction of atmospheric CO2 as a “life-saving” endeavor without understanding basic plant biology. The opposite is true: More atmospheric CO2 is a boon to humanity, and less is bad. We should be grateful for the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide that contribute to greater crop productivity instead of spending billions on foolish projects to remove the gas from the air to store it underground. Such initiatives will do nothing to improve the weather while impoverishing people. Today’s release of carbon dioxide through the combustion of coal, oil and natural gas is reversing a process that sequestered CO2 from the atmosphere millions of years and lowered to less than optimum concentrations the amount of the gas available for plant growth. A resolution worth adopting this New Year would be to reject the coordinated demonization of CO2 by climate scaremongers and to celebrate it for what it is: the gas of life. This commentary was first published at BizPac Review on December 27, 2024. Vijay Jayaraj is a Science and Research Associate at the CO2 Coalition, Arlington, Virginia. He holds an M.S. in environmental sciences from the University of East Anglia and a postgraduate degree in energy management from Robert Gordon University, both in the U.K., and a bachelor’s in engineering from Anna University, India.

They had plenty of lebensraum The warmunists spend all their energy trying to prove to the Great Unwashed Masses that today’s conditions are tantamount to the oft-forecast “tipping point” that will send us all to hell in a handbasket …. while in reality, this is the greatest period in human history for bountiful food, bountiful energy supplies, long life expectancy, great comforts, and “social justice”. The better we have it in this life, the more miserable the warmunists and cassandras who themselves are the great pollutants of life on earth. Warm-mongers? “Embrace CO2 Emissions and Benefits” We’re entering a cold spell and there’s every chance of our lighting a fire in our – yet to be banned – fireplace. Is there anymore a tight and warm embrace of coal and wood borne CO2 – plus anything else you want to burn? Story tip Net zero ‘nudge unit’ accused of Covid scare tactics will push heat pumps on public Behavioural Insights Team receives £100,000 contract from Government as ministers aim to deliver 300,000 extra home upgrades this year https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/01/02/net-zero-nudge-unit-accused-covid-scare-tactics-heat-pumps/ Given that there were less than 40,000 heat pumps of all kinds installed in the UK in 2023 (figures are not yet available for 2024) there is absolutely no chance that an extra 300,000 are going to be installed in 2025. Not in my house… “Modern greenhouse operators routinely boost productivity by elevating CO2 …” In a closed “greenhouse” CO2 has to be added just to replace that consumed by the plants. The elevated term is important. Further, on a windless day, a rapidly growing field, say of corn, will use-up the ambient CO2 and the growth will slow. We should take the captured CO2 from some industrial processes and release it in the fields of growing crops instead of pumping it into underground storage. We could release it into orchards and vineyards. We could submit an application to the USDA for a research funds for these projects. For field work we will need several brand new F-150 Ford pickup trucks. So, are we not at the “tipping point” where we can transition from “Have nothing and be happy” to “Have plenty to eat and be ecstatic” Curious minds want to know. A few days ago Astronomy Picture of the Day APOD put up this statement: “…methane, a greenhouse gas that, if released, could potentially increase the amount of infrared light absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere, and so increase the average temperature of the entire planet. In their Asterisk discussion board it was pointed out that CO2 is beneficial to crops around the world which produced this response: Here In any case, a few percent difference in crop production in either direction isn’t really the issue. It’s the collapse of ocean ecosystems, the shift in location of agricultural zones, the rise of sea level, the huge increase in extreme weather events, the loss of species diversity, and many other things that are defining this as a crisis. Hundreds of millions will die, billions will have their lives disrupted, our global economy will collapse and that will almost certainly continue us on our path away from democracy (already beginning, obviously). It’s not going to be pretty for the next generations. This the mindset that the New Year’s resolution is up against. People really do believe that. Hundreds of millions will die, billions will have their lives disrupted, our global economy will collapse…. If we descend into another glacial cycle. The climate crusaders want us to believe that a warmer world with more CO2 constitutes a crisis. The concentration of CH4 in the air is 1.929 ppmv. One cubic meter of air contains ca. 0.0014 g of CH4. The low concentration of CH4 is due to the initiation of its combustion by discharges of lightning. Everyday there are millions of lightning discharges, especially in the tropics (cf. Wiki). A hydrocarbon, CH4 is readily oxidized by ozone which is produced by lighting discharges. CH4 is slightly soluble in cold water. One liter of ice-cold water can contain 35 mls of CH4. That is not very much, but the cold polar waters a quite large. Jet planes with their large engines are flying vacuum cleaners for CH4. Vehicles with ice’s burn up CH4 in the air they use. Wildfires burn up CH4. We really do not have to worry about CH4. Interesting piece, especially on the C3-C4 divide. Nicely encouraging prospective. …. And another.. this could be made into a badge.. Very nice Vijay, wonderful post. Another great Vijay article My first decade of interest in climate was mainly reading scientific studies of CO2 enrichment and plant growth. I have read at least 200 of them. About 95% were about C3 plants because it was believed another 300 ppm of CO2 would not benefit C4 plants like corn much. But the benefits were larger than predicted. This is just my educated guess because there are no conclusive statistics: Global Food Crops C3 plants 70% of food C4 plants 30% of food Average growth increase per +100 ppm CO2 About 10% NOTE: A huge amount of corn (40% globally) is used as food for steers (not cows), pigs and chickens. Biological Impacts of CO2 20 page Summary of a 1079 page document Microsoft Word – _03-26-14_ CCR-IIb SPM.doc I vaguely recall reading an article somewhere that C4 plants are actually capable of reverting back to C3 processes to make better use of the enhanced atmospheric CO2. I much prefer my beef, range fed rather than corn fed. 🙂 The real cost of Net Zero….. Australia The Real Cost of Net Zero: The shocking truth of the renewable energy push Shown below in the graphic is a plot of the of annual average temperatures for Adelaide. The graphic is from the late John Daly’s website available at: http://www.John-Daly.com. Do think you could go to the BoM and get the temperature data up to 2023? If the trend continues, this would be additional info that CO2 does not cause warming of air. However, it is likely that original weather station has been moved so it would not be possible to complete the plot. While this is a good article. it considerabl;y understates the benefits of CO2. While the harms fail to manifest, the benefits increase linearly to concentration levels well above anything likely to occur. These benefits are massive. Currently most every every crop on the planet grows 12% to 20% more food (conservative estimate) then it would if the atmospheric CO2 level suddenly dropped from 420 PPM to pre-industrial 280 PPM. (280 PPM CO2 is near starvation levels. If CO2 concentration had moved 125 PPM in the opposite direction to only 155 PPM concentration, almost everybody on the planet would starve, and almost all bio-life would cease.) Also, this CO2 caused increased production of bio-life, delivers another stupendous benefit, in that zero increase in water or land acreage is required. Additionally CO2 makes crops more drought, heat, and frost resistant – geographically expanding growing zones and growing seasons! Indeed, if we went to 280 PPM tomorrow, WWIII would happen within weeks. Also there are far more benefits to C4 plants then listed. Please begin here, http://www.co2science.org//subject/c/c4plantbiom.php and there are many more then the multiple links here. …….280 PPM tomorrow, WWIII would happen within weeks. WWWIII is much more likely to result from the brain chemistry of a power crazed politician than from atmospheric chemistry. They are orthogonal. However a 20 percent global drop in food production would cause very rapid global conflict. Story tip: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352938524002416 Add this: Highlights As usual, Vijay’s CO2 essay is excellent. I will reference it in my articles Dutch and Belgium consortia own about 50% of all food supermarkets in the eastern US, which provides plenty of shelf space for display of European farm products, at the expense of US farmers, all as part of our full of holes trade agreements. What is not generally known, Dutch greenhouse owners in Quebec, Canada, receive low cost electricity and gas to provide lighting and CO2 and heat in the winter, during which they grow blueberries, cucumbers, parsnips, tomatoes, etc, which I buy in the Hanneford market, in West Lebanon, NH, owned by a Belgium consortium. Most supermarket chains now charge wholesalers for “shelf space” ….so maybe the US farmers need to get into the kickback game….Canadians, on the other hand value their quota system which insulates their farmers from going bankrupt every time the US has a production bubble.

Title: I wanted to add bitcoin to my portfolio, but wasn't sure about the best strategy for buying in. Here's what 3 experts recommended.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/financial-experts-recommended-invest-in-bitcoin-crypto-microstrategy-blackrock-etf-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-02T10:00:01Z
Full Content:
My investing strategy has never been very complicated or flashy. I typically stick to buying index funds. If I'm feeling crazy, I'll throw in an individual blue-chip stock here and there. After purchasing a security, I subscribe to a "leave it alone" strategy, save for a periodic rebalancing once or twice a year; my employer's policy also doesn't allow in-and-out trading. I had never seriously considered buying bitcoin. But in recent weeks I became increasingly curious about the cryptocurrency. Postelection, I sensed what can only be described as a seismic vibe shift concerning bitcoin. Not only has its price shot up, eclipsing $100,000 briefly in December, but trillion-dollar asset managers are throwing their support behind bitcoin. Bitcoin ETFs have taken off, publicly traded companies are adding bitcoin to their coffers, and there are talks of a national bitcoin reserve. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, recently suggested a bitcoin allocation within a multi-asset portfolio. It seemed to me that bitcoin had gained a new sense of legitimacy as an asset class. I decided there was no better way to determine whether bitcoin was really the next big thing — or if Wall Street simply had FOMO — than by buying bitcoin firsthand. I asked three financial experts for guidance on how to start investing in bitcoin. Before taking the plunge, I had some concerns: Was it smart to buy after the price of bitcoin had already run up so much? John Haar, a managing director at the bitcoin-services firm Swan Bitcoin, gave me an analogy: "If someone said 'Am I too late to bitcoin?' my answer would be 'Do you think you're too late to buying real estate or the S&P 500?' If an asset is a good storer of value, then it's going to appreciate over time, and there isn't really a concept of being too late to it." Looking at the price of bitcoin, I lamented my lack of foresight in not having stocked up in 2010, when it was trading at mere cents (never mind that I was 9). But as they say, the second-best time is now. Haar suggested dollar-cost averaging as a way to build up my bitcoin investment. Instead of trying to time the market to buy a dip, I could spend half of a predetermined allocation to bitcoin on an initial purchase, then slowly spend the other half by buying at regular intervals. By not investing in a lump sum, I'd still have the opportunity to take advantage of future price drops, Haar said. Robert Cannon, a financial advisor at Experity Wealth, echoed that sentiment. "If you believe in the future potential and the long-term view," Cannon said, "the best thing to do is dollar-cost averaging." Essentially, if you're thinking about buying and holding bitcoin long term, as I was, the timing of when you buy in is less important than simply just buying in. I also wondered how much of my portfolio I should allocate to bitcoin. David Laut, the chief investment officer at Abound Financial, told me he recommended his clients keep a 5% allocation to a combination of gold and bitcoin if they're looking for a more aggressive investing style. The reason is that these assets aren't typically correlated with the performance of the stock market. Cannon said he'd seen people use bitcoin as an inflation hedge in their portfolios. Ultimately, it depends on your risk tolerance, Cannon told me. He's advised clients with between 1% and 10% of their portfolio in bitcoin. When it came to actually buying bitcoin, I had a few options: I could purchase the cryptocurrency on a centralized or decentralized exchange or through an ETF, or purchase stock in companies related to bitcoin, such as Microstrategy. Many serious bitcoin investors prefer holding bitcoin directly, either on an exchange or through a self-custody wallet, Haar said. That's because ETFs provide bitcoin price exposure but not actual ownership. But Laut and Cannon both said they thought ETFs were a great way for a beginner to invest in bitcoin. "I'd rather own an ETF because then I don't have to worry about Coinbase being hacked," Laut told me. Crypto is still nascent and has risks — Laut pointed to the collapse of FTX two years ago, in which many investors saw their holdings evaporate. Laut said that with an established broker-dealer like Fidelity or Charles Schwab, investors could mitigate regulatory risks. I took the advice from Cannon, Haar, and Laut into consideration as I pondered my options. I decided on the following strategy: I'd allocate 1% of my portfolio to bitcoin to start off, with the option to increase my allocation in the future as I became more familiar with the cryptocurrency. I would invest half of it now and invest the rest over the next six months. I didn't want to go through the hassle of setting up an account on a crypto exchange like Coinbase. Luckily, my brokerage firm Fidelity offered a few ways to get bitcoin exposure, including buying bitcoin directly or through an ETF. I purchased the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which Cannon recommended. But there's no shortage of bitcoin ETFs to choose from. Other popular offerings include the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, and the ProShares Bitcoin ETF. Purchasing a bitcoin ETF was practically the same as purchasing any other stock or ETF, except for one thing: Right before I confirmed the trade, a pop-up message asked me to review and approve an agreement regarding crypto investments and upgrade my investment objective to "most aggressive" before proceeding. It's easier than ever to buy bitcoin, which might make investors underestimate the risk. But bitcoin is still a highly volatile asset, which sets it apart from traditional stocks. "If I told you you could lose everything, how much would you put in there?" Cannon said. For now, 1% seems like a good plan for me. Do you have a bitcoin investing story you'd like to share?

Title: Why Clearway Energy, Inc. (CWEN) Is Among the Best Environmental Stocks to Invest in Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Environmental Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CWEN) stands against the other best environmental stocks to invest in right now. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), held in Baku, Azerbaijan, concluded on November 24, with a landmark agreement that sets a new collective goal for climate finance. The agreement, which aims to triple the annual finance to developing countries from the previous goal of $100 billion to $300 billion by 2035, marks a significant step forward in global efforts to combat climate change and support vulnerable nations. Furthermore, this new finance goal, known as the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) also aims to scale up collaboration among all actors including governments, private sector entities, and international financial institutions to finance developing countries to reach $1.3 trillion annually by 2035. The progress made at COP29 builds on the global climate action achieved at previous conferences. COP27 established a historic Loss and Damage Fund, while COP28 delivered a global agreement to transition away from all fossil fuels in energy systems swiftly and fairly, tripling renewable energy and boosting climate resilience. The new finance goal at COP29 is a crucial step in ensuring that these commitments are met and that the global community remains on track to limit global warming. According to a report by McKinsey, the $300 billion annual goal for climate financing falls drastically short of the estimated $1 trillion needed annually to meet global targets. On a broader scale, McKinsey estimates that up to $9 trillion per year will be required globally by 2050 to decarbonize physical assets and transition towards a sustainable future. The report highlights that private capital is widely seen as a key enabler in bridging this financing gap. However, many investors remain cautious, not just due to a lack of funds, but due to a shortage of credible, scalable investment opportunities, execution challenges, insufficient risk management, and delays in scaling operations. The geopolitical and macroeconomic environment further complicates the sustainability landscape. Higher interest rates, inflation, and energy supply disruptions have created an environment where cost assumptions from just a few years ago no longer hold true. In light of these dynamics, McKinsey identifies three key strategies for businesses to navigate the complex investment landscape in sustainability. First, companies must reevaluate and refresh sustainability strategies as past assumptions may no longer be valid, and companies must take a pragmatic approach to align their strategies with current realities. Second, businesses must accelerate climate technology industrialization. While renewable energy technologies have made significant progress in cost competitiveness, other emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and precision fermentation, require further industrialization. Third, companies must address execution risks, streamline supply chains, and ensure they have experienced teams capable of managing large-scale sustainable projects. The report concluded by emphasizing that companies who will act decisively, embrace innovative financing mechanisms, and prioritize operational excellence will not only contribute to global sustainability goals but also position themselves for future growth in an evolving economic landscape. The journey towards a sustainable future requires collaboration, innovation, and accountability across all sectors. While the challenges are significant, the opportunities for growth, resilience, and value creation are even greater. A wind farm in motion, its many turbines spinning in the breeze. To compile our list of the 10 best environmental stocks to invest in right now, we used environmental ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 20 environment-friendly companies. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 29 Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CWEN) is one of the largest owners of renewable energy projects in the United States. The company is primarily focused on wind and solar energy and is actively expanding its battery energy storage assets. Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CWEN) is actively advancing the growth of its renewable energy portfolio. The company recently signed a binding agreement to acquire the 137 MW Tuolumne Wind Project from Turlock Irrigation District, located in Klickitat County, Washington. The acquisition, expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, will supply power under a new 15-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Turlock Irrigation District. It is projected to deliver an average incremental annual levered asset Cash Available for Distribution (CAFD) of approximately $9 million over five years, starting January 1, 2026. In addition, Clearway Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CWEN) is investing in the Pine Forest Solar and Storage Project. Situated in the rapidly expanding ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas) power market, this project strategically strengthens the company’s renewable portfolio.

Title: Is Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) the Best Low Volatility Stock to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Low Volatility Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) stands against other best low volatility stocks to buy right now. The market has shown strong performance overall, with the S&P 500 up nearly 26% year to date. However, in the past thirty days, it has experienced a slight decline of 1%. A notable sell-off occurred between December 17 and 19, which contributed to some volatility. Since then, the market has been fluctuating, with prices rising and falling as investors continue to navigate the uncertainty. In a CNBC interview, Alan Rechtschaffen, Senior Portfolio Manager at UBS Global Wealth, stressed that he maintains a positive outlook on market growth, emphasizing that the current market sell-off is driven by a lack of faith rather than fundamental issues. He noted that the positivity surrounding the market will improve as President Trump’s policies take effect. Rechtschaffen acknowledged concerns over high interest rates and high debt levels but argued that the Fed’s goal of lowering rates, combined with efforts to reduce spending and increase efficiency, will lead to high growth. He is particularly optimistic about sectors like technology, utilities, and financials, which he believes will benefit from a focus on new energy sources and deregulation. Although valuations are higher than usual, Rechtschaffen believes that with the right efficiencies in place, the market could see a 10% rise, offering opportunities for investors willing to take risks in this promising period. The path of rate cuts in 2025 is creating uncertainty for Wall Street as the Fed’s outlook shifted last week, now forecasting two cuts instead of four. The possibility of a rate hike has not been ruled out if inflation re-accelerates. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi that adjustments could be made depending on data, but she doesn’t see inflationary pressures at the moment. However, she isn’t ruling out anything. On Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts, Max Wasserman of Miramar Capital said that he believes the economy is stronger than anticipated, with GDP growth around 3% and inflation at 2.7%, which reduces the need for aggressive rate cuts. He also suggested that a rate hike could become more likely in the second half of 2025 if inflation remains persistent. Wasserman advised a more cautious approach in portfolio management, favoring de-risking strategies, such as taking profits from top-performing stocks and focusing on dividend stocks. He also recommended staying short-term on bonds, as rising interest rates could pressure longer-duration bonds. Additionally, he expressed concerns about potential inflationary policies from the incoming administration, such as changes to immigration or tariffs, which could further strain the economy and complicate the Fed’s path forward. For this article, we used the Yahoo Finance stocks screener to identify 30 companies with the largest market cap and a 5-year beta (monthly) between 0.2 and 0.8. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks most widely held by institutional investors. The 8 best low-risk stocks to buy are listed in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A workstation in a research lab stocked with laboratory products and services. 5-year Beta (Monthly): 0.79 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 98 Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) provides a wide range of products and services for life sciences, diagnostics, and laboratory research. It offers tools for biological research, drug production, disease diagnosis, and clinical testing. Scotiabank maintains a positive long-term outlook for the life science tools sector, considering it “bullish,” and regards three stocks, including Thermo Fisher, as “some of the highest-quality stocks to own.” However, in the short term, the firm adopts a more neutral stance on these large-cap stocks due to ongoing uncertainties in key markets, particularly biopharma, and China, as well as potential political risks heading into 2024, according to the analyst. On 23 December, as reported by TipRanks, Scotiabank started coverage of Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) with a Sector Perform rating and a price target of $605, while BofA has a price target of $660 on the stock and a Buy rating as reported on December 13. Thermo Fisher’s (NYSE:TMO) acquisitions are delivering strong results. The company’s recent acquisition of Olink Holdings for $3.1 billion, which was finalized in the third quarter, is helping to improve its capabilities in the rapidly growing proteomics market. The acquisition is expected to deliver synergies, with the company projecting $125 million in adjusted operating income synergies by the fifth year. The Binding Site, which is now the company’s protein diagnostics business and was acquired in 2023, continues to perform well. In the third quarter, the company secured an IVDR claim extension in the European Union for its Optilite Freelite Mx, enabling it to assist in diagnosing neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis. Overall, TMO ranks 4th on our list of best low volatility stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of TMO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TMO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Firms End 2024 Stronger With Impressive Gains. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) stands against other firms end 2024 stronger with impressive gains. A lackluster trading persisted throughout the last day of the year, with Wall Street’s main indices ending the day mixed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped by 0.07 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.43 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite declined by 0.90 percent. Meanwhile, NYSE Composite inched up by 0.10 percent and S&P Composite rose by 0.44 percent. Despite the lack of catalysts to spark trading, 10 companies–predominantly in the biopharmaceuticals sector–posted impressive gains. Let’s explore the reasons behind their outstanding performance. To come up with Monday’s top gainers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A scientist surrounded by vials and beakers in a modern laboratory, proudly displaying a vaccine. Shares of Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) closed the year on a strong note, rallying by 5.59 percent at $41.58 apiece as investors resorted to bargain-hunting after analysts regarded the company’s valuation as “too cheap.” Year-to-date price, however, marked a 63.04-percent nosedive from the $41.58 booked on January 2, 2024, as the company continued to face a slew of challenges with the continuous lower demand for Covid-19 vaccines. Earlier last year, the vaccine maker announced plans to slash its research and development budget to conserve cash for product launches, but after a year of consistent stock price decline, analysts remained skeptical. In other news, the company announced strengthening its partnership with Merck to purchase $50 million of Personalis common stock, which covers a multi-year extension with Moderna (MRNA) to utilize Personalis’ ImmunoID NeXT Platform and technology for V940/mRNA-4157, an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy that both firms are developing. Overall, MRNA ranks 5th on our list of firms end 2024 stronger with impressive gains. While we acknowledge the potential of MRNA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRNA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Ethereum Predictions 2025: Expert Shares His Projections
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-predictions-2025-expert/
Time Published: 2025-01-02T08:05:13Z
Full Content:
Anthony Sassano, an independent Ethereum educator, angel investor, advisor, and founder of The Daily Gwei, shared his Ethereum predictions for 2025 via X, outlining a series of significant milestones and advancements he expects to unfold this year. Ethereum will celebrate its 10th birthday this year and Sassano predicts that Ether (ETH) will reach a price of $15,000 by the end of 2025. He anticipates substantial growth in institutional investment, forecasting that ETH Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) will see net inflows exceeding $50 billion throughout the year. Additionally, he expects that staked ETH ETFs will be filed for and receive approval from the Trump administration which will significantly increase demand. Further expanding his Ethereum predictions, Sassano envisions an increase in major Traditional Finance (TradFi) companies and institutions building on it. “More major TradFi companies/institutions start to build on Ethereum,” he predicts, adding, “BlackRock (and partners) launch a layer 2 tokenized RWA platform on Ethereum.” Government adoption features prominently in Sassano’s Ethereum predictions, as he anticipates that multiple nation-states will reveal holdings of ETH as part of their treasury assets. “Multiple nation states reveal that they hold ETH as a treasury asset,” Sassano states. On the technical front, he predicts the rollout of the Pectra upgrade in March or April 2025, “with more blobs and then soon after, blobs will be saturated again.” This will be followed by the Fusaka upgrade in 2026, which he believes will be the “biggest Ethereum upgrade ever.” He also expects the mainnet gas limit to increase to at least 50 million by the end of the year, facilitating greater transaction throughput and scalability. Sassano’s Ethereum predictions also include significant advancements in Layer 2 (L2) solutions. He anticipates that high-performance L2s like MegaETH and Rise will launch, outpacing existing high-performance Layer 1 (L1) networks in efficiency and adoption. Furthermore, he expects Arbitrum One to become the first major rollup to reach stage 2 decentralization, with many other rollups achieving stage 1 decentralization. In addition to these developments, Sassano predicts that Base will spin out from Coinbase and announce token and decentralization plans.Sassano explained the reasons for this, “Because Base is an incubated project within Coinbase that is achieving escape velocity at this point. Would make a lot of sense for it to spin out logically into its own team (while still having all the same Coinbase support) – gives them more freedom, flexibility and independence without having to worry so much about regulations and potential bureaucracy in-house.” He also foresees that a based rollup will enter the top five as measured by Total Value Locked (TVL), and a major optimistic rollup will transition into a zk rollup. Infrastructure advancements remain a critical component of Sassano’s Ethereum predictions.

Title: Institutions along with individual investors who hold considerable shares inInnodata Inc. (NASDAQ:INOD) come under pressure; lose 8.3% of holdings value

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The considerable ownership by individual investors in Innodata indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy The top 25 shareholders own 41% of the company Insiders have sold recently Every investor in Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ:INOD) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 54% to be precise, is individual investors. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk). While institutions, who own 41% shares weren’t spared from last week’s US$104m market cap drop, individual investors as a group suffered the maximum losses Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Innodata, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Innodata Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. We can see that Innodata does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Innodata's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Innodata is not owned by hedge funds. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 6.9% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 5.4% and 5.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. Additionally, the company's CEO Jack Abuhoff directly holds 4.1% of the total shares outstanding. A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. We can report that insiders do own shares in Innodata Inc.. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth US$60m. Most would see this as a real positive. Most would say this shows alignment of interests between shareholders and the board. Still, it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. The general public -- including retail investors -- own 54% of Innodata. This level of ownership gives investors from the wider public some power to sway key policy decisions such as board composition, executive compensation, and the dividend payout ratio. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified 3 warning signs for Innodata (2 don't sit too well with us) that you should be aware of. If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) stands against the other multibagger stocks. The US equities continued their upward movement in 2024 and fueled the S&P 500 to record highs. Much of this optimism in the broader market was backed by the strong US economy and the Federal Reserve’s stance to cut interest rates. As per PBS News, 2024 saw several familiar winners, like big technology stocks. These stocks got even bigger due to continuous increases in their stock prices. Apart from certain tech giants, strong momentum was also seen in Bitcoin, gold, and other investments. Ameriprise Financial reported that 2024 had a strong start, with the S&P 500 Index concluding the Q1 on a high note due to a healthy US economic backdrop, moderating inflation, improvement in profit conditions, and anticipations of rate cuts from the US Fed. The strong growth momentum continued in Q2 as the S&P 500 Index saw its strongest three-quarter run since mid-2021. Ameriprise Financial highlighted that an AI boom again drove healthy gains throughout IT and communication services. However, increased rates and a pause by the US Fed capped broader market gains. In September, the US Fed reduced its policy rate for the first time since 2020, concluding its aggressive rate-hiking cycle to control inflation. Therefore, it began a new monetary policy stance that supported economic growth and the labor market. Additionally, since the election, investors’ confidence has been further boosted towards risky assets, including equities.

The US is expected to remain a global growth engine with the expansionary business cycle, healthy labor market, broadening of AI-associated capital spending, and the prospect of strong capital markets and dealmaking activity. Furthermore, BlackRock sees several factors expected to support stocks in 2025. The decisive election result removed key uncertainty hanging over the broader US market. The rally that was seen after the results might continue into the start of 2025 primarily because of prospects of tax cuts and deregulation throughout key industries. While the impact of some policies remains uncertain, history has a long-term record of positive returns in 1st year of a Presidential term. The firm also believes that earnings and valuations hint at healthy potential for a continued broadening of the market. Its analysis of the S&P 500 data reflects that earnings for Mag 7 stocks outperformed the broader market by 37% in 2023. This earnings gap was narrowed across 2024. Now, it expects it to decline to 7.5% in 2025. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Right Now, we used a screener to shortlist the stocks that have gained over 100% over the past year and have healthy average upside potential. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of 30th December 2024. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A microbiologist in protective gear studying samples in a laboratory. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 41 One-year Return: ~117% Average Upside Potential: ~176% Market Cap as of 30th December: $4.44 billion Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, which focuses on the development of novel therapies for metabolic and endocrine disorders. Wall Street remains optimistic about Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX)’s lead program, VK2735, and its long-term growth potential. VK2735 is a novel dual-agonist designed to target the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors. This combination enhances metabolic benefits for conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) made headway in its clinical trials for VK2735. Recent developments have demonstrated VK2735 leading to significant weight loss results, bolstering the confidence of the investors. As per Maximize Market Research, the obesity treatment market size is expected to reach ~US$32.50 billion by 2029. Dual-agonists, like VK2735, reflect promise in delivering greater weight loss and glycemic control compared to GLP-1 monotherapies, placing Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) for long-term growth. Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX)’s clinical trials of VK2735 (both injectable and oral formulations) continue to progress well, with results so far indicating strong efficacy and tolerability. A successful transition to late-stage trials and eventual FDA approval should unlock additional opportunities for partnerships, licensing, or global commercialization. Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, sees material upside to Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX)’s stock on the back of the company’s GLP-1 drug, which it believes has the potential to be a best-in-class obesity drug considering its favorable efficacy and safety profile. Here's what the firm said in its Q2 2024 letter: “Viking Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VKTX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies for patients suffering from metabolic and endocrine disorders. Their lead drug VK2809, a beta-selective thyroid hormone receptor agonist, is in development for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Their VK2735 drug is a GLP-1 dual agonist being developed for patients with obesity. During the quarter, the company’s shares were negatively impacted by several factors: 1) a challenging environment for biotechnology stocks, exacerbated by Fed policy decisions to maintain elevated interest rates, 2) increased competition in the obesity treatment landscape, 3) manufacturability and scalability concerns regarding Viking’s obesity drug and 4) the absence of strategic partnerships from large pharmaceutical companies. Despite the challenging quarter, we continue to believe that the company’s GLP-1 drug has the potential to be a best-in-class obesity drug given its favorable efficacy and safety profile. Further, with approximately one-third of U.S. adults suffering from obesity, we believe the company’s GLP[1]1 drug has the potential to address a large market once approved.” Overall VKTX ranks 1st on our list of the best multibagger stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of VKTX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than VKTX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR)’s strategic pivot towards Bitcoin acquisition placed it well in the public markets, providing investors indirect exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. At the core of the company’s current strategy is its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition plan. It has been utilizing a combination of cash from operations, debt issuance, and equity raises to finance its Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR)’s Bitcoin strategy provides investors with significant potential upside if Bitcoin prices appreciate. With the company accumulating more Bitcoin, any appreciation in Bitcoin's value is expected to be magnified in the company’s stock price. The strategy offers a way for investors to provide exposure to Bitcoin via publicly-traded company, which can be more accessible or compliant with certain investment mandates than direct cryptocurrency investments. If Bitcoin gets wider adoption as a store of value or hedge against inflation, MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR)’s early position can result in substantial returns. In October, the company unveiled its plans to garner $42 billion in fresh capital for Bitcoin purchases over the upcoming 3 years. It holds 252,220 bitcoins as of September 30, 2024. The new capital-raising plan, called the "21/21 Plan," focuses on securing $21 billion via equity offerings and another $21 billion through fixed-income securities over 2025 and 2027. While there is optimism around the company’s stock, Artisan Partners, an investment management company, has avoided this company because the firm believes there is a lack of conviction in its franchise characteristics. Here's what the firm said in its Q2 2024 letter: “Regarding MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), our decision to avoid this company comes down to a lack of conviction in its franchise characteristics. The stock has worked this year due to a rebound in the price of bitcoin. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has been focused on converting its cash and cash equivalent holdings, as well as issuing debt, to fund the purchase of bitcoin, which now makes up most of the company’s value.” Overall MSTR ranks 5th on our list of the best multibagger stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Jim Cramer’s Take on HCA Healthcare (HCA): Bold Predictions for the Future

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) stands against the other healthcare stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about. Healthcare has been one of Jim Cramer's favorite topics lately. The tail end of the year has pushed a portion of the sector, namely healthcare benefit managers and pharmaceutical chains, into Wall Street's spotlight. Investors were particularly anxious after President-elect Trump's remarks during a press conference at Mar-e-Lago. At the event, he promised to take on the healthcare middleman due to the high costs that Americans were facing. Americans are "paying far too much. . . .much more than other countries" for healthcare, shared Trump. He pointed at what he believes is the heart of the problem. According to Trump, "We have a thing called the middle man, you know, the middle man right? The horrible middleman that makes more money frankly than the drug companies. And they don’t do anything except they’re a middleman.” The role played by the healthcare middlemen has also made the President-elect vow to “knock out the middle man" despite understanding that he's "going to be very unpopular after that.” Cramer has spent several shows discussing either the broader impact of the President-elect's goal on the benefits management industry or the impact on specific companies. After Trump shared his plans for the middlemen, Cramer pointed out that the industry does enjoy significant reach. He shared "I think that what, if President-elect Trump follows up about knocking out the middleman, he will. He will because these companies will eventually lose their support in Congress.” This is because Cramer believes that once the different levers of the US government (Republicans, Democrats, and the Executive) act in unison then, “when you have that kind of come together over them, you don’t wanna be in that business.” However, he cautioned that the big companies are not completely vulnerable. "These companies are not, uh, without their friends," shared Cramer. He also added that the firms also "resent the middlemen. Cardinal’s had a lot to be able to be a little bit more forward about what can be done. [MCK] is considered to be a company that has done a lot to be able to make it so smaller drug stores get product.” Yet, while the companies might have friends, some of them are vulnerable as well. Later during his show, Cramer commented on the firm that ranks 13th on this list. He shared that this firm is "viewed as being part of the problem of the cost of healthcare," and added that "they have no friends." He also mentioned another firm in a later program. This stock ranks 6th on our list of stocks Cramer talked about after the Fed's interest rate cut. He believes that "Look I think that if I were the people at [the healthcare benefit managers], when the President-elect decides that he is going to take a shot at you, as we know from his first time around, it’s not one off. There’s multiple shots. Multiple attempts to say listen you guys are . . . friction. I would not buy these stocks." Commenting on President-elect Trump and his partner Elon Musk, Cramer commented "I mean these guys are powerful one-two combination." The rather sharp remarks for the pharma benefits manager were somewhat of a departure from Cramer's earlier comments. For the same stock, he shared “Can we just say that the middlemen have been under fire for decades. And they are always, they always, McKesson is always standing. McKesson has just defied everyone. Right. They defy everybody. No one can touch McKesson.” Overall though Cramer believes that the healthcare benefits management sector might be in for trouble in the future. Investors also appear to be cognizant of this reality with some stocks down 45.57% year-to-date. Within this turmoil, let's see how his previous stock predictions have fared. To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about healthcare stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out pharma, hospital management, and healthcare benefit management stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 66 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 09-05-24 Performance Since Then: 24.8% HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is one of the biggest hospital managers in America. It operates inpatient and outpatient care facilities, and as a result, is dependent to a large extent on the US government's healthcare benefit programs for its revenue. HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA)'s shares dropped by 10% in October after Hurricane Helene reduced its revenue by $50 million and led to a Q3 EPS miss by seven cents. The 10% share price drop erased the gains that the firm had made in the second half. Here's what Cramer said about HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) in September: "In the interest of keeping things fresh, let me give you a new idea, one we talked about not that long ago: HCA Healthcare. That’s the big hospital chain. HCA has been making a mint from the major uptick in patients coming in for non-urgent procedures. Incredibly, there's still a huge backlog of people who postponed going to the hospital during the pandemic. Overall, HCA ranks 4th on our list of healthcare stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of HCA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HCA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer’s Take on Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX): Bold Predictions for the Future

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) stands against the other healthcare stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about. Healthcare has been one of Jim Cramer's favorite topics lately. The tail end of the year has pushed a portion of the sector, namely healthcare benefit managers and pharmaceutical chains, into Wall Street's spotlight. Investors were particularly anxious after President-elect Trump's remarks during a press conference at Mar-e-Lago. At the event, he promised to take on the healthcare middleman due to the high costs that Americans were facing. Americans are "paying far too much. . . .much more than other countries" for healthcare, shared Trump. He pointed at what he believes is the heart of the problem. According to Trump, "We have a thing called the middle man, you know, the middle man right? The horrible middleman that makes more money frankly than the drug companies. And they don’t do anything except they’re a middleman.” The role played by the healthcare middlemen has also made the President-elect vow to “knock out the middle man" despite understanding that he's "going to be very unpopular after that.” Cramer has spent several shows discussing either the broader impact of the President-elect's goal on the benefits management industry or the impact on specific companies. After Trump shared his plans for the middlemen, Cramer pointed out that the industry does enjoy significant reach. He shared "I think that what, if President-elect Trump follows up about knocking out the middleman, he will. He will because these companies will eventually lose their support in Congress.” This is because Cramer believes that once the different levers of the US government (Republicans, Democrats, and the Executive) act in unison then, “when you have that kind of come together over them, you don’t wanna be in that business.” However, he cautioned that the big companies are not completely vulnerable. "These companies are not, uh, without their friends," shared Cramer. He also added that the firms also "resent the middlemen. Cardinal’s had a lot to be able to be a little bit more forward about what can be done. [MCK] is considered to be a company that has done a lot to be able to make it so smaller drug stores get product.” Yet, while the companies might have friends, some of them are vulnerable as well. Later during his show, Cramer commented on the firm that ranks 13th on this list. He shared that this firm is "viewed as being part of the problem of the cost of healthcare," and added that "they have no friends." He also mentioned another firm in a later program. This stock ranks 6th on our list of stocks Cramer talked about after the Fed's interest rate cut. He believes that "Look I think that if I were the people at [the healthcare benefit managers], when the President-elect decides that he is going to take a shot at you, as we know from his first time around, it’s not one off. There’s multiple shots. Multiple attempts to say listen you guys are . . . friction. I would not buy these stocks." Commenting on President-elect Trump and his partner Elon Musk, Cramer commented "I mean these guys are powerful one-two combination." The rather sharp remarks for the pharma benefits manager were somewhat of a departure from Cramer's earlier comments. For the same stock, he shared “Can we just say that the middlemen have been under fire for decades. And they are always, they always, McKesson is always standing. McKesson has just defied everyone. Right. They defy everybody. No one can touch McKesson.” Overall though Cramer believes that the healthcare benefits management sector might be in for trouble in the future. Investors also appear to be cognizant of this reality with some stocks down 45.57% year-to-date. Within this turmoil, let's see how his previous stock predictions have fared. To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about healthcare stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out pharma, hospital management, and healthcare benefit management stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 55 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-28-24 Performance Since Then: -17.85% Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) is a biotechnology company that derives more than 90% of its sales through selling cystic fibrosis drugs. It also gained prominence earlier this year through its CASGEVY treatment which became the world's first gene-editing-based treatment for Sickle Cell Disease. However, the latter half of 2024 has been nothing short of devastating for Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX)'s shares. The stock sank by 11% in December after the firm's highly hyped non-addictive painkiller thought to have the potential to replace opioids failed to meet objectives. Here's what Cramer said about Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) in August: "I think Vertex is great. Look, its fibrosis franchise is incredible, and a terrible disease. But I also like the fact that what they're doing in terms of opiates—look, this is a great company. No one ever talks about it. We've had them on. I think that they're brilliant. Okay, per period. Down story." Overall, VRTX ranks 7th on our list of healthcare stocks Jim Cramer has made bold predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of VRTX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VRTX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Costco Is Caught In The Crosshairs Of The DEI Controversy
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2025/01/01/costco-is-caught-in-the-crosshairs-of-the-dei-controversy/

“Our success at Costco Wholesale has been built on service to our critical stakeholders: employees, ... [+] members and suppliers. Our efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion follow our code of ethics,” Costco Board of Directors stated. Exterior of a Costco store on July 11, 2024 in Richmond, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Costco Wholesale faces an upcoming proxy battle brought by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), challenging its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) program. The company board of directors announced it stands firm on the company’s DEI initiatives. “Our success at Costco Wholesale has been built on service to our critical stakeholders: employees, members and suppliers. Our efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion follow our code of ethics,” it stated and urged stockholders to vote against the NCPPR proposal. Voting will take place on Jan. 23. Now Costco, the nation’s third-largest retailer after number one Walmart and number two Amazon, is embroiled in the politically and emotionally-charged DEI controversy as calls for a Costco boycott are beginning to emerge, according to Newsweek. Anti-DEI crusader Robby Starbuck, who claims victory in getting Walmart, not only the largest retailer but the nation’s largest private employer, to roll back its DEI initiatives, posted on X: “For now I suggest conservative consumers find other places to spend their money if Costco is so dedicated to doubling down on DEI. If they’re smart, Costco will do right by their shareholders and change before we turn our attention to them.” NCPRR is making a simple and straightforward proposal: “to conduct research and publish a report on the risks to the Company maintaining its current DEI (including ‘People & Communities’) roles, policies and goals.” This is hardly an unreasonable request following last year’s Supreme Court ruling that found Harvard University’s race-based admissions policies violated the 14th Amendment. While that ruling didn’t specifically affect business employment and hiring practices, it raised the threat of future legal battles aimed at corporate DEI programs. In addition to Walmart, other companies are reassessing their DEI programs. Ford Motor Company, Harley Davidson, Toyota, Boeing, Tractor Supply, Molson Coors, Brown Foreman, John Deere, Microsoft, Southwest Airlines, Home Depot, Lowe’s and Caterpillar are among the major corporations that have dialed back DEI initiatives. Their prudence is warranted since the business case supporting DEI programs and their ideological underpinnings is losing ground as more research emerges, like the study published by professors Jeremiah Green and John R.M. Hand in the Econ Journal Watch. They tried to replicate numerous studies by McKinsey that served as a foundation for corporate DEI programs and found the McKinsey studies flawed. “[O]ur results indicate that despite the imprimatur often given to McKinsey’s 2015, 2018, 2020, and 2023 studies, McKinsey’s studies neither conceptually … nor empirically … support the argument that large US public firms can expect on average to deliver improved financial performance if they increase the racial/ethnic diversity of their executives,” they wrote. Further evidence emerged in December when a Federal Court vacated the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of a proposed Nasdaq board diversity rule. The rule, which the SEC originally approved in 2021 but was never implemented due to legal challenges, would have required those listed on the exchange to include at least two directors who are “diverse,” including at least one director who self-identifies as female and at least one director who self-identifies as an underrepresented minority or LGBTQ. Harvard Law Professor Jesse Fried took issue with the basis of Nasdaq’s board diversity claims: “Nasdaq cannot cite any high-quality study showing that board gender or ethnic diversity boosts returns, because there has been none. In fact, there is a sizeable body of academic work reporting the opposite results: diversifying boards can harm financial performance,” he posted on the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance. The SEC could appeal that ruling, though with the Trump administration taking office later this month, it is unlikely to do so. Nonetheless, Costco opposes studying the company’s DEI program and accuses NCPRR of having a “broader agenda” to abolish its diversity initiatives rather than reducing risks to the company and its stockholders. “We believe that the proponent’s request for a study reflects a policy bias with which we disagree and that further study and reporting would not be an efficient use of Company resources,” the board explained. Stefan J. Padfield, JD, director of the Free Enterprise Project at the National Center for Public Policy Research, doesn’t deny his organization’s opposition to DEI. “We oppose DEI because corporate diversity initiatives are race-discrimination initiatives and institutionalize, among other things, race discrimination,” he shared with me. “They expose companies to legal and reputational risks. Thus, our broader goals are perfectly consistent with value-maximization goals of our fellow shareholders,” he continued. Asking Costco to objectively and rigorously study the risks associated with its DEI policies and practices is compelling. NCPPR’s proposal cites the $25.6 million judgment against Starbucks after a Federal Court found race discrimination played a part in the firing of a white former Starbucks regional manager. Given Costco’s reporting on the makeup of its 310,000 employee base, NCPPR figures it has at least 200,000 employees who might claim illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight, resulting in similar costly judgments if “only a fraction of those employees were to file suit.” “Simply asking shareholders to trust the status quo at Costco is insufficient,” Padfield said. “This is a rapidly changing landscape in terms of law, regulation and market sentiment and shareholders accordingly have good reason to ask for a review of practices, legal advice and managerial information gathering and processing.” Amazon recently completed such a two-year study conducted by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, and Garrison, which identified areas of improvement and gave Amazon confidence to continue its DEI program. One suspects Costco’s board doesn’t believe its own program would bear such scrutiny. “The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information to our shareholders and the Board unanimously recommends a vote against this proposal,” it stated. Yet businesses, especially those of the size and reach of Costco, make decisions based on data. How can a responsible corporate board and executive leadership not want more information, rather than less, on which to make major strategic decisions related to far-reaching corporate employment practices? What shareholder wouldn’t demand the company justify its position as recent research and rulings are turning against DEI orthodoxy and other companies are dialing back their previous initiatives? As W. Edwards Deming famously said, “In God we trust. All others must bring data.” In a seminal Harvard Business Review article, “Getting Serious about Diversity: Enough Already with the Business Case,” Robin Ely, Harvard professor of business management, and Morehouse College president David Thomas stated: “Leaders may mean well when they tout the economic payoffs of hiring more women and people of color, but there is no research support for the notion that diversifying the workforce automatically improves a company’s performance.” They argue for business leaders to adopt a “learning-orientation” to measure the real-world effectiveness of such programs. “To make real progress, people – and the organizational cultures they inhabit – must change. But instead of doing the hard work involved, companies have generally stuck with easier, more limited approaches that don’t alter the status quo.” It appears Costco is not ready to step up to Ely’s and Thomas’ “learning-and-effectiveness approach” to put its DEI program under the microscope, like Amazon, to find out where it’s working and where it’s not, so appropriate changes can be made. What’s to fear by Costco examining its DEI policies and practices? Significant good might come from it. “The problem is that nearly 25 years later, organizations have largely failed to adopt a learning orientation toward diversity and are no closer to reaping its benefits. Instead, business leaders and diversity advocates alike are advancing a simplistic and empirically unsubstantiated version of the business case,” Ely and Thomas wrote. “They misconstrue or ignore what abundant research has now made clear: Increasing the numbers of traditionally underrepresented people in your workforce does not automatically produce benefits. Taking an ‘add diversity and stir’ approach will not spur leads in your firm’s effectiveness or financial performance.” One can argue that if Costco were to adopt NCPPR’s proposal for a study and found significant benefits from its DEI policies, it would be a major step forward for the company and the business community at large. Ely and Thomas stress the moral imperative for diversity in the corporate culture, calling on leaders to “embrace a broader vision of success that encompasses learning, innovation, creativity, flexibility, equity and human dignity.” However, they reveal in their HBR article that businesses by and large haven’t realized diversity’s full potential. If Costco believes in what it says and can prove it, it would be a case study in doing DEI right that other business leaders would gratefully follow. Costco is steadfastly holding to its current policies founded on its code of ethics. “Our focus on diversity, equity and inclusion is not, however, only for the sake of improved financial performance but to enhance our culture and well-being of people whose lives we influence,” it stated. Yet it is unwilling to objectively measure if its admirable four-part code of ethics – Obey the law. Take care of our members. Take care of our employees. Respect our suppliers. – is fully realized through its current “People and Communities” program. And for shareholders, the financial risks and rewards should be measured too, as the legal and regulatory environment is changing. The Costco board opposes the proxy proposal not necessarily on the grounds of the request but on who’s making it: the National Center for Public Policy Research and its Free Enterprise Project. An analysis of the 2024 proxy season by the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell found that NCPPR was a top proponent last year, filing 54 proxy proposals with over half (31) aimed at social/political issues. BlackRock, Kohl’s, Home Depot and CVS were among its targets. Overall, social/political proxy proposals garnered the most submissions, a total of 365, but only one such shareholder proposal passed. The average number of votes cast in favor was only 15%. That said, the chances of NCPPR prevailing in its proposal for Costco to conduct a study of its DEI program and give a report to shareholders is slim to none. But NCPPR intends to keep fighting. Deputy director for NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project, Ethan Peck shared, “DEI is the redistribution of opportunity – for employees, potential employees and suppliers – on the basis of race and sex. It is not only immoral; it’s illegal and runs the risks of future litigation. “Adopting DEI under immense public pressure during the summer of 2020 was one thing, but doubling down on it after years of sunlight exposing what DEI entails, and multiple court decisions that increase the litigation risks of DEI, is much more radical,” he said. To which, Costco seems to say, “Bring it on.” Note: Costco did not respond to a request for comment.

Expected for launch in mid-2025, Brensocatib represents a major near-term catalyst for Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM). The successful commercialization of this drug can significantly impact the company's financial outlook. Brensocatib targets the underlying cause of inflammation in NCFBE (Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis) by inhibiting neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs). Current treatments only manage symptoms, and there are no approved therapies to address the underlying inflammation. If Brensocatib achieves rapid market adoption and meets or surpasses sales projections, it can fuel substantial top-line growth for Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM). This will offer immediate financial benefits and will also validate the company's R&D capabilities. Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM) believes Brensocatib and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis alone to be a $5 billion-plus peak sales operating opportunity. The success in the bronchiectasis market can offer the company a platform to expand into associated respiratory conditions or rare diseases. As per Wall Street, the expertise and infrastructure developed for bronchiectasis can be used to ramp up the development and commercialization of treatments for other indications, multiplying Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM)’s addressable market. TimesSquare Capital Management, an equity investment management company, sees material upside to Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM)’s stock on the back of optimism around Brensocatib. Here's what the firm said in its Q3 2024 letter: “Vaxcyte, Inc. (developer of vaccines) and Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM) (developer of treatments for various pulmonary diseases). Insmed has one commercially approved treatment for lung infections that is under review for expanded use. Recently another treatment reported positive clinical data that paves the way for a commercial launch in 2025. The latter, Brensocatib, will be the first approved to treat directly chronic bronchial issues that currently only have symptom mitigation methods.” Overall INSM ranks 12th on our list of the best multibagger stocks to buy right now.

Title: Trump's billionaires will have to navigate a complex web of possible conflicts of interest
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-billionaires-conflicts-of-interest-elon-musk-cabinet-ethics-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-01T11:11:01Z
Full Content:
President-elect Donald Trump is stocking his administration and broader orbit with billionaires and titans of industry. Their résumés and portfolios also come with a bevy of potential conflicts of interest that could overshadow their actual jobs. Elon Musk may receive the lion's share of the attention, but he's far from the only billionaire in Trump's orbit who has benefited from government contracts. "This Trump administration is just chocked full of billionaires, millionaires, and lobbyists," Craig Holman, a lobbyist for government watchdog Public Citizen, recently told Business Insider. Trump tapped private equity billionaire Stephen Feinberg to become his second-highest-ranking official at the Pentagon. Feinberg's firm, Cerberus Capital Management, has significant interests in military defense contractors, which, as deputy director of defense, could pose a conflict given that the Pentagon's No. 2 is typically responsible for the Defense Department's massive budget. Earlier this year, Cerberus acquired a controlling interest in M1 Support Services, an aircraft maintenance contractor. In fiscal year 2024 alone, M1 has been awarded over $630.7 million in federal contracts, according to USASpending.gov contract data. Cerberus also has a large stake in Navistar Defense, a specialized military vehicle manufacturer. In 2021, Navistar paid a $50 million fine to resolve a complaint that accused the company of inflating the prices of mine-resistant vehicles it sold to the US Marine Corps from 2007 to 2012, before Feinberg's firm bought a 70% stake in 2018. Musk has an even wider portfolio of responsibilities. Unlike Feinberg, the Tesla CEO is set to remain outside the Trump administration — meaning the world's richest man would not be subject to the potential divestment full-time administration officials may be asked to do. "He definitely has a vision for humanity and he views himself as a world historic figure, and he knows his wealth is necessary to fulfilling his vision," Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a public interest group, told Business Insider earlier this month. "So I am frightened by what government by people like that looks like." All of Trump's appointees who enter the government will have to comply with the criminal conflict of interest law. Congress did not apply that law to the president or vice president, in part due to constitutional concerns. Congressional Democrats have raised concern about Musk's ties to China. He called for the expulsion of Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, after she and other liberal lawmakers questioned whether Musk helped kill a sweeping government funding bill due to its inclusion of restrictions on certain US investments in China. Trump told Time Magazine that he's seen Musk put the country ahead of his financial interests. "I think he's one of the very few people that would have the credibility to do it, but he puts the country before, and I've seen it, before he puts his company," Trump said. In response to questions about potential conflicts of interest, Brian Hughes, a Trump-Vance Transition spokesperson, said in a statement to Business Insider "All nominees and appointees will comply with the ethical obligations of their respective agencies and offices." Divestment can be difficult to navigate. In 2017, Florida Panthers owner Vincent Viola, a billionaire, withdrew from consideration to become Trump's first Army secretary. According to The New York Times, Viola had too much difficulty untangling his financial interests. Others have been able to broker deals allowing them to cash out early. Former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson had to work out a special $180 million retirement package with the oil giant because some of his holdings included restricted shares that hadn't been fully vested. Goldman Sachs accelerated its payout to Gary Cohn, who left the firm to become Trump's chief economic advisor, leaving him with a roughly $285 million exit package. In order to entice talent out of the private sector, the government also allows officials to defer some tax liabilities when they are directed to sell shares or other assets. Tillerson and Cohn both used this perk. So too has current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Government watchdogs have long expressed unease about top officials entering the government with private-sector ties. Biden advisors' ties to BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, were the subject of significant attention during the 2020 transition. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo was once interim chief of staff to Larry Fink. Brian Deese, who was Biden's top economic aide, led BlackRock's sustainable investing before joining the Biden administration. Adeyemo agreed to recuse himself from any potential BlackRock-related business until he sold off his interests. As a political appointee, Deese's ethics agreement is not public information, though ethics-focused groups previously asked the White House to disclose it. (The White House did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment about Deese's agreement. He left the administration last year.) It remains to be seen whether the president-elect will impose additional ethics requirements as he did shortly after taking office in 2017. Trump's first cabinet was the wealthiest in modern history. His incoming team is likely to be even richer. The influx of billionaires extends from the cabinet down through US ambassadors. So far, Trump's tapped at least two additional billionaires to represent the US abroad, Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta and investment banker Warren Stephens, to be US ambassadors. And that list doesn't even include the likes of Musk, who has Trump's attention without the hassle of selling off his vast interests. "He is going to have the ear of President Trump anyway, even though he's serving in an advisory capacity," Holman said of Musk. Jump to

Title: Altcoin Season 2025: A Crypto Bull Run Guide
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/clorischen/2024/12/31/altcoin-season-2025-a-crypto-bull-run-guide/

A phone screen displaying a graphic chart showing an upward trend, with the label '$100K'. (Photo by ... [+] Hakan Nural/Anadolu via Getty Images) Bitcoin halving, all-time high, and altcoin season—the recipe for a bull run, or is it? First, Bitcoin's halving reduces its issuance rate, which sparks supply scarcity. After that, BTC rallies into its ATHs and is followed by a horde of pumped altcoins driven by investors who prefer higher, albeit riskier, returns. The altcoin season is then full on. Bitcoin had its most recent halving in May of this year, and soon after that, it smashed through the $100k mark—a historic milestone. Yet, the altcoin market is bleeding. Where is the usual rally? Is the golden recipe broken? The surge of institutional capital and the liquidity crunch from high interest rates, coupled with Trump’s positive yet bold take on crypto, have made one thing certain: this cycle will be unlike any we’ve seen before. Every cycle has four stages: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. Even though the mechanism behind these stages is well-known, timing the market is one of the most sought-after skills. You try to predict when we enter a given stage to strategize your trades. However, even though cycles follow a predictable pattern, we must not forget the wider market context–and crypto has seen a lot in the past year. The growing presence of institutional investors in the Bitcoin market has reshaped its dynamics. Having taken 7th place as the biggest asset in the world, Bitcoin has become a new asset of choice for institutions, supported by the emergence and growth of crypto ETFs. Their increased involvement often brings greater price stability. Yet, for altcoins, it may not be good news. After all, fluctuations and big corrections redirect capital flow into altcoins. Less volatility means fewer returns that could circle back into the altcoin market. This year has been special. The launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs has brought a significant capital inflow from traditional finance onto the crypto market. Institutional inflows into these ETFs have triggered a Bitcoin supply shock, strengthening its dominance. The demand for Bitcoin caused by ETFs directly influences Bitcoin dominance, currently sitting at around 56%, a meaningful metric often overlooked by novice traders. It measures BTC's market share relative to altcoins, offering insights into whether we're in a Bitcoin season (BTC outperforms) or an altcoin season (altcoins outperform). What does a strong BTC dominance with a stable Bitcoin price mean? Altcoins dumping. And in this cycle, Bitcoin spot ETFs prolonged Bitcoin dominance. This new variable was absent in previous bull runs and will make the 2025 altcoin season undeniably unique. Bitcoin: The Cycle of Dominancce If you ask any financial executive about the most important financial metric, they’ll tell you it’s liquidity. In 2023 and 2024, the US interest rates hiked to one of the highest numbers in a long while. Even though it’s dropped from 5.25% a year ago to 4.19% now, it’s still a relatively attractive yield for a risk-free asset. On the other hand, cutting interest rates often fuels crypto bull runs for a very simple reason–they create a favorable environment for riskier assets to thrive. After all, risk-free government debt at a 0.11% yield, like in 2021, is as attractive as losing your capital due to inflation. Low rates equal cheaper borrowing and increased liquidity, which, in turn, pushes investors to park their money for higher returns. Where? Yes, you’ve guessed it. Crypto. The winning of Trump’s administration in the US has undoubtedly shaken the crypto world. The Bitcoin Act sparked a lively debate across the crypto and non-crypto circles. If passed, the Senate legislation would require the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to purchase 200,000 bitcoins annually within a period of five years to accumulate one million bitcoins. In other words–about 5% of the global supply. Needless to say, pro-crypto regulations are a very meaningful step for the widespread adoption of crypto assets, and Trump’s stance has proven to ignite a positive sentiment, with BTC hitting its ATH shortly after the future President confirmed his plans to create a BTC federal reserve. With BTC keeping its dominance, high interest rates, and pro-crypto regulations in the US, should we expect a full-blown altcoin supercycle in 2025? That’s a billion-dollar question. If history has taught us anything, it’s that altcoin pumps often follow major Bitcoin moves. Yet, estimating just how big those price movements will be - or exactly how long after Bitcoin’s new all-time highs altcoins will moon–is impossible. David Siemer, the CEO of Wave Digital Assets, says: “I don't think we'll see such a dramatic altcoin season as 2021 in the near future, meaning BTC dominance falling below 40%. But we will see a huge increase in altcoin values as BTC continues to rise.” Siemer then adds that “for alts to break out like 2021 relative to BTC, the use (adoption) and value (revenue capture) of altcoins needs to increase by many orders of magnitude”, emphasizing that it may happen in at least 3 years. But once it begins, altcoin season itself can be easily recognized because of some quite bullish signals: Cane Island Digital Research has shared in its “Proof of Altseason” findings about the seasonality of altcoin rallies, showing ETH as a proxy for altcoin to experience a bullish market. In addition, it mentions a repeated pattern of the January-May altseason period. Although the upcoming altcoin season may differ significantly from what we’re used to, certain sectors have secured their spots within the crypto space. After the $VIRTUAL token experienced a 24908.4% pump (that’s 249x), it’s safe to say that we’ve entered a new level of narrative dominance. While memecoins could outpace sectors like real-world assets or AI, AI agents are in a league of their own, often regarded as the driving force behind the next supercycle. Artificial Intelligence is still at the top of its game, and with the progress of AI agents, the onchain AI economy has garnered a big chunk of mindshare, hitting its peak at 50% in 2024, according to Kaito AI. This trend will likely follow in 2025, driven by the unprecedented demand for AI services. Institutional adoption, ignited by big names like BlackRock, has also impacted sectors like real-world assets, legitimizing tokenization as a fundamental component of the crypto world. While most of the attention is on AI and AI agents, traditional finance is exploring tokenization as a viable business option, with major banks like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs trying to disrupt the financial market. As we enter 2025, we must keep several things in mind before the altcoin season. First, Bitcoin dominance is your friend, so use it wisely to time your trades. Websites like BlockchainCenter.net can help you assess whether we’re in an altcoin or Bitcoin season. What’s important to keep in mind is: The crypto market is maturing. Each cycle is a stepping stone and should be considered a learning lesson. While memecoins are still harvesting their fruits, new narratives are becoming more and more influential. But here is the most interesting part–the narratives trending right now, like AI agents, are not just passing trends. To top it all off, we now face a greater impact from macros and institutional adoption than any previous bull run. Does it mean we should expect different altcoin dynamics this time around? To some extent. We shouldn’t blindly follow the pattern from previous years, either. The question isn’t whether altcoin season will happen—it’s when and how different it will be from previous years.

Title: Citigroup joins US lenders in exiting Net-Zero Banking Alliance

(Reuters) - U.S. banks Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Bank of America said on Tuesday they are exiting the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group of global banks that have pledged to curb greenhouse gas emissions. They follow Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Goldman Sachs, which both left the alliance earlier this month. Financial firms, historically criticized for their connections to the fossil fuel industry, have made efforts to incorporate net-zero standards more prominently into their operations. However, they have begun scaling back on some initiatives to avoid irking Republican policymakers who are opposed to limiting the financing of fossil fuels. Citi said it had made progress toward its own net-zero goals and decided to leave the NZBA. BofA, in an emailed statement to Reuters, said: "We will continue to work with clients on this issue and meet their needs." The NZBA aims to bring down carbon emissions from the lending and investment portfolios of its members to zero on a net basis by 2050. Last month, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) were sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states, which said the large asset managers violated antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and boosted energy prices.

BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF redefines the market, hitting $50B AUM while Bitcoin tops $100K. BlackRock Inc’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has set a new standard in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry. Launched in January 2024, the fund achieved $50 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 11 months. Meanwhile, this growth has made it the fastest-growing ETF of all time, surpassing records across all asset classes, according to Bloomberg. The iShares Bitcoin Trust has reached milestones at a pace no ETF has matched before. Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and technical strategy at Strategas Securities, noted that IBIT’s asset size now equals the combined AUM of over 50 long-established European ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, described IBIT’s launch as “the greatest in ETF history.” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart estimated that with its current AUM and a 0.25% expense ratio, the fund is projected to generate $112 million annually in revenue for BlackRock. The launch of IBIT also marked a major shift for Bitcoin. With BlackRock’s support, Bitcoin’s [BTC] price surged past $100,000 for the first time. The world’s largest asset manager, overseeing more than $11 trillion, brought institutional legitimacy to the cryptocurrency, attracting both traditional investors and individuals who had previously been cautious. The road to IBIT’s launch followed years of regulatory hurdles. Efforts to secure approval for a spot-Bitcoin ETF began as far back as 2013, with repeated rejections from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A breakthrough came in 2023 when Grayscale Investments won a federal court ruling overturning the SEC’s rejection of its Bitcoin trust conversion application. Soon after, BlackRock entered the scene, leveraging its regulatory expertise and reputation to gain approval in early 2024. IBIT has become a leader in the crowded Bitcoin ETF market, which now holds $107 billion in assets across 12 funds. BlackRock’s offering accounts for more than half of the daily trading volume among these funds. Since its launch, IBIT has experienced outflows on only nine days, reflecting consistent investor interest. The fund’s introduction of options trading on the 19th of November strengthened its appeal. Research firm Asym500 reported that IBIT’s Options have become some of the most traded among ETFs, with an average daily volume of $1.7 billion. Competing products, including those from Fidelity and Grayscale, trail far behind, averaging just 1% of IBIT’s volume. While BlackRock has embraced Bitcoin ETFs, its competitor Vanguard has stayed out of the space. Vanguard has also restricted trading of Bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform. Analysts suggest this could alienate younger investors who view cryptocurrency as a core asset class. Nate Geraci noted that this decision may give BlackRock a strategic edge, “Younger investors are increasingly including crypto in their portfolios, and BlackRock’s move positions it as a forward-thinking leader,” he said. As IBIT continues to grow, it has established itself as a defining player in the ongoing expansion of Bitcoin into mainstream financial markets.

US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed more than 1.1 billion BTC in holdings, and they now collectively hold more Bitcoin than Satoshi Nakamoto. According to X user Shaun Edmondson, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs trading on US exchanges hold 1,104,354 BTC after aggressive buying since their January launch. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF holds the most coins with 521,375 BTC, more than double the assets of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. BlackRock now ranks as the third-largest Bitcoin holder. Data from SoSoValue shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold $109 billion in assets, equivalent to 5.57% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. This week has boded well for spot Bitcoin ETFs, with the data so far showing that the weekly inflows are at the second-highest level since January. This comes after the products posted positive flows for six consecutive days. The total inflows to these products have already surpassed $2.35 billion so far this week. On December 5, inflows totaled $766M, with BlackRock’s IBIT posting $770M in inflows. These strong inflows coincided with a rally in BTC price above $100,000 to an all-time high of $103,670. Besides Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) ETFs have also recorded their best week since launch after total weekly inflows surpassed $752M. Spot ETH ETFs have been under pressure from persistent outflows from the Grayscale ETF. However, for the last nine days, these products have recorded positive netflows. Inflows to spot Ethereum ETFs also hit a record high of $428M on December 5, their highest level since their launch. These ETFs now hold $12.51 billion worth of Ether, equivalent to 2.71% of the altcoin’s market capitalization. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has opined that the performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially BlackRock’s IBIT, has broken previous records in the US ETF market. “$IBIT is now over $50b. It took it 228 days to reach this milestone, the next fastest ETF to reach 50b was $IEFA in 1,329 days. So over 5x faster than any ETF ever launched,” he stated. Balchunas further added that while he was not a Bitcoin maximalist, BTC was a “special asset” compared to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, at press time, traded at $93,787 after a 2% drop in 24 hours.

There’s little doubt that the industry has progressed this year. From regulatory clarity to a thriving startup culture, here are nine cities that helped shape the crypto landscape in 2024. 1.Berlin, Germany This year, Germany clarified tax rules for staking and lending, reducing uncertainty for retail and institutional investors. The city's collaborative culture, bolstered by events like the Berlin Blockchain Week, attracts developers and entrepreneurs alike. “Berlin is solidifying its place as Europe’s premier crypto hub for 2025,” Hannes Graah, founder of digital wallet Zeal,” told Decrypt. “With a deep-seated crypto culture and a vibrant developer community, the city is leading the charge in integrating blockchain into daily life.” The tax on crypto gains aligns with the regular income tax rate, which can be as high as 45%, plus an additional 5.5% Solidarity Tax. However, if a user holds their crypto for at least a year, then their gains are tax-free. 2.Singapore Singapore’s Monetary Authority (MAS) expanded its regulatory sandbox in 2024, creating new opportunities for fintech startups to explore tokenized assets, decentralized finance or DeFi, and other blockchain-based solutions in a controlled environment. This year, MAS also streamlined licensing processes and introduced clearer guidelines for digital payment token service providers, reducing entry barriers for companies. With its forward-thinking crypto framework and strategic location in Asia, Singapore remains a pivotal gateway for businesses targeting both Eastern and Western markets. “Singapore maintains a slight edge due to its established financial reputation and regulatory framework,” Danny Chong, co-founder of Tranchess, a yield and multi-chain staking protocol, told Decrypt. “Singapore’s complementary strengths can create a transformative economic zone for the crypto industry.” 3.Dubai, United Arab Emirates Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) issued comprehensive crypto guidelines in 2024, solidifying the region's position as a crypto powerhouse. Initiatives like the DMCC Crypto Center and zero-tax policies continue to attract global exchanges and venture capital. “Streamlined licensing processes and investments in high-profile events like Token2049 have attracted prominent virtual asset providers and financial institutions, cementing Dubai and Abu Dhabi as magnets for institutional investors seeking clear regulations and a supportive environment for digital asset innovation,” Brandon Truong, co-founder of layer-1 blockchain ZetaChain, told Decrypt. In October, Vara implemented a comprehensive framework covering marketing, consumer protection, prohibited activities, and international compliance for virtual assets, adding to existing frameworks implemented last year. That’s helped pull outside crypto firms in. 4.Tokyo, Japan In 2024, Japan doubled down on its efforts to balance innovation and consumer protection for crypto. In April, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) implemented tax reforms approved the year prior that eliminated levies on unrealized corporate gains for crypto holdings. The move effectively incentivizes institutional investments, harboring a friendlier environment for blockchain and crypto businesses. Tokyo continues to be a global hub for blockchain gaming and NFTs, thanks to its tech-forward infrastructure and regulatory clarity. The city’s vibrant startup ecosystem, combined with government support for Web3 innovation, has made it a hub for developers and entrepreneurs. 5.Sydney, Australia While regulations have been slow to develop in Australia—and even as Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock continues to thumb her nose at the industry—Sydney plays host to a vibrant crypto community. This year’s Aus Crypto Con, held at the International Conference Center, showcased a vast array of domestic and neighboring countries’ latest crypto innovations, as well as some old familiar ones. The Australian and Investment Commission is also exploring regulations for the near future that seek to define when and how crypto should be classified as financial products. Should it be implemented, the guidance would mark the first comprehensive policy geared specifically towards Australia’s budding crypto industry. Still, some lingering questions remain, and local industry leaders are pushing back over concerns about when crypto products, such as yield-bearing stablecoins and tokenized assets, should be considered financial products. 6.San Francisco, United States San Francisco's Silicon Valley continues to foster disruptive crypto projects despite a challenging U.S. regulatory environment. In 2024, venture funding for Web3 startups surged, particularly in decentralized social platforms. Notably, Bluesky Social, a decentralized social media company, secured a $15 million Series A investment in October to expand its user base and develop subscription models. The investment reflects renewed optimism about decentralized networks. Venture capitalists are increasingly backing projects that promote user autonomy and data privacy. 7.Miami, United States Miami continues to be a dynamic center for crypto entrepreneurs. In May 2024, the University of Miami hosted the 2nd Annual Business of Blockchain Technology Conference, which provided a platform for academics, professionals, and policymakers to discuss blockchain research and practices. While Mayor Francis Suarez has long been a proponent of blockchain innovation, no significant new initiatives aimed at broadening blockchain education were widely reported this year. However, the city organized events like WAGMI Miami, a major Web3 and blockchain conference that attracted thousands of participants, while the annual Art Basel convention again attracted a slew of crypto artists and creators to the city. Such events and others only reinforced Miami's status as a crypto hub and center of influence. 8.New York City, United States New York City strengthened its position as a blockchain hub in 2024 with tightened crypto regulations and industry advancements. The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) introduced stricter requirements for crypto firms, including enhanced coin-listing policies and updated customer service guidelines to improve consumer protections. In November, Circle, the issuer of USDC stablecoin, announced its move to New York ahead of a planned IPO. New York's balance between regulatory oversight and fostering blockchain innovation highlights the city’s growing appeal as Wall Street firms, including BlackRock, continue to move on the asset class. 9.Hong Kong Hong Kong is ramping up efforts to become a leading crypto and wealth management hub by proposing tax exemptions for cryptocurrency investment gains. The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau has suggested expanding capital gains tax exemptions to include crypto, overseas properties, and carbon credits, targeting sophisticated investors and private funds. The city is also tightening regulations on stablecoins, requiring issuers to hold reserves locally and establish a physical presence. These measures, combined with its existing tax breaks for family offices, aim to attract institutional capital and foster blockchain innovation. Hong Kong is positioning itself to compete as a major player in the global digital asset market.

Title: Is Exxon Mobil (XOM) the Best Dividend Stock of 2024?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxon-mobil-xom-best-dividend-190425978.html
Time Published: 2024-12-31T19:04:25Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 Dividend Stocks of 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other dividend stocks. Macroeconomic factors have weighed on US stocks in the final days of the year, with the broader market declining by over 1% in the past week. Despite this post-Christmas slowdown, US financial markets are on the verge of closing out another exceptional year. The broader market index is projected to post a roughly 25% gain for 2024, marking the first back-to-back annual increases of more than 20% since 1997-1998. This strong performance has been supported by positive economic indicators, including resilient consumer spending and a robust labor market. Inflation, though still elevated, has shown consistent signs of moderation. Improved economic data and easing inflation have also influenced the Federal Reserve’s policy shift this year. Anticipation of rate cuts contributed to market growth, with the central bank implementing its third rate reduction in 2024. Dividend stocks have had a relatively weak performance this year, with the Dividend Aristocrats Index achieving a modest return of about 4%, widening the gap between its performance and that of the broader market. The index tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. However, investors shouldn't lose confidence in these results, as the value of dividend stocks becomes more apparent over the long term. A report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that, since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns of US stocks. Additionally, from 1980 to 2019—a period marked by a sharp decline in interest rates—dividends contributed 75% to the market’s overall returns. Investors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks because dividend payments are generally viewed as a sign of long-term commitment. Maintaining these payments demands profitability, strong returns, and consistent cash flow generation, making them a valuable indicator of a company’s quality. Businesses that regularly raise their dividends showcase their ability to consistently generate profits, which can also signal greater resilience during economic or market downturns. According to research, companies within the broader market that pay dividends have historically been more profitable compared to those that do not. Reflecting investors' preference for dividend stocks, many US companies are increasing their payouts and implementing dividend policies. As of September 30, 2024, around 80% of companies in the Index paid dividends, a figure consistent with a decade ago. Notably, 24% of these dividend-paying companies now belong to the technology sector, a significant rise from 13% ten years earlier, as reported by Franklin Templeton. Other innovative industries, such as healthcare and industrials, have also seen growth in dividend payers. This broader adoption of dividends has expanded the range of options for equity income investors, offering greater access to dynamic and high-growth companies. For instance, major tech companies that are market leaders have recently introduced dividends. Meanwhile, established tech giants demonstrate that dividend payments can coexist with innovation and reinvestment, proving that companies can excel at both. For this list, we reviewed a selection of dividend stocks and identified those that have provided positive returns in 2024. From this group, we focused on companies offering yields above 2% as of December 30. We then narrowed down the list by selecting companies with the most hedge fund investments, based on Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Aerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is an American multinational energy company. It described its Q3 performance as "industry-leading" and intends to keep investing in 2025 to sustain that position, while also continuing to buy back its stock to reward shareholders. For 2025, the company plans to increase capital investments to between $27 billion and $29 billion, alongside an additional $20 billion for share repurchases, which will reduce the number of shares in circulation, benefiting shareholders. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) reported revenue of $90.02 billion in Q3 2024, exceeding analysts’ expectations by $1.66 billion. It remains a leader in carbon capture and storage, having secured a new agreement that increases its annual CO2 offtake commitments to 6.7 million metric tons, surpassing all its competitors in the sector. Exxon also demonstrated strong financial performance, generating $17.6 billion in operating cash flow and $11.3 billion in free cash flow for the quarter. Additionally, it returned $9.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is renowned for its reliability as a dividend payer, having increased its payouts for 42 consecutive years. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.74%, as of December 30. At the end of Q3 2024, 86 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database held stakes in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), compared with 92 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is roughly $7 billion. First Eagle Investment Management was one of the company’s leading stakeholders. Overall XOM ranks 3rd on our list of the best dividend stocks of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin more than doubles in 2024 on spot ETF approval, Trump euphoria

Business FILE PHOTO: Representation of the bitcoin cryptocurrency and a price chart are seen in this illustration taken October 24, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Bitcoin more than doubled in 2024 driven by the U.S. markets regulator's approval for exchange-traded funds tied to its spot price, and optimism over easing regulatory hurdles with Donald Trump set to return to the White House. The world's largest and most well-known cryptocurrency hit $100,000 earlier this month, a milestone that has ignited 'animal spirits' among supporters of the once-nascent asset class. A more than 120 per cent surge in bitcoin this year and a nearly 50 per cent jump in ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, have propelled the sector's market value to roughly $3.5 trillion, according to CoinGecko data. More gains are in store for 2025, according to analysts. "We remain convinced $100,000 is not the final milestone. We expect Bitcoin to hit a cycle-high of $200,000 in late 2025," analysts at brokerage Bernstein wrote in a client note earlier this month. MicroStrategy, a software firm that has become the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin, has seen its shares surge nearly five-fold in 2024. The stock, which joined the benchmark Nasdaq-100 index recently, is now seen as a proxy for bitcoin, with its movement closely tied to sentiment towards the digital asset. Several smaller companies are following its playbook and allocating portions of their cash to bitcoin. "We expect bitcoin to emerge as the new-age premier 'store of value' asset eventually replacing gold over the next decade and becoming a permanent part of institutional multi-asset allocation and a standard for corporate treasury management," the Bernstein note said. Much of the optimism began in January when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first ETFs to track the spot price of bitcoin, marking a watershed moment for the broader crypto industry. The move gave the sector institutional legitimacy and improved its mainstream appeal as traditional finance heavyweights including BlackRock and Fidelity launched the products. The victory of Trump, who has promised to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet," further bolstered the industry's position later this year. Crypto advocates donated millions during the election, hoping to elect candidates that favor the sector. Most crypto stocks have also benefited from the industry-wide rally. The big winners of 2024 are MicroStrategy, crypto exchange Coinbase and bitcoin miner Hut 8 On the other hand, several other crypto miners have reeled under shrinking margins due to higher energy and hardware costs, missing the year's rally. Shares of Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital and Bit Digital lost between 26 per cent and 32 per cent this year.

Title: Jim Cramer’s Take on NVIDIA (NVDA): The King of AI GPUs Under Pressure
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-nvidia-nvda-king-181657526.html
Time Published: 2024-12-31T18:16:57Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 9 Semiconductor Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted. As 2024 comes to a close, the semiconductor industry has seen its fair share of fireworks. While firms like Wall Street’s favorite AI GPU stock are the ones that have caught investor attention, not all chip stocks have performed well. Just like the economy, where firms exposed to AI-driven data center spending have performed well, semiconductor stocks that are geared towards AI have also seen their fortunes soar while others haven’t been so lucky. As an example, consider the stock price performance of two of the most well-known semiconductor stocks in the world. The first ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks while the second ranks 12th. The first stock is the GPU stock we mentioned above while the second is the world’s largest integrated chip manufacturer. An integrated chip manufacturer, for those out of the loop, is a firm capable of designing and manufacturing its chips. Looking at their share price performance, the first stock has gained 184% year-to-date while the second is down by 57.5% over the same time period. So why does their performance lie on the opposite ends of the spectrum? Well, the first company has sustained investor optimism because its products are market leaders in terms of computing AI workloads. Even so, while the shares are up by 184%, they had already gained 173% by mid-October. Since then, the stock has added just 4% as Wall Street is in wait-and-watch mode regarding the demand for AI services among businesses and users and the GPU supply chain of the company. However, while the GPU maker hasn’t impressed in terms of returns in the final quarter, the integrated chip manufacturer has stunned with its fall from grace. From the start of the year to July-end, its shares had lost 36%. While that was bad on its own, the firm’s second-quarter earnings report led to nothing but a bloodbath. It caused a whopping 34.6% share price drop over the next couple of days. So what happened? Well, starting from the financial figures, its Q2 earnings per share of two cents fell way short of consensus analyst estimates of $10 cents. The revenue wasn’t great either, as while the firm earned $12.83 in the second quarter, analysts had expected it to bring in $12.94 billion. But an earnings and revenue miss rarely wipes a third of a stock’s value. Along with the dismal financial results, the firm also revealed that not only would it cut 15% of its workforce, but it would also stop paying a dividend in Q4. Naturally, investors weren’t impressed and they weren’t optimistic about the firm’s future trajectory either. Since the earnings, the stock is up by 2.5% though as its CEO’s sudden exit and whispers of a divestiture of the costly chip manufacturing business to ease costs seemed to have piqued investor attention. The start of December has also seen another interesting, albeit long-term, development for the semiconductor industry. The semiconductors, or chips, that currently power our computers and phones rely on classical computing which uses bits for computing. Quantum computing, on the other hand, expands the processing power significantly over classical computing by relying on qubits instead. In December, Google revealed its Willow quantum computing chip which it claims is capable of processing a problem that would take a classical supercomputer 10 septillion years in less than five minutes. More importantly, Google claimed to have manufactured the chip itself – a development that broadens the number of companies capable of manufacturing advanced processors. The announcement injected fresh life into quantum computing stocks which have gained as much as 281% since Willow was revealed. This is despite the fact that no semiconductor foundry is capable of manufacturing quantum computing chips at scale. And why would they? After all, the use cases for quantum computers are limited as well, as opposed to the billions of chips used in personal computing applications. For his part, Cramer isn’t a fan of quantum computing either. Commenting on the negative share price movements following the Federal Reserve’s well-televised conference earlier this month, he likened the sentiment in quantum computing to a hype bubble. The market won’t recover quickly according to Cramer as “rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing” pushed stocks higher than their fundamentals would justify. Further commenting on the industry, he stated: “How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is? It’s a nonfungible token, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” To compile our list of Jim Cramer’s bold predictions about semiconductor stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out semiconductor stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-20-24 Performance Since Then: 7.73% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world’s leading AI GPU designer. Since OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT, the firm’s shares have gained more than 700%. Yet, since their July peak, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares have added just 1.62% as investors wait to see how its Blackwell GPUs perform and whether any rivals pop up. The stock has also been hit with speculation of rivals stealing NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s AI GPU market share due to supply constraints and high prices. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock dipped by 3% in December after Broadcom shared that it can earn as much as $90 billion in AI revenue by 2027. Here’s what Cramer said about the firm in August: “I almost feel like you can guess it—it’s Nvidia. It’s the king, and the rest of the market is made up of its pawns, marching to Nvidia’s drum. Remember this morning when I was on the call and said, “Look, Nvidia is almost too important. There’s too much pressure on Nvidia—can it sustain it? I don’t want Nvidia to be Samson. Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 11 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Array Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY) stands against the other best renewable energy stocks to buy now. The future of President Joe Biden’s landmark climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) plays a significant role in promoting renewable energy by offering a wide range of tax incentives and funding mechanisms to encourage investment in clean energy technologies, including solar, wind, and geothermal power, hangs in the balance as the incoming Republican-controlled White House, Senate, and House of Representatives prepare to take office in 2025. However, an area of concern is the future of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), which provides financing for green energy projects. The LPO has been instrumental in funding large-scale renewable energy projects and it expanded significantly under the IRA. However, Trump’s appointees, particularly Wright, who has expressed skepticism about the climate crisis, may be inclined to scale back or dismantle this program entirely, which could have a significant impact on the green energy sector. READ ALSO: 12 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 12 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In Now. In an interview with Bloomberg on December 23, Tom Steyer, Co-Founder of Galvanize Climate Solutions, a climate-focused global investment firm, discussed the role of renewable energy in the United States. Steyer emphasized that while the year 2025 is often discussed in the context of climate regulations, it is more accurately about meeting the growing energy demand. He argued that renewable energy should be at the center of any energy bill, regardless of political persuasion. Steyer highlighted that market costs are the primary drivers of the energy transition to renewables. He cited the fact that in 2023, 86% of new electricity generation was predominantly from renewable sources, driven by economic rather than purely environmental considerations. Steyer pointed out that the phrase “drill, baby, drill” might still be part of the political conversation, but the cost differential between renewable and fossil fuels drives the reality. He noted that renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels and are becoming increasingly cost-effective. For instance, the cost of natural gas in the U.S. has risen to nearly double its previous levels, while in Europe, it is even higher. However, the cheapest electricity is increasingly coming from renewable sources, both in the U.S. and globally. This economic reality is driving business decisions, international competitiveness, and national security by industries such as tech, that require large amounts of electricity and are increasingly turning to renewables to meet their energy needs. When asked about the potential impact of deregulation in the energy sector, Steyer suggested that deregulation could help accelerate the adoption of renewables if it includes faster permitting and lower oversight for all energy projects, including renewables. He noted that the Trump administration’s push for faster permits and reduced oversight for oil and gas drilling could extended to renewables, and will lead to a significant expansion of low-cost, abundant renewable energy. Regarding nuclear energy, Steyer acknowledged its potential but noted the challenges associated with cost, safety, and public perception. He pointed out that nuclear energy has historically been expensive, with the last nuclear plant in Georgia costing at least four times its original estimate. While nuclear energy could provide a stable baseload power source, the high costs and safety concerns have made it a less attractive option compared to renewables. As the United States enters 2025, the future of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) remains uncertain under a Republican government. However, the cost-effectiveness of renewable energy compared to fossil fuels makes it increasingly dominant in the global energy mix.

Dividend stocks are currently in focus as Wall Street analysts expect them to rebound in 2025 amid changing market preferences. Bank of America analyst Ohsung Kwon expects dividends from S&P 500 companies to increase by 10% in 2025. But which dividend stocks are safe and reliable for long-term investors? Let's turn to a case study for ideas. Earlier this month, a dividend investor shared his income report and milestone on r/Dividends – a discussion board for income investors with more than 644,000 members. He said his average monthly dividend income this year was $1,000. Don't Miss: Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100 for properties like the Byer House from Stranger Things. The investor said this income was about 30% more than last year. The investor’s portfolio screenshots showed that his average monthly dividend income was around $978 or $11,742 per year. "I'm quite happy with that!" he added. The 35-year-old investor said his portfolio’s current value was $485,000. He also shared screenshots of his portfolio holdings. Let's take a look at some of his biggest positions. Broadcom Number of Shares: 220 According to the portfolio screenshots he shared, the investor had 220 shares of Broadcom (AVGO), one of his biggest positions. Over the past year, AVGO shares have gained about 113%. Fidelity UCITS SICAV – Fidelity U.S. Equity Income Fund Number of Shares: 4,092 Fidelity U.S. Quality Income UCITS ETF Inc USD (FUSD) was the second-biggest position in the investor’s portfolio in terms of dollar value. Over the past 12 months, the fund has been up 16%. See Also: Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. Microsoft Number of Shares: 91 Microsoft (MSFT) was another low-yield technology dividend stock in the portfolio that generated about $1,000 per month. In a note, Stifel recently said Microsoft is poised for growth in 2025 due to AI monetization. The firm lifted its price target on MSFT to $525 from $500. Arbor Realty Trust Number of Shares: 2,731 New York-based mortgage REIT Arbor Realty Trust (ABR) has a dividend yield of just over 12%, according to Benzinga Pro. Last month, the company posted third-quarter earnings that came in ahead of Wall Street estimates. British American Tobacco p.l.c. Number of Shares: 932 British American Tobacco plc (BATS) was another high-yield dividend stock in the portfolio. The company has been paying dividends since 1984. Oracle Corporation Number of Shares: 160 Oracle (ORCL) shares were up 62% in 2024 through December 28. However, Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. recently downgraded the stock to Sell from Neutral with a $130 price target, citing valuation concerns. Trending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! JPMorgan Chase Number of Shares: 106 The investor, who earned about $1,000 per month in dividends, had 106 shares of JPMorgan in his portfolio. The bank has raised its dividend every year since 2009. Realty Income Corporation Number of Shares: 420 Realty Income (O), one of the most famous monthly dividend stocks among Redditors, was also a part of the portfolio as the investor had 420 shares of the REIT. Realty Income raised its dividend by 0.2% earlier in December. BlackRock Number of Shares: 19 The investor had 19 shares of Blackrock (BLK) in his portfolio. Earlier this month, Citi said in a note that BlackRock was one of the best asset managers heading into 2025. The firm has a Buy rating on the stock. Altria Group Number of Shares: 358 Tobacco giant Altria (MO) was recently upgraded to Buy from Neutral. Analysts believe the company will benefit under the upcoming Republican administration due to lower corporate taxes, tariffs and strong border controls. Its price target was increased to $65. According to Benzinga Pro, Altria has a dividend yield of 7.8%. Wondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg? Speak to a financial advisor today.

Title: A standoff between BlackRock and the FDIC is dragging into 2025

A clash between BlackRock (BLK) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) over the money manager’s holdings of US banks will now play out in the waning days of President Joe Biden’s administration. The FDIC has asked BlackRock to sign by Jan. 10 a "passivity agreement" that would codify greater checks on the money manager’s holdings of FDIC-supervised lenders, according to people familiar with the matter, pushing back a deadline that was previously Dec. 31 of this year. The agreement FDIC has asked BlackRock to sign is similar to one announced last week with another giant money manager, Vanguard Group, that imposes new compliance requirements when the manager amasses more than 10% of all outstanding stock in an FDIC-supervised bank. BlackRock spent much of 2024 resisting the FDIC’s push for greater oversight, denying that the asset manager exerts undue control over companies through its investment stewardship activities. As recently as December, the giant Wall Street firm proposed an arrangement with the FDIC that didn't include the same level of oversight agreed to by Vanguard. The FDIC did not respond to BlackRock's proposal until announcing its Vanguard settlement, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The tug of war between BlackRock and FDIC is the latest example of rising D.C. scrutiny of BlackRock, which oversees $11 trillion in assets. For years, the financial giant has been a target of GOP attacks about "woke" investing. Republicans have raised concerns about whether BlackRock’s massive holdings in US corporations force companies to adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. And Democrats have for years also been leery about whether the heft of BlackRock could pose risks to the financial system. The "passivity" agreement FDIC wants BlackRock to sign is designed to assure bank regulators that the giant money manager will remain a "passive" owner of an FDIC-supervised bank and won’t exert control over a bank’s board. Currently, BlackRock only has such an agreement with the Federal Reserve. Now the FDIC wants its own agreement with the money manager, which is also permitted under law. In July, FDIC board member Rohit Chopra described the FDIC's lack of oversight of passive asset manager stakes as "highly inappropriate" and a shirking of "the responsibility Congress entrusted to us." "Certain sectors of our economy are critical infrastructure for our country," added Chopra, who is also the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. "We don’t let just anyone own a nuclear power plant or operate a bridge." BlackRock has been public about its viewpoint that such additional oversight is unfounded and ultimately detrimental. Its head of regulatory affairs, Benjamin Tecmire, told the FDIC the increased oversight would duplicate what the Fed already does, according to an October letter to the agency. Tecmire said such duplication would make it more difficult for BlackRock fund investors to invest in banks, thereby harming investors, crimping banks' access to equity, and slowing capital flow across the US economy. The FDIC inquired about BlackRock’s stake in 39 bank holding companies where it held a more than 10% position. Since taking those positions, BlackRock said it voted on just two of a total of 1,304 occasions against what management recommended. BlackRock also engaged with 12 of those lenders 19 times in the past three years “and most of these engagements were initiated by the banking institutions themselves, not BlackRock,” Tecimire told the FDIC. If BlackRock doesn't agree by Jan. 10 to the same level of scrutiny approved by Vanguard, the FDIC can take other options, according to another person familiar with the situation. Those options range from further extending the deadline to sending BlackRock a formal inquiry or even a subpoena for more information on selective communications between its stewardship team and the executives of US banks. It is not known how the Trump administration may decide to handle the BlackRock situation if it is not resolved by Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. One Republican member of the FDIC board appointed by Biden, Jonathan McKernan, called the agreement signed last week with Vanguard "a good step in the right direction," saying in a statement it addressed concerns he had raised about FDIC monitoring of “the purported passivity of the largest index fund complexes.” "Those concerns have some urgency given the rapid growth of these index fund complexes and the growing body of academic work and other evidence raising doubt about whether these index fund complexes are truly passive."

Title: AI And The Municipal Bond Market: Algorithmic Trading And Predictions
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2024/12/31/ai-and-the-municipal-bond-market-algorithmic-trading-and-predictions/
Time Published: 2024-12-31T14:40:29Z
Full Content:
Computational Finance The term algorithmic trading is tossed around a lot these days. But what does it mean? Let’s break it down into its components. It’s not that defining an algorithm is all that complex. If anything, it is very simple. An algorithm is a set of instructions enabling a computer program to put together different sources of information [data] and generate a result. If you’re talking algorithms, you’re also talking AI and data. Both are equally straightforward. At its core AI is simply a way to organize, analyze, and apply data for an outcome. Data is anything that is or can be digitized and tagged with a number. And anything—photographs, text, speech—can be digitized and numerically tagged. Outcomes can be as basic as determining the mean of a data set or as complex as the predictive analytics needed for a self-driving car. Analyzing outcomes and then refining and adjusting the program and data inputs for a better outcome is what machine learning or deep learning are all about. As for trading, it's a safe assumption that if you are reading a Forbes.com investment column, you know that it means buying and selling bonds, stocks, options, and other financial instruments. Fun Fact! Algorithm is an eponym derived from the last name of Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, a ... [+] Persian mathematical genius who lived around AD780. So how does all this come together as algorithmic trading? James Pruskowski, Chief Investment Officer & Co-Founder at 16Rock Asset Management offered a general example. Integrating AI and algorithms, the firm’s municipal bond trading models regularly monitor market data—inputs like trades, volume, spreads, bid wanteds, request for quotes. One model is programmed to seek out arbitrage opportunities based on pricing anomalies discerned by analyzing market data. With regularly updated buy and sell parameters, the computer bids/buys and asks/sells. A fully automated process, all of this can happen in a few seconds. The new trade data gets uploaded, is analyzed, and the model is updated to determine what the best opportunities might be given the new information. And the cycle continues. Noting AI and algorithmic trading are liquifying the municipal odd lot market (an odd lot trade is comprised of a $100,000 par or less block of bonds), James also observed that separately managed account (SMA) asset growth as well as municipal ETFs were compelling many market participants to be price takers. Be it a Financial Advisor or ETF fund manager, when faced with a pressing need to invest or sell, operational complexities force both—and their executing traders at large retail wire houses—to be price takers. These prices tend to reflect the higher yielding asking price versus the lower yielding bid price. Correspondingly, levels on market benchmark curves (such as the ICE US Municipal AAA Curve) derived from these trades reflect these price takers’ lower price, higher yielding trades. This is how, in his view, price takers define the opportunity set in today’s market. USA, New York, New York City, Trading desk with computers and phones Josh Rosenblum, Head of Algorithmic Trading at Brownstone Investment Group (he was formerly head of Municipal Trading Strategies at the firm), offered a different take. Combine the billions of assets under management held by mutual funds and SMA advisors with electronic trading platforms, he sees buy side firms moving from price takers to price makers. Moreover, with those platforms buy side firms could trade with each other directly. The relationship between broker and the client is evolving into more of a partnership to develop mutually beneficial workflows. He has seen evidence of tighter spreads in the odd lot market due to algorithmic trading, also noting that AI-generated predictive pricing analytics creates a self-fulfilling pricing prophecy. If the model says the next trade on bond has a high probability to be valued at a certain amount, the maximum buy or sell price an investor would be willing take is going to be at that price or within a hair’s-breadth from it. Prediction is driving reality. Moreover, the counterparty “investor” is increasingly likely to be another AI-driven model. While a positive implication of this may be more market liquidity, computer and model dependence has its own pitfalls. While speaking independently, James and Josh concurred that AI, electronic trading platforms, and algorithmic trading is creating a technological arms race. If you’re not the lead, you’re falling behind, which is accelerating technological adoption because absolutely no one wants to be left behind. This is particularly true when it comes to execution speeds. If you aren’t trading faster than your worthy competitor, you weren’t going to get bonds. No bonds, no performance. No performance, no investors. Pretty simple. Buy Now Button and Cursor. Vector Stock Illustration It isn’t just proprietary funds using algorithmic trading. For broker dealers who want to stay active in the municipal bond market, it’s a classic build-or-buy decision. Perhaps first out of the box was Toronto-Dominion Bank’s (NYSE-TD) acquisition of Headland Tech Holdings, LLC in 2021. Barely a year later, Raymond James (NYSE-RJF) bought SumRidge Partners, LLC in the firm’s ongoing strategy applying technology as the backbone to build out their trading business. Larger broker dealers and asset management firms such as Goldman Sachs and Blackrock, respectively, have generally pursued internal builds to remain competitive, although hiring top software engineers to do so might be interpreted as a form of buying. Then again, at least one bracket firm has thrown in the muni towel: Citigroup exited the municipal bond business in 2023. Bond Talk Given its direct market impacts, the market’s focus on algorithmic trading is understandable and justifiable. But there is another algorithm-based technology that might prove equally impactful on the market. ChatGPT is based on an algorithm, specifically a type of machine learning model called a language model. More precisely, it is built on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, which is a deep learning model designed to understand and generate human-like text. It is not a single algorithm but a complex system involving many components. The overall process can be described as an algorithm that uses machine learning to generate responses based on patterns in the data it has seen. In fact, that entire prior paragraph was written by ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a fascinating technology. From planning a Caribbean cruise to generating Python code to the latest procedures in hip replacement surgery, just about anything you can imagine is available at your fingertips. Enter a question and, in a few seconds, ChatGPT replies with an answer. But interactive technology goes beyond typing in text for a response, as anyone who has talked to Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa can attest. Flipping that around, Speechify can turn anything into audio—text, pdf, email—and read it to you in high quality digital voices, including Snoop Dogg or Gwyneth Paltrow. In fact, Forbes.com offers an audio of this article for your listening pleasure. (No, it is not my voice.) Prefer video? Pictory offers text to video, URL to video, PPT to video, and several other to-video abilities. You can copy-paste this entire article into Pictory to see how the technology transforms my jottings into a Hollywood-esque video. (Again, no, I am not featured in it. Sigh. I really need a new agent.) In short, the abilities of interactivity are boundless. If you can imagine it, it can be done with AI in any communications medium. Chat bot concept with 3d rendering humanoid robot with headset That includes talking to municipal bonds. If you are wondering why you would want to talk to your bonds, ask Robert Kane and Saul Tessler of Munibonds.ai. Founded in 2024, the firm has an AI chat function where you enter a question on a bond and the app generates a very thorough response. This user driven input functionality is far more robust than the limited, predetermined drop-down menu list. If it has been disclosed, from the Preliminary Official Statement to the most recent quarterly financials, the app finds the data and generates an answer. It’s as close to making the municipal bond market’s PDF-laden disclosure documents into something machine readable as technology will allow. For now. Munibonds.ai is more than just an interactive search function. Tracking both user queries and other external market data, the firm offers market sentiment analysis on any bond. Or a portfolio of bonds. Or a bid-wanted list. You get the idea. It also offers a numerical “bond ranking”. While short of a credit rating, with the right user prompts, the report generated by the chat technology—including some fundamental analysis—is pretty close to a standard credit rating report. Creating the customized need parameters and automating that function, everyone from portfolio managers, traders, analysts, to compliance officers can have credit, structure, use of proceeds, market sentiment, and any other decision-making or reporting information on any bond or portfolio of bonds in nearly real time at any time. All they have to do is ask. Predicting the Future Imagine a perfect Laplace AI model. Possessing complete knowledge of every piece of data in the universe, past and present, to achieve a state of omniscience, it could predict the future with perfect accuracy. Whether or not the result would be an angel or a demon is up for debate, but read enough about AI and one comes away with the sense this is the ultimate state those developing and applying AI would like to achieve. It's impossible, of course. But for the municipal bond market, even if knowledge gleaned from AI leads to asymptotic results, it’s a far better result than what exists now. So here are the top AI predictions as to what the municipal bond market can expect going forward. 1. The rate of technological advancement and adoption across the market is going to accelerate. 2. Any market processes that can be automated will be. 3. From broker dealers to investment advisors to trading platforms, there will be further market consolidation. 4. The market will become far less opaque and fragmented. 5. A primary market electronic shelf-financing mechanism will develop for municipal bond issuers. 6. The market will adopt standardized, digital official statements, a consistent reporting taxonomy using an XBRL format, and ongoing disclosures will be in a machine readable or similarly algorithmically accessible format. 7. The pricing differential due to the current structural imbalance between odd-lot trade and institutional trade valuation will dissipate. 8.
