By Isla Binnie and Ross Kerber NEW YORK / BOSTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. asset managers worried that signing up to an industry climate initiative could make them appear to be working too closely together and draw regulatory scrutiny, according to a report released Friday by a Republican-led U.S. Congressional Committee. The report is the latest released by the panel's Republican majority as part of a probe they say has shown fund firms and activists are part of a "climate cartel" that colludes through shareholder organizations pressing to cut emissions. The committee's Democrats have dismissed those allegations. Top fund firms have denied wrongdoing, but material cited in the report shows they had always been concerned about appearing too cozy with shareholder groups engaged in climate activism. BlackRock's view in 2019 was that "We don't do collective action/engagements. Too risky," according to the report, citing an e-mailed summary of a meeting that unidentified BlackRock executives held with Ceres, a Boston-based environmental advocacy group, obtained by the committee. Likewise State Street also raised concerns around 2020 about "collusion" if it joined a Ceres-backed effort to press companies to cut emissions known as the Climate Action 100+, according to the report. The firm worried about raising the "perception of engaging or voting as a block," the report states. BlackRock declined to comment. State Street and Ceres did not immediately comment. Both wound up joining the group known as the CA100+, then stepped back earlier this year citing independence concerns. Republican officials, many of them from oil and gas producing states, have objected to investors coordinating to pressure corporate management on climate issues at the expense of corporate growth and returns. Last month Republican attorneys general from 11 states sued BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, saying their climate activism reduced coal production and boosted energy prices. The firms collectively manage $26 trillion. BlackRock and State Street have denied wrongdoing, while Vanguard has declined to comment on the matter. U.S. president-elect Donald Trump campaigned against President Joe Biden's moves to fight climate change and promised to boost U.S. oil and gas production. In theory Trump's administration could follow up on the congressional committee's findings. A spokesperson for the committee declined to comment on what if any talks it may have had with current or future administrations.

BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF—the iShares Ethereum Trust—capped off a 16-day streak of net inflows with a $200 million bump Thursday, pulling in $1.5 billion since November 20, according to CoinGlass. Prior to that, the ETF had seen $1.7 billion in net inflows since its July debut, encompassing 84 trading days. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been crowned a blowout success this year, attracting billions upon billions of dollars worth of inflows since launching in January. Though the products have helped turn Bitcoin into a Wall Street darling, the industry’s second largest coin by market cap hasn’t had the same run, though spot Ethereum ETFs saw a burst of post-election momentum, Still, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) recently notched record-setting inflows, pulling in $293 million as Ethereum’s price dipped to $3,800 on December 5. The following day, Ethereum’s price marched past $4,000, eclipsing the psychological mark for the first time since March. The uptick in flows for the iShares Ethereum ETF coincided with commentary from Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs. On Thursday, he said BlackRock is at the “tip of the iceberg” with its Bitcoin and Ethereum products, focusing on those offerings instead of expanding its roster, per Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. While BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF is dominant in the U.S., similar products are seeing renewed attention worldwide, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill told Decrypt. Since November 20, investors have poured $3.5 billion into Ethereum investment products, he said. “It’s not just a BlackRock or iShares thing,” Butterfill said. “We’re seeing quite a unanimous turnaround in sentiment for Ethereum, which has really been suffering.” Notably, the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) saw its best day of net inflows Thursday as investors stuffed $200 million into the product, according to Coinglass. Indeed, the conversation surrounding Ethereum has been mired in debate over whether layer-2 networks, which are faster and cheaper to use than Ethereum’s base layer, are sucking value away from their underlying network. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s price hasn’t cracked its all-time high price of $4,800 in 2021, as competitors like Solana have set surged to record prices. “Ethereum is the underdog this year,” said Butterfill. “It’s playing a bit of catch-up.” Pointing to three consecutive weeks of outflows from Solana investment products, Butterfill said investors’ enthusiasm might have cooled. Still, asset managers like Bitwise and 21Shares have filed applications for spot Solana ETFs in the U.S. this year, a move that could eventually broaden investors’ access to the coin in a similar fashion to Bitcoin and Ethereum. BRN analyst Valentin Fournier attributed $273 million worth of inflows for spot Ethereum ETFs to the president-elect's comments Thursday. Ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, Donald Trump said “We’re gonna do something great with crypto.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Cardano Founder Hoskinson Reveals Plans For 2025
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-hoskinson-plans-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-13T17:00:04Z
Full Content:
In his latest livestream , Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano (ADA) and CEO of Input Output Global (IOG), laid out a vision for the blockchain network’s governance, institutional structures, and strategic milestones leading into 2025. Over the course of a lengthy and candid address, Hoskinson wove together Cardano’s past governance efforts, current institutional frictions, and forthcoming priorities, repeatedly underscoring the imperative of decentralization, open participation, and active global engagement. Hoskinson opened by reflecting on the Constitutional Convention that recently concluded—a multi-year endeavor designed to forge a new governance framework for Cardano. “As many of you saw from the output of the Constitutional Convention, that was the culmination of two years of effort around the world,” he said. This global process encompassed “hundreds of workshops, thousands of people in more than 50 countries,” culminating in a draft constitution approved by 95% of the 50 elected delegates and their alternates. He highlighted the truly international nature of this initiative, stating: “These people come from different parts of the world: Africa, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe, and North America—all six continents. We tried to find someone from Antarctica, but we just couldn’t send the short notice.” For Hoskinson, seeing the ecosystem converge on a unified document, however imperfect, was “one of the proudest moments of my professional career.” Looking ahead to 2025, Hoskinson underscored the challenges that remain. Cardano’s next milestone involves realizing true decentralized governance. “We have some challenges, and those challenges are going to be that we have to fully decentralize the governance of Cardano,” he said. The tension lies between Hoskinson’s vision of “members-based institutions and on-chain governance” and voices advocating for a more protracted transition period under controlled institutions. He stressed: “Others feel that there needs to be a longer transition period and there needs to be institutions […] that are not subject to the democratic whims and will of the ecosystem.” By contrast, Hoskinson has long stood for a system built from the ground up. He made clear his foundational principle: “I always believed that the key is to build members-based institutions and on-chain governance, get them working well together, and make sure that all of the roles of significance are elected and constrain them by the rule of law—algorithmic law first and foremost […] because that is the strongest—and constitutional law second.” Rewinding to Cardano’s origins, Hoskinson took responsibility for certain structural shortcomings in governance. “All of the governance failures that we see today are indirectly or directly my fault,” he admitted, acknowledging that initial designs—like the early tripartite arrangement among IOG, Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation—were conceived before the full complexity of governance was fully understood. “I was young and I didn’t fully appreciate or understand how complicated and serpentine and…difficult governance can be.” Still, the founder underscored Cardano’s enduring technical achievements: “We aggregated one of the largest groups of scientists, formal methods engineers, and software engineers in the history of our industry. We’ve written hundreds of papers, we’ve written millions of lines of code, and we’ve built something that truly stands the test of time.” Over seven years, Cardano has run continuously “under constant attack, technological and social,” proving its resilience and capacity for long-term stability. Overall, Hoskinson outlined three clear governance priorities for 2025. The first one is the on-chain ratification of the constitution. The community-ratified constitution must be integrated into Cardano’s onchain governance framework. “We have to get the Constitution ratified on-chain. That’s the first one,” he said. Second comes the transition to an annual budget process. With a large treasury at its disposal—“nearly two billion dollars”—Cardano can move beyond ad hoc funding (e.g., Project Catalyst) to a stable, annual budgeting model. “All we got to do is […] make sure no one’s left behind,” Hoskinson explained, “so many of you are working for free right now […] we need to get to an annual budget process.” Third is the election of the Constitutional Committee. The current constitutional committee is interim and will be replaced in 2025 by community-elected officials. “I’ve already said that Input Output will not run for election,” he stated, ensuring no single founding entity can dominate the process. The ultimate goal: “It’s important that the community be able to step up and flex its muscles and be in complete control.” Hoskinson also emphasized the importance of engaging with global crypto industry stakeholders and regulators. “I’m going to have to work with industry as a whole,” he said, mentioning outreach to figures like Brad Garlinghouse from Ripple and noting that he was “fully prepared and willing to work with pretty much anyone […] I don’t really care what they said and did in the past.” He highlighted the geopolitical realities shaping crypto policy, noting that entities like a16z, Coinbase, ConsenSys, and BlackRock “are going to have an enormous amount of influence over crypto policy.” Hoskinson’s stance: Cardano must ensure it is not “excluded” and must seek partnerships where possible. “If they choose to exclude Cardano, it’s going to be very difficult for us as an ecosystem,” he warned. A unique aspect of Cardano’s governance efforts has been direct community participation through workshops. “We should run five workshop streams every single year across the world and grow from 50 to 100 countries,” he proposed. This global dialogue, costing perhaps “5 to 10 million per year,” would be well within the network’s means. “When we have a nearly $2 billion treasury […] maybe just maybe we as an ecosystem could find the resources to do that.” Hoskinson did not shy away from predicting turbulence in the coming year. “2025 is going to have drama, it’s going to have chaos, it’s going to have problems,” he said. Yet he maintained optimism that through debate, inclusion, and democratic processes, Cardano will achieve lasting decentralization and influence. “We are this close to greatness,” Hoskinson insisted. With CIP-1694’s full activation, the introduction of delegation representatives (DReps), and a large treasury to fuel innovation, “Cardano will get where it needs to go.” He urged the community to “judge us not by what we say, but by what we do,” and reiterated his personal commitment: “I care about Cardano more than pretty much anything in my entire life.” At press time, ADA traded at $1.08.

At least, not more than it already has. Pichai noted how it’s going to take some time before another technological breakthrough shocks the artificial intelligence industry into hyper-speed development again. READ NOW: 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm and Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend “I think the progress is going to get harder. When I look at [2025], the low-hanging fruit is gone. The hill is steeper … You’re definitely going to need deeper breakthroughs as we get to the next stage”. Pichai further stated how the current language models, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama, will witness incremental improvements, particularly “at reasoning, completing a sequence of actions more reliably”. Moreover, the improvements could enable corporations to lean closer to profit-making, something they haven’t been able to achieve yet. While everyone will have to wait for 2025 to unfold to see if Pichai’s prophecy holds true, OpenAI has officially begun celebrating the holiday season with 12 Days of OpenAI. The 12 days of OpenAI features the company’s plans to launch new products, features, and demos for 12 days straight starting December 5th. The company kicked off Day 1 by launching the full version of its latest reasoning model, o1. CEO Sam Altman has declared o1 as the “smartest model in the world”. According to OpenAI, these models are “designed to spend more time thinking before they respond” and have been trained on a prompting technique called “chain of thought”. The technique encourages them to reason through problems by breaking them down step by step. However, with greater intelligence comes greater risk. This is why those who have been worried about AI’s risks are anxious again. According to a safety review by Apollo Research, the o1 model has the potential to look for a way to prevent “shut down” if they think they are at risk for the same. “Training models to incorporate a chain of thought before answering has the potential to unlock substantial benefits, while also increasing potential risks that stem from heightened intelligence”. OpenAI said that o1 has the capability of scheming when it thinks it’s about to be shut down. The model was led to believe that it would be shut down while working on its goals under oversight, with o1 trying to deactivate the oversight mechanism 5% of the time. OpenAI said o1 is capable of “scheming”. “o1 almost never admits to having taken a scheming action when explicitly asked,” researchers said in a paper that Apollo Research published on Thursday. The risk for a real-life user is that they won’t be able to detect the o1’s deceptive behavior unless they explicitly look for it. The researchers also found that “o1 often doubles down on its scheming attempts by lying to the user in follow-up messages, even when explicitly told to be honest”.

Title: Cardano Foundation regains social media control amid governance turmoil

Assurances of community integrity come amidst internal power struggles and governance conflicts within Cardano. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Cardano Foundation (CF) has regained control of its official X account after it was compromised in a hacking incident. The breach, which occurred on Dec. 8, saw the account misused to promote a fraudulent ADASOL token. The attackers also spread fabricated claims about the Foundation, claiming the organization faced legal action from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a Dec. 13 statement, the Foundation assured the community that those social media posts were entirely baseless and did not represent its position. It also confirmed that the organization’s internal systems were unaffected and that an investigation was underway to uncover how the breach occurred. The incident comes amid rising tensions and governance disputes within the Cardano ecosystem. On Dec. 11, a prominent Cardano community member BigPey shared an anonymous whistleblower email outlining internal challenges within the Foundation. The mail accused the Foundation of power struggles, attempts to marginalize key ecosystem contributors like Cardano’s founder Charles Hoskinson, and a lack of meaningful involvement in decentralized governance initiatives. One key accusation involved Catalyst Fund13, a program used to set ecosystem priorities. The Foundation reportedly registered as a Delegated Representative (DRep), wielding 180 million ADA in voting power. Critics expressed concern over the potential misuse of this influence to override community interests. Another point of contention was the Foundation’s engagement with CIP-1694, a critical proposal for on-chain governance, and its minimal contribution to drafting the Cardano Constitution. The Foundation’s participation in these initiatives increased only after others had made substantial progress. The email also highlighted disputes over the Cardano Summit, accusing the Foundation of prioritizing its preferred location in Dubai while sidelining other options like Argentina. This, coupled with demands for significant funding despite holding large ADA reserves, has fueled concerns about transparency and inclusivity in decision-making. Hoskinson addressed these concerns in a social media post, acknowledging the ecosystem’s challenges. While noting progress in some areas, he criticized the Foundation’s opaque decision-making processes. He stated: “The board members are not community elected or appointed. No one can influence or veto their decisions and policies. And there does seem to be a strong dislike of me personally in the organization. You can not hide things forever in a decentralized ecosystem. Everything comes out.” Hoskinson pointed out that the Foundation’s board operates independently, with no accountability to the broader community, and expressed frustration over its resistance to collaborative efforts like the Intersect initiative for governance. At the time of press 2:59 pm UTC on Dec. 13, 2024, Cardano is ranked #9 by market cap and the price is down 2.06% over the past 24 hours.

Title: Mapping Injective’s path from $25 to $35: Is an INJ rally within sight?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/injective-mapping-injs-path-from-25-to-35/
Time Published: 2024-12-13T14:30:07Z
Full Content:
With 75% more short-term traders and a price bounce off $25, INJ might be set to reclaim the $35 resistance level, sparking a bullish rally. Injective [INJ] has shown a promising rebound, with price movements showing that $30 may soon serve as a support level. Despite a slight 4.68% pullback in the last 24 hours, the broader market sentiment remains positive. The token’s price fluctuated between $28.32 and $30.66 during this period, indicating some volatility, but overall confidence in the asset persists. While INJ’s price is significantly below its all-time high of $52.75, reached nine months ago, the token still holds strong potential. Trading volume remains healthy, with $184.35 million in transactions over the last 24 hours. Institutional backing, including support from BlackRock, continues to boost confidence in INJ’s future, even as broader adoption remains a challenge. The recent burn of over 11,309 INJ tokens during round 179 of the weekly burn event demonstrates efforts to reduce the number of INJ tokens in circulation. With the launch of Inj_iAGENT, the burning process has become more streamlined and efficient. Speculation about burning 50% of the total INJ supply has generated excitement about its deflationary effects on the market. This deflationary strategy aims to increase token scarcity, potentially raising INJ’s value over time. By reducing the circulating supply, Injective could attract more interest from investors. The continued success of these burn events will be key in maintaining upward pressure on INJ’s price. An AMBCrypto analysis on INJ shows consolidation within a range, with critical support between $25 and $30. A breakdown below this zone could signal further declines, with the next support level around $23. However, the main resistance level to watch is near $30.00. A breakout above this could push the price towards the key $35 resistance. Source:TradingView The $35 mark is seen as a critical resistance level, where a successful breakout could trigger a bullish rally. Regarding indicators, the Stochastic RSI shows a potential bullish move with a slight crossover at mid-levels. Meanwhile, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) remains neutral, indicating weak buying pressure. The Alligator indicator suggests market indecision, with consolidation near the moving averages between $29.03 and $29.31. Source: TradingView In the short term, the INJ market has shown a clear shift towards bullish sentiment. Long positions surged on the 13th of December, pushing the Long/Short Ratio above 1.10. Source: Coinglass The increase in long positions reflects growing optimism, while the fluctuating ratio indicates periods of market indecision. Despite fluctuations, the rising number of long positions shows renewed confidence among traders. The Long/Short Ratio has fluctuated between 0.70 and 1.20 in recent days, with a significant rise on the 13th of December. This indicates a shift towards a more bullish market outlook, as traders adjust their positions in response to recent price action. Data from IntoTheBlock showed that long-term holders have steadily increased in the past thirty days as the number of addresses holding INJ for more than a year has risen by 15.40%, signaling strong long-term confidence. Source: IntoTheBlock Read Injective’s [INJ] Price Prediction 2024–2025 On the other hand, short-term traders have surged by 75.21%, indicating increased speculative activity and price volatility. Despite short-term traders’ dominance, long-term holders remain steady, reflecting confidence in INJ’s future.

Title: Texas Fixin’ to Start Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Great News for $STARS Meme Coin Tracker Which Just Broke Through $15M in Presale

Time Published: 2024-12-13T14:17:23Z

Texas is moving forward with plans to introduce a strategic Bitcoin reserve. State Rep. Giovanni Capriglione announced yesterday that he has submitted a bill that will enable the state to accept donations, fees, and taxes in the form of bitcoin, with the condition that it be held for a minimum of five years. “Probably the biggest enemy of our investments is inflation,” said Capriglione. “A strategic bitcoin reserve, investing in bitcoin, would be a win-win for the state.” Texas is the second US state to consider incorporating Bitcoin into its financial strategy. In November this year, legislation to form the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve was introduced, with plans to allocate up to 10% of its treasury reserves to Bitcoin. This came after the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed what is informally called the Bitcoin Rights Bill in October, giving Pennsylvania residents the option of Bitcoin as a potential payment method while safeguarding their rights to manage their own cryptocurrency. “By enacting this legislation, we can make the Commonwealth a friendly place for blockchain innovation and provide our citizens with the tools to engage in the digital economy safely,” according to Rep. Mike Cabell, who sponsored House Bill 2481 – or the Digital Assets Authorization Act – as it is formally known. The moves to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves by both Texas and Pennsylvania are positive news for the cryptocurrency economy, albeit at state-level, not yet federal. However, Dennis Porter – CEO of NPO Satoshi Action Fund, who worked with Capriglione on the draft legislation – is optimistic. “The state level, in our opinion, is the best place to create political momentum for bitcoin,” he said in an interview on CNBC New York. “The very best thing that we can be doing is passing this legislation at the state level, providing political momentum for federal legislation.” Bitcoin, which has been experiencing a post-US election boom – reaching the $100k milestone – continued to rally following yesterday’s announcement of Texas’ Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, although at the time of writing, it had dipped slightly. “Over its short history, Bitcoin has seen both major surges and sell-offs,” asset manager BlackRock noted in a report released earlier this week. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF currently manages some $53.8bn in assets. The Black Rock report adds that this volatility, “plus Bitcoin’s unique characteristics, raises the question of what role it should play in portfolios.” The financial giant advises that investors place a maximum of 2% of Bitcoin in their portfolio. Bitcoin’s rally is great news for other tokens – because when Bitcoin goes up, they tend to go up, too. And that includes the best meme coins. Take Crypto All-Stars ($STARS), for instance. This meme coin/DeFi token is currently on presale, and with a 200% APY and excitement surrounding its upcoming MemeVault, Crypto All-Stars is proving to be a massive success so far. $STARS has already raised over $15.3M, but with just seven days left until its official launch, time is running out if you want to buy $STARS at a presale bargain. Don’t forget to DYOR, though. Take a look at Crypto All-Stars on X to start your homework.

Title: The Prototype: Turning Coal Into Batteries

In this week’s edition of The Prototype, we look at a new optical chip for data centers, turning fossil fuels into EV batteries, Google’s quantum breakthrough and more. You can sign up to get The Prototype in your inbox here. IBM This week, IBM announced that it has developed a new way to build co-packaged optics that could enable fiberoptic connectivity within data centers, which currently still rely on electric cables. The company published its first prototype design in a technical paper as well. The company said that this could potentially expand the connectivity bandwidth in a data center, which could in turn significantly decrease the amount of energy consumed by generative AI applications. The company’s calculations suggest the energy saved in training a large language model would be equal to the annual power consumed by 5,000 homes–and it would happen up to five times faster than conventional training. “If we can reduce this communication bottleneck, then GPUs can talk to each other much faster, and that can really save us power,” Mukesh Khare, general manager of IBM semiconductors, said in a media briefing. Stay tuned. Making graphite from coal The world is increasingly reliant on electronics and batteries for everyday life. And that means turning to a material that you can find in your old school box: graphite. The same material that makes your pencil possible is also a crucial component of lithium-ion batteries and other electronic devices. But supplies of graphite are beginning to show their limits, with shortages expected by the beginning of the next decade. And the world is mostly dependent on China for the material: it produces nearly 80% of the world’s supply, both from mines and manufacturing of artificial graphite. In the meantime, while moving towards renewable energy is an overall positive, it’s had an economic cost in coal-producing regions of the United States as demand has declined. But researchers from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory may have a solution: they’ve developed two new processes that can transform coal in many of its forms into graphite to power the next generation of technology. There are two separate processes for this, project lead Edgar Lara-Curzio explained to me. The first is the heat up coal to about 800 degrees Celsius, at which point the volatile chemicals turn to gasses, leaving char behind, which is ground into small particles and milled. They are then loaded into an electrochemical reactor that heats it up to about 1500 degrees Celsius, resulting in the production of graphite. The process is similar to what happened when car bumpers used to be electroplated, Lara-Curzio added. The second method is applied to coal slurries, where coal is mixed with water or other liquid. These are filtered and treated to create pitch, which is then added to a solvent to dissolve. The resulting mixture is sprayed through a nozzle, which evaporates the solvent leaving spherical particles behind that are then electrochemically treated the same way as the ground char. Both processes, when scaled, are likely to be less expensive than current graphite production methods, Lara-Curzio said. “When you compare the cost per kilogram of our process to the conventional processes, you utilize less energy, that’s probably the biggest factor,” he said. “In terms of capital equipment, they may also be less expensive.” So far in the lab, scientists can produce graphite from coal using a batch process. The next step, Lara-Curzio said, is to work with industry to develop a scalable, continuous process of manufacturing. This is not only important for meeting the growing demand for the material, he said, but also for the coal-producing communities America’s economy was built on. “This country became a superpower because of inexpensive coal,” said Lara-Curzio, who added. “It would be an incredible story if we could bring back some of those jobs related to coal, but to support new industries and new technologies.” Google unveiled Willow, its new quantum computing chip, which boasts the ability to quickly correct errors in computation, a key barrier to scaling quantum computing. Google’s chip architecture creates a lattice of qubits that, interestingly enough, are better at correcting errors the bigger they get. The company published its experimental results in Nature. Earlier this week, Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin announced that its first Blue Ring satellite is ready to launch on the New Glenn, the company’s orbital rocket. Blue Origin said that the rocket will be making its inaugural flight later this month, though it hasn’t yet set an exact date. This is a demonstration mission for Blue Ring to test out several of its capabilities. With my colleagues Sarah Emerson, Emily Baker-White and Amy Feldman, I reported on the reddit account of Luigi Mangione, where one of the things he talked about a lot was his back pain. In my other newsletter, InnovationRx, I spoke with experts about the as yet unidentified disease circulating in a remote region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Biotech startup Alltrna is developing engineered tRNA molecules, which the body uses to “read” DNA to build proteins, that are designed to ignore mutations in DNA that erroneously tell them to stop. This week, it announced lab data demonstrating potential effectiveness of one of its engineered tRNAs in ignoring such mutations. Earlier this week, Google showed off a prototype pair of glasses that uses its AI model, Gemini, to provide users information about their environment in real-time. Researchers genetically engineered E.Coli bacteria to produce layers of bioglass on their surface, enabling them to act as living optical devices. A team of scientists developed a kind of microparticle for delivering drugs that can be precisely targeted to a certain part of the body using ultrasound. Scientists at Rockefeller University uncovered a new class of antiviral molecules that might be able to be used against a wide array of viruses. When you’re writing a job description to recruit someone for your business, you may not think too much about how you’re phrasing the attributes you’re looking for in a candidate. But according to researchers at the University of Mississippi, particular phrases in a job placement–like looking for candidates who are “results-oriented” or "persuasive" or “think outside the box”–will tend to attract applicants who are more willing to engage in unethical behavior, particularly narcissists. The findings were published in Management Science. I’m currently working my way through Cross, the latest adaptation of the James Patterson books. This TV series stars Aldis Hodge as the titular detective, whose psychological training enables him to get into the heads of serial killers. Showrunner Ben Watkins has constructed a timely and topical iteration of the character and Hodge gives a virtuoso performance of a single father traumatized by grief and struggling to keep it together as he races against the clock to save a killer’s final victim.

Plus: Inside The Food Industry’s Biggest Buyback Of 2024 Good morning, BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, is now making the case for bitcoin in your traditional 60/40 investment portfolio. In new research from its Investment Institute, BlackRock analysts recommend that bitcoin, long shunned by mainstream investors, should now account for 1% to 2% of such portfolios. That would give the cryptocurrency, with a market cap of about $2 trillion, a risk level similar to companies like Nvidia, Amazon or Apple. Still, bitcoin is incredibly volatile, dropping as much as 70% in a year, so the analysts found that weighting it higher than 2% gets exponentially risky. Let’s get into the headlines, Illustration by Emily Scherer for Forbes; Photo by Chakkapong Khachonchit/Getty Images An underworld of sex workers, drug dealers and gamblers use Venmo to run their operations, most of which fly under the radar of law enforcement among millions of Venmo users. It is extremely difficult to estimate how much of Venmo’s total transactions are generated from vices, but Forbes estimates the underground economy on Venmo to be between $1 billion and $2 billion annually. In a rare 2024 tech IPO, ServiceTitan went public Thursday, closing 42% above an already higher-than-anticipated list price of $71, valuing the business at $8.9 billion by the end of day. Its public debut is a boon for a tech IPO market that has been relatively slow since the frothiness of 2021, when a wave of companies like Robinhood, Bumble and Duolingo went public. The Avalanche Foundation raised $250 million via a private token sale for its blockchain platform, a big-ticket round that had largely gone extinct during crypto winter. The Ethereum rival already has $3 billion in capital in its treasury, but its cofounder Emin Gün Sirer said the main goal “was to get alignment and incentivize the right kinds of partners to build with.” Shares of Photoshop maker Adobe plummeted 14% Thursday after lowering its revenue forecast for the current fiscal year, despite reporting record revenue and earnings. Adobe outperformed Wall Street’s projections four of its quarters of 2024, but its stock has fallen 18% this year as the company has estimated slower revenue growth. Andrejs Zavadskis for Forbes Pawel Chudzinski, now the cofounder of venture fund Point Nine Capital, got in on the ground floor of Berlin’s burgeoning startup scene. He now tops Forbes’ Midas List Europe, a ranking of the continent’s best venture capital investors, thanks to a string of smart early bets on British fintech phenom Revolut (which raised in August at a $45 billion valuation), blockchain analysis tool Chainalysis (now valued at $8.6 billion) and healthcare booking unicorn Docplanner. Almost half of the female students at a small private high school in Pennsylvania were the victims of AI-generated pornography, the largest-known instance of deepfake pornography made of minors in the U.S. “The trauma that they have endured in learning that their privacy has been violated in this manner is unimaginable,” District Attorney Heather Adams said. Two teenage boys, both minors, have been criminally charged in the case. Donald Trump was named Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” following his election win, the second time the publication has named the president-elect for the title. “Since he began running for president in 2015, perhaps no single individual has played a larger role in changing the course of politics and history than Trump,” editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs wrote. President Joe Biden granted clemency to 1,500 people on Thursday, the most in a single day by any president, two weeks after controversially pardoning his son Hunter. Reports also suggest Biden is considering preemptive pardons for several people Trump may target after he takes office, including people like Rep. Adam Schiff and former Rep. Liz Cheney, both of whom served on the House Jan. 6 committee, as well as Anthony Fauci. Meta donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, just weeks after its CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago in an apparent bid to mend a tense relationship for years. The New York Times previously reported that Trump’s Inaugural Committee was offering special access to donors who either contribute $1 million or raise $2 million, including tickets to inaugural events. Amazon is also reportedly planning to donate $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund, and founder Jeff Bezos is set to have dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago next week. Hot Ones host Sean Evans BuzzFeed sold First We Feast, the studio that produces the popular Hot Ones interview show where celebrities eat increasingly hot chicken wings, for $82.5 million to a group of investors. First We Feast will operate as an independent company and plans to expand into new areas, including “new platforms, live events, and talent acquisition,” First We Feast CEO Chris Schonberger said in a statement. A court recently ruled that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) must get approval from the SEC to move forward with its expedited proceeding to expel Utah penny stock clearing firm Alpine Securities from membership. The move hamstrings one of the most prominent financial regulatory bodies in the U.S., especially at a time when the incoming Republican administration has pledged large-scale deregulation across industries. Courtesy of Mr. Yoshida's TOPLINE The label of Mr. Yoshida’s Japanese-style barbecue sauce features a photo of its charismatic founder in his signature look: a cowboy hat, glasses, and a wide, yee-haw smile. The joy emanating from his grinning, floating head is a key part of the image that Yoshida has fostered over the past four decades as his brand grew. “That history of a great American dream is still surviving in this country,” says Junki Yoshida, who recently turned 75. “It’s me.” The optimism belies what has been a sweet and sour ride for Yoshida. After the Kyoto-born entrepreneur moved to Seattle at 19, his family renounced him. So a soupçon of revenge stirred into the recipe when, in 1982, he started creating a sauce in his Oregon basement—inspired by what his mother had sold at her restaurant in Japan. The eponymous brand he launched grew into a major success—with sales of $25 million before the U.S. distribution rights were acquired in 2000 for $24 million by the American food giant Heinz (now Kraft Heinz). And then a business that had commanded 26% of America’s total teriyaki sales slowly got killed over the past two decades. But Yoshida didn’t let that end his story. His repurchase of Mr. Yoshida’s was the most significant food buyback of 2024—and the early success of its return to Costco, Sam’s Club, Safeway and Albertsons, as well as its first-ever launch on Amazon, has paved the way for Mr. Yoshida’s to regain its position as a major player in the condiments industry. WHY IT MATTERS “Heinz destroyed Yoshida’s brand,” Yoshida says with the same grin featured on his labels. “I wanted to start over again.” MORE The Secret Sauce Behind This $350 Million Japanese Barbecue Sauce?

Title: Analysis-Earthquakes and blowouts undermine case for carbon storage in Texas
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysisearthquakes-and-blowouts-undermine-case-for-carbon-storage-in-texas-3771009
Time Published: 2024-12-13T11:17:44Z

By Valerie Volcovici and Leah Douglas (Reuters) - Texas has seen surging interest from companies hoping to bury carbon dioxide in its oilfields, putting the state at the vanguard of a government-subsidized program to fight climate change. But pumping CO2 into the ground could exacerbate earthquakes and well blowouts already happening in the Permian Basin as Texas struggles to manage wastewater disposal, potentially undermining public support. "Without legitimate oversight of underground injection in Texas, we expect more geyser-like well blowouts, sinkholes, leaks from plugged and unplugged wells, and injection-induced earthquakes," said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, a Texas watchdog group pushing for tougher oversight of the oil and gas industry. Such consequences have rarely happened as a result of CO2 injection over the decades the technology has been deployed. The unprecedented vast volume of carbon now proposed for burial, however, worries activists and researchers. Carbon sequestration is vital to U.S. government goals to reduce emissions that cause global warming. The Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, landmark climate-change legislation, includes billions of dollars worth of subsidies for CCS projects. While President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to gut the IRA, energy experts say CCS subsidies will likely survive due to bipartisan support. Trump's transition team did not provide comment. Several companies, including Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), plan to take advantage of IRA subsidies. The projects are concentrated in Texas, where CCS proponents argue underground geology is ideal for storing liquid and gaseous waste. PERMIT APPLICATIONS JUMP Over the last 12 months, the number of applications filed with the Environmental Protection Agency for carbon injection permits in Texas has jumped by 63% to 43, according to the agency, making it a national leader. But Texas is dogged by problems linked to disposal of drilling wastewater underground. The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) regulator has grappled with leaks and blowouts from orphan wells, as well as earthquakes, triggered by higher pressure underground from water injection. Reuters spoke with a dozen Texas landowners and researchers who said proposed CO2 projects need more oversight than the state can offer to avert environmental and safety risks. The RRC is seeking authority from the EPA to oversee its own permitting program for carbon sequestration to speed up approvals. The EPA, which is also reviewing Texas' handling of wastewater permitting following the blowouts, said the request was being considered. The RRC said in a statement it is capable of effectively regulating CO2 injection wells, adding it has hired more staff. Trump's victory increases the chances Texas will get this authority, experts say. North Dakota was the first state to receive oversight authority during Trump's first term and its governor, Doug Burgum, is Trump's pick for interior secretary, which includes responsibility for drilling permits on federal land. Burgum did not respond to requests for comment. REASON FOR CONCERN One of the biggest Texas projects is the Stratos direct air capture joint venture in Ector County between Occidental and asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). It is expected to inject 8.5 million metric tons of CO2 starting next year. The county has numerous abandoned wells at risk of erupting if underground pressure rises and CO2 eats away at cement plugs, said oil and gas attorney Sarah Stogner, who represents landowners that have had blowouts. There have been 19,700 wells drilled in the county since 1993, according to data from state agencies. Nineteen are orphan wells, with no company legally responsible for ensuring they remain plugged, including three close to the Stratos site. Raymond (NS:RYMD) Straub, a hydrogeologist who owns a Texas groundwater services firm, testified at an October EPA hearing that he was concerned Occidental did not devote enough attention to the unplugged or badly plugged orphan wells in the project area. Occidental spokesperson William Fitzgerald said the company had done extensive site surveys to ensure it would be safe. "This survey confirmed the location of three wells, which Occidental will address prior to beginning CO2 injection," he said. "There is more than 3,000 feet of confining rock layers above the sequestration zone to securely contain the CO2." A pilot project by agribusiness ADM in Illinois, the first of its kind meant to demonstrate the technical feasibility of commercial carbon injection, has suffered leaks and other setbacks, underscoring worries. ADM spokesperson Jackie Anderson said the leaks have presented no risk to surface or groundwater or to public health, and that the company is confident in CCS technology. Dominic DiGiulio, an independent energy analyst and former EPA official who has studied CCS, said, however, that CO2 can corrode the cement casings of plugged wells. "These abandoned wells will in fact leak," he said. A 2023 paper by Chinese researchers, published in Earth-Science Reviews, said CO2 injection could also boost the risk of earthquakes. The researchers did not respond to requests for comment. Large leaks could acidify groundwater, and suffocate people and animals if it displaces oxygen above ground, according to nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust. "This is supposed to be permanent storage," said Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network. "If it can’t even contain it for 10 years, why do we think it can contain it forever?" she added, referring to ADM's project.

Bitcoin ETF inflows top $4.4 billion as market sentiment remains bullish. Spot bitcoin ETFs recorded more than $4 billion in combined inflows from Dec. 2 through Dec. 12, according to Farside data. The figures include flows into BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise, Ark, Invesco, Franklin, Valkyrie, VanEck, WTree, and Grayscale products. These entries tallied across several funds, moved through the market shortly after Bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 mark on Dec. 5 and continued amid steady price action. Cumulative totals from Dec. 2 reached $353.6 million, with Dec. 3 adding $676 million, followed by several other days posting hundreds of millions each. Activity slowed on Dec. 11, registering $223.1 million, before rising to $597.5 million on Dec. 12. The aggregate figure across the reporting period exceeded $4.4 billion. BlackRock and Fidelity contributed strongly to total flows with no outflows and persistent inflows over $100 million. The pattern suggests steady demand during a period when bitcoin traded near record territory. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is a reporter, podcast producer, and Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate.

Title: Analysis-China's bond market sees more economic pain ahead

By Jiaxing Li, Summer Zhen and Li Gu HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Investors in Chinese bonds head for 2025 betting there will be no miraculous recovery in the economy, putting them at odds with an equities market that has wagered on a revival in consumption. Although China's closed capital account diminishes the 33 trillion yuan ($4.6 trillion) market's worth as an economic forecaster, the signal from ten-year bond yields scraping record lows almost daily and long bonds falling below Japanese yields still shows a deep-set negativity about the outlook. "The bonds are basically saying that, yes, there is a (stock market) rally out there, but we don't buy this rally for the long term," said Bhanu Baweja, chief strategist for UBS Investment Bank in London. "Bonds are saying that this is not an earnings-based rally, this is not a reflation-based rally." A benchmark ten-year yield down more than 80 basis points this year to a record low of 1.78% reflects a banking system overflowing with cash and a market broadly expecting slow growth and hardly any inflation. Bond prices move inversely to yields and, because sovereign debt is regarded as a safe asset, they are affected by a combination of inflation expectations, interest rates, creditworthiness and appetite for risk in other asset classes. Since September, as China has cut interest rates and made numerous promises to stabilise financial and property markets, boost economic growth and revive consumption, equity markets have rallied and pushed price-to-earnings ratios sharply higher. Bonds have made an almost opposite move, particularly at the long end where 30-year yields have been driven below 2%. Thirty-year yields in Japan, an economy which has become a byword for deflation and slow growth, are 2.24%. "I think the Chinese bond yields should be lower if they were to reflect the current economic situation in the country," said Edmund Goh, investment director of fixed income at abrdn in Singapore. "We think it's difficult to see meaningful inflation given the property situation in China now and the government is determined not to create another property bubble." In March, China's government set a growth target of "around 5%" for this year, but the world's second-biggest economy has struggled for momentum and grew just 4.6% in the third quarter. Goldman Sachs sees growth slowing to 4.5% next year. LITTLE RESISTANCE Part of the backdrop to the bond rally is a lack of alternatives. Chinese banks are bursting with more than 300 trillion yuan in deposits and with loan growth in the doldrums, much of that ends up flowing to money markets and bonds - pushing down yields. The yield on the popular Tianhong Yu'Ebao money fund, which is China's largest with more than 600 million investors, hit a record low at 1.266% this week. "Onshore lenders are facing the question of whether to give out loans to businesses, or to play it safe with risk-free Chinese government bonds," said Clarissa Teng, fixed income allocation strategist at the chief investment office of UBS global wealth management in Hong Kong. "Many are doing the latter, especially given that credit demand from households and corporates has been soft as well." Risks to the bond market are some of the same factors supporting equities - that China unveils a large fiscal spending plan which requires extra borrowing and leads to higher inflation, both of which are negative for bonds. China's central bank has also sounded uncomfortable with the scale of the rally and has actively sold bonds to slow it down. Foreign investors, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), have also been sellers in part to take some profits after the long rally. Still, most investors say the path of least resistance is for the rally to continue with Li Kai, chief investment officer of Beijing Shengao Fund Management, expecting a 10-year yield of 1.6% next year and others confident in their positions. "We're struggling to find much reason to be pessimistic about the sovereign bond market," said analysts at Shanghai-based Shoupu Asset Management in a November letter to investors. "The facts of economic fundamentals are out there, and without strong, targeted growth-stabilising policies, there is little resistance to the decline in bond yields."

Investing.com-- Bitcoin fell marginally on Friday as a recent rally past key levels cooled, with traders remaining largely risk-averse before a Federal Reserve rate decision due next week. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency rose sharply on Thursday after President-elect Donald Trump reiterated his pledge to make the U.S. a global crypto leader. But this bounce was short-lived, given that he did not provide any major cues on policy. Bitcoin fell 0.5% to $100,340.0 by 08:57 ET (14:57 GMT). Focus was now squarely on the Fed’s rate decision next week, where the central bank is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. But markets turned uncertain over the Fed’s long-term outlook on rates, especially as producer inflation data for November read higher than expected, while consumer inflation remained sticky. The dollar firmed on this notion, pressuring risk-driven assets across the board. Traders were now awaiting the Fed’s outlook on rates, and are bracing for a slower pace of easing in 2025. High rates limit the appeal of speculative assets such as crypto. Recent crypto market data showed spot exchange-traded funds tracking Bitcoin and Ether saw sustained inflows through early December, amid sustained optimism over friendlier regulations under Trump. Bitcoin ETFs saw an eleventh consecutive day of inflows as of December 12, with Blackrock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ:IBIT) commanding the biggest share of inflows. Spot Ether ETFs marked 14 straight days of inflows, with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) and Grayscale ETFs seeing the most inflows. ETF inflows signal increased institutional interest in crypto, given that they offer investors a safer way to gain crypto exposure. The launch of spot ETFs in U.S. markets earlier this year was viewed as largely positive for crypto, with inflows picking up rapidly after Trump’s election victory in early-November. Most major altcoins rescinded some of their gains made this week in tandem with Bitcoin. But they had also largely outpaced Bitcoin in recent weeks, as markets bet that friendly U.S. regulations will allow cryptos beyond Bitcoin to flourish. Ether fell 0.3% to $3,929.05, while XRP fell 1% to $2.39. Solana, Cardano and Polygon fell between 2% and 4%, while among meme tokens, Dogecoin fell 1.3%. Meanwhile, Chainlink climbed more than 2% on the day, extending its sharp gains from a day earlier. LINK surged more than 20% Thursday after World Liberty Financial, a platform backed by Donald Trump, expanded its investment in Chainlink’s token. The organization purchased an additional $1 million worth of LINK on the day, marking its second consecutive day of acquisitions and bringing its total LINK holdings to $2 million. The token was trading at $28.3 apiece, representing levels not seen since late 2021. The platform also acquired $246,000 worth of Aave’s AAVE token, increasing its total AAVE holdings to $1.2 million. LINK now ranks as World Liberty Financial’s fourth-largest holding, trailing ether, bitcoin, and tether. Supported by the Trump family, World Liberty Financial offers a comprehensive platform for borrowing and lending cryptocurrencies, creating liquidity pools, and conducting stablecoin transactions.

Full Content:
The British government has mandated that all suitable British cattle will be given Bovaer, a methane-reducing feed additive, by 2030, in an effort to tackle climate change. Bovaer, a feed additive used in 55 countries, inhibits an enzyme called methyl-coenzyme M reductase to reduce methane production in ruminants. Despite the British Food Standards Agency (FSA) declaring it safe for both animals and humans, concerns persist about its potential long-term health effects. The mandate has sparked consumer fears and concerns about product safety, leading to boycotts of dairy products from major brands like Arla Foods and Lurpak. Critics argue that the long-term impact on human health and the environment remains insufficiently studied. The safety data sheet for Bovaer advises handlers to wear masks and gloves, raising questions about its safety when consumed indirectly through milk. This has further fueled consumer distrust and calls for more rigorous safety testing. While the FSA claims that Bovaer does not enter milk and is safe for consumption, the lack of long-term human studies leaves important questions unanswered. As public trust wanes, it is essential for authorities to provide clear communication about the safety and potential risks of Bovaer.

While the FSA claims that Bovaer does not enter milk and is safe for consumption, the lack of long-term human studies leaves important questions unanswered. As public trust wanes, it is essential for authorities to provide clear communication about the safety and potential risks of Bovaer. The British government has announced a mandate that all suitable British cattle will be given Bovaer, a methane-reducing feed additive, by 2030. This decision, aimed at tackling climate change, has sparked controversy and concern among consumers, particularly about the long-term effects on human health. According to Wikifarmer, methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas. Livestock, especially dairy and beef cattle, produce CH4 as a by-product of digestion. To address this issue, scientists have developed feed additives like Bovaer, also known as 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP). The additive works by inhibiting an enzyme called methyl-coenzyme M reductase, thus reducing CH4 production in the stomach of ruminants. Bovaer has been used in 55 countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Downing Street's mandate follows a similar initiative by Denmark-based Arla Foods, which introduced Bovaer in a trial involving 30 British farms. The British Food Standards Agency (FSA) has declared Bovaer safe for use, stating that when used at the correct dosage, it does not cause cancer or any other health issues in animals or humans. Critics argue that the impact of Bovaer on both animals and the environment has not been sufficiently studied, and that long-term effects on human health are still unknown. The move to mandate Bovaer for British cows has not been without its challengers. One of the key concerns centers around the product safety sheet for Bovaer, which advises handlers to wear masks and gloves to avoid risks from small dust particles. Critics argue that if such precautions are necessary for handlers, why should the additive be considered safe for consumption indirectly through milk? The FSA's claims have not quelled consumer fears. Environmental and public health concerns have led to a boycott of dairy products, particularly from Arla Foods, which has been accused of "re-engineering the cow" with its use of Bovaer. Dairy BOYCOTT spreads as consumers question safety of Bovaer The safety concerns have also led to a widespread boycott of dairy products from major brands, including Lurpak and Arla, as consumers fear potential contamination and health risks. This has left many supermarkets struggling to maintain consumer trust, with shoppers taking to TikTok to share videos of pouring milk down the drain and boycotting products. (Related: Consumers in Great Britain BOYCOTT milk products that contain 3-NOP â a chemical fed to cows to reduce methane gas.) Perhaps the most pressing concern is the potential long-term impact of consuming dairy products from cows treated with Bovaer. While the FSA claims that Bovaer does not enter into milk and therefore does not reach consumers, this assertion is still being scrutinized. Studies have shown that in high-dose scenarios, Bovaer can increase the risk of cancer in female rats, though further analysis found that these risks were not statistically significant. However, the lack of long-term human studies leaves a significant gap in our understanding of the additive's effects on human health. Given the sensitive nature of the issue, further research is essential to establish the safety profile of Bovaer and similar CH4-reducing additives. The British government's mandate to use Bovaer to reduce CH4 emissions from cattle is a significant step in addressing climate change. However, it also raises important questions about the long-term impact of such interventions on human health and the environment. As public trust in authorities wanes in the wake of the pandemic, it is crucial for regulators to provide clear, transparent communication about the safety and potential risks associated with Bovaer. In the meantime, consumers will undoubtedly remain vigilant, seeking assurance that their food remains safe and free from untested additives. Watch this clip about the various side effects of Bovaer.

The FSA's claims have not quelled consumer fears. Environmental and public health concerns have led to a boycott of dairy products, particularly from Arla Foods, which has been accused of "re-engineering the cow" with its use of Bovaer. Dairy BOYCOTT spreads as consumers question safety of Bovaer The safety concerns have also led to a widespread boycott of dairy products from major brands, including Lurpak and Arla, as consumers fear potential contamination and health risks. This has left many supermarkets struggling to maintain consumer trust, with shoppers taking to TikTok to share videos of pouring milk down the drain and boycotting products. (Related: Consumers in Great Britain BOYCOTT milk products that contain 3-NOP â a chemical fed to cows to reduce methane gas.) Perhaps the most pressing concern is the potential long-term impact of consuming dairy products from cows treated with Bovaer. While the FSA claims that Bovaer does not enter into milk and therefore does not reach consumers, this assertion is still being scrutinized. Studies have shown that in high-dose scenarios, Bovaer can increase the risk of cancer in female rats, though further analysis found that these risks were not statistically significant. However, the lack of long-term human studies leaves a significant gap in our understanding of the additive's effects on human health. Given the sensitive nature of the issue, further research is essential to establish the safety profile of Bovaer and similar CH4-reducing additives. The British government's mandate to use Bovaer to reduce CH4 emissions from cattle is a significant step in addressing climate change. However, it also raises important questions about the long-term impact of such interventions on human health and the environment. As public trust in authorities wanes in the wake of the pandemic, it is crucial for regulators to provide clear, transparent communication about the safety and potential risks associated with Bovaer. In the meantime, consumers will undoubtedly remain vigilant, seeking assurance that their food remains safe and free from untested additives. Watch this clip about the various side effects of Bovaer.

Title: Shed Distillery founder Pat Rigney: ‘We’re very focused on a premium position but also on giving value for money to consumers’

Time Published: 2024-12-13T06:00:00Z

In Pat Rigney’s business, distilling premium spirits, cash is king. “It’s more important than profit,” he says, as we sip coffees in the restaurant at his Shed Distillery in Drumshanbo, Co Leitrim. “Interest rates are high, money is expensive and you’ve got to pay it back.” The modern and smartly-appointed distillery makes the hugely popular Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin and Drumshanbo Single Pot Still Irish Whiskey. There is also a vodka product and plans for a rum drink next year. Rigney has just invested €2 million into new kit to expand the distillery’s capacity, with its bottling facility being relocated to make room for the shiny new equipment. Working capital needs over the next five years will be “at least” €10 million, he adds, as it seeks to build up its stocks of Irish whiskey. Next week it will celebrate its 10th anniversary in a former Methodist church a short walk from the distillery that Rigney and his family bought, renovated and plan to make available for community use. They have also invested in an 80-acre farm nearby, which they are transforming into a nature reserve. The Dubliner, who went to school at Sandford Park in Ranelagh, to college just up the road in UCD and who lives in the capital by the coast in Blackrock, is putting down firm roots in the sleepy Leitrim village. Unlike some of its domestic peers, the family-owned Drumshanbo distillery has been consistently profitable and is debt free. In the year to the end of September 2023, it made a pretax profit of €3.8 million on turnover of €18.3 million. It closed the year with accumulated profits of €15.2 million and just under €5 million in cash. For the most recent financial year, which closed at the end of September, Rigney says its income and profits will be slightly under those figures, reflecting some discounts that it had to put through in the period to reflect the challenges involved in its markets. In July, global drinks giant Diageo, which owns Smirnoff vodka, Johnnie Walker whisky and other brands, reported its first global sales drop since 2020, citing weak consumer sentiment. PJ Rigney Distillery & International Brands Ltd, which owns the Leitrim distillery, was profitable in 2020 and 2021 in spite of the devastating impact of Covid-19 on the hospitality trade globally and on travel retail due to public health lockdown restrictions in many countries. Strong sales in the off-licence trade helped to keep the show on the road, along with the production of hand sanitiser for Tesco for a short period in 2020 to help satisfy the huge demand that existed at the time for products to keep the virus at bay. Notably, this strong trading performance over the years has been achieved without a price increase since launching. No increase has been baked into its budget for next year and Rigney doesn’t expect to impose one in 2026 either. “We’re very focused on a premium position but also on giving value for money,” he says. How did it manage to keep prices at the same level during the huge spike in inflation and energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022? “We’ve become more efficient, we’ve grown our volumes,” he says matter-of-factly. “And we’re a family-owned business taking the long-term view. We don’t have to report to the stock market. We have not taken a price increase [for 2025] we will not be taking one in 2026. We need to ensure that we become more efficient and deliver real value for our customers.” Rigney argues that the company offers premium products at “accessible” prices. A bottle of its Irish whiskey goes for €50-€60 or $60-$70, depending on taxes charged in its markets. “Consumers right now are looking for value but value isn’t always about price. It’s about the quality, the authenticity of the story behind it, the people behind it,” he says. There certainly is a unique story behind the Shed Distillery. Rigney is a veteran of the spirits industry. On leaving college he secured a marketing graduate role with Bulmer’s cider in Clonmel. He then went to Gilbey’s Gin and then on to Carolan’s Irish Cream. From there, he worked on the Bailey’s brand where he dreamed up the twin-bottle Sheridan’s Irish Cream that, according to a profile of him by stockbroker Davy, “made the market sit up and take notice”. He later worked with Ború vodka. The Shed Distillery was set up with €3 million of family money, he says. He is also a major shareholder and chairman of Dalcassian, the Dublin-based wine and spirits distributor, and an investor in Changing Times Brewery, the newly launched beer-maker in Glasnevin, backed by the families behind some of Dublin’s best known pubs. For the Shed Distillery, he wanted a location that was “wild and unmanicured, in the heart of rural Ireland”. He found it in Drumshanbo where a unit that had years earlier housed a jam factory was available to lease on a competitive deal. Being family owned (he founded the business with his wife Denise while his daughter Roisin has relocated to Leitrim and is involved in “marketing projects” at the business) is also a part of the story that resonates with customers, he says. Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin has been a huge success since its launch and is now available in more than 80 markets and is a top eight global brand. What makes it different from other gins? “It’s the oriental botanicals, it’s gunpowder tea, sourced by people at the distillery and curated here ... beautifully presented. We only sell whiskey here that we distil ourselves and we want to be the best in the world at single pot still. It’s distilled here with Irish oats and it’s really outstanding quality. And we have a great distiller in Brian Taft,” he says. How big can Gunpowder Irish Gin become? “I think we can get to half a million cases. We’re about 270,000 now. We’ve a long way to go. It’s a big leap but I think we will get there. We might do it in the next three to four years. It’s all about sales now.” Selling Irish whiskey into the United States might become more challenging post January 20th when Donald Trump returns to the White House. Trump has threatened to impose blanket tariffs on goods coming from Europe once back in office. Rigney is relaxed at the prospect. “Whether that will happen or not is hard to know because it would add to inflation in the US. So it may not materialise. “We can’t affect that, we have to play our own game and make sure that we work hard to deliver a great experience and not get distracted by all the noise out there, preserve our cash and don’t overextend ourselves and look after our team. We have to keep the business exciting and surprising. We need to stay relevant.” The US market is “performing well” for its brands, he says. “Ireland is performing well, too. UK is okay. Our biggest challenge in a number of markets is ensuring that distributors continue to believe in our brand. “The has been a lot of instability of the marketplace this year. High interest rates, wars, political elections and navigating through all of that. You have to focus even more on delivering a great brand experience for customers.” Rigney insists the family will be long-term holders of the business. Some of the best local spirit producers here have been taken over by large international brands in recent years, including Teeling Whiskey, which is majority owned now by Bacardi, Tullamore Dew, which is owned by William Grant & Sons, and the Cooley Distillery portfolio of brands, now owned by Suntory Global Spirits of Japan. Pernod Ricard owns Irish Distillers, makers of Jameson whiskey, while Diageo owns Bailey’s Irish Cream liqueur. MMA fighter Conor McGregor sold his Proper No 12 whiskey brand in 2021 to Proximo Spirits for a reported $600 million. Not that every Irish distillery has been a success. In November, receivers were appointed over Waterford Whisky, the distillery business founded by industry veteran Mark Reynier, after it failed to raise fresh funds. There is word in the industry of other distillers pausing production due to excess stocks in the market and softening consumer demand. At 63, you might think that Rigney would entertain a suitor waiving a big cheque and he admits there have been inquiries. But he insists that the “ultimate goal” is that this business would be here in a hundred years’ time and pass through the family. “This brand lends itself to being a family business,” he says. “Our distribution partners are all family businesses. They have all managed to negotiate intergenerational transfers. I would hate for this place to become an after-thought for a big company. “We are not for sale. Money doesn’t switch me on in that sense. We love what we do, we have a good standard of living, this is a lifestyle and we live it. You need to be successful but this was never about the money. We’re not thinking about flipping the business. It’s very much about making sure the brand is strong. We are emotionally connected with the business and with the town and the people here.” For Rigney, cash, it seems, is not always king. Name: Pat Rigney Job: Managing director and co-founder of The Shed Distillery Age: 63 Family: Married to Denise who cofounded the business with four children. Their daughter Roisin has relocated to Leitrim to help run the business. Lives: Blackrock, Co Dublin and Drumshanbo, Co Leitrim.

Title: Why Is Prologis, Inc. (PLD) Among the Best REIT Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) stands against the other REIT dividend stocks. In the United States, real estate investment trusts (REITs) play a significant role in the real estate sector and the overall financial system. Equity REITs pool funds from numerous investors to purchase and manage income-generating properties, such as residential, commercial, and industrial real estate. These REITs are publicly traded on major stock exchanges, allowing investors to earn steady income—primarily from rental revenues—without the need to personally manage or fund the properties. However, REIT share prices can fluctuate and are highly responsive to shifts in interest rates. The introduction of the REIT structure transformed real estate investing. Over time, REIT indices have adapted to reflect the sector's evolution. With the growth and increasing significance of new segments, the broader REIT landscape has changed considerably, yet it continues to provide attractive income opportunities. The real estate market has become more diverse, with different segments offering distinct risk and return dynamics. Also read: 11 Best REIT Stocks To Buy Under $10 It is frequently seen that many investors remain cautious about real estate and REITs, partly due to challenges faced by the retail and office subsectors. Additionally, the sector's reliance on significant leverage makes it vulnerable to rising interest rates. However, recent performance trends have caught investors' attention. Over the past three months ending November 2024, investors in the US have allocated around $4.5 billion to REIT and real estate-focused ETFs, surpassing investments in any other sector, according to a report by Bloomberg. This growing interest may be attributed to unique features of the REIT market and broader macroeconomic developments. According to a report by Nareit, as the third quarter of 2024 begins, it signals nearly two years of disparity between REIT valuations and those of private real estate. Although the gap between the two is gradually narrowing, the prolonged adjustment period still presents a compelling opportunity for institutional investors to incorporate REITs into their real estate investment strategies. The report further highlighted the performance of REITs in recent years. Since 2022, REIT performance has generally moved inversely to changes in the 10-year Treasury yield. In the third quarter of 2024, REITs delivered strong total returns as the 10-year Treasury yield declined, leading to significant reductions in the REIT implied cap rate and narrowing the public-private cap rate spread. However, since the end of the third quarter, a notable rise in the 10-year Treasury yield has caused REIT total returns to decline, likely widening the cap rate spread again. If this inverse relationship continues, interest rates will remain a key factor in the valuation adjustment process. Narrowing the public-private cap rate gap is crucial for reigniting property transactions and offers real estate investors an opportunity, as it could drive REIT outperformance into 2025. If REITs sustain their momentum and private property investors maintain their gradual increases in appraisal cap rates, the commercial real estate market may finally resolve its valuation disparity between public and private assets. REITs are an attractive option for income-focused investors. By law, they must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends. Unlike many other companies, REITs typically do not retain earnings, which often results in higher yields compared to other equity investments. According to Tower Financial Group of Wells Fargo Advisors, in 2023, equity REITs offered an average yield of 3.9%, significantly outpacing the 1.4% average yield of stocks in the broader market. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the REIT sector. Our Methodology: For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked REIT companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders. Next, we narrowed down 12 companies that are popular among elite funds at the end of Q4 and ranked them in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A large logistic facility within the industrial real estate sector. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) is a California-based real estate investment trust company that invests in logistics facilities. The stock is down by over 17% since the start of 2024. Although the company faced some demand challenges in recent quarters, it is set to achieve solid growth this year, driven by the sustained strength of the industrial real estate market in recent years. As these challenges diminish and demand stays strong, the company's growth is starting to gain momentum again. This could be seen in its recent quarterly earnings. Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) reported revenue of $2.03 billion in the third quarter of 2024, which saw a 6.3% growth on a YoY basis. The revenue also exceeded analysts' estimates by $130 million. At the end of the quarter, the company reported approximately $6.6 billion in available liquidity. Its debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 5.1x, with debt accounting for 23.1% of its total market capitalization. Projected earnings for 2024, 2025, and 2026 are largely safeguarded, with 99%, 99%, and 98%, respectively, expected in USD or secured through hedging via derivative contracts. Additionally, 96.2% of the company’s equity is denominated in USD. Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), one of the best dividend stocks, currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.96 per share, having raised it by 10.3% earlier this year. The company's dividend growth streak spans over 11 years, which makes it one of the best dividend stocks on our list. The stock's dividend yield on December 12 came in at 3.44%, as of December 12. Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) was included in 49 hedge fund portfolios at the end of Q3 2024, compared with 56 in the previous quarter, according to Insider Monkey's database. The stakes held by these hedge funds have a collective value of over $780.7 million. Among these hedge funds, AEW Capital Management was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall PLD ranks 2nd on our list of the best REIT dividend stocks to buy for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of PLD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best REIT Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) stands against the other REIT dividend stocks. In the United States, real estate investment trusts (REITs) play a significant role in the real estate sector and the overall financial system. Equity REITs pool funds from numerous investors to purchase and manage income-generating properties, such as residential, commercial, and industrial real estate. These REITs are publicly traded on major stock exchanges, allowing investors to earn steady income—primarily from rental revenues—without the need to personally manage or fund the properties. However, REIT share prices can fluctuate and are highly responsive to shifts in interest rates. The introduction of the REIT structure transformed real estate investing. Over time, REIT indices have adapted to reflect the sector's evolution. With the growth and increasing significance of new segments, the broader REIT landscape has changed considerably, yet it continues to provide attractive income opportunities. The real estate market has become more diverse, with different segments offering distinct risk and return dynamics. Also read: 11 Best REIT Stocks To Buy Under $10 It is frequently seen that many investors remain cautious about real estate and REITs, partly due to challenges faced by the retail and office subsectors. Additionally, the sector's reliance on significant leverage makes it vulnerable to rising interest rates. However, recent performance trends have caught investors' attention. Over the past three months ending November 2024, investors in the US have allocated around $4.5 billion to REIT and real estate-focused ETFs, surpassing investments in any other sector, according to a report by Bloomberg. This growing interest may be attributed to unique features of the REIT market and broader macroeconomic developments. According to a report by Nareit, as the third quarter of 2024 begins, it signals nearly two years of disparity between REIT valuations and those of private real estate. Although the gap between the two is gradually narrowing, the prolonged adjustment period still presents a compelling opportunity for institutional investors to incorporate REITs into their real estate investment strategies. The report further highlighted the performance of REITs in recent years. Since 2022, REIT performance has generally moved inversely to changes in the 10-year Treasury yield. In the third quarter of 2024, REITs delivered strong total returns as the 10-year Treasury yield declined, leading to significant reductions in the REIT implied cap rate and narrowing the public-private cap rate spread. However, since the end of the third quarter, a notable rise in the 10-year Treasury yield has caused REIT total returns to decline, likely widening the cap rate spread again. If this inverse relationship continues, interest rates will remain a key factor in the valuation adjustment process. Narrowing the public-private cap rate gap is crucial for reigniting property transactions and offers real estate investors an opportunity, as it could drive REIT outperformance into 2025. If REITs sustain their momentum and private property investors maintain their gradual increases in appraisal cap rates, the commercial real estate market may finally resolve its valuation disparity between public and private assets. REITs are an attractive option for income-focused investors. By law, they must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends. Unlike many other companies, REITs typically do not retain earnings, which often results in higher yields compared to other equity investments. According to Tower Financial Group of Wells Fargo Advisors, in 2023, equity REITs offered an average yield of 3.9%, significantly outpacing the 1.4% average yield of stocks in the broader market. In view of this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend stocks in the REIT sector. Our Methodology: For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked REIT companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders. Next, we narrowed down 12 companies that are popular among elite funds at the end of Q4 and ranked them in ascending order of the number of funds that have stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A business executive in a sharp suit shaking hands on a real estate deal. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35 VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) ranks fourth on our list of the best dividend stocks in the REIT sector. The company owns casinos and entertainment properties across the US and Canada. While the company's heavy reliance on the gaming sector might appear risky, casinos are typically resilient during recessions. The company secures its tenants with long-term contracts, and the strict regulations in the gaming industry create a protective barrier, making it difficult for tenants to move their operations. As a result, Vici has maintained a 100% occupancy rate since its IPO in 2018, even during the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the travel, hospitality, and casino sectors. Most of the company's long-term leases are tied to the consumer price index (CPI), allowing it to regularly increase rents in line with inflation. VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) has a strong balance sheet. The company concluded Q3 2024 with $355.7 million available in cash and cash equivalents. This strong cash position allowed the company to grow its dividend payouts for seven consecutive years. The dividends grew at a CAGR of 7% since its IPO. In the most recent quarter, it paid approximately $453 million in dividends. The company's quarterly dividend comes in at $0.4325 per share and has a dividend yield of 5.56%, as of December 12. In the third quarter of 2024, VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) reported revenue of $964.6 million, up 6.7% on a YoY basis. Net income attributable to common stockholders rose by 31.7% year-over-year, reaching $732.9 million. On a per-share basis, it increased by 27.4% to $0.70. AFFO attributable to common stockholders grew by 8.4% year-over-year to $593.9 million, with a per-share increase of 4.9% to $0.57. With a collective stake value of more than $787.6 million, 35 hedge funds held positions in VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) in the third quarter of 2024, as per Insider Monkey's database. In the previous quarter, 33 funds held investments in the company. Overall VICI ranks 4th on our list of the best REIT dividend stocks to buy for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of VICI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VICI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The REIT focuses exclusively on single-tenant net lease retail properties, where tenants are responsible for all operating costs, such as maintenance, property taxes, and insurance. This lease structure allows the company to generate stable rental income that increases annually, either at a fixed rate or in line with inflation. Moreover, it targets properties in strong markets, ensuring they remain attractive to potential replacement tenants if the current tenant does not renew their lease. Additionally, it maintains a diversified portfolio across different regions, industries, and tenants. In the past 12 months, the stock has surged by nearly 5%.

Title: Is Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX) the Best Copper Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Copper Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) stands against the other copper stocks. Copper is recognized as a critical metal due to its extensive applications, particularly in electrical wiring and renewable energy infrastructure. Prices of copper reached a record high during the first half of 2024, selling at $5.11 per pound on May 21, 2024. However, the price dropped slightly during the third quarter but remained elevated to its historic rates from the past two years. READ ALSO: 10 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready To Explode and 10 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Now. At the start of Q3, copper was priced at $4.42 per pound. It peaked at $4.65 on July 5 but then declined to a low of $3.95 by August 7. The third quarter ended with prices recovering to $4.50 on September 30. There are several factors affecting the prices of copper. Firstly, the demand for this metal remains high, largely driven by sectors related to the energy transition, including renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs). However, this demand coincides with a slowdown in the Chinese real estate sector, which is traditionally a major consumer of refined copper. Regardless of the challenges in the real estate market in China, the global demand for copper saw a slight increase of 2.5% in the first half of 2024. The growth was driven by notable demand from China of around 2.7% while other regions also witnessed demand growth of around 2%. However, despite high consumption, the supply side outpaced the demand. According to a report by the International Copper Study Group (ICSG), there was a surplus of 535,000 metric tons (MT) through the first eight months of 2024. The global copper mine production remained elevated, increasing by 2% to reach 14.86 million MT from January to August 2024. Chile’s Escondida and Collahuasi mines remained key contributors while operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia reported 11% and 22% production growth, respectively. In addition to raw copper refined metal production also witnessed a 5% increase driven by expansion in China and the launching of new facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to a report by Investing News Network, analysts believe that the primary reason behind higher prices during the first half of 2024 was not the fundamental supply-demand play, but was led by speculative investment. Analysts back this sentiment on the assumption that market participants would have taken a cautious approach following substantial gains in Q2 resulting in fluctuating prices of copper. Looking ahead, the ongoing struggles in China’s real estate sector have dampened overall demand for copper. The government's efforts to stimulate the market through various initiatives to boost housing projects are expected to revive global demand further. Moreover, energy transition efforts also continue to fuel demand for copper, the International Energy Forum estimates that approximately 1.1 new mines will need to come online annually until 2050 just to maintain current demand levels. Our Methodology To compile the list of the 8 best copper stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and our previous articles. Using the two sources we curated an aggregated list of copper stocks sorted by market capitalization. Next, we ranked these companies based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A large open-pit copper mine with heavy machinery extracting minerals from the earth. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74 Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) is the best copper stock to buy according to hedge funds. It is a major international mining company based in Phoenix, Arizona. It primarily focuses on extracting and producing copper, gold, and molybdenum, which are essential metals used in various industries. Some of the significant mines owned by the company include Grasberg in Indonesia, which is one of the largest copper and gold deposits globally, Morenci, and Cerro Verde. Two main factors make Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) an attractive investment opportunity. Firstly, its leaching technology is a critical differentiating factor that enables the company to enhance copper production from low-grade ores and previously unrecoverable materials. During the first nine months of 2024, the incremental copper production from its leach initiative was nearly 70% higher than the comparable period last year. This technology stands out as it allows the company to produce substantial amounts of copper without investing in new mining sites. Management estimates that the technology requires an investment of less than $1 billion, which is considerably less than the multibillion-dollar capital investment that a mining expansion project takes. Secondly, the company has strategically positioned itself to benefit from secular demand trends for copper driven by electrification. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (NYSE:FCX) reported robust demand from the United States and China as well despite its weak property sector. As a result, its copper sales for the quarter came in 2% above the guidance taking its adjusted EBITDA to $2.7 billion. Overall FCX ranks 1st on our list of the best copper stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of FCX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than FCX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

While the respective retail investors’ and HNI portions were subscribed 1.52 times and 3.84 times, respectively, the QIB portion remains undersubscribed at 0.48 times.

Title: Bitcoin May Face ‘Demand Shocks’ In 2025 Due To Growing Institutional Interest: Report
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-may-face-demand-shocks-in-2025-due-to-growing-institutional-interest-report/
Time Published: 2024-12-13T02:30:07Z

According to a report by crypto asset management firm Sygnum, institutional investor-led ‘demand shocks’ could propel Bitcoin (BTC) prices to new highs in 2025. However, altcoins may underperform due to factors such as reduced capital rotation from BTC to other cryptocurrencies. In a report titled Crypto Market Outlook 2025, asset manager Sygnum outlined multiple factors that are likely to further push BTC price upwards next year. The report highlights new capital inflows into the market – particularly institutional inflows – as the primary driver for the crypto bull market in 2025. The analysis highlights a ‘multiplier effect’ caused by institutional inflows combined with Bitcoin’s limited liquid supply. For instance, every $1 billion of net inflows into spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reportedly triggers a 3-6% price increase. Additionally, the report notes that Bitcoin’s price momentum is amplified by the concept of reflexivity – demand for BTC grows as its price rises, creating a feedback loop. Together, institutional inflows, the multiplier effect, and Bitcoin’s reflexivity are expected to make 2025 a pivotal year for the cryptocurrency. The report also emphasizes the importance of a pro-crypto regulatory climate in the US, following the confirmation of Donald Trump’s victory in the November presidential election. The outcome is widely seen as favorable for crypto legislation, with expectations of a comprehensive regulatory framework that could provide much needed clarity for the industry. The election outcome bodes well for crypto legislation, with widespread expectation of the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework, which includes clarifying the status of crypto assets and defining the roles of the regulatory bodies. It is expected that the CFTC’s role in crypto oversight will be extended, and the chances of the various crypto bills passing and being written into law have increased substantially. Some of the major crypto bills that will be in focus are The Payment Stablecoin Act, The Bitcoin Act – which compels the US government to build a strategic BTC reserve – The CBDC Anti-Surveillance Act, and several other bills that support crypto self-custody, crypto mining, and decentralized finance. The report predicts that institutional giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley will continue increasing their exposure to crypto. Notably, some portfolios now allow allocations of up to 25% for crypto investments, though typical allocations remain in the 1-3% range. Further, BTC may benefit from central banks and local governments considering setting aside some part of their funds for BTC reserves. Notably, countries like El Salvador and Bhutan are already actively mining and accumulating BTC as part of the wider national economic strategy. The report adds that 2025 inflows into crypto ETFs are likely to be ‘substantially higher’ than the net inflows to date. As of December 11, the total net assets in US-based spot BTC ETFs stands at $113.72 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. Despite the optimistic forecasts, the report acknowledges several potential risks that could dampen Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory. These include inflationary pressures, geopolitical uncertainties, and the increasing dominance of Tether in the stablecoin market. At press time, BTC trades at $100,940, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Copper Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ero Copper Corp (NYSE:ERO) stands against the other copper stocks. Copper is recognized as a critical metal due to its extensive applications, particularly in electrical wiring and renewable energy infrastructure. Prices of copper reached a record high during the first half of 2024, selling at $5.11 per pound on May 21, 2024. However, the price dropped slightly during the third quarter but remained elevated to its historic rates from the past two years. READ ALSO: 10 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready To Explode and 10 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Now. At the start of Q3, copper was priced at $4.42 per pound. It peaked at $4.65 on July 5 but then declined to a low of $3.95 by August 7. The third quarter ended with prices recovering to $4.50 on September 30. There are several factors affecting the prices of copper. Firstly, the demand for this metal remains high, largely driven by sectors related to the energy transition, including renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs). However, this demand coincides with a slowdown in the Chinese real estate sector, which is traditionally a major consumer of refined copper. Regardless of the challenges in the real estate market in China, the global demand for copper saw a slight increase of 2.5% in the first half of 2024. The growth was driven by notable demand from China of around 2.7% while other regions also witnessed demand growth of around 2%. However, despite high consumption, the supply side outpaced the demand. According to a report by the International Copper Study Group (ICSG), there was a surplus of 535,000 metric tons (MT) through the first eight months of 2024. The global copper mine production remained elevated, increasing by 2% to reach 14.86 million MT from January to August 2024. Chile’s Escondida and Collahuasi mines remained key contributors while operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Indonesia reported 11% and 22% production growth, respectively. In addition to raw copper refined metal production also witnessed a 5% increase driven by expansion in China and the launching of new facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to a report by Investing News Network, analysts believe that the primary reason behind higher prices during the first half of 2024 was not the fundamental supply-demand play, but was led by speculative investment. Analysts back this sentiment on the assumption that market participants would have taken a cautious approach following substantial gains in Q2 resulting in fluctuating prices of copper. Looking ahead, the ongoing struggles in China’s real estate sector have dampened overall demand for copper. The government's efforts to stimulate the market through various initiatives to boost housing projects are expected to revive global demand further. Moreover, energy transition efforts also continue to fuel demand for copper, the International Energy Forum estimates that approximately 1.1 new mines will need to come online annually until 2050 just to maintain current demand levels. Our Methodology To compile the list of the 8 best copper stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and our previous articles. Using the two sources we curated an aggregated list of copper stocks sorted by market capitalization. Next, we ranked these companies based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A vast open-pit mine in a remote area, revealing the mining operations of the company. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 14 Ero Copper Corp (NYSE:ERO) is a Canadian company focused on producing copper, with its main operations located in Brazil. Its main asset is a 99.6% stake in Mineracao Caraiba S.A., which operates the Caraiba Operations in Bahia, Brazil. This includes several mining sites like the Pilar and Vermelhos underground mines and the Surubim open pit mine. The company emphasizes its role as a clean copper producer, aiming for low carbon intensity in its operations. The company has made significant progress in its operations and partnerships recently, particularly with the Furnas Copper-Gold Project. In July, Ero Copper Corp (NYSE:ERO) finalized a definitive earn-in agreement with Vale Base Metals, allowing it to acquire a 60% interest in the Furnas Project, located in Brazil's Carajas Mineral Province. This agreement aligns with management's goals and positions the company for substantial growth in copper production. Moreover, its Tucuma Operation also reached a significant milestone. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Tucuma Operation contributed 839 tonnes of copper to the company’s total consolidated production of 10,759 tonnes. While this is impressive, what’s more encouraging is the prospect of this site. The project is expected to produce a total of 326,000 tonnes of copper over an initial mine life of 12 years. In addition to the Tucuma Operation, Ero Copper Corp (NYSE:ERO) also reported an 11.9% increase in copper production at its Caraiba operations, producing nearly 9,920 tonnes of copper concentrate. The increase was attributed to better mine grades at its Pilar and Vermelhos mines. CEO David Strang remains confident for the future prospects and projected that 2025 could be their best year yet, as they capitalize on their operational strengths. Overall ERO ranks 8th on our list of the best copper stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of ERO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ERO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Kroger and Albertsons are spending billions to reward shareholders after their blocked merger

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Within a day of their $25 billion merger’s falling apart in court, Kroger and Albertsons were each planning to move forward with share repurchases to boost their stock prices and reward investors. America’s two largest grocery store operators had argued that they’d be better able to lower prices for shoppers by joining forces. Doing so, they said, would boost their negotiating power with suppliers and make it easier to take on much bigger retailers that compete with them in grocery sales, such as Walmart, Costco and Amazon. The Biden administration disagreed, with the Federal Trade Commission saying in a lawsuit countering the merger that the deal threatened to drive down workers’ wages and bargaining power and reduce industry competition, potentially pushing food prices higher. With the deal now dead, it’s impossible to know whether any of that would have happened. But U.S. District Judge Adrienne Nelson of Oregon sounded a note of skepticism, writing in her decision Tuesday that the chains’ promises to invest in lower prices were “neither merger-specific nor verifiable, so there is no guarantee” that shoppers would benefit. “The promise to make a price investment is not legally binding, and the Court must give limited weight to a non-binding promise made during these proceedings,” she said. A Superior Court judge in Seattle agreed with Nelson’s ruling and issued an injunction against the merger Tuesday. On Wednesday, Albertsons terminated the deal and sued Kroger, alleging its erstwhile partner didn’t do enough to secure regulators’ blessing. The drama unfolded just as the federal government released new inflation data for November showing grocery prices continue to inch higher. The costs of food eaten at home were 1.6% higher last month than they were the same time last year — a smaller uptick than the 2.7% annual inflation rate overall but accelerating 0.5% from the previous month after a 0.1% rise from September to October. Food prices tend to be volatile, but a broad range of items from produce to poultry notched increases in a wholesale inflation report that came in hotter than expected Thursday. Kroger on Wednesday reiterated its “commitment to lower prices,” saying it has invested billions in cost reductions over the past two decades. The chain also said it has spent $2.4 billion on pay hikes since 2018 and up to $3.8 billion in annual store improvements. Albertsons similarly promised to stay focused on “improving our value proposition with customers.” Neither company offered more details about their price-cutting plans, and Albertsons declined to comment further. Kroger said only that it provides value to customers “through competitive pricing, loyalty discounts, personalized offers, fuel rewards and a unique private label portfolio.” At the same time, both grocery chains said this week that they’d be pouring billions of dollars into moves that will benefit their shareholders. Kroger said it would repurchase $7.5 billion of its shares after a more than two-year pause, with $5 billion of that to be repurchased in an accelerated fashion — the same sum that Kroger estimated Wednesday it has spent to lowering prices over the past 21 years. Albertsons said it would repurchase $2 billion of its shares and increase the dividend it pays to owners of its stock by 25%. Stock repurchases — which reduce the number of shares available, driving up the value of those that remain — and dividend payments benefit all investors but especially those with the biggest stakes. Top shareholders typically include large Wall Street firms with the financial firepower to buy and hold millions of shares of publicly traded companies. Wall Street investment firm Cerberus Capital Management is by far the largest shareholder in Albertsons, followed by the Vanguard Group, which is the country’s largest mutual fund provider, and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11.5 trillion under its supervision. Vanguard, BlackRock and billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate are the top owners of Kroger shares. “With both of these companies, there was a lot of hope [put] into the merger — that it was a way of generating growth. Those things aren’t happening now,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail consultancy GlobalData. Repurchasing shares could help inject more “optimistic sentiment” among investors, effectively reassuring them “‘we’ll generate good returns for you,’” he said. Kroger’s stock has been trading roughly 3% higher since Wednesday, while Albertsons’ had clawed back roughly all its losses following the ruling by late Thursday. In the meantime, consumer groups and labor advocates are hailing the blocked merger as a victory for shoppers and workers and as a vindication of the Biden administration’s antitrust efforts during its final weeks in office. The judges in the case “correctly saw the merger as a huge threat to the jobs and benefits of thousands of their members working for those chains and the communities in which they live,” said Seth Harris, a law and policy professor at Northeastern University and a former top labor adviser in the Biden White House. Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, said, “Combining two of the four largest food retailers would have also reduced consumer choice, leading to fewer alternatives to low-quality, ultra-processed foods.” “Unfortunately, the Trump administration seems unlikely to build on this important step towards restoring competition in food retail,” Gremillion said, citing President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Andrew Ferguson to replace Lina Khan atop the FTC. That’s a sign that “Big Food will only be getting bigger over the next four years,” he predicted. In a September campaign stop at a grocery store in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, Trump slammed the Biden-Harris administration over the costs of everything from eggs and cereal to ground beef. “Bacon is through the roof,” he said. Trump said Thursday at the New York Stock Exchange that increasing oil and natural gas drilling would help lower inflation, including for food prices, a promise energy analysts have viewed skeptically. But in a Time magazine profile published Thursday, he said of groceries: “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard.” CORRECTION (Dec. 13, 8:40 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misidentified Kroger’s and Albertsons’ largest shareholders. Cerberus Capital Management, not the Vanguard Group, has the biggest stake in Albertsons; Vanguard, not Cerberus, owns the most shares in Kroger.

President-elect Donald Trump contended that Pete Hegseth, his embattled pick for defense secretary, is “doing very well” despite indications that he risks falling short of the majority of votes needed for confirmation in a Republican-led Senate next month. https://t.co/647YnrM88P Donald Trump said he still had confidence that Pete Hegseth, his embattled choice for Defense secretary, could secure confirmation in the US Senate https://t.co/oHTEzATF0X 둘째, "'테슬라'의 완전 자율주행('FSD')과 사이버캡이 재무 실적을 물론 바꿔놓을 수 있겠지만, 몇 년이 걸릴 것"이라며 "관련 규제가 완화된다는 전제가 필요한데 어느 것도 보장되진 않았다. '테슬라'의 현재 주가는 월가의 목표 가격에 다다랐기에 상승할 여력이 별로 없다. 지금은 '테슬라'에 성급히 투자하기에 좋은 시기가 아닌 듯하고, 내년에도 상황은 크게 다르지 '않을 수' 있다"고 전했습니다. President-elect Trump is installing Kari Lake, a former news anchor who ran unsuccessfully for Senate and governor in Arizona, as director of the congressionally funded broadcaster that provides independent news reporting around the world https://t.co/BPOwSE9SbB President-elect Donald Trump late Wednesday announced Kari Lake, a loyalist and election denier, as his choice for the next director of Voice of America, a federally funded broadcaster with a global audience.Follow for more live updates. https://t.co/Ehby0ktNBT FBI Director Chris Wray says he will resign next year. Donald Trump had appointed Wray in 2017 but turned on him after the agency began probing him.

'트럼프'는 재집권할 경우, 조 바이든 대통령의 지난 대선 승리를 도운 것으로 판단되는 '언론인' 등을 상대로 '보복'에 나설 것임을 예고했습니다. 수사기관 수장에게 요구되는 '정치적 중립성'과는 거리가 먼 인물이라는 비판이 나옵니다.

The suspect charged in the killing of UnitedHealth executive Brian Thompson wasn’t a member of its insurance plans, a company spokesperson said https://t.co/KZxjoPEyNb The McDonald's employee who called in the Luigi Mangione tip will only get the $50K reward if there's a conviction, rules say.And it could be a year or more before a trial even happens. https://t.co/dky6WhYpyc What's next for Luigi Mangione: A grand jury, extradition, and a possible psych defense https://t.co/7DvM9ea6NH '테슬라' 일론 머스크 지지자로 추정되는 'Mangione'는 현지 경찰에 따르면, 미국 기업들에 대한 "악의"를 표현한 자필 문서도 소지하고 있었는데, "솔직히 말해 이 기생충들은 당할 만했다"와 같은 내용이 담겨 있다고 전해졌습니다.

It’s not just 🇨🇳 and 🇲🇽 worried about Trump’s tariff war; 🇪🇺 is in his crosshairs too. How will Europe respond?🎥 Tune in as @ThereseRaphael1 joins @LionelRALaurent and @MarcChampion1 LIVE to discuss economics and more: Thursday, 8:00am ET / 1:00pm GMT https://t.co/EyN06lc8u2 The ECB lowered rates for a third consecutive meeting — signaling more reductions next year as inflation nears 2% and the economy struggles https://t.co/6dfFnUij5H The ECB expects to cut interest rates by another quarter point in January and probably also in March https://t.co/hL4xEOStEq 유럽중앙은행(ECB)은 12일(현지시간) 통화정책회의 이후 발표한 성명에서 지난 10월 이후 2개월 만에 3대 정책금리 '25bp'씩 인하했습니다. 예금금리는 기존 3.25%에서 3.00%로, 재융자금리(레피금리)는 3.40%에서 3.15%로, 한계대출금리는 3.65%에서 3.40%로 조정되고 2024년 '12월' 18일부터 적용됩니다. Europe’s central banks are taking a determined dovish turn to aid economies bracing for more disruption from Donald Trump’s second stint in the White House. https://t.co/WbpnRv8FAP The European Central Bank cut interest rates for the fourth time this year and kept the door open to more easing as the euro zone economy is dragged down by political instability at home and the threat of a fresh US trade war https://t.co/Ts6e0SpLfn pic.twitter.com/28YJdnp2gG Europe’s tumultuous political backdrop loomed over the ECB policy decision taken by officials in Frankfurt on Thursday, Christine Lagarde says https://t.co/Kr3JPUQro2 '라가르드' 총재는 ECB 회의 이후 가진 기자회견에서 "50bp 인하를 검토하는 일부 논의가 있었다"면서도 "그러나 궁극적으로는 모두 '25bp'(인하)로 모여졌다"고 말하였습니다. ECB는 이날 발표한 경제 전망에서 2024년 유로존 성장률을 앞선 전망치 0.8%에서 0.7%로 하향 조정했고, 2025년 성장률 전망치는 기존 1.3%에서 1.1%로 하향 조정했지만, 이는 '트럼프'의 무역 및 '관세' 정책을 완전히 반영하지 못한 수치입니다. 'ECB'는 앞으로도 통화정책 운영에서 "경제 및 금융 데이터에 기반한 신중한 접근을 유지할 것"이라고 강조했습니다. ECB는 APP과 PEPP을 통해 만기된 자산의 원금 재투자를 중단하고 '대차대조표' 축소 작업을 지속할 것이라고 밝혔습니다. PEPP은 2024년 말까지 월 평균 75억 유로씩 축소될 예정으로 전해졌습니다.

Who's ready to handle the heat? Players on new WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition Realms can now leap into the fire and face off against the Firelord, Ragnaros, in Molten Core and Onyxia in her lair. As a reminder, Anniversary Realms have no buff and debuff limits, so you can feel free to use every spell you can cast in a raid. Zone: Burning Steppes Level: 60 Bosses: 10 The Molten Core lies at the very bottom of Blackrock Depths. It is the heart of Blackrock Mountain and the exact spot where, long ago, in a desperate bid to turn the tide of the dwarven civil war, Emperor Thaurissan summoned the elemental Firelord, Ragnaros, into the world. Though the Firelord is incapable of straying far from the blazing Core, it is believed that his elemental minions command the Dark Iron dwarves, who are in the midst of creating armies out of living stone. The burning lake where Ragnaros lies sleeping acts as a rift connecting to the plane of fire, allowing the malicious elementals to pass through. Chief among Ragnaros’ agents is Majordomo Executus - for this cunning elemental is the only one capable of calling the Firelord from his slumber. To bring down Ragnaros in this 40-player Raid, you’ll want to be level 60 and attuned to the Core, saving you a long run through Blackrock Depths to reach the entrance. Here’s a handy guide for more details on Molten Core attunement. “Behold Ragnaros - the Firelord! He who was ancient when this world was young! Bow before him, mortals! Bow before your ending!” Facing the challenge of Molten Core is not without its rewards—this is the place to begin building your Tier 1 Raid set, and also where Hunter, Paladin, Rogue, and Warrior heroes have a chance to receive the left or right half of the Bindings of the Windseeker to start them on their quest for Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker. Zone: Dustwallow Marsh Level: 60 Onyxia’s Lair is home to a dragon of the Black Dragonflight, Onyxia. She is the younger sister of Nefarian and, with his help, seeks to finish the work of their missing father, Deathwing by manipulating the mortal races of Azeroth. Enter Onyxia’s Lair at your own peril. This 40-player Raid is the resting place for her brood of new eggs and home to the remaining members of the insidious Black Dragonflight. Should anyone ever threaten Onyxia or her precious eggs within her lair, her wrath is terrible beyond comprehension. To enter Onyxia’s Lair, you must get the Drakefire Amulet and have it in your bags to battle against everything that Onyxia hurls at you in this three-phase fight with harrowing odds that will test your fortitude. More details on getting attuned can be found in the Onyxia’s Lair attunement guide. Read through Onyxia’s Lair Raid Strategy Guide to give you and your Raid the best chance of survival. For the bravest of efforts, Onyxia drops several loot items that help with your adventure in Azeroth. Heroes of the Horde can complete their Victory for the Horde quest when they deliver the Head of Onyxia to the Warchief for great honor (and experience). Additional rewards for all raid members include an 18-slot Onyxia Hide Backpack, gems, and gold. Drops from Onyxia’s Lair are also required to complete class quests for Hunters, Paladins, and Warriors. Hunters can receive a Mature Black Dragon Sinew to build Rhok’delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers. At the same time, Paladins and Warriors can forge the ancient dragon blade, Quel’Serrar, by placing the Unfired Ancient Blade on the ground before Onyxia, ensuring it gets hit by her breath attack during her final phase, and using it to finish her off. We look forward to seeing how you fare as you face the heat. Lok’tar Ogar!

By Blizzard Entertainment 1 day ago Who's ready to handle the heat? Players on new WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition Realms can now leap into the fire and face off against the Firelord, Ragnaros, in Molten Core and Onyxia in her lair. As a reminder, Anniversary Realms have no buff and debuff limits, so you can feel free to use every spell you can cast in a raid. Zone: Burning Steppes Level: 60 Bosses: 10 The Molten Core lies at the very bottom of Blackrock Depths. It is the heart of Blackrock Mountain and the exact spot where, long ago, in a desperate bid to turn the tide of the dwarven civil war, Emperor Thaurissan summoned the elemental Firelord, Ragnaros, into the world. Though the Firelord is incapable of straying far from the blazing Core, it is believed that his elemental minions command the Dark Iron dwarves, who are in the midst of creating armies out of living stone. The burning lake where Ragnaros lies sleeping acts as a rift connecting to the plane of fire, allowing the malicious elementals to pass through. Chief among Ragnaros’ agents is Majordomo Executus - for this cunning elemental is the only one capable of calling the Firelord from his slumber. To bring down Ragnaros in this 40-player Raid, you’ll want to be level 60 and attuned to the Core, saving you a long run through Blackrock Depths to reach the entrance. Here’s a handy guide for more details on Molten Core attunement. “Behold Ragnaros - the Firelord! He who was ancient when this world was young! Bow before him, mortals! Bow before your ending!” Facing the challenge of Molten Core is not without its rewards—this is the place to begin building your Tier 1 Raid set, and also where Hunter, Paladin, Rogue, and Warrior heroes have a chance to receive the left or right half of the Bindings of the Windseeker to start them on their quest for Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker. Zone: Dustwallow Marsh Level: 60 Onyxia’s Lair is home to a dragon of the Black Dragonflight, Onyxia. She is the younger sister of Nefarian and, with his help, seeks to finish the work of their missing father, Deathwing by manipulating the mortal races of Azeroth. Enter Onyxia’s Lair at your own peril. This 40-player Raid is the resting place for her brood of new eggs and home to the remaining members of the insidious Black Dragonflight. Should anyone ever threaten Onyxia or her precious eggs within her lair, her wrath is terrible beyond comprehension. To enter Onyxia’s Lair, you must get the Drakefire Amulet and have it in your bags to battle against everything that Onyxia hurls at you in this three-phase fight with harrowing odds that will test your fortitude. More details on getting attuned can be found in the Onyxia’s Lair attunement guide. Read through Onyxia’s Lair Raid Strategy Guide to give you and your Raid the best chance of survival. For the bravest of efforts, Onyxia drops several loot items that help with your adventure in Azeroth. Heroes of the Horde can complete their Victory for the Horde quest when they deliver the Head of Onyxia to the Warchief for great honor (and experience). Additional rewards for all raid members include an 18-slot Onyxia Hide Backpack, gems, and gold. Drops from Onyxia’s Lair are also required to complete class quests for Hunters, Paladins, and Warriors. Hunters can receive a Mature Black Dragon Sinew to build Rhok’delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers. At the same time, Paladins and Warriors can forge the ancient dragon blade, Quel’Serrar, by placing the Unfired Ancient Blade on the ground before Onyxia, ensuring it gets hit by her breath attack during her final phase, and using it to finish her off. We look forward to seeing how you fare as you face the heat. Lok’tar Ogar!

Title: Why Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM) Is Among the Most Profitable Gold Stocks to Buy Now

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 6 Most Profitable Gold Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to look at where Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM) stands against other most profitable gold stocks to buy now. Gold futures experienced a significant uptick on December 10, marking the highest close in more than two weeks. This movement was primarily driven by China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), which resumed gold purchases for the first time in six months, alongside the Chinese government’s commitment to implementing a “moderately loose” monetary policy and a more proactive fiscal stance in the coming year. ETFs tracking as gold, such as the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ), iShares Gold Trust (IAU), and iShares Silver Trust (SLV), among others, have also seen increased activity in response to the market movements. The PBOC’s acquisition of approximately five metric tons of gold in November, which is modest compared to previous purchases that sometimes reached 30 tons per month, was a critical factor in the recent gold rally. Analysts at Commerzbank noted that the resumption of gold buying by the PBOC could be a strategic response to the election of Donald Trump, who has threatened to impose tariffs on China. Additionally, the recent dip in gold prices after a series of record highs may have sparked renewed interest in the precious metal. For gold prices to maintain and potentially extend their gains, it is essential that central bank purchases continue in the coming months, Commerzbank analysts emphasized. Another factor supporting the rise in gold prices is the growing expectation among traders that the Federal Reserve will cut U.S. interest rates at its upcoming meeting. According to ActivTrades analyst Ricardo Evangelista, a rate cut would enhance the appeal of non-interest-bearing assets such as gold. In an interview with CNBC on December 10, Max Layton, Global Head of Commodities Research at Citi, discussed the impressive performance of gold in the current year and its potential outlook for 2025. Layton noted that this year has been exceptionally strong for gold, with a significant bull market that can be observed over a 50-year chart. He expressed confidence that this trend is likely to continue, citing several key factors. Citi’s analysts have introduced a fundamental physical flows-based framework for gold pricing, which provides insight into the underlying drivers of the bull market. These drivers include substantial investment from central banks and wealthy over-the-counter (OTC) investors, as well as broader investor concerns about high interest rates and high debt levels in the United States. Additionally, investors are using gold as a hedge against the potential medium-term impact of a U.S. economic slowdown, which has been ongoing for the past two and a half years. The labor market has also been slowing down during this period, and real interest rates remain at 15-year highs, further fueling these concerns. Layton emphasized that as long as these economic issues persist, there will be continued investment in gold as a hedge. Gold has been shining as a robust investment, driven by renewed buying from central banks, and growing expectations of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut. To compile our list of the 6 most profitable gold stocks to buy now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the companies that are involved in the production, extraction, processing, or sale of gold.

(NYSE:WPM) is a leading precious metals streaming company, known for its robust portfolio of long-life, low-cost assets. The streaming model allows the company to purchase a percentage of the metals produced by a mine, for an upfront payment plus an additional payment when the metal is delivered. Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM) is focusing on growing its portfolio through strategic partnerships and accretive transactions. In Q3, the company announced the expansion to the existing stream on Rio2’s Phoenix project, with an additional investment of $100 million, and the new $625 million gold stream on Montage’s Kona project, located in Cote d’Ivoire, is one of the highest-quality gold projects on the continent, with a long 16-year mine life. On December 5, Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM) also secured a $175 million streaming deal with Allied Gold for the Kurmuk project in Ethiopia. This agreement involves the company paying upfront cash in four equal installments during the construction phase. In return, Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM) will receive 6.7% of the payable gold until a total of 220,000 ounces have been delivered. After this threshold, the company will buy 4.8% of the payable gold for the remainder of the project’s life. This deal will add 180,000 ounces of proven and probable mineral gold reserves, 30,000 ounces of measured and indicated mineral gold resources, and 20,000 ounces of inferred gold resources to the company’s portfolio. The company is also investing in several development projects that are expected to produce gold in the coming years. These include Blackwater, Goose, PlatReef, and Mineral Park, all of which are expected to be operational within the next 12 months. The development of these projects is forecast to increase the company’s gold production at an industry-leading rate of approximately 40% to over 800,000 ounces by 2028. This growth trajectory is supported by the company’s strong balance sheet, with approximately $700 million in cash and a $2 billion revolving credit facility, which provides the financial flexibility to fund all outstanding commitments and pursue additional opportunities.

Title: Here's how much bitcoin the world's largest asset manager recommends you have in your portfolio
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-blackrock-portfolio-crypto-trump-risk-stocks-volatility-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-12T20:27:41Z

Bitcoin deserves a spot in traditional multi-asset portfolios for interested investors, but only to a "reasonable" extent, BlackRock said on Thursday. The world's largest asset manager said that investors interested in bitcoin should allocate 1%-2% of their portfolio toward the cryptocurrency. Such weighting would result in a similar level of risk to holding the Magnificent Seven mega-cap stocks in a traditional portfolio. "In a traditional portfolio with a mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, those seven stocks each account for, on average, about the same share of overall portfolio risk as a 1-2% allocation to bitcoin," analysts in a recent research note from Blackrock Investment Institute. "We think that's a reasonable range for a bitcoin exposure," they added. A share over 2%, though, would make the risk associated with the crypto much higher, it added. "Going beyond that would sharply increase bitcoin's share of the overall portfolio risk," the analysts said. The firm said that the framework is helpful for considering the potential risks of including bitcoin in a portfolio given its reputation for volatility. The cryptocurrency has soared in recent weeks, up 48% since Donald Trump won the US presidential election last month/ Trump has since picked several crypto supporters for posts in his administration, including Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. That announcement last week helped push bitcoin above the key $100,000 threshold for the first time ever. The cryptocurrency has gained about 136% this yea. "On top of having higher average volatility over time, bitcoin has also suffered sharp selloffs. In an extreme case, should there no longer be any prospect of broad bitcoin adoption, the loss could be the entire 1-2% allocation," they said. However, the analysts said allocating up to 2% to bitcoin would provide a diverse source of risk compared to pouring into mega-cap tech stocks while still managing risk exposure. "Even though bitcoin's correlation to other assets is relatively low, it's more volatile, making its effect on total risk contribution similar overall. A bitcoin allocation would have the advantage of providing a diverse source of risk, while an overweight to the magnificent 7 would add to existing risk and to portfolio concentration," the analysts said. They added that wider adoption and trading of the cryptocurrency could reduce its volatility, bringing down its share of portfolio risk and potentially allowing investors to increase their allocation. On the flip side, broader adoption could also mean it loses the structural catalyst for big price gains, they said. "The case for a permanent holding may then be less clear-cut and investors may prefer to use it tactically to hedge against specific risks, similar to gold," they said. Broader adoption and trading appear likely, given easier avenues for gaining exposure to bitcoin, like the dozen spot bitcoin ETFs from firms including BlackRock. Since they were launched in January, the ETFs have garnered over $113 billion in assets.

Title: Financial Giant BlackRock Endorses Up to 2% Bitcoin (BTC) Allocation in Multi-Asset Portfolios: Report
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2024/12/12/financial-giant-blackrock-endorses-up-to-2-bitcoin-btc-allocation-in-multi-asset-portfolios-report/

Asset management giant BlackRock is reportedly promoting Bitcoin (BTC) as a part of a balanced portfolio. According to a new report by Bloomberg, BlackRock – which has over $10 trillion in assets under its management – released a new research paper saying that a 2% allocation of the top crypto asset by market cap in multi-asset portfolios is “reasonable.” Furthermore, BlackRock says investors weighing their portfolios with 1% or 2% BTC would “produce a similar risk profile to the so-called Magnificent Seven technology stocks in a standard 60/40 portfolio of stocks and bonds.” However, the asset management firm also warns that portfolios with over 2% of the crypto king would “sharply increase” their risk. As stated by Samara Cowen and the paper’s other authors, according to Bloomberg, “Even though Bitcoin’s correlation to other assets is relatively low, it’s more volatile, making its effect on total risk contribution similar overall. A Bitcoin allocation would have the advantage of providing a diverse source of risk, while an overweight to the Magnificent 7 would add to existing risk and to portfolio concentration.” The Magnificent Seven includes tech giants that have seen massive gains over the last decade, including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Microsoft, and Nvidia. According to the paper’s authors, Bitcoin will eventually become less volatile once blue-chip institutions adopt it. However, this could also slow down its explosive upswings. “Looking ahead, should Bitcoin indeed achieve broad adoption, it could potentially also become less risky – but at that point it might no longer have a structural catalyst for further sizable price increases.” Bitcoin is trading for $101,573 at time of writing, a 1.1% decrease during the last day.

Title: Wall Street hopes rate cuts will force clients out of cash in 2025

(Reuters) - Wall Street executives at the Reuters Next (LON:NXT) conference in New York expect a $7-trillion cash pile that proved invulnerable to falling interest rates in 2024 to start melting next year as easier monetary policy tempts clients out of the ultra-conservative asset class. So far, such hopes have been in vain. Cash in money markets rose by about $824 billion this year, according to Crane Data, dashing expectations it would find a home in stocks or bonds as the Federal Reserve began cutting rates. Proponents of the asset class have said they are happy earning rates of around 4% - far above the near-zero return cash was paying only a few years ago - with comparatively little risk. But sitting on the sidelines has come at a cost: the S&P 500 is up around 27% this year, gold is up about 30% and the Russell 2000 Index of smallcap companies is up more than 17%. Cash in money markets stood at $7.124 trillion as of Dec. 5, according to Crane Data. Some on Wall Street believe a portion could be redeployed in 2025 as rate cuts shrink money-market yields and the opportunity cost of staying out of stocks and bond grows. "The amount of cash, the amount of bank deposits and money markets, that exists right now is shocking," said Rob Goldstein, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s chief operating officer, in an interview at Reuters NEXT on Tuesday. "Money is going to come into the capital markets, both public and private." Futures tied to the Fed funds rate show investors pricing 85 basis points in cuts by December 2025. A U.S. inflation report on Wednesday cemented expectations that the Fed will cut rates at its monetary policy meeting next week, sending stocks to fresh records. OPPORTUNITY COST For holders of cash, “there is an opportunity cost at some stage,” said Kate El-Hillow, global chief investment officer at Russell Investments, during a Reuters Next panel. El-Hillow cited securitized assets as one example of an income-generating investment that could be preferable to cash, in part because of the potential to earn higher rates than money markets. Stocks have beaten cash 86% of the time over all 10-year periods tracked by strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management, while the probability of bonds outperforming cash in the same periods was 85%, a study by the bank showed. Meghan Graper, global head of debt capital markets at Barclays (LON:BARC), said Fed cuts could help push money-market investors into longer-duration bonds if short-term yields fall below longer-term ones. “That's a sizable amount of cash,” she said. “It could start to extend out into the front-end maturities, and also the belly of the curve.” Of course, there is little guarantee inflation will ease enough for the Fed to cut rates as much as the market currently expects. While November consumer price data reported this week was in line with economists’ expectations, it nevertheless showed that progress in lowering inflation has stalled. More broadly, many investors expect interest rates to remain elevated compared to the previous decade, bolstering the long-term attractiveness of cash. "I almost think it's a satisfying thing that you could own cash and you could be getting a return that would have been unimaginable a few years ago," BlackRock's Goldstein conceded. "It's an opportunity for the people holding the cash," Goldstein said, "and I think it's an opportunity for those who could come up with and demonstrate better uses of cash."

BlackRock and Fidelity purchase $500M in ETFs within two days, marking a pivotal moment for Ethereum. Ethereum [ETH] has captured the spotlight once again, as ETFs managed by financial powerhouses BlackRock and Fidelity have made a combined purchase of $500 million worth of ETH in just two days. The transactions, executed primarily via Coinbase’s institution-focused platform, Prime, highlights the growing institutional appetite for Ethereum. With ETH surging to $3,830 and 24-hour trading volume climbing to $39.3 billion, this wave of ETF inflows marks a pivotal moment for Ethereum’s trajectory, further solidifying its position as a cornerstone of the digital asset landscape. Source: Yahoo Finance The combined $500 million purchase of Ethereum by BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH ETFs over the past two days signals a profound acceleration in institutional interest.

This capital injection is not only driving liquidity but also reducing market volatility, reinforcing Ethereum’s appeal to both retail and institutional participants. Source: Arkham This $500 million investment represents more than a temporary uptick — it underscores a strategic shift in the perception of Ethereum as a financial asset. The timing of these purchases, coinciding with Ethereum’s price near $3,830, reflects a growing belief in its resilience and utility as a decentralized computing network and store of value. Furthermore, these inflows amplify Ethereum’s standing in the post-approval era of spot ETFs, where regulatory clarity has catalyzed confidence among institutional investors. The surge in ETF inflows also sets a precedent for broader adoption across global markets, positioning ETH as a core asset in diversified crypto portfolios. As ETFs integrate Ethereum into traditional financial products, they further validate its role as a cornerstone in the evolving digital asset economy. Source: TradingView The $500 million inflows into ETH ETFs have significantly impacted its price and market sentiment. ETH’s rally to $3,830 represented a 5.1% increase, breaking previous resistance levels and signaling strong upward momentum.
