Wednesday, 09 Apr 2025 KUALA LUMPUR: 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and its 10 subsidiaries on Wednesday (April 9) withdrew their lawsuit against Singaporean national Shabnam Naraindas Daswani over the alleged purchase of luxury items worth more than USD346mil, allegedly acquired using misappropriated 1MDB funds. Shabnam (also known as Natasha Mirpuri) was initially named as a co-defendant in the suit alongside Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, the wife of former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak. However, Rosmah remains a defendant in the ongoing lawsuit. According to lawyer Nathalie Ker Si Min, representing 1MDB, a consent judgment was recorded before High Court Judge Wan Muhammad Amin Wan Yahya during online proceedings on Wednesday. "The consent judgment records the plaintiff's decision not to continue with the suit against Shabnam, with liberty to file afresh," Ker confirmed when contacted by reporters. Meanwhile, when contacted, Shabnam's lawyer, Datuk N. Sivananthan, also confirmed the development. The lawsuit was initially filed on May 9, 2024, naming Rosmah and Shabnam as the first and second defendants. The ten subsidiaries involved as co-plaintiffs are: 1MDB Energy Holdings Limited, 1MDB Energy Limited, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Limited, Global Diversified Investment Company Limited, SRC International Sdn Bhd, Affinity Equity International Partners Limited, Alsen Chance Holdings Limited, Blackrock Commodities (Global) Limited, Blackstone Asia Real Estate Partners Limited and Brightstone Jewellery Limited. The plaintiffs are seeking a court order compelling Rosmah to pay USD346,010,489 or a sum to be assessed by the court. They also seek court declarations, including one asserting that the first to sixth plaintiffs hold rightful ownership of the luxury items, currently purported to be in Rosmah's possession. – Bernama Thank you for your report!

Title: Eugene, OR, is finally building bike-optimized singletrack in Suzanne Arlie Park

The city of Eugene sits in the lush evergreens of Oregon’s Willamette Valley, on the western side of the Cascade Mountain Range. Along with the town of Springfield, separated from Eugene by the Willamette River, the area boasts a population of nearly 250,000 residents, making it Oregon’s third-largest city. Despite the city’s size (okay, it’s large for us Oregonians), trail access is few and far between for Eugene’s mountain bikers. Many riders in the area find themselves making the journey to places like Alsea Falls, Blackrock, or Oakridge — proper mountain bike destinations themselves, but a bit of a trek from Eugene. However, the city of Eugene is looking to change that. A new trail proposal has been approved, and the city is now looking for trail builders to construct 12 miles of new trails, much of it mountain bike-specific singletrack. As you can imagine, this has Eugene-area mountain bikers stoked! Mountain bikers in the Eugene/Springfield area have been relatively hamstrung if they want to ride singletrack close to the city. Aside from a random bit of trail here and there, along with what appears to be mellower bike paths, residents have two options: Ridgeline Park in Eugene and Thurston Hills in Springfield. Carpenter Bypass is another popular location, but it’s located nearly 30 minutes south of Eugene via the interstate. Local riders and advocacy groups have expressed growing frustration over the absence of nearby trail systems. These groups have repeatedly urged the city to build more trails, but as is common around the country, finances and resources are spread thin. What Eugene does have going for it is an abundance of parks and open space. “I was involved in purchasing this property back in 2008,” Philip Richardson told us. “We bought it in several chunks. Now we have 565 acres.” Richardson is a City of Eugene Landscape Architect and Parks Planner in the Parks and Open Space Division. The 565 acres of land he referred to is Eugene’s Suzanne Arlie Park, where the 12 miles of new trail will be located. Suzanne Arlie is Eugene’s largest park. It skirts Eugene’s eastern city limits, falling between the popular Mt. Baldy and Interstate 5. The land was first purchased in 2008, with the city acquiring 200 acres. Three years later, Eugene purchased the remainder of the land comprising the park’s current acreage. Today, the park has a series of hiking trails, including Eugene’s Ridgeline Trail, which stretches through several parks. Aside from some social trails that mountain bikers built in years past, Suzanne Arlie Park hasn’t seen any singletrack development. Thanks to the nudge from local riders and Eugene’s willingness to provide a space for trail development, Richardson anticipates construction on the new mountain bike trails to begin within the next few months. Eugene hired Eddie Kessler of Ptarmigan Trails to consult and help build an overall trail plan. They’ve decided to break the project up into two parts: the trails and the amenities. The amenities include the trailhead itself, bathrooms, parking, and widening the road near the trailhead, which zoning codes require. This shouldn’t be an issue for Eugene, as most of this is standard construction and does not require specialized trail crews. Part two of the project consists of the trails themselves, which Richardson said have been more of a challenge. The city asked for bids on the project, yet few came in. The project spans two building seasons, which is part of the issue with finding a trail-building contractor. “We talked to some of the bigger folks like Dirt Mechanics, and they’re just booked through 2026,” Richardson explained. This isn’t surprising given recent trail expansion and the increased use of specialized trail-building contractors in recent years. Fortunately, as of the time we spoke, Richardson did share that they have received a bid on the project, although the city wasn’t ready to share the details. Eugene received a $1.2 million federal economic development grant for the project. Richardson remains hopeful they will still get the funding, even though the Trump Administration has created uncertainty around how recreation funds are distributed. He doesn’t anticipate that this federal funding will cover the entirety of the project and told us that the city is seeking additional funds. Richardson predicted the Suzanne Arlie project could cost upwards of $2.5–$3 million. Roughly two of the twelve miles of new trail in Suzanne Arlie Park will be an extension of the Ridgeline Trail. Like so many around the country, this existing trail grew in popularity during COVID. However, the trail is more popular with trail runners and hikers, with many miles closed to bike use. Even the sections open to mountain bikes weren’t necessarily where people would want to ride. “Another interesting thing that [Kessler] helped us as an agency kind of get our mind around [was that] pretty much all of Ridgeline has been designed for hikers,” Richardson explained. “[Eugene trails are] not really designed with bikes in mind.” To address this lack of MTB trails, about half of the new trails at Suzanne Arlie will be designed and built with mountain bikers in mind. The trail plans drafted by Kessler and provided to Singletracks call for numerous bike-only trails across the entire difficulty spectrum: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. However, according to Richardson, those are simply Kessler’s recommendations, and the trails will all technically be multi-use. “To start off, we’re not going to designate anything as ‘mountain bikes only,’” Richardson told us. “But things may change as we need to manage.” Despite the mountain biking trails being open to all users, Richardson thinks hikers will know they aren’t on a pedestrian path and will choose a different route. He also said the city will ensure that trails are adequately marked with signs. When all is said and done, there will be over five miles of mountain bike-optimized trails at Suzanne Arlie Park. They will consist of five beginner, four intermediate, and four advanced trails. The remaining four-plus miles of trail will be multi-use, some connecting with the bike-optimized trails to create loops. While there isn’t much information yet about exactly how each of these individual trails will be built, unofficial planning names give some hints. Trail identifiers such as “Enduro 1,” “Blue DH,” “Black DH,” “Family Flow 1,” and others all sound like descending-focused trails. The remaining four-plus miles of new trails in Suzanne Arlie Park will be what the city of Eugene calls “shared use.” And while these trails won’t be designed with mountain biking in mind, Richardson explained that they lean more toward the mountain biking end of the spectrum. “I think just because of how much use and activity there is from mountain bikers, it’s like ‘mountain bike’ and ‘trail design’ [are] kind of in the forefront right now of the best trail design, whether you’re talking about hikers or bikers,” he said. Praise from a city parks planner goes a long way in building a relationship between the city and the local mountain bike community. Richardson hopes to partner with trail organizations like Disciples of Dirt for trail maintenance at Suzanne Arlie. As the project gets closer to kicking off, Richardson knows crews will deal with a relatively short build season. While snow and freeze/thaw aren’t the issue in Eugene, water certainly is. The city can receive up to 50 inches of rainfall annually. When the weather does turn dry, the building window only holds for several weeks before the fire risk creeps to extreme. Richardson and the city of Eugene would love to have the project wrapped up by the end of the 2026 building season. This will depend on the city securing more funds for the Suzanne Arlie Park Project and cooperative building seasons.

Title: Private Credit Is Challenging Banks and Changing the Terrain of CRE Finance

Time Published: 2025-04-09T10:00:25Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy During a climactic moment of the classic 1975 film “Jaws,” the three fishermen finally encounter up close the killer shark they’re hunting, leading actor Roy Scheider’s chief Martin Brody to utter the famous line, “You’re gonna need a bigger boat.” In many ways, here in 2025, the commercial real estate capital markets system is going to need a bigger boat to get a handle on private credit. It’s a less-well understood part of the financing world that has gone from being a minor, back alley lending option 20 years ago into a $1.7 trillion industry that is expected to double its asset volume by the end of the decade. “It has changed a lot, and part of it is just the fact that the market has adapted to think about private credit not as a last resort, but, in many ways, as a first option,” said Josh Zegen, managing principal and co-founder of Madison Realty Capital, a debt fund with $22 billion in assets. Between 2013 and 2023, U.S. private credit — corporate and real estate loans originated by private, nonbank lenders — grew from $141 billion to $853 billion, according to the financial data provider Preqin. That’s not that surprising. The market’s largest players — Apollo Global Management, Ares Management and Blackstone — to say nothing of “smaller” firms, with their $2 billion to $25 billion in assets, have raised money from institutional investors seeking higher returns. This fundraising has come at a time when banks have pulled back their CRE and corporate lending, making the need for private credit financing not just enticing but also necessary. BlackRock now predicts that the global private credit market will double and reach $3.5 trillion by 2030, according to The Wall Street Journal. Much of that has flown into commercial real estate assets underwater at maturity and in need of rescue capital, or ambitious construction projects looking for bridge and senior financing to either get off the ground or across the finish line. “It’s been an incredible positive for the industry, and the amount of liquidity that’s come in, on the credit side, is staggering, and it’s clearly coming from the debt funds,” said Tom Traynor, vice chairman and co-head of large loans at CBRE (CBRE). Traynor noted that as recently as 15 years ago, private credit was limited to a smattering of opportunity funds financing mezzanine pieces. Today the trillion-dollar industry creates highly complex loans, structured with the tightest possible spreads, that fund the full spectrum of core and core-plus assets to value-add and opportunistic real estate credit. “The banks are, by far, the biggest group within the lending universe, but it’s pretty incredible the impact private credit has had on an institutional level, because it’s created really robust competition,” he said. “They’re basically in competition with everybody.” Even long-term players in the private credit space like Zegen are surprised by its rapid evolution, especially when he recalled how investors couldn’t initially differentiate the need to separate real estate equity from traditional credit, or decipher how a novel lending product could deliver better returns than classic fixed-income investments like Treasurys and corporate bonds. “When we started business 21 years ago, from 2004 to 2008, it was everything a bank didn’t want to do — you were dealing with special situations, someone who needed money quickly for a last-minute deal,” said Zegen. “The borrower universe took time to understand, and the same was true for the institutional investor base. It needed to adapt, get educated and put money out.” Seth Weissman, managing partner of Urban Standard Capital, an alternative lender that has financed $1.4 billion worth of CRE projects, listed several factors that have come together to grow the private credit space. First, the 2023 regional banking crisis, which saw four of the five largest commercial bank failures in U.S. history, spooked lenders and depositors alike. Banks pulled back their lending after that. Borrowers then turn to private credit for speed, flexibility and bespoke deal structuring, choosing to go with long-term loans financed by pension funds, asset managers and insurance companies, rather than panicky deposits from Main Street businesses and individual families. “It’s a more institutional and sophisticated investment base, and every private lender is overpaid for their risk,” said Weissman. “They call it the golden age of private credit for a reason.” And it’s not as if banks are weeping at the thought of allowing an unregulated “shadow bank” market to grow unabated. Often, private credit funds bear the risk of various CRE and corporate loans that normally require onerous capital reserve requirements and perhaps several board meetings for a bank to even approve. Large commercial banks like Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase regularly provide back leverage to private credit firms that originate risky CRE debt, mainly through warehouse lines, repurchase agreements and loan-on-loan financings. “It’s competition but it’s also collaborating,” said David Bouton, co-head of U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at Citigroup. “We jointly do deals with clients who are private credit, we source loans and provide back leverage, and in certain ways, it’s actually provided a very good partnership.” Last year, Bouton and Joseph Dyckman, the other head of U.S. CMBS at Citigroup, extended $4 billion of warehouse line repurchase agreements to nonbank lenders, bringing the bank’s total commitment in that space to $13 billion. “I think our clients view it as another way to partner with Citi, and we view it as a way to expand the origination platform,” said Dyckman, who added he’s not too worried about the exponential growth of shadow banking. “Everyone makes a big deal about private credit markets, but private credit can’t withstand the volume we’ll see in the next several years, so there’s still a tremendous opportunity for bank balance sheet lending to continue.” Scott Rechler, chairman of RXR, has been able to view the emergence of private credit through the lens of being both a borrower and a private lender, as his firm launched a $1 billion CRE credit strategy in 2023. Rechler argued that banks like to be lenders to nonbanks due to the favorable credit treatment and the better collateral, as well as the fact that whole loans provided to the funds are often broken up to disentangle risk — which is also easier for borrowers to live with. “What we’re finding, we’re seeing, is an interesting simpatico, where everyone is finding their home and it works for all pieces,” said Rechler. “And, so, that is a good development that will create somewhat more permanent capital for the borrower and re-equitize the CRE space.” Humble origins Unlike its more famous (and maligned) cousin, private equity, which emerged out of the go-go 1980s and was immortalized by movies like Wall Street and books like Barbarians at the Gate, the industry of private credit has its origins in the lending apocalypse that followed the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009. “After the GFC, the Dodd-Frank [financial oversight legislation] went into effect and regulatory oversight pushed business to the shadow banking market. That’s how debt funds got started,” explained James Millon, president of U.S. debt and structured finance at CBRE. In the post-GFC banking landscape, onerous regulations made it more challenging and expensive for traditional lenders to play a role in financing real estate and corporate debt. And, while the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the Term Asset‐Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) were designed to open up liquidity within the asset-backed securitization space, the programs also created an incentive for private debt funds, nonbank lenders and mortgage REITs to open their doors to originate loans and borrow against them at cheap rates. Both Millon and Rechler independently likened the capital markets’ innovation in this period to what occurred when private firms established the modern commercial mortgage-backed securities market in the early 1990s to replace the failed savings and loan industry that began a painful, multiyear collapse in 1987. “After the savings and loan crisis, the nonbank lender that evolved was the CMBS market, which didn’t exist before that,” explained Rechler. “After the GFC, the regulatory environment made it much more challenging and expensive for traditional lenders to play a role, which led to nonbank lenders.” And, at first blush, the nonbank lending industry was relatively small. In 2009, it was only $250 billion, while total private credit assets under management didn’t even reach $1 trillion until 2020, according to data from the Wall Street Journal. “Before it was formalized, and had the glow of being called private credit, the private lending world was hard money lending, it was sharp elbowed and could be called predatory,” said Weissman. But it did fill a void. Michael Gigliotti, senior managing director at JLL Capital Markets, explained that GE Real Estate and Mesa West Capital were among the first that saw the gap in the marketplace of CRE bridge loans that banks were either avoiding due to nonrecourse risk or the dangerous leverage requirements, which flew in the face of new Dodd-Frank mandates. Moreover, investment dollars into various CRE asset classes only grew once the S&P 500 added real estate in 2016 as one of 11 sectors in its Global Industry Classification Standard, pushing real estate finance well beyond the traditional bounds of public REIT stock purchases. “People really gravitated toward [private credit] because it solved issues, and then there wasn’t enough of it, so more people took advantage of it,” said Gigliotti. “Also there was the ability to earn equity-like returns in the credit space because of leverage you could put on their credit.” There were sector specific loans, too, that required the touch of private credit. S3 Capital’s Robert Schwartz, who co-founded his firm in 2013, said that by the mid-2010s regional banks were completely inactive lenders in the sub-$20 million space for construction loans. That allowed his firm to grow quickly by filling that void, mainly in New York City, and eventually nationally. Today S3 Capital has originated $6.3 billion in multifamily bridge and construction loans. “The need for that capital was huge, and the regional banks were ignoring it. There was no real institutional presence in that market back then for those lenders,” said Schwartz. But the Dodd-Frank rules, while well intentioned to rein in the excesses of the commercial and investment banks that nearly blew up the global financial system, also had an unintended side effect. After 2008, the government no longer wanted to see banks use the deposits of Joe Six-Pack or Molly Main Street to finance CRE investment sales, construction projects, lease-ups or repostings. Instead, they wanted that financing to come from institutional investors that could bear the brunt of any losses (and certainly the headlines). “The regulation is well intended but it’s not executed well,” said Weissman. “As it’s become harder to get loans from banks, it’s opened up the desire and demand for alternative financing, and that’s what’s accelerated that business.” Clients for you. Clients for me? For both banks and nonbank lenders alike, the crux of their business model is to secure clients — either depositors or long-term investors, sometimes direct referrals, often repeat borrowers — that allow them to make loans on lucrative assets. Now that a second player has entered the credit space, however, banks are feeling the heat as there’s only a limited number of clients to service and only so much debt needed at once. “The thought process that your local banker is your tried and true, to be trusted for all your banking needs, mortgages, lines of credit, has been turned on its head with the prevalence of private credit,” said real estate finance attorney Christine O’Connell, a partner at King & Spalding. “Back in 2008 to 2010, when banks pulled back and private credit came in, it was seen as dangerous for borrowers. But, as these players have grown in the space, it’s almost become the banks that used to be there.” Those who have succeeded in the alternative lending space believe they can offer their borrowers services that banks either can’t do or won’t do, particularly speed of execution and the ability to take over stalled projects and foreclosures due to their vertically integrated structure. Marcello Cricco-Lizza, principal of global commercial real estate at Balbec Capital, an alternative investment manager with $7 billion in assets, argued that large bank loans often take months to close, due to regulatory constraints, while bank appraisals can take two to three weeks as nervous boards review the details. “There’s a whole slew of borrowers for whom bank financing just doesn’t make sense. There’s not enough proceeds, and they can’t go high enough in leverage,” he said. “Whereas, we can add higher leverage on our loans and have the sophistication to take over those properties and work them out that banks don’t have.” Aside from the ability to offer higher loan-to-value ratios, there’s a certain personal touch that many private credit asset managers tend to advertise as well. Warren de Haan, CEO and managing partner of Acore Capital, a CRE investment firm with $19 billion in AUM, noted that his company currently has 80 borrowers with whom they’ve made at least three deals, and that “there’s not much reason for them to go elsewhere,” due to the familiarity between both parties. “Today, when you have a difficult macro environment with higher interest rates, there’s more of a hands-on asset management function that’s required for borrowers to feel they’ve had a great experience,” he said. “Everything we do feeds the funnel of production, so our goal is to give our clients a white-glove experience.” Investors have taken notice of the more borrower-friendly landscape. The proportion of bank lending compared to all corporate borrowing dropped from 44 percent in 2020 to 35 percent in 2023, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In an increasingly situational and deal-specific marketplace, where borrowers choose their lenders based on deal theme and expertise, banks have responded by highlighting their resumés and relationships, to say nothing of their global, multinational outreach. “Banks are leaning in on strong relationships that they have to keep their clients, but I don’t think they’re expanding into too many new relationships,” said David Perlman, managing director at Thorofare Capital, a vertically integrated commercial real estate debt manager. “If you have a good relationship, you’ll get a good bank quote, but it’s very competitive.” Perlman added that the largest commercial banks have the luxury of holding a global viewpoint toward their clients’ business needs. This allows them to be more flexible on deal structures, like waving upfront fees and yield maintenance, due to the global revenue their deposits eventually accrue. Attorney Scott Levine, a partner at King & Spalding, told CO that relationships “are a huge reason” why his CRE clients go to certain banks for financing, and that debt funds were known in the post-GFC landscape from 15 years ago to sometimes sell off pieces of their loans. “Borrowers have historically felt the debt funds were more likely to sell than the banks, particularly when things went south, and that’s when they got concerned,” he said. “The banks may have been selling pieces of loans, but they were generally sticking around in the deal — and, for borrowers, they knew who was on the phone when they called.” But the outlook is not entirely sunny for U.S. commercial banking. Most banks’ legacy portfolios have issues, whether from 30-year mortgages written at low interest rates, or 10-year office loans now completely underwater. Plus, almost every bank is feeling the heat from nervous depositors, who are tempted by Treasurys, money market accounts, mutual funds and, yes, debt funds. Moreover, the uncertainty of Basel III — an international framework on bank capital requirements and liquidity and leverage regulations — has also depressed the sector’s standing among borrowers, as banks have been more cautious about extending CRE loans amid the Basel fog, which requires higher capital requirements to compensate for the increased risk. So, ironically, banks have responded to the competition from private credit by becoming the private credit industry’s lender of choice, and changing the nature of commercial real estate finance in the process. Risk vs. reward As Stuart Boesky explains it, the banks just got tired of carrying all the risk in big CRE projects. The industry veteran and CEO of Pembrook Capital told CO that the nation’s largest banks actively decided that it would be most cost effective for the active fund managers to take some of their “smaller” clients away from them. In return, the banks would help these entities by originating large loans at advance rates that reduced risk and allowed themselves to remain participants in the CRE market, albeit with a smaller staff and less overhead. The debt funds, in turn, generated new business and created clients for life. “Until very recently, I think the banks were happy to let the funds do their business,” said Boesky. “I don’t think that business was profitable to banks due to cost of capital and regulatory requirements and so they were very willing to lend to those big funds.” Through warehouse-type facilities and repurchase structures (repos) – which include note-on-note finances, joint venture uni-trench loans and single-asset repos — the banks have been able to originate safer CRE loans that receive better capital treatment and that place balance sheet risk in the hands of safer sponsors. “Their desire to finance us is top of their list,” said de Haan. “It’s a partnership between alternative lenders and the banks that results in more liquidity available at an attractive cost for the CRE industry, and that’s a positive long-term trend.” Balbec Capital’s Cricco-Lizza has called this universe of lender financing “the most competitive sector today within all of CRE,” and said that the competitive nature among debt funds for bank loan business has pushed out many regional banks that otherwise would be making bridge and construction loans. “Everyone wants to be in it,” he said. “Because the people providing lender financing don’t take a loss, if you do the work property, but it’s a low-risk business where you can still earn some spread, and a lot of bigger banks in direct CRE lending have done pretty poorly.” Citigroup’s Dyckman said lender financings allowed his commercial bank to originate certain types of loans they normally wouldn’t consider because they have a professional banking partner with them to carry most of the risk. “Now we can do deals with size,” said Dyckman. “It’s been a tremendous sort of growth for us over the last 12 months.” But, like anything in the nebulous waters of high finance, enormous risks balance out the enormous rewards. Boesky argued that in many respects the evolution of debt funds is a good thing, as banks in the post-GFC years offered historically low LTV levels on CRE loans that would’ve depressed the product across all sectors had debt funds not come into existence. But he cautioned that private credit might be growing too large, too quickly. “As they raise more and more money, they get more competitive, which means they have to price their loan products at points that don’t adequately compensate them for the associated risk,” he said. “And sometimes things like that end badly.” Rechler — who is both a borrower of, and lender in, private credit — admitted that there is a lack of transparency on the capital that has created some risk in this new system. “When banks do it, the regulators know exactly what’s out there, they know what banks are lending and how much to each sector, but that’s not really transparent on these funds,” he said. Casual observers should recognize that if a black swan event occurs, commercial banks’ exposure is limited because they are lending at a senior position to the funds. They’ll be more protected than the actual investors into private credit, who would take the first losses. “If there’s margin calls, or a COVID-style event, all of sudden the leverage providers to private credit will call in their loans, and a lot of lenders don’t have that margin call type of facility,” said Weissman. “It’s not that there’s no risk. There’s a transfer of risk and repricing of risk that’s happening here.” Others in the space are bullish no matter what the market brings. Zegen conceded that while there’s room for multiple players, the investor base of private credit is expanding away from institutions to now encompass wealth managers, IRA accounts, and individual retail investors “They’re funding the next age of private credit, and more and more it’s taking the place of banks,” said Zegen. “We’re in the early innings of it.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: The God Box

The religious roots of climate-conscious investing. In 2020, an investment strategy was all the rage on Wall Street: ESG, or environmental, social and governance investing. It’s a wonky term with a simple premise: Companies that manage the risks and opportunities posed by societal issues like climate change will perform better, especially in the long term. For a moment, it seemed Wall Street could be part of the solution to the climate crisis, driving companies to decarbonize — if not to save the planet, to protect their own bottom lines. That was, until a fierce and widespread backlash against ESG took hold. To understand the backlash to ESG, and, more specifically, climate-conscious investing, it helps to first understand its humble origins. Part of that history began about as far from Wall Street as possible, spiritually anyway, with faith-based investors. “Going back 100 years, some religious organizations felt that their faith and values had to be reflected in their investments too,” said Tim Smith, policy adviser and a founder of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. For example, “United Methodists wouldn't have invested in tobacco and alcohol,” he said. But in 1971, the religious community entered a new chapter, sparked by the atrocities of apartheid in South Africa. Smith said the Episcopal Church had been outspoken on the issue, but realized its money told a different story. The church was invested in companies and banks doing business as usual in South Africa. So leaders decided to file a shareholder resolution, to ask General Motors to pull out of South Africa. “The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church went to the General Motors stockholders meeting and spoke, dressed in his Episcopal finery, and challenged General Motors on the moral justification for staying there,” Smith said. It took 15 years of fighting and growing public pressure, but in 1986, General Motors relented, citing moral and financial reasons. It was a pivotal moment in church and business history, Smith said, “because that kind of appeal to a company through the shareholder resolution process, especially by a church group, had not been happening.” In the decades that followed, faith-based investors started pressing companies in their portfolios on other social issues like labor, discrimination, and pollution. Pat Daly, a member of the Sisters of St. Dominic of Caldwell in New Jersey, led the charge on pushing companies to act on climate change. Daly died in 2022, but by all accounts, she was a force. For decades, she pushed huge corporations like GE, Ford and Exxon Mobil to take steps to address their environmental impact. In a 2016 interview, Daly credited the decades of work from faith-based investors for laying the groundwork for ESG investing. “I think the legacy is that we really have started the ESG movement,” she said. “We've set it in play, and it's taking off.” By the early 2000s, Wall Street was paying attention to these issues too, but for a very different reason: The bottom line.

[Lest we forget the crimes perpetrated by Pfizer, we repost this article by Dr. Naomi Wolf, first published by GR in October 2024.] Our book, The Pfizer Papers: Pfizer’s Crimes Against Humanity, was published October 15 and became an immediate bestseller. This is a book that three governments—the US, the UK and Australia—all sought to suppress. The story of how it came to be is extraordinary—3,250 highly credentialed doctors and scientists under the leadership of one extraordinary woman, Amy Kelly, worked for two years on the 450,000 internal Pfizer documents released under court order by a successful lawsuit by attorney Aaron Siri. In the process these volunteers confirmed the greatest crime against humanity of all time. Read on. This book in your hands is the result of an extraordinary set of confluences. It also presents, in a format available in bookstores for the first time, material that has already changed history. You are about to embark as a reader on a journey through an extraordinary story—one whose elements almost defy belief. The Pfizer Papers is the result of a group of strangers—ordinary people with extraordinary skills, located in different places around the world, with different backgrounds and interests—who all came together, for no money or professional recompense at all; out of the goodness of their hearts, and motivated by love for true medicine and true science—to undertake a rigorous, painfully detailed, and complex research project, which spanned the years 2022 to the present, and which continues to this day. The material they read through and analyzed involved 450,000 pages of documents, all written in extremely dense, technical language. This far-flung, relentlessly pursued research project—under the leadership of DailyClout’s COO, the remarkably gifted project director Amy Kelly—brought one of the largest and most corrupt institutions in the world, Pfizer, to its knees. This project, pursued by 3,250 strangers who worked virtually and became friends and colleagues, drove a global pharmaceutical behemoth to lose billions of dollars in revenue. It balked the plans of the most powerful politicians on earth. It bypassed the censorship of the most powerful tech companies on earth. This is the ultimate David and Goliath story. The story began when lawyer Aaron Siri successfully sued the Food and Drug Administration, to compel them to release “The Pfizer Documents.” These are Pfizer’s internal documents—as noted above, 450,000 pages in number—that detail the clinical trials Pfizer conducted in relation to its COVID mRNA injection. These trials were undertaken to secure the ultimate prize for a pharmaceutical company, the “EUA,” or Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. The FDA awarded EUA for ages 16+ to Pfizer in December 2020. The “pandemic,” of course (a crisis in public health that a book of mine, The Bodies of Others, confirmed, involved hyped and manipulated “infections” data and skewed mortality documentation) became the pretext for the “urgency” that led the FDA to bestow EUA on Pfizer’s (and Moderna’s) novel drug. The EUA is the hall pass, essentially, allowing Pfizer to race right to market with a not-fully-tested product. The Pfizer Papers also contains documentation of what happened in “post-marketing,” meaning in the three months, December 2020 to February 2021, as the vaccine was rolled out upon the public. All leading spokespeople, and bought-off media, called the injection “safe and effective,” reading from what was a centralized script. Many people who took this injection, as it was launched in 2020–2021–2022 and to the present, did not realize that normal testing for safety of a new vaccine—testing that typically takes ten to twelve years—had simply been bypassed via the mechanisms of a “state of emergency” and the FDA’s “Emergency Use Authorization.” They did not understand that the real “testing” was in fact Pfizer and the FDA observing whatever was happening to them and their loved ones, after these citizens rolled up their sleeves and submitted to the shot. As we can never forget, many millions of these people who submitted to the injection were “mandated” to take it, facing the threat of job loss, suspension of their education, or loss of their military positions if they refused; in some US states and overseas countries, people also faced the suspension of their rights to take transportation, cross borders, go to school or college, receive certain medical procedures, or enter buildings such as churches and synagogues, restaurants and gyms—if they refused. The FDA asked the judge in the Aaron Siri lawsuit to withhold the release of the Pfizer documents for seventy-five years. Why would a government agency wish to conceal certain material until the present generation, those affected by what is in these documents, is dead and gone? There can be no good answer to that question. Fortunately for history, and fortunately for millions of people whose lives were saved by this decision, the judge refused the FDA’s request, and compelled the release of the documents; a tranche of 55,000 pages per month. When I heard about this, though, I was concerned as a journalist. I knew that no reporter had the bandwidth to go through material of this volume. I also understood that virtually no reporter had the training or skill sets required to understand the multidimensional, technically highly specialized language of the reports. In order to understand the reports, one would need a background in immunology; statistics; biostatistics; pathology; oncology; sports medicine; obstetrics; neurology; cardiology; pharmacology; cellular biology; chemistry; and many other specialties. In addition to doctors and scientists, in order to understand what was really happening in the Pfizer documents, you would also need people deeply knowledgeable about government and pharmaceutical industry regulatory processes; you would need people who understood the FDA approval process; you would need medical fraud specialists; and eventually, in order to understand what crimes were committed in the Papers, you would need lawyers. I was worried that without people with all of those skill sets reading through the documents, their volume and complexity would lead them to vanish down “the memory hole.” Enter Steve Bannon, the former Naval Officer, former Goldman Sachs investment banker, former advisor to President Trump, and current host of the most popular political podcast in America and one of the most listened-to worldwide, WarRoom. He and I come from opposite ends of the political spectrum. I had been a lifelong Democrat, an advisor to President Bill Clinton’s reelection campaign, and to Al Gore’s presidential campaign. He, of course, is a staunch Republican-turned-MAGA. I had been deplatformed in June 2021, before the Pfizer documents came out, for the crime of warning that women were reporting menstrual dysregulation upon having received the mRNA injections. As a career-long writer on women’s sexual and reproductive health issues, I knew that this was a serious danger signal and that this side effect would affect fertility. (Any eighth grader should be able to foresee that as well.) Upon my having posted this warning, I was banned from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms. I was attacked globally, all at once, as an “anti-vaxxer” and “conspiracy theorist”; and my life as a well-known, bestselling feminist author, within the legacy media, ended. No one in that world would talk to me anymore, publish my work, or return my calls. I was un-personed. (It turned out, upon two successful lawsuits in 2023 by Missouri and Louisiana attorneys general, that it was actually the White House, the CDC, and senior leaders of other government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, that unlawfully pressured Twitter and Facebook to remove that cautionary tweet of mine, to shut me down, and to “BOLO” or Be On the Lookout for similar posts. This suppression is now the subject of a pending Supreme Court decision on whether or not it violated the First Amendment.) In this dark time in my life, to my surprise, I received a text from Steve Bannon’s producer, who invited me onto WarRoom. I brought forward my concerns about women’s reproductive health in the wake of mRNA injection, and to my surprise he was respectful, thoughtful about the implications, and took the issue very seriously. I returned again and again, to bring that and other concerns that were emerging in relation to the mRNA injections to his audience. I was relieved to have a platform on which I could share these urgent warnings. At the same time, I was sad that the Left, which was supposed to champion feminism, seemed not to care at all about serious risks to women and unborn babies. I recognized the irony that a person whom I had been taught to believe was the Devil Incarnate, actually cared more about women and babies than did all of my right-on former colleagues, including the feminist health establishment, who had always spoken so loudly about women’s wellbeing and women’s rights. Given my appearances on WarRoom leading up to 2022, it was natural that the subject of the Pfizer documents came up on that show when the documents were released. I shared my concern that they would be lost to history due to their volume and technical language. Bannon said something like, “Well, you will crowdsource a project to read through them.” I was taken aback, as I had zero skills related to, or knowledge about how possibly to do such a thing. I answered something like, “Of course.” So, my news and opinion platform DailyClout was deluged with offers from around the world, from WarRoom listeners with the skill sets needed, to decipher the Pfizer documents. I was terrified. It was chaos. I had excellent people on my team. But none of us knew how to manage or even organize the deluge of emails; we did not know how to evaluate the thousands of CVs; and even once we had “onboarded” these thousands of people, in different time zones, to “the project,” our inboxes became even more terrifying, as it was literally impossible to organize 3,250 experts into an organization chart that could systematically work through these documents. Emails were getting tangled or went unanswered. People asked questions we could not answer. We had no idea what structure could allow such a huge number of disparate experts to work through the vast trove of material. A few weeks in, as I was in despair, Bannon had me on again. He asked about the progress of the project, and I replied, more upbeat than I felt, that many people had joined us, and they were starting to read. “Of course, you will begin delivering reports,” he prompted. “Of course,” I answered, horrified at being in so far over my head. I have never had a corporate job, so it had not even occurred to me that a series of reports was the format that the analyses of the documents should take. Then something happened that I can only describe as providential. We put out a call to the volunteers for a project manager, and Amy Kelly reached out. Ms. Kelly is a Six Sigma-certified project manager, with extensive experience in telecommunications and tech project management. She is also a simply inexplicably effective leader. The day that she put her hand to the chaos in the inboxes, the waters were stilled. Peace and productivity prevailed. Ms. Kelly somehow effortlessly organized the volunteers into six working groups, with a supra-committee at the head of each, and the proper work began. I can only explain the scope and smoothness and effectiveness of the work that followed, as occurring in a state of grace. In the two years since Ms. Kelly and the volunteers have been working together, they have gone through 2,369 documents and data files totaling hundreds of thousands of pages and have issued almost one hundred reports. I taught the volunteers to write these in a language that everyone could understand—which I thought was very important to maximize their impact. And Amy Kelly meticulously revised almost all, and edited all, of them. The first forty-six reports appeared in a self-published format that we put out. It was very important to us that they appear in a published form that was physical, and not just digital, as we wanted something that people could hand to their doctors, their loved ones, their congressional representatives. These forty-six reports broke huge stories. We learned that Pfizer knew within three months after rollout in December 2020, that the vaccines did not work to stop COVID. Pfizer’s language was “vaccine failure” and “failure of efficacy.” One of the most common “adverse events” in the Pfizer documents is “COVID.” Pfizer knew that the vaccine materials—lipid nanoparticles, an industrial fat, coated in polyethylene glycol, a petroleum byproduct; mRNA; and spike protein—did not remain in the deltoid muscle, as claimed by all spokespeople. Rather, it dispersed throughout the body in forty-eight hours “like a shotgun blast,” as one of the authors, Dr. Robert Chandler, put it; it crossed every membrane in the human body—including the blood-brain barrier—and accumulated in the liver, adrenals, spleen, brain, and, if one is a woman, in the ovaries. Dr. Chandler saw no mechanism whereby those materials leave the body, so every injection appears to pack more such materials into organs. Pfizer hired 2,400 fulltime staffers to help process “the large increase of adverse event reports” being submitted to the company’s Worldwide Safety database. Pfizer knew by April 2021 that the injections damaged the hearts of young people. Pfizer knew by February 28, 2021—just ninety days after the public rollout of their COVID vaccine—that its injection was linked to a myriad of adverse events. Far from being “chills,” “fever,” “fatigue,” as the CDC and other authorities claimed were the most worrying side effects, the actual side effects were catastrophically serious. These side effects included: death (which Pfizer does list as a “serious adverse event”). Indeed, over 1,233 deaths in first three months of the drug being publicly available. Severe COVID-19; liver injury; neurological adverse events; facial paralysis; kidney injury; autoimmune diseases; chilblains (a localized form of vasculitis that affects the fingers and toes); multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (when more than one organ system is failing at once); the activation of dormant herpes zoster infections; skin and mucus membrane lesions; respiratory issues; damaged lung structure; respiratory failure; acute respiratory distress syndrome (a lung injury in which fluid leaks from the blood vessels into the lung tissue, causing stiffness which makes it harder to breathe and causes a reduction of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange); and SARS (or SARS-CoV-1, which had not been seen in the world since 2004, but appears in the Pfizer documents as a side effect of the injections). Thousands of people with arthritis-type joint pain, one of the most common side effect, were recorded. Other thousands with muscle pain, the second most common. Then, industrial-scale blood diseases: blood clots, lung clots, leg clots; thrombotic thrombocytopenia, a clotting disease of the blood vessels; vasculitis (the destruction of blood vessels via inflammation); astronomical rates of neurological disorders—dementias, tremors, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, epilepsies. Horrific skin conditions. A florid plethora of cardiac issues; myocarditis, pericarditis, tachycardia, arrhythmia, and so on. Half of the serious adverse events related to the liver, including death, took place within seventy-two hours of the shot. Half of the strokes took place within forty-eight hours of injection. But what really emerged from the first forty-six reports, was the fact that though COVID is ostensibly a respiratory disease, the papers did not focus on lungs or mucus membranes, but rather they center, creepily and consistently, on disrupting human reproduction. By the time Pfizer’s vaccine rolled out to the public, the pharmaceutical giant knew that they would be killing babies and significantly harming women and men’s reproduction. The material in the documents makes it clear that damaging human’s ability to reproduce and causing spontaneous abortions of babies is “not a bug, it is a feature.” Pfizer told vaccinated men to use two reliable forms of contraception or else to abstain from sex with childbearing-age women. In its protocol, the company defined “exposure” to the vaccine as including skin-to-skin contact, inhalation, and sexual contact. Pfizer mated vaccinated female rats and “untreated” male rats, and then examined those males, females, and their offspring for vaccine-related “toxicity.” Based on just forty-four rats (and no humans), Pfizer declared no negative outcomes for “. . . mating performance, fertility, or any ovarian or uterine parameters . . . nor on embryo-fetal or postnatal survival, growth, or development,” the implication being that its COVID vaccine was safe in pregnancy and did not harm babies. Pfizer knew that lipid nanoparticles have been known for years, to degrade sexual systems, and Amy Kelly in fact found nanoparticles, of which lipid nanoparticles are a subtype, pass through the blood-testis barrier and damage males’ Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and germ cells. Those are the factories of masculinity, affecting the hormones that turn boys at adolescence into men, with deep voices, broad shoulders, and the ability to father children. So, we have no idea if baby boys born to vaccinated moms, will turn into adults who are recognizably male and fertile. Pfizer enumerated the menstrual damages it knew it was causing to thousands of women, and the damage ranges from women bleeding every day, to having two periods a month, to no periods at all; to women hemorrhaging and passing tissue; to menopausal and post-menopausal women beginning to bleed again. Pfizer’s scientists calmly observed and noted it all but did not tell women. Babies suffered and died. In one section of the documents, over 80 percent of the pregnancies followed resulted in miscarriage or spontaneous abortion. In another section of the documents, two newborn babies died, and Pfizer described the cause of death as “maternal exposure” to the vaccine. Image is from Children’s Health Defense Pfizer knew that vaccine materials entered vaccinated moms’ breast milk and poisoned babies. Four women’s breast milk turned “blue-green.” Pfizer produced a chart of sick babies, made ill from breastfeeding from vaccinated moms, with symptoms ranging from fever to edema (swollen flesh) to hives to vomiting. One poor baby had convulsions and was taken to the ER, where it died of multi-organ system failure. I will now take you to the thirty-six reports you will find in this book. Some of the headlines from the reports that follow are: On Feb 28, 2021, Pfizer produced “Pregnancy and Lactation Cumulative Review” showing that after mothers’ vaccination with its vaccine: * Stroke. * Facial paralysis. * Kidney injury or failure. * The most powerful forces in the world—including the White House, the staffers of the United States president himself; Dr. Rochelle Walensky of the CDC; the head of the FDA, Dr. Robert M Califf; Dr. Anthony Fauci; Twitter and Facebook; legacy media, including the New York Times, the BBC, the Guardian and NPR; OfCom, the British media regulatory agency; professional organizations such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, and the European Medicines Agency, the European equivalent of the FDA, and the Therapeutics Goods Administration, Australia’s equivalent of the FDA—all sought to suppress the information that Amy Kelly, the research volunteers, and I brought to the world starting in 2022, and that you are about to absorb in the following pages. Nonetheless, in spite of the most powerful censorship and retribution campaign launched in human history—made more powerful than past such campaigns by the amplifying effects of social media and AI—these volunteers’ findings were not suppressed at last, and survived on alternative media, and on our site DailyClout.io; to be shared from mouth to mouth, saving millions of lives. Fast forward to more recent events. What has the role of this information been in stopping this greatest crime ever committed against humanity? The worst has happened. Disabilities are up by a million a month in the United States, according to former BlackRock hedge fund manager Edward Dowd. Excess deaths are way up in the US and Western Europe. Birth rates have plummeted, according to the mathematician Igor Chudov (and WarRoom/DailyClout Volunteer Researcher Dr. Robert Chandler) by 13–20 percent since 2021, based on government databases. Athletes are dropping dead. Turbo-cancers are on the rise. Conventional doctors may be “baffled” by all of this, but sadly, we, thanks to Amy Kelly and the volunteers, understand exactly what is happening. Our relentless effort to get this information to the world, in an unimpeachable form, has finally paid off with results. The uptake for boosters is now 4 percent. Very few people “boosted” their children. Most colleges in the United States withdrew their vaccine “mandates.” Pfizer’s net revenue dropped in Q1 of 2024 to pre-2016 levels. OfCom, which had targeted Mark Steyn for “platforming” on his show my description of the reproductive and other harms in the Pfizer documents, is being sued by Steyn. The BBC had to report that vaccine injuries are real, as did the New York Times. AstraZeneca, a somewhat differently configured COVID vaccine in Europe, was withdrawn from the market in May 2024, following lawsuits involving thrombotic thrombocytopenia (a side effect about which our research volunteer Dr. Carol Taccetta had informed the FDA by letter in 2022), and the European Medicines Agency notably withdrew its EUA for AstraZeneca. Three days after we published our report showing that the FDA and CDC had received the eight-page “Pregnancy and Lactation Cumulative Review” confirming that Dr. Walensky knew about the lethality of the vaccine when she held her press conference telling pregnant women to get the injection, Dr. Walensky resigned. It is difficult indeed to face this material in the roles that Amy Kelly and I play. No doubt for the volunteers, unearthing this criminal evidence is painful indeed. It may be hard to read some of what follows. As I have said elsewhere, seeing this material is like being among the Allied soldiers who first opened the gates of Auschwitz. But the truth must be told. Among other important reasons to tell these truths, people were injured and killed with a novel technology not deployed before in medicine; and these pages hold important clues as to the mechanisms of these injuries, and thus, they provide many signposts for physicians and scientists in the future, for treating the many injuries that these new mRNA technologies, injected into people’s bodies, have brought about. We must share the truth, as the truth saves and sustains; and eventually, the truth will heal. * We thank Steve Bannon, and his wonderful team at WarRoom, for being the instigator of this entire project and for consistently bringing us onto his show so that we can tell the world what the volunteers find. We thank Skyhorse Publishing, publisher Tony Lyons, and our editor Hector Carosso, for taking the critical step of publishing this material in a book that will be available everywhere. Books matter, and this publication will make a difference in bringing about accountability and an accurate history of this catastrophic set of events. We thank the volunteers, 3,250 strangers around the world who banded together in the love of truth and of their fellow human beings. We thank our two hundred lawyers, who helped us to FOIA emails from the CDC and helped us to understand the crimes that we were seeing in the following pages. Many of our volunteers themselves have suffered ostracism, job loss, marginalization, and other penalties, as a consequence of their commitment to real science, real medicine, and to bringing forth the truth to save their fellow human beings, and generations yet unborn. * The battle is ongoing. No one who committed this massive crime against humanity is in jail, or even facing civil or criminal charges. There are at least three lawsuits against Pfizer—two of ours, and one of Brook Jackson’s—but, to date, none of the lawsuits have completely prevailed. The litigation drags on. Nonetheless—nonetheless. The word is out. Amy Kelly and I get hundreds of emails from grateful families, telling us about their healthy babies or grandchildren and thanking us for saving those babies, or sons and daughters and daughters-in-law, and we know this project has saved many lives; perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives and maybe saved millions from disabling injuries. Steve Bannon, who started it all, saved hundreds of thousands of lives and saved his listeners and ours from sustaining millions of injuries. God know how many babies will be born in the future, safe and well, because of our collective, arduous, much-targeted work. The story of this project is not over. Your own actions, upon your having read these reports, are part of the ongoing ripples of this work. Whom will you tell? How will you process the information? What will you do to avenge the crimes of the past? What will you do to save the future? * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Global Times Economic coercion and blackmail underscores Washington's hegemonic mindset: expert By Ma Jingjing Published: Apr 09, 2025 12:23 AM Chinese Foreign Ministry and Commerce Ministry on Tuesday vowed to take countermeasures to safeguard rights and interests, in response to US President Donald Trump's recent claims of escalating tariffs unless China withdrew its retaliatory tariffs against the US by April 8. In a post on Truth Social on Monday, the US president has threatened China with an extra 50 percent tariff on goods imported into the US if China does not withdraw its 34 percent counter-tariff on US products, according to CNBC. "We will not let anyone take away the Chinese people's legitimate right to development. We will not tolerate any attempt to harm China's sovereignty, security and development interests. We will continue to take resolute and strong measures to safeguard our legitimate rights and interests," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in response at the regular Foreign Ministry press conference on Tuesday. Lin said that judging from its actions, the US doesn't seem to be serious about having talks right now. "If the US truly wants to talk, it should let people see that they're ready to treat others with equality, respect and mutual benefit. If the US decides not to care about the interests of the US itself, China and the rest of the world, and is determined to fight a tariff and trade war, China's response will continue to the end," Lin said. In a statement published on its website on Tuesday, China's Commerce Ministry said China will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its rights and interests should the US escalate its tariff measures. Citing sources or experts, Niutanqin, one of the self-media accounts, posted on Tuesday that China could take six possible measures against the US' tariffs, including significantly increasing tariffs on US agricultural products such as soybeans and sorghum, banning US poultry imports, suspending China-US cooperation on fentanyl-related issues, imposing curbs on services trade with the US, reducing or banning the import of US films, and investigating the intellectual property benefits of US companies operating in China. China will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its legitimate and lawful rights and interests, Lin said on Tuesday, noting that the ministry does not comment on what's been said on the internet. Escalated pressure While showing no intention to pause the sweeping "reciprocal tariffs," Trump continues to intensify pressure on its trade partners including China, the EU, Japan and Canada. "The European Union's been very bad to us," Trump told reporters at the White House, accusing European nations of not buying enough US goods. "They're going to have to buy their energy from us, because they need it and they're going to have to buy it from us. They can buy it, we can knock off $350 billion in one week," Reuters reported, citing the US president. On Monday evening, the European Commission proposed its first retaliatory tariffs at 25 percent on a range of US imports in response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, Reuters reported, citing an internal document. The tariffs on some goods will take effect on May 16 and others later in the year, on December 1, the document said, Reuters reported. In addition, Trump wrote in another post on Truth Social on Monday that Japan has "treated the US very poorly on Trade. They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs." The US Department of Commerce, as part of an annual review process, plans to hike duties on Canadian lumber from 14.4 percent to 34.45 percent, CNN reported on Monday, citing published and unpublished filings in the Federal Register. "The economic coercion and blackmail underscores Washington's hegemonic mindset - seeking 'America First' and 'American exceptionalism' by forcing others to make sacrifices," He Weiwen, a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The US' unilateral and protectionist behaviors run counter to the WTO's multilateral trading rules as well as other countries' legitimate rights and interests, He said, stressing that China's resolute countermeasures against US bullying are necessary to safeguard true multilateralism and maintain the multilateral trading system. Self-inflicted isolation "By imposing high tariffs on all of its trade partners, including China, the US risks trade and economic isolation," Yu Miaojie, president of Liaoning University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. In the short term, global trade may be adversely affected and global growth may be dragged down. However, the US' tariffs will have limited impact on China's exports, given that the country has made efforts to diversify export destinations over the past several years and form a new pattern of all-round opening-up in various fields and sectors, Yu said. "Instead, US tariffs will lead to higher prices, adding to inflationary pressure while slowing US economic growth," he said. Larry Fink, CEO of US multinational investment firm BlackRock, said US stock markets could fall another 20 percent as steep US tariffs will lead some investors to believe the US economy may already be contracting, Reuters reported. "Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now," Fink told the Economic Club of New York on Monday, Reuters said. Ken Langone, co-founder of US home improvement specialty retailer Home Depot, blasted the tariffs, describing the 34 percent tariff rate on China as "too aggressive, too soon," the Financial Times reported. "I believe he's been poorly advised by his advisers about this trade situation - and the formula they're applying," said Langone The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents millions of US businesses big and small but which is heavily funded by industry titans, is considering suing the Trump administration to block the implementation of Trump's new tariffs set to go into effect Wednesday, Fortune reported on Tuesday, citing sources with direct knowledge of the discussions. The US Chamber could argue that Trump's invocation of emergency powers to impose the new tariffs is illegal. Last week a nonprofit called New Civil Liberties Alliance took a similar approach, filing suit on behalf of a small business owner who imports goods from China, arguing that the US President did not have the legal authority to impose his February tariffs on China, according to the report. "Faced with the US' bullying practices, all other economies will have to figure out how to overcome challenges. Thus, those economies should unite, and continue to promote bilateral and multilateral cooperation," Chen Fengying, a research fellow at the Beijing-based China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Tuesday. China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) hosted a roundtable meeting with US-funded companies on Sunday, reaffirming the country's commitment to reform and opening-up amid global trade tensions, according to a statement on the MOFCOM website on Monday. Regardless of global uncertainties, China remains resolute in its path toward reform and opening-up, Ling Ji, vice minister of commerce and deputy China international trade representative, said at the meeting, noting that multilateralism is the inevitable solution to the challenges facing the world and that China's door to the outside world will only open wider.

Title: US will not let China disrupt Panama Canal: Pentagon chief

Hegseth is the second senior US official to visit Panama since President Donald Trump took office in January vowing to "take back" the US-built canal to counter what he sees as China's influence over the waterway. "Today, the Panama Canal faces ongoing threats," Hegseth said in a speech at a police station located at the entry to the shipping route. "The United States of America will not allow communist China or any other country to threaten the canal's operation or integrity," he added. The United States built the more than century-old canal and handed it over to Panama in 1999. Hegseth met with Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino, with the two issuing a joint statement that affirmed security ties -- though there was a notable discrepancy in the versions released by both sides on the issue of Panama's sovereignty over the canal.

That sentence did not appear in the English-language statement released by the US government. - 'Wonder of the world' - A Hong Kong company operates two ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. The Trump administration has put immense pressure on Panama to reduce what it calls Chinese influence on the canal, which Washington sees as a threat to US national security. Panama has denied the assertions that China exercises undue control over the waterway, but its protests on the subject have grown weaker and on the eve of Hegseth's visit it accused the Hong Kong company of failing to meet its contractual obligations. "I want to be very clear. China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal. And China will not weaponize this canal," Hegseth said, calling it a "wonder of the world." Speaking alongside Mulino, Hegseth said the US and Panama together would "take back the Panama Canal from China's influence" and keep it open to all nations, using the "deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world." He claimed that China's control of critical infrastructure in the canal area gave Beijing the power to conduct spying activities across Panama, making Panama and the United States "less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign." The Chinese Embassy in Panama issued a statement refuting Hegseth's claim that Beijing interferes in the operations of the canal. "China has never taken part in the management or operation of the Panama Canal, nor has it interfered in issues" concerning the waterway, the statement said, calling on Washington to halt "blackmail" and "plundering" of Panama and other countries of the region. It labeled Hegseth's comments "not at all responsible or founded" and said the United States "has orchestrated a sensationalist campaign based on the 'China threat theory' so as to undermine cooperation between China and Panama." It added: "China has always respected Panama's sovereignty with regard to the canal." - Pressure on port company - The concession to the HK-based company's subsidiary to operate Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and Cristobal port on the Atlantic side was first granted in 1997 and renewed for another 25 years in 2021. But faced with Trump's repeated threats to seize the canal, Panama has put pressure on CK Hutchison to pull out of the country. In January, it began an audit of Panama Ports -- the subsidiary -- to determine if it was honoring its concession contract. On the eve of Hegseth's visit Panama's comptroller announced that the audit had revealed "many breaches" of the contract and said Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed from the operator. In March, CK Hutchison announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on canal -- to a group led by giant US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, which likely prevented the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as had been planned. Hegseth's visit to Panama comes two months after that of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Shortly after that visit Panama announced it was pulling out of Chinese President Xi Jinping's landmark global infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative. Hong Kong firm did not uphold Panama Canal ports contract: Panama auditPanama City (AFP) April 8, 2025 - The Hong Kong firm in charge of two key Panama Canal ports has flouted the terms of its contract, according to a Panamanian audit released Monday, as US and Chinese firms fight for business on the waterway after President Donald Trump threatened to seize it. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed under the contract. The subsidiary, called Panama Ports, benefited from many tax exemptions and also had irregularities in a previous audit that was used to justify an extension of the concession first awarded in 1997, said state comptroller Anel Flores. "This is a very delicate issue," Flores told journalists, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. The release of the audit results came hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Panama, which has come under strong pressure from Trump to reduce Chinese influence on the US-built canal. The United States has said it is a threat to its national security -- and the region as a whole -- for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. Hegseth will meet Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Tuesday and visit the canal, which opened in 1914. He will also participate in a security conference with Central American officials. Although the waterway has been under Panamanian control since 1999 under international treaties, Trump has threatened to take it back, by force if necessary, arguing that it is effectively controlled by Beijing. - Trump threats - Flores on Monday denied that the announcement of Panama Ports failing to honor the concession contract had anything to do with the Hegseth visit. "This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP. The state comptroller's office is an autonomous body that examines how government money is spent. It began the audit of Panama Ports in late January to determine if it was honoring the concession contract, after Trump threatened to take over the canal. Faced with the US president's repeated threats, the Central American country in turn has put pressure on CK Hutchison to relinquish its control of the ports. In March, the firm announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the interoceanic Panama Canal -- to a group led by US giant asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash.

"I want to be very clear. China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal. And China will not weaponize this canal," Hegseth said, calling it a "wonder of the world." Speaking alongside Mulino, Hegseth said the US and Panama together would "take back the Panama Canal from China's influence" and keep it open to all nations, using the "deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world." He claimed that China's control of critical infrastructure in the canal area gave Beijing the power to conduct spying activities across Panama, making Panama and the United States "less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign." The Chinese Embassy in Panama issued a statement refuting Hegseth's claim that Beijing interferes in the operations of the canal. "China has never taken part in the management or operation of the Panama Canal, nor has it interfered in issues" concerning the waterway, the statement said, calling on Washington to halt "blackmail" and "plundering" of Panama and other countries of the region. It labeled Hegseth's comments "not at all responsible or founded" and said the United States "has orchestrated a sensationalist campaign based on the 'China threat theory' so as to undermine cooperation between China and Panama." It added: "China has always respected Panama's sovereignty with regard to the canal." - Pressure on port company - The concession to the HK-based company's subsidiary to operate Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and Cristobal port on the Atlantic side was first granted in 1997 and renewed for another 25 years in 2021. But faced with Trump's repeated threats to seize the canal, Panama has put pressure on CK Hutchison to pull out of the country. In January, it began an audit of Panama Ports -- the subsidiary -- to determine if it was honoring its concession contract. On the eve of Hegseth's visit Panama's comptroller announced that the audit had revealed "many breaches" of the contract and said Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed from the operator. In March, CK Hutchison announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on canal -- to a group led by giant US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, which likely prevented the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as had been planned. Hegseth's visit to Panama comes two months after that of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Shortly after that visit Panama announced it was pulling out of Chinese President Xi Jinping's landmark global infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative. Hong Kong firm did not uphold Panama Canal ports contract: Panama auditPanama City (AFP) April 8, 2025 - The Hong Kong firm in charge of two key Panama Canal ports has flouted the terms of its contract, according to a Panamanian audit released Monday, as US and Chinese firms fight for business on the waterway after President Donald Trump threatened to seize it. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed under the contract. The subsidiary, called Panama Ports, benefited from many tax exemptions and also had irregularities in a previous audit that was used to justify an extension of the concession first awarded in 1997, said state comptroller Anel Flores. "This is a very delicate issue," Flores told journalists, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. The release of the audit results came hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Panama, which has come under strong pressure from Trump to reduce Chinese influence on the US-built canal. The United States has said it is a threat to its national security -- and the region as a whole -- for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. Hegseth will meet Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Tuesday and visit the canal, which opened in 1914. He will also participate in a security conference with Central American officials. Although the waterway has been under Panamanian control since 1999 under international treaties, Trump has threatened to take it back, by force if necessary, arguing that it is effectively controlled by Beijing. - Trump threats - Flores on Monday denied that the announcement of Panama Ports failing to honor the concession contract had anything to do with the Hegseth visit. "This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP. The state comptroller's office is an autonomous body that examines how government money is spent. It began the audit of Panama Ports in late January to determine if it was honoring the concession contract, after Trump threatened to take over the canal. Faced with the US president's repeated threats, the Central American country in turn has put pressure on CK Hutchison to relinquish its control of the ports. In March, the firm announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the interoceanic Panama Canal -- to a group led by US giant asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash.

The United States has said it is a threat to its national security -- and the region as a whole -- for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. Hegseth will meet Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Tuesday and visit the canal, which opened in 1914. He will also participate in a security conference with Central American officials.

"This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration.

It began the audit of Panama Ports in late January to determine if it was honoring the concession contract, after Trump threatened to take over the canal. Faced with the US president's repeated threats, the Central American country in turn has put pressure on CK Hutchison to relinquish its control of the ports. In March, the firm announced an agreement to sell 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the interoceanic Panama Canal -- to a group led by US giant asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal, which likely prevented the parties from signing an agreement on April 2 as had been planned.

China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal. And China will not weaponize this canal," Hegseth said, calling it a "wonder of the world." Speaking alongside Mulino, Hegseth said the US and Panama together would "take back the Panama Canal from China's influence" and keep it open to all nations, using the "deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world." He claimed that China's control of critical infrastructure in the canal area gave Beijing the power to conduct spying activities across Panama, making Panama and the United States "less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign." The Chinese Embassy in Panama issued a statement refuting Hegseth's claim that Beijing interferes in the operations of the canal. "China has never taken part in the management or operation of the Panama Canal, nor has it interfered in issues" concerning the waterway, the statement said, calling on Washington to halt "blackmail" and "plundering" of Panama and other countries of the region. It labeled Hegseth's comments "not at all responsible or founded" and said the United States "has orchestrated a sensationalist campaign based on the 'China threat theory' so as to undermine cooperation between China and Panama."

Hong Kong firm did not uphold Panama Canal ports contract: Panama auditPanama City (AFP) April 8, 2025 - The Hong Kong firm in charge of two key Panama Canal ports has flouted the terms of its contract, according to a Panamanian audit released Monday, as US and Chinese firms fight for business on the waterway after President Donald Trump threatened to seize it. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed under the contract. The subsidiary, called Panama Ports, benefited from many tax exemptions and also had irregularities in a previous audit that was used to justify an extension of the concession first awarded in 1997, said state comptroller Anel Flores.

Hong Kong firm did not uphold Panama Canal ports contract: Panama auditPanama City (AFP) April 8, 2025 - The Hong Kong firm in charge of two key Panama Canal ports has flouted the terms of its contract, according to a Panamanian audit released Monday, as US and Chinese firms fight for business on the waterway after President Donald Trump threatened to seize it. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed under the contract. The subsidiary, called Panama Ports, benefited from many tax exemptions and also had irregularities in a previous audit that was used to justify an extension of the concession first awarded in 1997, said state comptroller Anel Flores. "This is a very delicate issue," Flores told journalists, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. The release of the audit results came hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Panama, which has come under strong pressure from Trump to reduce Chinese influence on the US-built canal. The United States has said it is a threat to its national security -- and the region as a whole -- for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. Hegseth will meet Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Tuesday and visit the canal, which opened in 1914. He will also participate in a security conference with Central American officials. Although the waterway has been under Panamanian control since 1999 under international treaties, Trump has threatened to take it back, by force if necessary, arguing that it is effectively controlled by Beijing. - Trump threats - Flores on Monday denied that the announcement of Panama Ports failing to honor the concession contract had anything to do with the Hegseth visit. "This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP.

Hong Kong firm did not uphold Panama Canal ports contract: Panama auditPanama City (AFP) April 8, 2025 - The Hong Kong firm in charge of two key Panama Canal ports has flouted the terms of its contract, according to a Panamanian audit released Monday, as US and Chinese firms fight for business on the waterway after President Donald Trump threatened to seize it. The audit found "many breaches" of the concession awarded to a subsidiary of logistics giant CK Hutchison to operate the two ports, and concluded that Panama did not receive $1.2 billion it was owed under the contract. The subsidiary, called Panama Ports, benefited from many tax exemptions and also had irregularities in a previous audit that was used to justify an extension of the concession first awarded in 1997, said state comptroller Anel Flores. "This is a very delicate issue," Flores told journalists, adding that he would file a complaint with prosecutors in the coming days over the unpaid concession fees. The release of the audit results came hours before US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived in Panama, which has come under strong pressure from Trump to reduce Chinese influence on the US-built canal. The United States has said it is a threat to its national security -- and the region as a whole -- for a Hong Kong company to operate ports at either end of the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific, through which five percent of all global shipping passes. Hegseth will meet Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Tuesday and visit the canal, which opened in 1914. He will also participate in a security conference with Central American officials. Although the waterway has been under Panamanian control since 1999 under international treaties, Trump has threatened to take it back, by force if necessary, arguing that it is effectively controlled by Beijing. - Trump threats - Flores on Monday denied that the announcement of Panama Ports failing to honor the concession contract had anything to do with the Hegseth visit. "This is an autonomous act by Panama," Flores said. However, some analysts had predicted that this audit would in fact purport to show irregularities, so that Panama could strip the Chinese company of the contract and thus appease the Trump administration. "It comes as a surprise to no one that the audit turns up alleged irregularities, since the idea was to have some kind of legal justification strong enough to cancel the concession," Euclides Tapia, a professor of international relations, told AFP.

David Rosenberg has made a career out of bearish forecasts, most notably his recession call ahead of the Global Financial Crisis and the US housing bubble in the mid-2000s. So it's fitting that the famed economist's first day on the job came on October 19, 1987 — better known as Black Monday — when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 22% in a day. "It was my first day as a Street economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia," Rosenberg said. "It was, in two words or less, pure pandemonium." With tariffs sinking stocks in recent days — both the Dow and the S&P 500 dropped more than 11% in just three trading days — Business Insider asked Rosenberg about what he learned on Day 1 of his career, and the lesson he would pass along to investors. The biggest thing Black Monday taught him was to distinguish between a liquidity-driven selling event and a fundamental bear-market drawdown, he said. During the former, investors are forced to sell and raise cash because of unusual market conditions, not because the economic or earning outlooks worsen. Think "Volmageddon" in 2018, when a record volatility spike blew up trades that had bet on calm markets, or the yen carry trade unwinding in 2024. The 1987 drop, the biggest since the 1929 crash, was another liquidity-driven event. It was due to panic-driven selling, partly thanks to automatic trading programs. The selling stopped relatively quickly, however, and was followed by a rapid market recovery. But Rosenberg said the current sell-off is different because of the macroeconomic implications of President Donald Trump's tariff policies. He is forging ahead with import taxes on about 60 trading partners, including a 104% levy on Chinese goods set to kick in on Wednesday. "The contrast to October 1987 is the economic backdrop today is at much greater risk," Rosenberg said. "What you had in 1987 was a heart attack as far as the market multiple was concerned, but there was no commensurate decline in earnings." Investors are eagerly waiting to see if Trump drops his trade war. But Rosenberg thinks it's unlikely. "This is something deeply philosophical to Donald Trump," he said. "Trade and tariffs are as important as religion, and he's been talking about this not just for years but for decades." Trump has shown some willingness to negotiate. On Monday, for example, he said the European Union could see "relief" from his tariffs if it bought $350 billion of US oil. But given Trump's volatile approach to implementing the import taxes, it's unclear what that relief would look like and how permanent it would be. "I don't believe for a second that Donald Trump is going to walk these back under any circumstances," he said. "If he does, I'd be pleasantly surprised. But I certainly would not be basing an investment decision on Donald Trump." If Trump does keep his tariffs on, the US economy will head toward a recession, if it isn't already in one, Rosenberg warned. "Recession risks are clearly building. I think Larry Fink is right that a recession is probably already underway," he said, referencing the BlackRock CEO's comments earlier this week. "This could end up being worse than the 1930s in the sense that the global economy is so intertwined and the global supply chain is so complex." Jump to

Title: How Trump’s war on climate and equity is impacting ‘woke investing’

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Environmental-, social-, and governance-related shareholder proposals are down 34 percent this year as the Trump administration galvanizes the movement against “woke investing,” according to an annual report by the shareholder advocacy groups As You Sow and Proxy Impact. The report counted 355 such proposals as of February 21, compared to 536 proposals filed by the same time last year. Wariness over anticipated changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission contributed to the decline, the authors said, as many investors opted to postpone resolutions until it became clear whether they would be blocked by new SEC leadership. “We’re a little bit in a pause mode,” said Andy Behar, As You Sow’s CEO. He said a “right-wing crusade” against socially responsible investing has left shareholders in limbo as they figure out how to navigate the shifting political climate. The term ESG — shorthand for an investment approach that prioritizes environmental, social, and governance issues — dates to 2004 and doesn’t have a fixed definition. Generally, it represents the idea that investors should buy shares in companies that factor social and environmental issues into their decision-making on the theory that such companies are more likely to prosper in the long run.

Here's How Investors promote ESG principles via shareholder resolutions, brief proposals that are put up for a vote by everyone who owns stock in a company during their annual meeting. These resolutions typically ask a company to issue a report about how some aspect of its operations, like its greenhouse gas emissions, may affect the company’s future profitability. All of the shareholder proposals submitted to a company during a given year are compiled into a “proxy statement,” and the time of year when voting occurs — usually around May — is called proxy season. Progressive critics of ESG have argued that the concept is so vague as to be meaningless and that exaggerated claims of corporate responsibility are a distraction from the systemic reforms needed to address societal problems. But the more aggressive criticism has come from the political right, which sees corporate diversity and environmental policies as “woke” interference with capitalism. These criticisms escalated during Joe Biden’s administration. In 2022, red-state regulators began naming and shaming financial institutions for an alleged “boycott” of fossil fuel companies and investigating big banks for their ESG practices. Last year, 17 red states passed legislation restricting corporate decision-making based on ESG priorities, and institutional investors like BlackRock grew more tepid in their support for ESG proposals. President Donald Trump’s broad attacks on climate policy and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have further chilled ESG efforts, inspiring several major banks to withdraw from a climate initiative in the lead-up to Inauguration Day. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How Experts quoted in the As You Sow and Proxy Impact report said government attempts to limit ESG investing amount to an attack on shareholders’ right to make policy recommendations through proxy voting, guaranteed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. “An anti-shareholder movement — often mislabeled as ‘anti-ESG’ — is silencing the voice of everyday investors in the U.S.,” reads one statement from Rick Alexander, CEO of the nonprofit The Shareholder Commons. Behar said ESG opponents are unduly manipulating the market. “They don’t like capitalism, they don’t like free markets, they don’t like democracy,” he said. “This is problematic for all the shareholders who are trying to keep our companies proceeding into the future.” Trump’s reelection has also prompted changes at the SEC, the federal agency charged with protecting investors and enforcing laws against market manipulation. It normally has five commissioners, no more than three of whom may belong to the same political party, but two of its Democratic members voluntarily stepped down after Trump was elected, and their seats are currently vacant. Two of the three sitting commissioners — one Republican and one Democrat — were nominated by Trump. The third, a Republican, was nominated by former president Joe Biden. In February — after the majority of the ESG shareholder resolutions included in the report had been filed — the SEC announced two new policies that complicated these resolutions and could make it more difficult to file resolutions next year. First, the agency placed tighter deadlines and more onerous reporting requirements on large investors asking companies to, for example, disclose their climate risks or boost gender equality on their boards. Second, the SEC made it easier for companies to exclude shareholder proposals from their proxy statements if those proposals were deemed not “significantly related” to their business. The SEC gave companies an extra opportunity to convince regulators to allow specific proposals to be excluded on the basis of this new policy, but it has not afforded investors a similar opportunity for additional explanation. “It was clearly a biased decision stacked against shareholders,” said Michael Passoff, CEO of Proxy Impact and a co-author of the report. In light of the growing anti-ESG movement, Behar said some companies have grown more willing to engage in dialogue with investors, perhaps hoping to avoid the publicity generated by a proxy vote. This, he said, is how shareholder advocates prefer to make change — by persuading companies to take action voluntarily in exchange for the withdrawal of a proposal. According to the report, 22 percent of ESG-related shareholder proposals were withdrawn as of February 21, compared to 7.7 percent at a similar time in 2024, suggesting that companies were negotiating behind the scenes with investors. However, companies have also been emboldened to ignore shareholder proposals. One way to measure this is by looking at the number of “no action” requests prompted by shareholder resolutions. These are requests companies make to the SEC asking for confirmation that the agency will not take action against them if they omit a proposal from their proxy statements. Even with fewer proposals filed as of early March this year, 221 had prompted no-action requests, compared to just 94 around the same time last year. While the As You Sow and Proxy Impact report identified fewer climate- and environment-related shareholder proposals filed this season, the nature of those that were filed did not change much from previous years. The largest chunk ask companies for information about the decarbonization strategies or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some new ones ask financial institutions to set investment ratio targets for clean energy infrastructure compared to fossil fuels; for insurance companies to report and reduce the climate pollution associated with their underwriting; and for mining companies to disclose their policies for deep-sea mining, in the absence of international rules governing this activity. Frances Fairhead-Stanova, a shareholder advocate for the environmentally responsible mutual fund Green Century Capital Management, said the As You Sow and Proxy Impact report raises concerns that affect many shareholders. However, she reported that the presidential election results and anticipated changes at the SEC did not prompt her organization to file fewer resolutions. She noticed more no-action requests, but said it’s unclear whether the SEC will grant a greater proportion of them compared to previous years. So far, Green Century has withdrawn 6 of the 27 climate- and environment-related resolutions it filed, in exchange for some sort of action or reporting. Starbucks, for example, agreed to share more information about its transition to reusable cups and to remove any recycling labels it deems misleading, following an internal assessment. TD Bank agreed to an audit of its board of governance policies with the aim of improving climate risk management. Five companies filed no-action requests, and the SEC has rejected two of these. The others are still pending. “We’re not panicked about any changes,” Fairhead-Stanova said. “We are just continuing to do our work.” A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations,” the defense secretary also said. Reuters said in a report on the news that the Panama Canal handles some 40% of U.S. container traffic, which is worth some $270 billion annually. After President Trump won the November elections, he threatened to take the Panama Canal back from Panama, saying the U.S. was being “ripped off”. Speaking at an event in December last year, Trump said, “Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal? Because we're being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we're being ripped off everywhere else.” The canal was built by the United States in the early 20th century. Panama granted the U.S. the right to build and operate the canal in exchange for annual payments. Ownership over the infrastructure was passed to the Panamanian government in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. The deal granted control over the Panama canal to the local government under obligation of maintaining its neutrality. Two key ports at the Canal, however, are owned by a Hong Kong conglomerate with ties to Beijing. In March, media reported that BlackRock had led a consortium to buy the two ports from CK Hutchinson—the Hong Kong owner—for $19 billion. Chinese regulators, however, put the deal on hold. In the latest development in the saga, the Panamanian comptroller reported irregularities with the contract that CK Hutchinson has with the local authorities for the management of the ports. The irregularities were discovered during an audit ahead of the renewal of the company’s license to operate the ports.

Title: China poses ongoing threat to Panama Canal: Pentagon chief

Pete Hegseth said Chinese control of ports lets Beijing conduct surveillance activities. By Taejun Kang for RFA 2025.04.09 TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China's control of Panama Canal ports is an unacceptable threat to U.S. security, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during a visit to the central American nation, underlining U.S. efforts to bolster its influence in the Western hemisphere. The Panama Canal has become a focal point of geopolitical tension, as China's involvement in its ports raises U.S. concerns over control and influence in a key global trade route. U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly said that the United States is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations. Speaking at a ribbon cutting for a new U.S.-funded dock at the Vasco NuÃ±ez de Balboa Naval Base after a meeting with Panama's President JosÃ© RaÃºl Mulino, Hegseth said the U.S. will not allow China or any other country to threaten the canal's operations. "To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defence and security cooperation than we have in decades," he said. China-based companies, Hegseth said, continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area. "That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable." In response to Hegseth's remarks, the Chinese embassy in Panama slammed the U.S. government in a statement on X. It said the U.S. has used "blackmail" to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a "sovereign decision of Panama ... and something the U.S. doesn't have the right to interfere in." "The US has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the 'theoretical Chinese threat' in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United States' own geopolitical interests," the embassy said. There have been growing calls in Washington for action to loosen Beijing's influence stemming from Chinese and Hong Kong companies' control over ports in Panama and elsewhere in the Western hemisphere. China and the U.S. are also waging a tit-for-tat trade battle, which threatens to stunt the global economy. The U.S. now imposes a 104% tariff on Chinese imports after a series of tariff hikes this year. On Feb. 3, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatened the Panamanian leader with potential American retaliation if his country didn't immediately reduce Chinese influence over the canal. The Panamanian government said that it was auditing the lease held by the Hong Kong consortium, which operates ports at both ends of the canal, and late on Monday concluded that there were irregularities. The Hong Kong consortium, however, had already announced that CK Hutchison Holdings would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete. âCK Hutchison Holdings, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, has operated the Balboa and CristÃ³bal ports at the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the Panama Canal through its subsidiary, Panama Ports Company, since the late 1990s. In March 2025, CK Hutchison agreed to sell a 90% stake in Panama Ports Company to a consortium led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., as part of a US$22.8 billion deal that includes control over 43 ports in 23 countries. At that time, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said concerns about the deal "deserve serious attention," possibly hinting at some form of legal action. "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international, economic and trade relations," Lee told journalists in Hong Kong. The Chinese territory would handle any commercial transaction "according to the law," he said. "The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises, including enterprises from Hong Kong," Lee said.

Title: Hegseth Says China Threatens the Panama Canal, Drawing Fiery Response From Beijing

AP AP PANAMA CITY — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday the Panama Canal faces ongoing threats from China but that together the United States and Panama will keep it secure. Hegseth’s remarks triggered a fiery response from the Chinese government, which said: “Who represents the real threat to the Canal? People will make their own judgement.” Speaking at a ribbon cutting for a new U.S.-financed dock at the Vasco Nuñez de Balboa Naval Base after a meeting with Panama President José Raúl Mulino, Hegseth said the U.S. will not allow China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation. Advertisement Advertisement “To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defense and security cooperation than we have in decades,” he said. Hegseth alluded to ports at either end of the canal that are controlled by a Hong Kong consortium, which is in the process of selling its controlling stake to another consortium including BlackRock Inc. “China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area,” Hegseth said. “That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable.” Hegseth met with Mulino for two hours Tuesday morning before heading to the naval base that previously had been the U.S. Rodman Naval Station. On the way, Hegseth posted a photo on X of the two men laughing and said it was an honor speaking with Mulino. “You and your country’s hard work is making a difference. Increased security cooperation will make both our nations safer, stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote. Late Tuesday, Mulino and Hegseth released a joint statement. A vaguely worded portion of the statement suggested the two had discussed the tolls the United States pays for its ships crossing the canal. It said that within the canal’s framework, “the Republic of Panama and the United States of America will work, as established, on a mechanism to compensate for the payment of tolls and charges.” Panama’s Foreign Relations Ministry did not immediately answer a request for clarification. But the Spanish and English versions had at least one significant discrepancy. The Spanish version included that “Secretary Hegseth recognized the leadership and inalienable sovereignty of Panama over the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas.” That sentence appeared nowhere in the English version. The visit comes amid tensions over Trump’s repeated assertions that the U.S. is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations—allegations that Panama has denied. Shortly after the meeting, the Chinese Embassy in Panama slammed the American government in a statement on X, saying the U.S. has used “blackmail” to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a “sovereign decision of Panama ... and something the U.S. doesn’t have the right to interfere in.” “The U.S. has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the ‘theoretical Chinese threat’ in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United State’s own geopolitical interests,” the embassy wrote. After Hegseth and Mulino spoke by phone in February, the U.S. State Department said that an agreement had been reached to not charge U.S. warships to pass through the canal. Mulino publicly denied there was any such deal. Trump has gone so far as to suggest the U.S. never should have turned the canal over to Panama and that maybe that it should take the canal back. The China concern was provoked by the Hong Kong consortium holding a 25-year lease on ports at either end of the canal. The Panamanian government announced that lease was being audited and late Monday concluded that there were irregularities. The Hong Kong consortium, however, has already announced that CK Hutchison would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Mulino during a visit in February that Trump believes China’s presence in the canal area may violate a treaty that led the U.S. to turn the waterway over to Panama in 1999. That treaty calls for the permanent neutrality of the American-built canal. Mulino has denied that China has any influence in the operations of the canal. In February, he expressed frustration at the persistence of the narrative. “We aren’t going to speak about what is not reality, but rather those issues that interest both countries,” he said. The U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. “I want to be very clear, China did not build this canal,” Hegseth said Tuesday. “China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations through the deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world.” © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

East Asia United States President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for America to “reclaim” the Panama Canal from what he termed “China control”. Panamanian Moises Castillo (L) in Beijing, and Chinese national Zhou Mei in her office in Panama overlooking the Pacific Ocean. This audio is generated by an AI tool. BEIJING: Shipping business owner Zhou Mei’s videos on Chinese social media application WeChat have been getting more attention lately. The 49-year-old Chinese national regularly posts snippets of her work and family life in Panama, including views from her office of ships waiting to pass through the Panama Canal. In recent weeks, the vital waterway – through which 5 per cent of all global shipping passes – has made headlines and, in turn, drawn viewers to Zhou. Shortly before United States President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, he announced his intention to “take back” the Panama Canal from what he termed “China control”. Since then, he has ramped up calls for the US to “reclaim” it. During a visit to Panama on Tuesday (Apr 8), US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that America will not allow China and other nations to "threaten the canal's operation or integrity". Amid this ongoing tussle between Beijing and Washington over the strategic trade route, Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing became the latest to be caught in the middle. Li’s logistics conglomerate CK Hutchison said last month that it planned to sell dozens of its ports, including two located at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by American investment firm BlackRock. The deal – worth more than US$19 billion in cash – triggered an angry reaction from Beijing, which claimed the company “betrayed” China. All this has put the tiny country of Panama with a population of 4.5 million people on the map. The fight over the strategic trade route has not just impacted big businesses – it has also affected those like Zhou, as well as young Panamanians studying in China. Married to a Panamanian, Zhou told CNA that she expanded her shipping business in Shanghai to the Latin American nation in 2004. This was way before Chinese presence at the Panama Canal surged and before Panama switched diplomatic ties from Taiwan to Beijing in 2017. Zhou said Trump gave Panama “free advertisement all over the world”. “For China, we have so many shipping companies that have a lot of business dealings with Panama. Your logistics, your shipping service and your fleets have to go through the Panama Canal - the channel to Latin America,” she noted. Her online videos have also been her way of staying in touch with loved ones, especially when she was unable to return to China for four years during the COVID-19 pandemic. “I really want to use this (social media) channel, not only to let my family but also to let my many shipping customers know about Panama, including many of my good friends,” she added. “They don't know about Panama's tourism resources, so for me, it is a very good opportunity.” On the other hand, Panamanian undergraduate Moises Castillo has not found a reason to celebrate his country’s newfound fame. The 23-year-old, who is in his second year of university in Beijing, is among many young Panamanians granted a Chinese government scholarship to study in China. While he had offers from schools in other countries, including the US, he said he chose to study civil engineering in China due to its affordability and potential opportunities. Job offers have already landed at his doorstep from Chinese companies operating in Panama. “Panama is a developing country, so we need a lot of infrastructure like bridges (and) railways. I was thinking it’s a good opportunity and at that time, China was also investing a lot in Latin America with infrastructure projects, so I was thinking I could work in some of these in the future,” he added. But Castillo said he grew concerned when he first heard the news that Panama was pulling out of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The trillion-dollar infrastructure programme operates in more than 100 countries. "I was kind of sad, frustrated and a little bit worried,” he added. “If the relationship between China and Panama is difficult, how is that going to affect my future? … How is that going to affect me having a scholarship here?” It was against this backdrop that China reacted strongly to Hong-Kong listed CK Hutchison's sale of its Panama port operations to BlackRock. Panama lies more than 14,000km away from Beijing, across the Pacific Ocean, and has been called the gateway to South America for its key geographic role in terms of connectivity and trade. China is Panama’s largest trading partner and is keen to deepen connections there, in its bid for resources like lithium and other agricultural products like soybean and corn. Beijing is also the second-biggest customer of the Panama Canal after Washington, with about a fifth of the cargo that passes through the waterway belonging to China. CK Hutchinson’s deal with BlackRock was ultimately not signed last week as planned, after China announced an antitrust review of the agreement. Analysts said Beijing’s diplomatic victory over the Panama Canal will likely motivate the Trump administration to repeat the stunt. Meanwhile, one expert predicted that 20 to 30 countries could follow Panama in dropping out of the Belt and Road Initiative within the next year. "What's important are the politics and the optics,” said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project. “One cannot overstate how important this is - that forcing a country to withdraw from BRI, and seeing the reaction that Trump and (US Secretary of State) Marco Rubio got in the United States among their base, is going to motivate them to (force) dozens of other countries (to also withdraw from BRI).” Olander added that “vulnerable countries” will have to decide whether to be in China’s or America’s “sphere of influence”. Still, he said this would not detract from the BRI’s longer-term strategy. “It just means they have to recalibrate in a much more contentious environment. The first and foremost priority for (Chinese President) Xi Jinping today is protecting the domestic economy,” he noted. “He’s got to keep that domestic economy moving forward, and so I think the US-China relationship is more important than the China-Panama relationship. So, they're kind of going to let Panama go.” Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

Gomez made the announcement after Panama's comptroller general criticized the contract, renewed in 2021, earlier this week. Comptroller Anel Flores said Panama "left $1.3 billion on the table," referring to tax incentives and benefits granted by the government to CK Hutchison. Trump says US will take back Panama Canal "This prosecutor's office is conducting an investigation initiated 'ex officio' for the alleged commission of a crime against public administration and other crimes against the State," Gomez said in a letter sent to Flores on Tuesday. The 25-year contract awarded to Panama Ports Company, in which CK Hutchison has a 90% stake, for the concession of the Balboa and Cristobal ports has been under audit since January. The audit is nearing completion, Flores said on Monday, adding that a lawsuit would be filed against government officials who authorized the contract. Since February, Panama's Supreme Court has also discussed the concession. BlackRock’s $23-billion deal to strengthen US control over Panama Canal Ports, global trade sees rising American presence in other strategic assets The contract reviews are seen as possible roadblocks in a key $22.8 billion deal announced in March by a group led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock to get access to CK Hutchison's port business in 23 countries, including the two ports in Panama. CK Hutchison and BlackRock did not immediately reply to requests for comment. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, speaking earlier this week at a conference in New York, said the deal was not made for geopolitical reasons, but the company was aware that China would review it as much as other jurisdictions. Regulatory review of the deal could take nine more months, Fink said, adding he was optimistic it would be approved. China's embassy in Panama said on Tuesday in a social media post that it has and will continue respecting Panama's sovereignty, and added that the relationship between the U.S. and Panama should not be "excluding." If irregularities in the concession renewal are confirmed by Panama's government or the Supreme Court declares the contract to be unconstitutional, the concession could be revoked, lawyers and experts have said.

Title: Hyundai to Mitsui, shipyard giants line up at India gate

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. New Delhi: India is mapping a course to become a shipbuilding powerhouse, forging strategic joint ventures between its state-owned enterprises and maritime giants from South Korea and Japan. State-run enterprises are engaging companies including Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hanwha of South Korea and Mitsui of Japan, two people aware of the plans said, in an ambitious bid to secure a larger share of the global demand and reduce India's reliance on overstretched Asian shipyards. State-owned Cochin Shipyard Ltd (CSL) may join hands with Hyundai Heavy Industries for a new facility in Kochi, the people said on the condition of anonymity. Cochin Shipyard confirmed the talks, but did not identify the future partner. A Hyundai team had visited India early this year for a preliminary survey for investing in Indian shipbuilding. “We are close to signing a deal with an overseas shipbuilder from Korea or Japan that would be making hulls for large ships," said Madhu S. Nair, chairman and managing director, Cochin Shipyard. "We already have a large 310 m dry dock that can also be used by the new joint venture for making ships of different sizes up to 300 m in length. A foreign partnership will help in bringing technology and scale required for making large ship hulls using tonnes of steel. The new facility should roll out ships in double-digits to meet both domestic and overseas demand," Nair added. New facilityLand for the new facility will be provided by the government-owned Cochin Port Trust, close to Cochin Shipyard's existing facility in Kochi, one of the two people said. The new facility will build cargo ships, container vessels, tankers, dry bulk cargo ships and multi-purpose vessels. It would, however, not make very large crude carriers (VLCCs) due to infrastructural shortcomings, but may consider it later depending on market conditions.

The company may consider a shipbuilding facility planned near Gujarat's Kandla Port, a Union government-owned port with ample land and basic infrastructure for shipbuilding and repairs. Also, a team from Japanese ship maker Mitsui OSK Shipping is expected in India around June, the people said. Among the main tasks for the group would be to seek local partnerships. “The first deal for a large shipbuilding facility may be reached in the next couple of months, with a few other deals expected before the end of the current year. Ship manufacturing in India will help the country become a major hub for ships after Korea, Japan and China," said the second person.

Mint had reported in September that India is looking for investments from Korea and Japan for its shipbuilding ambitions. Shipping boostIndia is not alone in trying to breathe life into its shipbuilding industry. In February, US President Donald Trump slapped fees of up to $1.5 million on Chinese-built ships entering the US, with charges of up to $1 million on both fleets that have ordered new Chinese ships and non-Chinese vessels in fleets with Chinese ships. The move aims to rebuild American shipyards. The global shipbuilding industry is currently dominated by massive shipyards in China, South Korea and Japan; however, these facilities are overbooked, with waiting periods running from three to five years. “Investments and technology transfers from countries like South Korea and Japan are being sought by the Indian government," said Pushpank Kaushik, CEO of Jassper Shipping, a Hyderabad-based shipping and logistics company. "Support has been expressed by states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Odisha for setting up maritime clusters. A detailed briefing on advanced and eco-friendly shipbuilding was also received from South Korea. Large commercial shipbuilding in India remains limited, even though 28 shipyards exist. Most ship repairs are handled overseas. However, with foreign support and partnerships, domestic capabilities are expected to improve, and larger ships may be constructed," Kaushik added. Global hubIndia is trying to become a global hub for ships, and push up local ship ownership by scaling Indian-built and Indian-owned and flagged cargo ships. The country’s share in global shipbuilding remains below 1%. The government’s projection is raise the share of Indian built ships in India’s fleet from 5% at present to 7% by 2030 and 69% by 2047 under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative. The plan is to set four mega shipbuilding parks, two each on the east and west coasts. Shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal has said that two shipbuilding parks would be made operational by 2030, eyeing a share of the $100 billion global shipbuilding market.

A modern shipbuilding facility typically costs $5-6 billion for construction, port infrastructure and ancillary services. Since a dry dock facility is already available in Kochi, the new facility may require less. In July last year, Mint reported that to create a market for domestic shipbuilding, the shipping ministry has proposed a joint venture of the state-run Shipping Corp. of India (SCI) with public sector oil marketing companies to build VLCCs. This venture may also rope in a foreign technology partner. Shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal told Mint in September that the government has launched a mega ship-building mission to develop mega shipbuilding parks along both coasts, and ministerial teams had visited South Korea and Japan to seek their investment in parks, and at least three state governments have agreed to provide land. Maritime fundEarlier this year, the FY26 budget proposed a ₹25,000 crore Maritime Development Fund, a government-industry partnership to help develop manufacturing clusters with a focus on shipbuilding and breaking. The budget also proposed revamping the existing Shipbuilding Financial Assistance (SBF) policy to address cost disadvantages, while also providing credit notes for shipbreaking to help purchase indigenously-built ships. The budget also included large ships in the infrastructure harmonized master list (HML) allowing purchase of ships on easier terms while providing basic customs duty exemption on raw materials, components, consumables or parts for the manufacture of ships extended for another 10 years.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/08/2025 4:22:03 PM PDT by george76 Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock Inc., warned policymakers in New York City on Monday that crime, cleanliness and a shortage of quality schools have significantly undermined the city’s attractiveness to businesses. “The city is on the verge of losing a lot of companies,” the 72-year-old Fink said during a candid conversation hosted by the Economic Club of New York on Monday. “I don’t believe the city has the vitality that it did before.” ... Fink, who first arrived in New York during the rough-and-tumble 1970s when it was plagued by an economic crisis and widespread urban decay, expressed deep frustration, saying: “I believed that my taxes were used to help build out the city. I don’t feel that way anymore.” His investment firm, BlackRock, oversees assets totaling approximately $11.6 trillion and is headquartered in Manhattan’s Hudson Yards .... Since late 2019, approximately 160 Wall Street firms, collectively managing nearly $1 trillion in assets, have moved their headquarters out of New York. ... The city has seen a significant reduction in drugstores, losing nearly 40% over the past decade, with 10% of closures occurring in 2024 alone. Major chains like Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid have reduced their presence, citing factors such as rampant shoplifting and other crimes. ... Major felony crimes have increased by 32.0%, including serious offenses such as murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny, and auto theft. Petty thefts at drugstores have increased by 37.4%, while quality-of-life offenses resulting in summonses, including public drinking and urination, have jumped by 37.7% (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo By Michael McDonald (Bloomberg) — Panama’s top auditor accused port operator CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. of wrongdoing, providing a potential pathway for the Central American country to wrest control of canal facilities caught up in a diplomatic tug-of-war between the US and China. Panama Ports Co., part of Hong Kong-based Hutchison’s far-flung operations, failed to obtain required approvals for a contract extension in 2021, and owed millions in dues, Comptroller General Anel Flores told reporters Monday following an audit. Flores plans to file a criminal complaint with Panama’s attorney general’s office on Tuesday against the maritime authorities who granted the 2021 contract renewal and against executives of Panama Ports, he said. Ultimately, Panama’s Maritime Authority will need to decide whether to rescind the contract, he said. CK Hutchison didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The move ratchets up pressure on CK Hutchison, founded by Li Ka-Shing, to give up control of two Panama Canal ports, after US President Donald Trump began pushing to rid the canal of Chinese influence. The audit was launched shortly after Trump returned to office in January; Hutchison then agreed to sell operations including the two facilities to a BlackRock Inc.-led consortium. But Chinese authorities have put pressure on the conglomerate to scuttle the BlackRock deal, which would net Hutchison more than $19 billion in cash should the transaction go through. Before the audit results were announced, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said he anticipates nine months of regulatory review, including from China, before a final decision is made on the deal. “I’m actually pretty optimistic that we will find a solution because, if you look at it, everything was done in the right order,” Fink said in an interview Monday at the Economic Club of New York. “I think it’s going to be a very interesting thing to watch for geopolitical purposes.” The audit’s outcome makes it clear that Panama’s government, which has close ties to the US, can attempt to remove Hutchison even if the BlackRock deal doesn’t go through. Flores said that in addition to the lapses in required approvals, his audit found that Panama Ports used a series of tax-exempt subcontractors to lower the amount it pays to the government. The company used tax breaks to save $850 million of at least $1.3 billion it owed in payments to the republic in the first 25 years of the contract period, Flores said, adding that it currently owes $300 million. The company also breached its agreement to share 10% of net income with Panama’s government, Flores said. “There are two people in a transaction, but they need to know what they are selling and that what they are buying might not be what they were told,” Flores said, referring to the BlackRock deal. “There are breaches, nonpayments and countless things that were wrongly calculated.” The Balboa and Cristobal ports on either side of the 51-mile (82-kilometer) Panama Canal, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, form a key part of the deal involving a total of 43 CK Hutchison facilities. While CK Hutchison is based in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory with its own borders, currency and legal system, Beijing has tightened its grip on the former British colony since 2020 when it imposed a broad national security law that’s paved the way for a crackdown on dissent. A consortium backed by BlackRock agreed last month to buy a majority of Panama Ports and other Hutchison assets. But the parties are yet to sign the deal while it’s being scrutinized by Chinese authorities. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: U.S. to take back Panama Canal from Chinese influence, visiting Pentagon chief says

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. The United States will take back the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday during a visit to the Central American nation. Hegseth, following talks with Panama's government, vowed to deepen security cooperation with Panama's forces and said China would not be allowed to "weaponize" the canal by using Chinese firms' commercial relationships for espionage. "Together, we will take back the Panama Canal from China's influence," Hegseth said, speaking at a pier renovated with U.S. assistance in Panama City. "China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations." More than 40% of U.S. container traffic, valued at roughly $270 billion a year, goes through the Panama Canal, accounting for more than two-thirds of vessels passing each day through the world's second-busiest interoceanic waterway. Hegseth got a close-up look at the Panama Canal on Tuesday, the first full day of a rare visit to a nation still unsettled by Trump's threats to take back the canal. While Hegseth spoke about removing Chinese influence, Trump has spoken in broader terms and not ruled out using military force, if necessary. Hegseth is the first U.S. defense secretary to visit in decades, and his trip follows reports that the Trump administration has requested options from the U.S. military to ensure access to the canal, which the United States built more than a century ago and handed over to Panama in 1999. Trump has complained that was a bad deal for the United States. Hegseth was greeted by Panama Public Security Minister Frank Abrego and held closed-door meetings with President Jose Raul Mulino and other officials. Given Trump's tough rhetoric, the stakes are high for Hegseth's visit. "On the whole, this hasn't been a winning issue for the United States in terms of public diplomacy in Panama," said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Still, current and former U.S. officials and experts say the United States has found a willing partner in tackling Chinese influence in Mulino. In February, Mulino announced Panama's formal move to exit China's Belt and Road Initiative and he has aided Trump's crackdown on migrants. He has accepted deportation flights of non-Panamanians and worked to stem migration from South America by those crossing through his country's dangerous Darien jungle. Hegseth praised Mulino, saying his government understood the threat from China, and his remarks about Panama being in the lead on addressing the canal's security concerns appeared to be a nod to Panamanian sensitivities. Hegseth, a U.S. military veteran and former Fox News host, has enthusiastically backed Trump's southern-focused security agenda, by means such as dispatching U.S. troops to the U.S. border with Mexico and offering military aircraft for deportation flights. U.S. SECURITY CONCERNS Trump has falsely claimed that China is operating the canal, something even Hegseth said was not true on Tuesday, and that Chinese soldiers are present. But experts acknowledge U.S. security concerns, particularly regarding espionage, with an expansive Chinese commercial presence in Panama that also includes plans by Chinese firms to build a bridge over the canal. Last month, Trump celebrated a deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8-billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its ports on either end of the Panama Canal. Trump said the purchase was an example of how the United States was "reclaiming" the canal. But China has criticized it, with the market regulator saying it will carry out an antitrust review of the deal. Current and former U.S. officials say the Panama Canal would be critical for the passage of U.S. warships during any future conflict in Asia, since Navy vessels would transit from the Atlantic to the Pacific to support the war effort. Even without blocking the canal, China could have an enormous advantage by being able to surveil vessels passing through it. Still, John Feeley, who was U.S. ambassador to Panama from 2015 to 2018, disputed the Trump administration's assertion that China's presence in Panama was a violation of the U.S.-Panama treaty. "What's not legitimate about the way Trump has gone about this is the bullying tactic that he's used, which is to claim that there has been a violation of the neutrality treaty. There hasn't been," Feeley said. Mulino has defended Panama's administration of the canal, saying it has been handled responsibly for world trade, including that of the United States, and that it "is, and will continue to be, Panamanian."

The last thing the US needs is rapist liar threatening somebody with empty threat The US has no merchant ships and Panama controls the canal, not China. The last thing the US needs is rapist liar threatening somebody with empty threat Doesn't matter, the Panama Canal is vital to US National Security interests and should have never been in the hands of the Chinese, now reverse it, you think on your life the Chinese would ALLOW the US to hold it if it were the gateway into their country or violating their territorial sovereignty? They won't even allow you to open up businesses and invest in property or land in their country, but we have to? Not your country, not your canal.. Get your dirty hands off Panama !!. Doesn't matter, the Panama Canal is vital to US National Security interests and should have never been in the hands of the Chinese, now reverse it, you think on your life the Chinese would ALLOW the US to hold it if it were the gateway into their country or violating their territorial sovereignty? They won't even allow you to open up businesses and invest in property or land in their country, but we have to? It is not US territory. The US has no legitimate claim to that canal any more. Period. Full stop. It is the territory of a sovereign nation. What you and many like you can't seem to get through your testadura is that Panama owns the canal. Panama, not China. A Chinese company operates two container ports on either end of the canal. That company gained those leases in 1997 when the canal was still operated by the US. The US granted Hutchison the long term leases on those two container ports, not Panama. Even still, they are leases for container ports. They are separate from the canal. The right is telling lie after lie on this matter trying to drum up a reason to go to war over the canal. And people like you who claim to be ardent to end wars and stop the fighting in Ukraine flip and cheer lead the US to seize the Panama Canal. Max hypocrisy. It is not US territory. The US has no legitimate claim to that canal any more. Period. Full stop. It is the territory of a sovereign nation. We do have a claim Treaty with Panama (1903 – Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty) After helping Panama gain independence from Colombia in 1903, the U.S. signed a treaty with the newly formed Panamanian government. The treaty gave the U.S.: *Control of the Panama Canal Zone** (a 10-mile-wide strip of land)* The right to build, operate, and protect the canal “in perpetuity” In exchange, Panama got a payment and an annual lease fee *This treaty is what gave the U.S. a legal claim to build and run the canal.* I think the lawyers and constitutionalists know more than you, I'll give them the props for pushing this legally. Treaty with Panama (1903 – Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty) ROFL Trump is not interested in international treaties that the US is signature to so why this one? It is dead in the water. "The Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903, which granted the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone, no longer applies as it was superseded by the Torrijos–Carter Treaties in 1977, which led to the full transfer of control of the canal to Panama on December 31, 1999. " Fixed for you. I blame the lower education standard of summer schools. Like the Trump University ask for your money back. Trump is not interested in international treaties that the US is signature to so why this one? It is dead in the water. Yeah, he won't win the Presidency, he won't get the Senate, he will lose the House and he won't get to send illegals back. DOGE won't be able to continue and get access to sensitive info. you guys need to stop saying things you guys fully no well will not come through for you, This is another one, not even remotely close to being dead in the water, it's just getting started. "The Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903, which granted the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone, no longer applies as it was superseded by the Torrijos–Carter Treaties in 1977, which led to the full transfer of control of the canal to Panama on December 31, 1999. " Fixed for you. Really? The U.S. had a legal right to build and operate the Panama Canal based on a 1903 treaty, but that claim became controversial due to how the treaty was made, even though it was returned to Panama, so again LEGAL RIGHT, makes all the difference in the world I blame the lower education standard of summer schools.

search 6,500 sf house has 100 ft of waterfront, hit market for $17M in July SHARE THIS ARTICLE FONT SIZE Kenneth Grunley, CEO of Grunley Construction, bought a waterfront home in Jupiter’s gated Admirals Cove community for $15.3 million. Records show Grunley bought the house at 112 Quayside Drive from Russell and Patricia Stern. Michele and Fredrick Locke with Fine Living Realty of the Palm Beaches had the listing, and Janis Lax with Waterfront Properties & Club Communities brought the buyer. Grunley heads his namesake Rockville, Maryland-based construction firm. It is one of the largest general contractors in the Washington, D.C. area, and specializes in government, commercial and institutional buildings. Grunley has performed renovation and modernization work on some of D.C.’s most iconic structures: the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the Washington Monument, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and the Watergate Hotel, to name a few. Russell Stern heads The Alternative Board (TAB) Jupiter, a business coaching firm. He was previously CEO of Solarflare Communications, a semiconductor developer that Santa Clara-based AMD (formerly Xilinx) bought for $400 million in 2019, according to published reports. The Sterns bought the 0.4-acre waterfront Admirals Cove property for $2.2 million in 2019, according to property records. The home was built in 2021, and spans 6,500 square feet with five bedrooms, five bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a pool and 100 feet of waterfront with a dock, records and the listing show. It hit the market in July for $17 million, according to Zillow. Admirals Cove is a gated luxury community that has attracted high-profile buyers over the years. Donald Trump Jr. and his now ex-fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle bought a $9.7 million mansion in 2021. Blue Jays pitcher Max Scherzer owns two homes in the community; he spent a combined $24.7 million acquiring them. Last year, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder sold his Admirals Cove mansion for $14 million. In November, seed magnate Ronald Holden sold his 1.1-acre estate for $34 million, then a record price for Jupiter. Edward Brown, retired CEO of Patrón Spirits, sold his Bears Club mansion for $48 million in February, making it the most expensive home ever sold in Jupiter and inland Palm Beach County.

Title: "We Will Take Back Panama Canal...": Pentagon Chief Meets Panama President
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/we-will-take-back-panama-canal-pentagon-chief-pete-hegseth-meets-panama-president-jose-raul-mulino-8120006

The US will take back the Panama Canal, ending China's influence in one of the world's most important waterways, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said today after a rare visit to the Central American nation. Marking the first visit by a US defence secretary to Panama in decades, Mr Hegseth held a closed-door meeting with Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino. He also got a close-up look of the canal as Washington reiterated its deep concern over China's investments and involvement in and around the crucial waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Following talks with Panama's government, the Pentagon chief vowed to deepen the US military's security cooperation with Panamanian forces. China, he said, would "not be allowed to weaponize" the canal by using Chinese firms' commercial relationships as a guise for espionage. "Together, we (Panama and the US) will take back the Panama Canal from China's influence," Secretary Hegseth said in Panama City. Given Donald Trump's tough rhetoric, the stakes were high for Secretary Hegseth's visit. The new arrangement with Panama, a first since 1999, will effectively end China's influence in the Panama Canal, he suggested. "China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations," he said. The Pentagon chief also praised President Mulino, saying his government understood "the threat from China". His remarks about Panama being in the "lead" on addressing the canal's security concerns appeared to be a nod to Panamanian sensitivities. While Secretary Hegseth spoke about removing Chinese influence from Panama, President Trump has spoken in broader terms and not ruled out using military force, if necessary. Even before Mr Hegseth reached Panama, the Trump Administration had reportedly requested options from the US military to ensure access to the Panama Canal. The United States had built the Panama Canal more than a century ago and handed its complete operations over to Panama in 1999. Today's development changes that dynamic with the US military likely to start patrolling and accessing the canal frequently, and in coordination with Panama's security agencies. According to news agency Reuters, several current and former US officials and strategic experts say that the United States has found a willing partner in tackling Chinese influence in Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino. In February, President Mulino had announced Panama's formal move to exit China's Belt and Road Initiative. He has also aided Donald Trump's crackdown on migrants in the United States. He did so by accepting US' deportation flights of non-Panamanians and worked to curb migration from South America by those crossing illegally through his country's dangerous Darien jungle. In a significant move last month, US firm BlackRock led a deal to buy out most of the $22.8-billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its ports on either end of the Panama Canal. At the time President Trump celebrated the deal, saying that the purchase was an example of how the United States was "reclaiming the Panama Canal". China however, had slammed the deal. The markets regulator has said that it will carry out an antitrust review of the deal. Military experts have pointed out that in the event of a war in Asia, the Panama Canal plays a critical role as US naval ships cross from the Atlantic to the Pacific to support war efforts. With China's vast presence in and around the canal, it could hinder the passage of ships, they said, adding that even if Beijing would not be able to stop American naval vessels in such a scenario, it would be in an advantageous position by being able to surveil vessels passing through it.

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Photo Caption: Delta is set to report first quarter earnings before market open on Wednesday. Vincenzo Pace Vincenzo Pace Airlines’ post-pandemic growth will be tested as tariffs, mass layoffs within the federal government, and weakened international demand continue to create economic uncertainty. Select a question above or ask something else The post-pandemic boom for the airline industry could come to an end as tariffs, a sinking stock market, and declining consumer confidence weaken travel demand. At the start of the year, analysts expected strong results — premium and international travel would continue to be healthy, corporate travel was slowly bouncing back, and even domestic travel was starting to make a comeback. But now, the latest round of sweeping tariffs from the Trump administration has sparked fears of a potential recession. Some Wall Street leaders have already declared the U.S. is in a recession. “One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine — canary in the coal mine — and I was told that the canary is sick already,” said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday, according to CNBC. Government travel has declined significantly following mass layoffs. And international demand from Canada, Mexico, and Europe is starting to weaken. Data compiled from Cirium found that advance bookings between the U.S. and Europe were down 12.6% compared to last year, but it cautioned that its data was primarily from online travel agencies. An open question is whether a falling stock prices will lead to lower spending by high-income flyers. Airlines have invested heavily in premium offerings as they’ve become a major profitability driver. “There’s never been a downturn where the industry has been less dependent on corporate demand, the category usually hit the hardest,” an investor note from JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker read. “On the other hand, there’s never been a downturn where the industry has been more dependent on the premium category, which has yet to be tested by a US recession.” Delta Air Lines is set to report its first-quarter earnings Wednesday morning, and analysts are expecting U.S. airlines to cut their outlooks for 2025. Delta already lowered its first quarter outlook, saying in a regulatory filing that it had seen softer demand for corporate and leisure travel. “We expect a world of slower growth, higher inflation, and a more isolationist US to significantly disrupt the competitive environment for airlines and ground the multiples back in the penalty box over the near-term,” wrote TD Cowen analyst Tom Fitzgerald in a note to investors on April 4. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also cut their first quarter outlooks, citing the current economic environment as a reason. Fitzgerald said in the note that he expected legacy carriers to fare better during an economic downturn compared to ultra-low-cost carriers. “While we do expect some consumers to trade down, we believe there is greater likelihood that consumers trade down within the same carrier's cabin (e.g., moving from Premium Economy to Standard Economy) than they pivot to a low-cost carrier,” he said in the note. Melius Research analyst Conor Cunningham said he expected airlines to make some capacity cuts. “2025 is clearly not the year airlines had hoped for with consumer and business confidence rattled by the Trump administration’s approach to policy in turn creating uncertainty,” the note read. Corporate demand, which was continuing to strengthen as companies changed their in-office policies, is also now in flux. Deutsche Bank noted it was seeing weaker demand for corporate transatlantic routes, most notably at London Heathrow, the largest corporate transatlantic market. However, an investor note from Raymond James noted that low fuel prices could offer airlines some reprieve. “While we expect the current policy rollercoaster ride to continue over the next year (a challenging scenario for corporate and consumer travel demand), we are modeling some improvement (albeit not full recovery) in 2H25,” the note read. What am I looking at? The performance of airline sector stocks within the ST200. The index includes companies publicly traded across global markets including network carriers, low-cost carriers, and other related companies.

Title: Recession and Tariff Fears Could Overshadow Big Bank Earnings

This week, America’s biggest banks are set to report their quarterly earnings. But as Reuters reported Tuesday (April 8), investors are less likely to be focused on profits than on the banks’ view of the economy amid steep U.S. tariffs. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said the biggest impact of the tariffs in the quarters to come “will be higher reserves for loan losses as the odds of recession rise.” As Reuters notes, banks are likely to reserve billions for potential loan defaults in the quarters ahead. Loan losses will probably increase this year due to newly revised accounting rules that require banks to account for losses over the full terms of the loans. “Banks are a reflection of the economy — if the economy worsens, their results will follow,” said Stephen Biggar, director of financial institutions at Argus Research. In addition to more reserves to cover losses on existing loans, Biggar expects banks to scale back lending as they see higher risks. The report argues that banks are likely to face questions during earnings calls about the market selloff that has erased trillions of dollars from global stock indexes. Bank stocks were some of the hardest hit, after surging earlier in the year on optimism about a jump in dealmaking. This week will see Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase report their earnings, all happening on Friday (April 11). JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that the tariffs could have lasting negative consequences, such as inflation and recession. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” Dimon wrote in his annual shareholder letter. “In the short run, I see this as one large additional straw on the camel’s back.” As PYMNTS noted in a report Tuesday on the impact of the tariffs on the FinTech sector, some observers have an even more pessimistic view. For example, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink notes that many U.S. business leaders believe the country is already in a recession. “Where do FinTechs fit in the larger picture? Analysts remain cautious about FinTech growth prospects, citing economic uncertainty and regulatory pressures,” PYMNTS wrote. “Despite this, there is optimism about the sector’s long-term potential, driven by innovations in artificial intelligence and blockchain, as well as a robust employment market and receding inflation. However, that outlook is clouded by the current economic turmoil.” Recession and Tariff Fears Could Overshadow Big Bank Earnings Report: Justice Department to End ‘Regulation by Prosecution’ of Crypto-Related Activities Best Buy Launches Creator Program With Influencer Storefronts i2c Teams With Access Finance to Expand Credit Card in US We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Wall Street titans had been oddly silent about Trump tariffs—until they became real. Amid market turmoil brought on by the President’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, a growing trickle of prominent bank CEOs and investors are raising the alarm on how these levies could cause irreparable harm to the global economy. Even established Trump supporters, such as Citadel CEO Ken Griffin and Pershing Square founder Bill Ackman, are vocalizing concerns about the potential fallout. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Here’s a look at what Wall Street’s most prominent leaders are saying: Ken Griffin, a major Republican donor, called Trump’s tariffs a “huge policy mistake” while speaking at the University of Miami event yesterday (April 7). Griffin estimated that it could take 20 years for the tariffs to actually bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. “It’s not 20 weeks. It’s not two years. It’s decades,” he stressed. But before then, the levies will raise the cost of groceries, appliances and vehicles for middle- and lower-class families. The speech mark a departure from Griffin’s previous comments on Trump’s tariff policy, which he claimed wasn’t a particularly important business issue. “I am really afraid of us abdicating our role of leadership for the free world,” said Griffin yesterday. “That’s the path we’re on.” Economic fragmentation caused by the tariffs could be “disastrous in the long run,” said JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon in his latest annual letter to shareholders. He warned that the levies will increase inflation and potentially lead to a recession, and he urged for negotiations to take place sooner rather than later. “America First is fine, as long as it doesn’t end up being America alone,” Dimon wrote. Dimon reportedly supported Kamala Harris during the 2024 Presidential election, the banking CEO has previously defended Trump’s tariff policy. In January, he called tariffs as an effective negotiation tactic and advised people to “get over it.” Bill Ackman, head of the hedge fund Pershing Square and one of Wall Street’s loudest supporters of Trump, has changed his tune. “We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter,” said Ackman in a series of X posts over the weekend. He described the levies as akin to “launching a global economic war against the whole world at once.” The hedge fund manager today (April 8) said that some of his comments on tariffs have been “misinterpreted” and noted that he still supports tariffs as a tool for negotiation. But he reiterated his call for a pause of up to 90 days before the tariffs come into effect to allow for negotiation. According to Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (BLK), an economic downturn in the U.S. is already taking place and will only continue to escalate. “The economy is weakening as we speak,” said Fink yesterday while speaking at the Economic Club of New York. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” he added. Fink alluded to America’s economic uncertainty in his annual shareholder letter last week. “I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader—nearly every person—I talk to: They’re more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory,” he wrote. Much of the economic benefits reaped over the past eight decades can be attributed to the growth of global trade, said Howard Marks during a Bloomberg TV interview on April 4. Now, the state of the world “is completely in flux,” he said. “We’ve gone from free trade and world trade and globalization to this system, which implies significant restrictions on trade in every direction and a step toward isolation for the United States,” he added. Last October, Daniel Loeb praised Trump’s economic policy and said his tariffs would have a positive impact on the market. He isn’t so sure now. On April 5, he reposted an article on X from the conservative think-tank American Enterprise Institute that criticizes the formula the administration used to calculate the tariffs. “Thoughtful piece on potential conceptual as well as practical errors that went into the announced tariff policy,” said Loeb of the report. “It will be a test of the administration’s judgement versus ideology how they resolve this over the weekend or coming days.” While hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio agrees that the U.S. has a problem to fix when it comes to domestic manufacturing, he doesn’t believe tariffs are the answer. “I agree with the problem. I am very concerned about the solution, the practicality of the solution,” he told CNBC in an interview published today. The levies will see company costs rise and their revenue plunge, said the Bridgewater Associates founder. “This is going to create great sand in the gears of production worldwide,” he added. Stanley Druckenmiller, a longtime Republican, is turning against the levies. “I do not support tariffs exceeding 10 percent,” said the billionaire investor in an X post on April 6. Druckenmiller has close ties to the Trump administration, having acted as the boss of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent when the two worked at George Soros’ hedge fund.

Title: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Predicts Mag 7 Corporate Treasuries Begin Rapid Accumulation of Bitcoin – Here’s Why

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan says that corporate buying of Bitcoin (BTC) is most likely about to explode. In a new interview with Kyle Chasse on his YouTube channel, Hougan notes that while holding BTC in corporate treasuries is still relatively unorthodox, the same could be said about Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in their early days. Hougan says he sees a theme developing in the adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate reserve asset that parallels the embrace of BTC ETFs. “Let me make an analogy to the ETF space… If you look at institutional asset managers in the crypto space, in the early days, it was only crypto native people. It was Grayscale, it was Bitwise, and there were a few others. And then you had financial institutions run not as public companies but as family-run businesses. Fidelity is run by a family, one person can make a decision – ‘I’m going into Bitcoin’ – and they did. VanEck is run by Jan Van Eck. He loved Bitcoin and they went into the space. But fast forward to today and its BlackRock and it’s Invesco, and it’s the largest institutions in the world coming into the space. You’re seeing the same thing in companies. It was Michael Saylor alone. Then it’s Michael Saylor and Metaplanet and a few others. Oh, well, Block has some Bitcoin, and Tesla may be reconsidering it, and PayPal is probably going to look at it and it’s expanding out. Why do we not think that BlackRock – the BlackRock equivalent – will come in and own Bitcoin, which is a Mag 7 company putting it on its balance sheet at five or ten percent of their massive cash pile? To me, it pattern matches exactly. People were skeptical then, and look at us today. People are skeptical now, and I think we’ll be in the same place in a few years.” At time of writing, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has the largest corporate treasury of BTC, followed by mining firms Marathon and Riot Platforms. Tesla holds the fifth-largest corporate stack of Bitcoin.

Title: Panama Files Criminal Charges Against Chinese-Linked Canal Port Owner for Breach of Contract

Comptroller General of Panama Anel Flores on Monday announced that he would file a criminal complaint against Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Port Holdings, on accusations of breach of contract over the two ports it manages at the Panama Canal. Flores, during a press conference, stated that an audit of PPC launched by his office this year found that the company, which operates two ports at opposite ends of the Panama Canal, found evidence of breaches of contract that amount to more than $300 million losses to the Panamanian state. Flores further accused Panama’s Maritime Authority (AMP) of “misrepresenting” financial figures and will therefore file criminal lawsuits against the company’s board and the authorities responsible for the 25-year renewal of PPC’s concession. “There are important findings that show amounts of more than 300 million dollars owed to us due to noncompliance with the contract. We see a renewal that also did not comply with all the procedures of law, nor does it have the endorsement of the Comptroller’s Office,” Flores said. “I want to announce that in the next few days we will go to the Public Prosecutor’s Office to file the corresponding complaints so that the directors who handled this renewal, the board of directors and the officers of Panama Ports, who will obviously have to explain to the Panamanian people before the Public Prosecutor’s Office why so much magnanimity, why so much benevolence in a contract that has been unfair,” he continued. Panama Ports Company signed a contract with Panama in 1997 that granted PPC a 25-year concession to develop and administer two ports at opposite ends of the Panama Canal located in the provinces of Balboa and Cristóbal. Local authorities renewed the contract for an additional 25-year period in 2021 as per the terms of the original 1997 deal, which reportedly contained automatic-renewal provisions so long as PPC complied with the agreed terms. In February, Panama’s Attorney General Luis Carlos Gómez requested that the nation’s Supreme Court rule to declare the 1997 concession contract “unconstitutional” because it allegedly violated 15 articles of the Panamanian constitution. Gómez presented the request a month after the Comptroller General’s office began an audit of PPC. In March, Comptroller General Flores stated that, despite the growth in container traffic in the country, the economic benefits for Panama resulting from the PPC lease deal have been “minimal” and described them as a “colonial enclave that perpetuates economic inequalities.” PCC’s two Panama ports have been at the center of a debate initiated by President Donald Trump in December after he called for the United States to regain control of the Panama Canal and denounced China’s alleged growing influence and control of the interoceanic trade route. The two ports are among the list of facilities included in a $22.8 billion deal between Hutchison Port Holdings, the Hong-Kong conglomerate that owns PPC, and asset manager BlackRock. The deal was blocked by the Chinese communist regime last week. Flores clarified at the start of his press conference that the PPC audit proceedings were signed off on January 15 but that the auditing staff physically began its labor on January 20 — the same day as the United States’ Inauguration day — stressing that the date “has nothing to do” with what international media “may possibly say” about the proceedings being a response to the U.S. statements and that the audit is an autonomous action of Panama and his office. Flores said the financial damages to the Panamanian state can be estimated from “different angles” and explained that under the original terms of the 1997 contract, Panama was receiving a percentage of the company’s profits that increased every year, reaching $27 million in 2002. In that same year, Flores further detailed, the administration of former Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso modified the contract so that Panama would receive ten percent of net profits instead of ten percent of gross profits — which made the Central American nation go from receiving $27 million in 2002 to only $1.3 million in 2003. “If we had complied with the first contract in full, Panama should have received $1.337 billion during the concession period. And we only received $483 million, with a loss to the Republic of Panama of $853 million in the same period,” Flores said. “Now, that is not the company’s fault. It is the fault of many people, bad Panamanians, I tell you, who delivered what they did not have to deliver, they negotiated very badly.” “If we add this to the economic damage caused by the fact that we gave them so many tax exemptions, they did not pay the rent, this results in another $350 million more,” he continued. “In other words, the real damage for the Republic is in the order of 1.2 billion dollars at a rate of 55 approximately per year that we as a country stopped receiving.” Flores also explained that PPC used “concessionaires” to perform container transportation services, and detailed that the Panamanian State does not receive a percentage of the profits of these companies. Additionally, the Comptroller pointed out that even though the volume of containers increased, the reported profit of the company, “at least on paper,” remains practically the same. “The company where Panama has a 10 percent stake, which is Panama Ports, earns less every day with more TEUs [Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit]. I can assume that this is happening there, and so can everyone who is watching me,” Flores said. The Comptroller, who described the contract as “leonine,” stressed that PPC received $3.78 billion between 1997 and 2003 but only paid a total of $236 million to the Panamanian state, and said, “In other words, they gave us a tip.” Christian K.

WoW Classic Version 1.15.7 Patch Notes April 8, 2025 New Quest Content in Eastern Plaguelands Players who have completed the Phase 7 Eastern Plaguelands quest “Scarlet Activities” may speak with Leonid Bartholomew the Revered at Light’s Hope Chapel to accept the quest “Unrest at Tyr’s Hand”. This quest splits off into a few different questlines related to Scarlet Enclave content. New Area - New Avalon Go behind enemy lines in disguise as you infiltrate the town of New Avalon within the Scarlet Enclave, prior to the events that transpire within the raid. This is a small crafting-focused town with access to a few common city services, such as a bank, a neutral auction house, and an alchemy lab. New Raid Dungeon – The Scarlet Enclave Starting at 1:00 p.m. PDT on Thursday, April 10, the Scarlet Enclave raid will be available for players to enter. New Legendary Weapon Questline Raid groups progressing through The Scarlet Enclave may encounter a “Ruined Lightforge Blade” legendary quest item as a drop from a certain boss encounter. This item is the quest starter for the legendary weapon questline. Changes Classes Going into Phase 8, we want to make some changes to damage numbers coming out of Naxxramas, refine and align the durability profile of tanks, and create more room for healers to coexist. You’ll notice a lot of changes are to previous tier’s set bonuses. We wouldn’t normally touch these bonuses, but with access to these via shoulder enchants, and some Tier 3 bonuses doing a lot of the heavy lifting for some classes inside of Naxxramas,we felt these were the correct adjustments to make to ensure that gear upgrades going forward remain meaningful. Druid Hunter Mage Paladin Priest Rogue Shaman Warlock Developers’ notes: In the opposite vein as Shaman Tanks, Warlock tanks have had too high avoidance, too low durability, and this was felt by most guilds who used a Warlock main tank for something like Maexxna during Naxxramas progression. We shifted Tank Rogues away from avoidance cap in exchange for allowing them to actually take hits, and for Warlocks we plan to do the same thing by increasing their health pool in Metamorphosis, which was starting to look like it wouldn’t be able to keep up with the health pools of other tanks. DPS Tier 3 4piece damage changed to 33% of the DoT’s damage (was 75%). Pets now benefit from your Spell Haste and convert it into both Spell and Melee Haste. New effect: Metamorphosis grants 15% increased health. Dance of the Wicked now converts 70% of your critical strike chance into Dodge (was 100%). Damage dealt reduction in Metamorphosis changed to 10% reduction (was 15%). Threat increase in Metamorphosis changed to 50% (was 77%). Shadow Cleave now grants 4 spell power per defense (up from 2). Chaos Bolt changed to deal Chaos damage, which is Fire, Frost, Arcane, Shadow, and Nature damage (was just Fire) . Demonic Pact now only counts half of the spell power from Defender’s Resolve (so it is unchanged and does not benefit from the above buff). Warrior Developers’ notes: Warriors have been relying on using the active on the Tempered Interference-Negating Helmet from Gnomeregan to compete. We feel that is clunky and unintuitive to the average player, so we have removed the ability to use the gnomeregan helmets past level 59 and offset that change for Warriors with 10% attack speed for 2handed weapons, and 5% attack speed for 1handed weapons. Soul of the Titan damage increase to Heroic Strike, Slam, and Overpower changed to 10% (Was 25%). Soul of the Battle Forecaster changed to 5% crit, damage, and damage reduction when changing stances (was 10%). Soul of the Sanguinist damage changed to 15% (was 20%). Frenzied Assault changed to 40% attack speed (was 30%). Single-Minded Fury changed to 4% attack speed per stack (was 3%). Soul of the Aftershock reduces the cooldown of Shockwave by 25% (was 50%).

Title: Pentagon’s Hegseth to Visit Panama Canal After Trump Threats

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Photo: Panama Canal Authority By Phil Stewart PANAMA CITY, April 8 (Reuters) – The United States will take back the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday during a visit to the Central American nation. Hegseth, following talks with Panama’s government, vowed to deepen security cooperation with Panama’s forces and said China would not be allowed to “weaponize” the canal by using Chinese firms’ commercial relationships for espionage. “Together, we will take back the Panama Canal from China’s influence,” Hegseth said, speaking at a pier renovated with U.S. assistance in Panama City. “China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations.” More than 40% of U.S. container traffic, valued at roughly $270 billion a year, goes through the Panama Canal, accounting for more than two-thirds of vessels passing each day through the world’s second-busiest interoceanic waterway. Hegseth is expected to get a close-up look at the Panama Canal later on Tuesday, the first full day of a rare visit to a nation still unsettled by Trump’s threats to take back the canal. While Hegseth spoke about removing Chinese influence, Trump has spoken in broader terms and not ruled out using military force, if necessary. Hegseth is the first U.S. defense secretary to visit in decades, and his trip follows reports that the Trump administration has requested options from the U.S. military to ensure access to the canal, which the United States built more than a century ago and handed over to Panama in 1999. Trump has complained that was a bad deal for the United States. Hegseth was greeted by Panama Public Security Minister Frank Abrego and held closed-door meetings with President Jose Raul Mulino and other officials. Given Trump’s tough rhetoric, the stakes are high for Hegseth’s visit. “On the whole, this hasn’t been a winning issue for the United States in terms of public diplomacy in Panama,” said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Still, current and former U.S. officials and experts say the United States has found a willing partner in tackling Chinese influence in Mulino. In February, Mulino announced Panama’s formal move to exit China’s Belt and Road Initiative and he has aided Trump’s crackdown on migrants. He has accepted deportation flights of non-Panamanians and worked to stem migration from South America by those crossing through his country’s dangerous Darien jungle. Hegseth praised Mulino, saying his government understood the threat from China, and his remarks about Panama being in the lead on addressing the canal’s security concerns appeared to be a nod to Panamanian sensitivities. Hegseth, a U.S. military veteran and former Fox News host, has enthusiastically backed Trump’s southern-focused security agenda, by means such as dispatching U.S. troops to the U.S. border with Mexico and offering military aircraft for deportation flights. Trump has falsely claimed that China is operating the canal, something even Hegseth said was not true on Tuesday, and that Chinese soldiers are present. But experts acknowledge U.S. security concerns, particularly regarding espionage, with an expansive Chinese commercial presence in Panama that also includes plans by Chinese firms to build a bridge over the canal. Last month, Trump celebrated a deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8-billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its ports on either end of the Panama Canal. Trump said the purchase was an example of how the United States was “reclaiming” the canal. But China has criticized it, with the market regulator saying it will carry out an antitrust review of the deal. Current and former U.S. officials say the Panama Canal would be critical for the passage of U.S. warships during any future conflict in Asia, since Navy vessels would transit from the Atlantic to the Pacific to support the war effort. Even without blocking the canal, China could have an enormous advantage by being able to surveil vessels passing through it. Still, John Feeley, who was U.S. ambassador to Panama from 2015 to 2018, disputed the Trump administration’s assertion that China’s presence in Panama was a violation of the U.S.-Panama treaty. “What’s not legitimate about the way Trump has gone about this is the bullying tactic that he’s used, which is to claim that there has been a violation of the neutrality treaty. There hasn’t been,” Feeley said. Mulino has defended Panama’s administration of the canal, saying it has been handled responsibly for world trade, including that of the United States, and that it “is, and will continue to be, Panamanian.” (Reporting by Phil Stewart; additional reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Rod Nickel and Alistair Bell) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

Title: Billionaires—Including Elon Musk—Speak Out Against Trump’s Tariffs: ‘Huge Policy Mistake’

President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs took effect Wednesday over the concerns of many of the nation’s billionaires, as even some longtime supporters of the president—including Elon Musk—have expressed concern about the tariffs and their impact on the economy. Elon Musk arrives for the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. Capitol ... More Rotunda on January 20 in Washington, DC. Jamie Dimon: The JPMorganChase CEO told Fox Business on Wednesday he thinks a recession is a “likely outcome” of Trump’s tariffs—though he said he’s right now taking a “calm view” of the financial situation, “But I think it could get worse if we don’t make some progress here”—after Dimon expressed concerns in his annual letter to shareholders Monday morning, saying they “will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession.” Elon Musk: The Tesla CEO shared a video early Monday of economist Milton Friedman touting free trade and the benefits of importing goods and reportedly lobbied Trump personally not to impose the tariffs, The Washington Post reported Monday. He’s also been sparring with Trump’s top trade adviser Peter Navarro for praising tariffs—most recently saying Tuesday Navarro is a “moron” who’s “dumber than a sack of bricks”—and Musk’s brother (and Tesla board member) Kimbal Musk has criticized the tariffs as a “permanent tax” on Americans. Bill Ackman: The hedge fund manager is a longtime Trump supporter but has repeatedly spoken out against the president’s tariffs, calling Tuesday for the White House to issue a 30, 60 or 90-day pause on the tariffs “to enable negotiations to be completed without a major global economic disruption” and saying Wednesday morning the financial chaos Trump’s tariffs have sparked are “not the markers of successful policy” and “many small businesses will go bankrupt” if they’re not paused soon. Ken Griffin: The Citadel founder—and major Republican donor—said at an event Monday that Trump’s tariffs are a “huge policy mistake,” with Bloomberg reporting he urged audience members to lobby Trump to step back on the tariffs and said he’s “really afraid of [the U.S.] abdicating our role of leadership for the free world.” Daniel Loeb: While Loeb said in February he thought Trump’s initial tariffs on Mexico and Canada wouldn’t harm the stock market, the hedge fund manager has spoken out against Trump’s more sweeping policy, sharing a post Monday that noted the stock market chaos is “all in the head of 1 person. Who can change his mind at any time”—writing, “Exactly”—and sharing criticism of the tariffs by billionaire Ken Griffin and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Larry Fink: The BlackRock CEO suggested at the Economic Club of New York Monday that “the economy is weakening as we speak” and the market could fall another 20% from where it is now as a result of Trump’s tariffs, CNBC reports. Fink suggested the U.S. is “probably in a recession right now,” but he still expressed some optimism about the economy’s long-term outlook, saying, “In the long run, this is actually more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity” and “the vitality of the United States will persist.” Joe Lonsdale: The Palantir cofounder said on X he has some concerns about the tariffs even though he understands where “some” of the Trump administration’s thinking “is coming from,” and shared a post on tariffs from Viahart founder Molton Hart early Monday, saying Hart’s argument that the “tariffs are structured in the wrong way” by taxing finished products and components at the same rate “reflects a lot of my key concerns about how the tariffs could be done better.” Ken Langone: The Home Depot cofounder and GOP megadonor told the Financial Times he believes Trump has “been poorly advised by his advisers about this trade situation” and criticized how the tariffs were calculated—saying, “I don’t understand the goddamn formula”—telling the FT it would have been “more manageable and certainly more constructive” for the Trump administration to impose baseline 10% tariffs on foreign imports before starting negotiations. Ray Dalio: Dalio, who founded the world’s biggest hedge fund firm, Bridgewater Associates, wrote Monday the tariffs are based on a broader “breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders.” He’s still expressed concern about Trump’s tariffs and their “practicality,” however, telling CNBC on Tuesday that while he “agree[s] with the problem” the tariffs are aimed at fixing, “I am very concerned about the solution.” Stanley Druckenmiller: Longtime hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller expressed some optimism about tariffs in an interview with CNBC, referring to them as the “lesser of two evils” versus an income tax—though an unverified social media account believed to belong to Druckenmiller responded to a clip of his interview Sunday, arguing he “do[es] not support tariffs exceeding 10%.” Ken Fisher: The Fisher Investments chairman attacked Trump’s tariffs Monday, saying on X the tariff plan is “stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools,” predicting it “will fade and fail.” Thomas Peterffy: Contrary to many other billionaires, the Interactive Brokers founder has fully embraced Trump’s tariffs, telling Forbes on Tuesday he “think[s] it gives an opportunity to many entrepreneurs to gear up for producing and inventing either the same things that foreign countries sell us at cheap prices, or proper substitutes for them,” and claiming any price hikes will affect “plastic sh-t from China that is not absolutely necessary for people to have.” More than $10 billion. That’s how much Trump’s top 10 billionaire donors lost in the stock market on Thursday alone, as stocks plunged in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s Wednesday tariff announcement. That’s only a fraction of the $270 billion in total that was wiped off the net worths of the world’s billionaires on Thursday, Forbes calculated, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Musk among those who were the hardest hit. Musk’s brother Kimbal Musk called Trump “the most high tax American President in generations” on Monday. “Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer,” the Tesla shareholder said on X. Peterffy criticized his fellow Trump-friendly billionaires who have spoken out against the president’s tariffs, telling Forbes, “I think that they are short term, greedy, looking after their own pockets.” Trump has dug his heels in on his tariffs and repeatedly doubled down in support of them, even as they’ve spurred chaos in the markets. “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” Trump said Wednesday morning on Truth Social after his tariffs took effect. The president staunchly defended his tariffs to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, saying they are “the only chance our country will have to reset the table” in terms of the U.S.’ trade with other countries, and that while other presidents wouldn’t be willing to impose such controversial tariffs, “I don’t mind going through it, because I see a beautiful picture at the end.” Trump’s tariffs have also garnered criticism from a number of non-billionaires who have typically been sympathetic to the president. Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy has suggested he’s lost up to 15% of his net worth as a result of the stock market plunge from Trump’s tariffs and said “everything’s in the s—-ter” because of the president’s policy—but also has continued to back the president, saying Trump is a “smart guy” even as he dubbed Monday’s stock market plunge “Orange Monday.” “I’m gonna roll with [Trump] Trump has suggested he’s open to negotiating with other countries on their tariffs, saying Monday that discussions with other countries would begin “immediately” and telling reporters he’s open to reaching “fair deals” with other countries that put “America first.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also said Trump will negotiate with other countries—likely starting with Japan—but has suggested those negotiations may take a while, telling Fox Business on Monday that all the countries approaching the Trump administration about making deals means “it’s going to be a busy April, May, maybe into June.” The White House denied reports Monday suggesting the administration was considering a 90-day pause, however, decrying the rumor as “fake news,” and Trump said Monday he’s “not looking at” pausing the tariffs unilaterally. Congress could also undo Trump’s tariffs, and bipartisan legislation has been introduced that would require any tariffs the president wants to impose to be approved by Congress. That legislation remains a longshot to pass as of now and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has reportedly urged House Republicans to back Trump’s policy—though some GOP lawmakers are already backing the legislation, and more could follow suit if Trump’s tariffs continue to wreak economic havoc. A Florida-based stationery company is also challenging Trump’s authority to enact tariffs in court—with potentially another major legal challenge on the way this week from business groups—though it remains to be seen how those will play out. Trump announced his sweeping tariff policy during a “Liberation Day” event Wednesday, levying tariffs of 10% and up on imports from nearly all foreign countries—even uninhabited ones. The tariffs fulfill a longtime promise by the president to impose sweeping tariffs in order to restore manufacturing to the U.S. and punish other countries for purportedly unfair trade practices, which Trump has pushed despite economists long warning that doing so would raise prices for U.S. consumers and harm the economy. Billionaires’ criticism of Trump’s tariffs comes after dozens of them backed the president in the November election. More than 50 billionaires expressed support for Trump and billionaires funneled millions into his campaign, even as the now-president made sweeping tariffs a signature plank of his platform.

Title: Trump was touting his Panama victory. Then China stepped in.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — A huge deal President Donald Trump touted as a victory in his campaign to “take back” the Panama Canal from China could be on the rocks amid pushback from Beijing. The $23 billion sale involving two ports run by CK Hutchison, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, to a consortium led by the U.S. investment firm BlackRock had been scheduled to be signed last week. But an agreement between the two has been delayed under pressure from China, whose market regulator launched a review of the deal as state-run newspapers attacked it as undermining China’s national interests. NBC News takes a look at the sale and what it may mean politically and economically for the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies. In his inaugural speech in January, Trump claimed without providing evidence that China controlled the 50-mile canal and vowed that the United States will take back the waterway, which he said was “vital” to national security. The Panamanian government has administered the U.S.-built canal since the United States relinquished it to the Central American country in 1999. Trump did not rule out military action, and he has directed the Defense Department to draw up plans to send more troops to Panama to “reclaim” the canal, through which 40% of U.S. trade passes. Visiting Panama on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth repeated Trump’s pledge to “take back the Panama Canal from China’s influence.” The U.S. “will not allow communist China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation or integrity,” he said. China, which says it has never interfered in the operation of the canal, called Hegseth’s remarks “irresponsible.” “We advise the U.S. to reflect on its own bullying and plundering of developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Panama, and stop distorting and slandering China,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Panama said in a statement Wednesday. Panama also denies Trump’s accusations about the neutrality of the canal, which is enshrined in its constitution. But to relieve the pressure from Washington, in January it launched an audit of CK Hutchison’s Panama Ports Co. (PPC), which since 1997 has operated two ports along the canal, Balboa on the Pacific side and Cristóbal on the Atlantic side. On Monday, Panama’s comptroller general said the audit had found that the contract was overly favorable to Hutchison PPC, costing Panama $1.3 billion in revenue, and that authorities would sue officials involved in its renewal in 2021. CK Hutchison’s sale to BlackRock includes a 90% interest in the two Panama Canal ports and an 80% controlling interest in 43 other ports outside Hong Kong and China. When the deal was announced March 4, the companies said definitive documentation for the Panama Canal operations would be signed by April 2. Trump quickly declared victory. “To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” he said in an address to Congress last month, citing the proposed deal. The sale of the two Chinese-run ports is about more than just Panama, said Christopher Hernandez-Roy, senior fellow and deputy director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. “It represents a major victory for the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back China in the Western Hemisphere,” he said, adding that is something China “would not want to happen.” Though CK Hutchison, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, Beijing quickly signaled its displeasure with the deal. China “firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries’ legitimate rights and interests,” Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said last week. Chinese government offices in Hong Kong have reposted articles from pro-Beijing newspapers criticizing the sale as undermining China’s national interest. Beijing’s market regulator has also said the sale is subject to an antitrust review “to protect fair market competition and safeguard public interests.” The original signing date of April 2 came and went last week. While neither BlackRock nor CK Hutchison has publicly commented on the delay, analysts say that in light of the cumulative 54% tariff the United States imposed on China, the ports could be used as a bargaining chip for China to extract concessions from the United States. “What seems more important is China’s effort to gain leverage in negotiations with Trump,” said Angela Zhang, a professor of law at the University of Southern California and author of “Chinese Antitrust Exceptionalism.” While the deal does not involve Hutchison’s ports in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, CK Hutchison is publicly listed in Hong Kong, which, Zhang said, could mean China “may have jurisdiction,” even if the transaction “itself occurred offshore.” The review by Beijing’s market regulator is an example of China’s asserting its “long-arm jurisdiction over offshore transactions,” she added. BlackRock declined a request for comment. CK Hutchison did not respond to a request for comment. For Panama, the deal’s failure “would be seen as snatching defeat from the jaws of victory,” Hernandez-Roy said. “There would be tremendous pressure on Panama to cancel the concessions,” he said, referring to the port operation rights that Hutchison PPC won in 1997. Nevertheless, some analysts say CK Hutchison, which is not financially dependent on the Chinese government, is expected to press ahead with the deal. Li, CK Hutchison’s 96-year-old owner, has been known to draw Beijing’s ire. “Beijing is a bit skeptical about Li’s family. But the family still remains to be one of the most influential, if not the most influential, conglomerates in Hong Kong,” said Wilson Chan, co-founder and director of policy research at Hong Kong’s Pagoda Institute. “I think what they are actually doing is to diversify the risk, as Trump is getting more and more high-profile about the ports in Panama,” he said. “And during turmoil in the global economy, cash is king.” Mithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC
