Irish Life Investment Managers hires BlackRock executive to run TirNua Capital Partners It is believed that TirNua Capital Partners will support Ireland’s energy transition. Stock image: Getty A major new fund to invest in ­Ireland’s energy transition infrastructure is being launched by Irish Life Investment Managers (ILIM), the Irish Independent has learned. It has established a new unit to manage the fund, called TirNua Capital Partners. The group, part of Canada’s Great-West Lifeco, has hired David O’Brien as chief executive of TirNua Capital Partners. He was previously managing director and co-head of the Evergreen Infrastructure Partners, a unit of US investment giant BlackRock. Irish Life Investment Managers declined to comment. As of the end of 2024, Irish Life Investment Managers had more than €131bn of assets under management. It is the largest life and pensions group and fund manager in Ireland. In 2023, BlackRock achieved the first close of its Evergreen investment infrastructure fund, securing almost $1bn (€856m) in commitments from its founding partners. The open-ended equity fund focuses on investments in European and North American infrastructure connected to energy transition and energy security. It has cornerstone commitments from European Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo and Inarcassa, Italy’s national pension fund for engineers and architects. Mr O’Brien scaled multiple infrastructure fund strategies and led multiple infrastructure investments It is believed that TirNua Capital Partners will also focus on investing in infrastructure assets that will support Ireland’s energy transition. Ireland has a target of seeing 80pc of its energy needs provided from renewable sources by 2030. The Government also hopes to have at least 5GW of offshore generating capacity installed by then. By 2050, it hopes to have 37GW of offshore renewable energy capacity installed. However, the 80pc target is unlikely to be met. Industry executives point to a slow planning process, what they claim are inefficient energy capacity auctions, and the system of judicial reviews as hindering the pace of development. The target for the deployment of offshore energy capacity is also unlikely to be met. While at BlackRock, Mr O’Brien scaled multiple infrastructure fund strategies and led multiple infrastructure investments. As co-head of BlackRock Evergreen Infrastructure Partners, he led the fund’s development, fundraising and investment activities. Before joining BlackRock in 2011, he was director of corporate finance at Irish firm NTR, where he worked for six years.

Share this article BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, filed today for a Bitcoin premium income ETF in Delaware. The proposed fund represents a new investment product designed to generate income through Bitcoin-related premiums. The filing extends BlackRock’s crypto expansion beyond its spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), which reached $90 billion in assets under management by September 2025. The firm captured 60% of the US Bitcoin ETF market share with IBIT. BlackRock’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs generated $260 million in annual revenue less than two years after launch. The asset manager has been adding Bitcoin exposure to its in-house funds, with model portfolios allocating 1%-2% to crypto assets. The premium income structure targets income-focused investors seeking Bitcoin exposure with yield generation, differentiating it from BlackRock’s existing spot Bitcoin product that tracks the cryptocurrency’s price movements directly.

Title: ‘I was hoping for Paul Mescal,’ tourist says after meeting Jim Gavin on campaign trail

Jim Gavin chatted to Canadian couple Maja Crawley and Colin Landrie during a short Dart journey between Blackrock and Dalkey in South Dublin on Thursday. The pair seemed somewhat bemused to have come upon the Fianna Fáil presidential election candidate’s large entourage during their journey. An Irish Rail staff member kept a close eye to make sure there was no canvassing on board as this is a no-no for the transport company. Team Gavin told him they were only on board to “get from A to B” and the candidate was on safe ground talking to the Canadian pair who do not have a vote in the election. Dún Laoghaire TD Cormac Devlin told the tourists that Taoiseach Micheál Martin was in Canada to meet their prime minister Mark Carney. So did the couple from Winnipeg, Manitoba, expect to encounter a presidential election candidate on their trip to Ireland? “I was hoping for Paul Mescal or Dermot Kennedy,” Ms Crawley said. Mr Gavin does not have the same kind of star power as the actor or the singer-songwriter, but who does in fairness? The former Dublin GAA manager, a newcomer to politics, does enjoy some fame due to his multiple All-Ireland winning efforts and there was the odd ‘Up the Dubs’ as he canvassed in the South Dublin suburbs. He met footballers Paul Mannion and Con O’Callaghan in Dún Laoghaire. The pair later featured in a campaign video backing him. But what is Mr Gavin telling voters regarding his plans for the presidency? Voters Anne O’Leary and Rimiko Ogata got the pitch in a Blackrock cafe. They got a technical explanation of the powers of the presidency, such as scrutinising Bills and appointing taoisigh and ministers after elections. He also said the office had “the power to highlight things” like disadvantage and “those who mightn’t have a voice” and to “shine a light on people who provide services”. This would be a “big part” of his presidency, he told them. Ms O’Leary asked for an example and Mr Gavin mentioned the kind of places he visited while canvassing in Navan, Co Meath, the previous day including a childcare centre. “It’s about highlighting the really good things in the country,” he said. Speaking afterwards, Ms O’Leary and Ms Ogata said they had not been Fianna Fáil supporters in the past, but would consider voting for Mr Gavin. Ms O’Leary said that with Mr Martin as leader she was more open to the party. Ms Ogata agreed. Mr Gavin, of course, is the person the Taoiseach backed to be Fianna Fáil’s candidate. He held off Ireland South MEP Billy Kelleher in the internal parliamentary party vote to select a candidate, but by a thinner margin than many expected. One of Mr Kelleher’s supporters in that contest, Dublin MEP Barry Andrews, was on the canvass with Mr Gavin. Is he ruing the fact that it is Mr Gavin rather than Mr Kelleher pounding the pavements on the campaign trail? “It’s ancient history,” Mr Andrews said. “We had a great contest and are delighted that Jim is our candidate. “We’re very lucky. His record of service is really unbelievable. I came across him in humanitarian work when I was in [aid agency] Goal and he was in the Air Corps. “In the next four weeks he’ll grow as a candidate and get to know the people.” More importantly, does he believe Mr Gavin can stay ahead of the Fine Gael candidate, Heather Humphreys, when it comes to first preference votes? “I think so, yeah,” Mr Andrews said. A widely held view among commentators is that whichever Coalition party candidate is ahead – Mr Gavin or Ms Humphreys – will benefit from transfers from the other, propelling them to the presidency over left-wing Independent Catherine Connolly, who is backed by Opposition parties. Mr Andrews said “the concentration on first preference will be the main thing here” and “that’s why he’s working as hard as he is”. “He’s an amazingly energetic candidate,” he said. “People are really responding to him well on the road.” In Blackrock, Eugene Kenny, from “a Fianna Fáil house”, said he would vote for Mr Gavin as “he seems to be the best of the three at the moment”. He described him as a “middle-of-the-road kind of guy” who is “able to speak pretty well”. Another voter in the village, Jane McGauran, told Mr Gavin how Ms Connolly was particularly vocal on the horror of the war in Gaza. Dr McGauran is a volunteer with the Children Not Numbers charity and is a member of Irish Healthcare Workers for Palestine. She is in contact with families in Gaza who have “very sick children” including some with injuries from explosives. She asked if Mr Gavin would speak out about the war and advocate for injured children to come to Ireland. He told her what was happening in Gaza was “genocide” and said he would “speak out against that”. “The fighting needs to stop, the hostages need to be handed back by Hamas and we need to get aid into Gaza and to get those women and children and people out,” he said. “So I will champion that.” She later said she was impressed with Mr Gavin’s answer. “I hope he follows through.” Would she vote for him? “I’ll read his manifesto and I’ll have a think about it. I haven’t decided,” said the doctor, who is also considering voting for Ms Connolly. In these early days of the campaign, Dr McGauran was not alone during the canvass in being in the “thinking about it” category when it comes to Mr Gavin.

Title: Is XRP Finally Coming To BlackRock? Ripple Drops Bombshell Announcement

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ripple has unveiled a partnership that places its RLUSD stablecoin at the center of tokenized finance involving BlackRock and VanEck. The announcement, which was shared on the company’s official X account, connects Ripple directly to tokenized versions of institutional funds and sets the stage for deeper integration between the XRP Ledger and some of the largest names in asset management. Ripple confirmed that it is working with Securitize,the world’s largest tokenization platform, to bring in real-time liquidity for institutional assets provided by BlackRock and VanEck. Through this arrangement, holders of BlackRock’s $BUIDL and VanEck’s $VBILL can instantly convert their fund shares into RLUSD, allowing them to retain access to on-chain yield. With the partnership, BUIDL and VBILL holders will now be able to instantly exchange their shares for RLUSD 24/7. Acording to the announcement, Securitize is also expanding integration with the XRP Ledger. Considering Securitize is one of the largest tokenization platform, this move increases the XRP ecosystem’s exposure to tokenized assets and strengthens Ripple’s push to imporove its on-chain financial infrastructure. “Making RLUSD available as an exchange option for tokenized funds is a natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” said Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoins at Ripple. “ Speculation around Ripple’s relationship with BlackRock has been building for months, and many in the industry have linked Ripple’s cross-border settlement technology to the asset manager’s vision for tokenization. The company is now working to tokenize $2 trillion worth of assets on the blockchain. BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund, BUIDL (BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund), in March 2024, doing so through Securitize’s infrastructure. Securitize serves as the platform that tokenizes BlackRock’s fund, issuing digital tokens that represent ownership of the underlying real-world assets. The implications are significant. Ripple has managed to secure a foothold in the conversation by tying RLUSD to tokenized funds. Ripple’s RLUSD is now linked not only to BlackRock’s BUIDL but also to VanEck’s VBILL fund. This creates a direct link between Ripple’s stablecoin ecosystem and products from two of the world’s biggest asset managers. The partnership can be viewed as an important step that could eventually pave the way for XRP itself to be tied into BlackRock’s tokenization efforts. This partnership also speaks to Ripple’s strategy of expanding the utility of RLUSD. Since its launch, the stablecoin has steadily grown in adoption, reaching a market capitalization of about $742 million. The collaboration with Securitize, and through it with BlackRock and VanEck, also improves XRPL’s presence in the real-world asset (RWA) tonization sector.

Title: Kraken quietly closes $500M round as its unusual CEO pushes toward the IPO finish line
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/09/25/kraken-ipo-ceo/
Time Published: 2025-09-25T17:38:45Z
Full Content:
Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. “My neighbors think I’m under house arrest,” observes Arjun Sethi. It’s not hard to see why. On the driveway of Sethi’s comfortable Menlo Park home, located a few miles from Stanford University, sits a black Cybertruck that rarely leaves. Meanwhile, various figures stream in and out of a wide open garage anchored by a table littered with electronics. Inside, there are no pictures on the walls and the domicile’s only personality is supplied by a large German shepherd patrolling the backyard. Sethi is no criminal, though, and the house is not just his home. It is also the prime outpost for Kraken, the longtime cryptocurrency exchange where Sethi, who draws few lines between his personal and professional life, is co-CEO. The gray-flecked 42-year-old, who favors plain T-shirts, may not be concerned about what his neighbors think of him. But he does have to care about the opinions of another group: Kraken’s investors, who are expecting big things in the near future. Founded in 2011, Kraken has long flown under the radar compared with its bigger competitor Coinbase, but has always commanded the respect of traders and crypto veterans. In the past year, the company has reached for a bigger share of the spotlight with high-profile acquisitions and product launches ahead of an IPO planned for next year. All of this will test whether Kraken can meet the lofty $15 billion valuation that came with a new funding round it closed this month. Meeting that challenge will fall to Sethi who, despite an official title of co-CEO, is very much calling the shots at Kraken. An executive whose experience lies primarily in venture capital, he is an unusual choice to lead a company on the cusp of going public, but one very much in keeping with Kraken’s history as an unconventional company. Sitting at a large desk plunked in the center of his sparse living room one August afternoon, Sethi patiently replies to my questions as random figures pop in and out of the garage. He has a wide range of intellectual interests—he dabbled in journalism in college and has read extensively on major religions—but for Sethi nearly everything comes down to data. After founding a pair of startups and working as a senior product manager at Yahoo, Sethi cofounded the venture capital firm Tribe Capital. Even more than its peer VC firms, Tribe has a reputation for data-based decision-making, which led to bets on Kraken, as well as on Carta, which makes cap-management software, and the cloud computing firm Docker, among others. If the unsentimental Sethi has a passion, it is the idea of using blockchain technology to fix obstacles in the financial system that prevent people from tapping into collateral they own. He cites, for instance, the common conundrum faced by employees who leave a startup and must exercise their stock options and pay related tax within 90 days—resulting in many of them simply walking away from their equity. The solution, Sethi says, is tapping into the modular stack of services offered by decentralized finance (DeFi), which promises to give consumers an unprecedented degree of control over their assets, and let them lend or securitize them like never before. “My hope with crypto is to distribute those benefits more evenly. We’re not all the way there, but the first steps are happening—stablecoins, then tokenized assets, and now tokenized equities,” said Sethi. His vision is for Kraken to be a hub for all of these things, bringing the best elements of crypto and the traditional financial stack under one umbrella. To that end, the company spent $1.5 billion this spring to buy NinjaTrader, a platform for professional asset traders, in a move that boosted Kraken’s customer base by 2 million and represented, in Sethi’s words, the “largest-ever deal combining TradFi and crypto.” Coinbase is the dominant player in retail crypto, but Kraken’s bread-and-butter has always been professional and institutional customers. Lately, though, Kraken has been pushing to expand its presence in retail, including with the launch of xStocks, which are shares of popular companies like Apple and Tesla, wrapped in crypto and tradable on blockchains. The concept of blockchain-based stocks may seem exotic or downright unnecessary, but look closer and the early response to xStocks appears to validate Sethi’s views on where finance is going. He notes that xStocks, which the company hopes to offer in the U.S. next year, are taking off in markets like South Africa where the fees to purchase traditional stocks from brokerages can still be over 10%. By offering shares on a decentralized blockchain platform—xStocks can even be traded outside of Kraken’s exchange—there is less opportunity for middlemen like brokerages to exact high fees. Kraken is one of a handful of trading firms, including Robinhood, that are offering tokenized assets, and some big Wall Street names like BlackRock are doing the same. If this is indeed where the world is heading, it will be the latest instance of Kraken being ahead of the curve; previous examples include the exchange being one of the first to list Ethereum and to offer crypto derivatives. Unlike most startups, Kraken made it this far with very little in venture capital funding, raising only $27 million from its founding until this year. That recently changed, however, as the company decided to raise a $500 million round as part of its final gear-up for an IPO. The Information reported in July that the company was seeking to raise that amount; this week Fortune learned, from a person who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, that it successfully closed the round this month. The round featured no primary investor with Kraken itself setting the terms, including the $15 billion valuation, said the person. Contributors included investment managers and venture capitalists, as well as Sethi’s Tribe Capital and Sethi in a personal capacity. The investors are pouring money into a thriving business that pulled in nearly $80 million in post-Ebitda earnings, and over $411 million in revenue in the second quarter, according to figures published by Kraken. Those numbers, along with the firm’s longevity and strong reputation in the industry, put it in position to be one of the strongest of the crypto firms entering, or on the cusp of entering, public markets. If there is a wild card, though, it may be the firm’s senior leadership. Following our sit-down interview, Sethi and I take a turn around his Menlo Park neighborhood, and return to his house for dinner with a member of his team and a cousin who has turned up. The meal is delicious but unusual. The cousin has arrived with coolers full of stone crabs, which he and Sethi scatter on plates of ice around the kitchen. There is a shortage of crab utensils, but since this is Silicon Valley, Sethi punches an order into an app and more appear at the door in a matter of minutes—a trick he performs several times over the course of my visit. The main course comes in the form of thin, marinated fillets of something (Sethi won’t say what) that have arrived in a same-day delivery from Wyoming. Sethi artfully grills the stack of fillets in his backyard, serving them with a nice California red, and that’s all. The dinner was par for the course for how Kraken operates more broadly. For its first decade, Kraken was defined by its cofounder Jesse Powell. A soft-spoken philosophy major and self-described introvert, Powell steered the company through various crises that buffeted the crypto industry. At some point along the way, he took on a more abrasive persona on X, posting comments on topics like gender and pronouns that made him a villain among certain mainstream media outlets. A working-class kid from Sacramento, Powell has also been game to spar with San Francisco liberals, including by suing a co-op he says denied his bid to buy a unit on grounds of his politics. (The case is ongoing.) In 2022, Powell stepped down as CEO amid a federal investigation into his role at a Sacramento arts nonprofit he had founded. The probe created a multiyear legal ordeal for Powell, including an FBI raid of his house that was leaked to the New York Times. The Justice Department this summer acknowledged Powell had done nothing wrong, but the three-year legal cloud resulted in tumult at the top of Kraken. On stepping down, Powell named longtime lieutenant Dave Ripley as CEO, but last year the company announced Sethi had taken on the role of co-CEO. A co-CEO arrangement is unusual at the best of times, and according to multiple people with ties to the company, it is basically a fiction in the case of Kraken. One former executive, who asked not to be named in order to speak candidly, said that on a Zoom call shortly after the co-CEO announcement, an employee asked Powell who would be making decisions; the founder stated definitely that Sethi would decide everything—even as Ripley, the now co-CEO, sat nearby. That same person praised Sethi’s command of product, but also complained that the new leader appeared indifferent to staff morale, and has run Kraken more like a venture capital firm than a company, relying on outside associates more than longtime staff. The person added that Sethi’s ongoing ties to Tribe Capital, where he is chairman, pose a conflict of interest. “Arjun is chairman of Tribe Capital, but doesn’t run [Tribe’s] business day to day. This arrangement was approved by both the Kraken board and his LPAC [limited partner advisory committee] at Tribe,” said a Kraken spokesperson. Sethi’s arrival also roughly coincided with the departure of a number of senior executives, including Kraken’s CTO, COO, senior sales staff, and longtime lawyer. While executive turnover occurs at every organization, the scope of change at Kraken has likely contributed to the company’s IPO bid getting pushed to 2026 even as a spate of other crypto firms have gone public this year. The Kraken spokesperson addressed the turnover by pointing to an October blog post by Sethi and Ripley titled “A New Day,” which notes: “We made a number of changes to the organization to eliminate layers and make the organization leaner and faster.” She acknowledged the shake-up had affected morale, but added that employees are now “energized and excited” as Kraken’s pace of shipping products picks up. Another former executive contacted by Fortune, who asked not to be identified owing to legal constraints, also made the case that Sethi’s disruptive management style was necessary to prepare the company for its IPO push. The person added that Kraken’s many years in business had resulted in more pre-IPO regulatory and operational issues than other firms, and added that the co-CEO role has served the company well, with Ripley excelling at internal operational issues and Sethi handling sales and public-facing roles. For his part, Sethi described his co-CEO as a “multiplier of the strategy because Kraken has so many products” and said he is seeking to build a management structure similar to what Mark Zuckerberg has done at Meta, where dedicated teams serve each of the company’s discrete brands. Following a period of investor exuberance that peaked in 2021, the window for new companies to go public all but closed as investors came to see startup valuations as overly inflated. That finally changed this year, and for crypto companies, a new appetite for public companies combined with regulatory tailwinds has led to an IPO bonanza. In the past few months, stablecoin issuer Circle enjoyed one of the biggest same-day IPO pops in corporate history, while lesser lights of the crypto scene like Gemini and Bullish also made successful public debuts. For Kraken’s investors, the company’s decision to wait until 2026 to list publicly is likely a source of frustration and anxiety. Will the market still be eager for another crypto IPO? There is cause for concern on this front. There are a growing number of indicators that current stock prices are overvalued, and in the case of the newly listed crypto firms, their business prospects appear tenuous. In Circle’s case, declining interest rates are a direct drag on the firm’s stablecoin revenue, while both Bullish and Gemini have far fewer customers than the likes of Kraken and Coinbase. If the current crypto bull run is followed by a crash, as has happened in numerous previous cycles, these firms’ share prices risk being clobbered. All of this increases the pressure on Kraken to hasten its IPO. But if the bottom falls out of the market before it has time to list, Kraken investors can take comfort that—far more than most other crypto firms—it has a sound business model and multiple revenue streams. The company is also seeing growth in numerous key markets outside of its longtime strongholds of Europe and the U.K. This means Kraken, regardless of how its IPO plans shake out, is built to play the long game. “Our model’s built around pro traders and institutions,” says Sethi. “Features like Kraken Pro, our robust API, and advanced interfaces make us a destination for funds and high-volume clients—they use our exchange not because it’s flashy, but because it works and the liquidity is deep.” In the future, Kraken will be in an even better position if Sethi’s vision of a total convergence of traditional finance and crypto comes to pass. If it does, the company’s investors and executives—especially Sethi—stand to make a tidy bundle. So much so that Sethi will have the resources to easily fund a charm offensive to win over his suspicious neighbors—provided, of course, that he cares about such things. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Intel has held talks with Apple about a possible investment, Bloomberg reported Thursday, the latest effort by the beleaguered chipmaker to reinforce its business in recent weeks with funding from Nvidia, SoftBank and partial ownership by the U.S. government. Discussions between Intel and Apple are at an early stage and include talks about the two companies working together more often, though it’s not clear whether an agreement will be reached, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Apple and Intel partnered for years as Intel provided chips for Apple computers, though their cooperation was cut after Apple announced in 2020 the company would produce its own processing units, and Apple has since unveiled a second iteration of its chip, the M2, which is manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Intel shares rose by nearly 6% to just below $33 as of around 11:10 a.m. EDT, following an earlier premarket rally, while Apple’s stock ticked slightly higher (0.3%). Neither Apple nor Intel immediately responded to requests for comment from Forbes. Intel has reached out to other unspecified companies about potential investments and partnerships, according to Bloomberg. Intel’s shares have rebounded in recent months after the Trump administration signaled support for the chipmaker. President Donald Trump earlier this year called Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan “highly CONFLICTED” and urged Tan to resign, following his alleged ties to Chinese firms and a criminal case involving Cadence Design, where Tan previously served as CEO. Tan and Trump appeared to mend their relationship, however, after Tan visited the White House in August. Following the visit, SoftBank announced it would invest $2 billion in the company as part of both firms' “investing in advanced technology and semiconductor innovation” in the U.S., ranking SoftBank as Intel’s fifth-largest shareholder. Trump announced in late August that Intel agreed to give the U.S. a 10% stake in the company, making the federal government one of its largest shareholders behind BlackRock and Vanguard. Earlier this month, Nvidia said it would acquire $5 billion worth of Intel’s shares and announced the two companies would collaborate on developing custom data center and personal computer products.

Fianna Fáil presidential election candidate Jim Gavin has said he did not see bullying or sexism during his military career but he praised the Women of Honour group for highlighting abuse in the Defence Forces. A tribunal was established following allegations of widespread abuse and misconduct made by the group. Mr Gavin, a former Defence Forces member and Dublin GAA manager, visited Blackrock and Dalkey in south Co Dublin on Thursday to canvass voters. During a press conference, he said the Women of Honour had “done the State some service by stepping forward” and that “we need to learn from what happened”. He said that during his time in the military he served “with pride” and “to the highest standards” and he “set a very high standard for those people who I led and who I followed”. “I had a really positive experience in Óglaigh na hÉireann,” he said. “It gave me great opportunities. It shaped the person who I am.” Pressed on whether he has seen examples of bullying or sexism during his time in the organisation, Mr Gavin replied: “I didn’t see any of that.” He added: “That’s not everyone’s experience and I understand that. I championed those who have put their name forward and I think they’ve done the State a great service.” The former Air Corps member said he was “very proud” of what the Women of Honour did in stepping forward and that he was fully behind them and “really keen to see what comes out of this inquiry”. [ Presidential candidate Jim Gavin says online claims about him are ‘obvious lies’Opens in new window ] Mr Gavin, who is on leave from his role as chief operations officer of the Irish Aviation Authority for the duration of the campaign, was also asked if he was satisfied about a secret arrangement dating back to the Cold War era that allowed the UK to police the State’s airspace. “You mentioned that word secret so obviously one can’t comment on that,” he said, adding that “these are matters between the Irish Government and any other particular state”. Mr Gavin said he welcomed planned Government’s investment in the Defence Forces arising from proposals from the Commission on the Defence Forces. Separately, asked whether he felt people need help with the cost of living with the budget approaching, Mr Gavin said: “I think cost of living, housing, homelessness, these are challenges of our time and our Government will be defined by them. “The Taoiseach and the leaders in Government have said that there is more work to do, and I accept that. “And as president, though you are non-political, I will, without fear, nor favour, highlight issues that are important to Irish people and represent them to the best of my ability.” [ Presidential election: Meet the three hopefuls who will be on the ballot paper next monthOpens in new window ] Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Listen to our Inside Politics podcast for the best political chat and analysis Get the Inside Politics newsletter for a behind-the-scenes take on events of the day Our politics team's behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

Securitize, a platform for tokenizing real-world assets, is expanding to the Sei blockchain with the tokenized Apollo Diversified Credit Fund (ACRED) the first to debut on the network. The move introduces tokenized private credit to Sei for the first time, the firm said. ACRED, which has $112 million in total value according to RWA.xyz, acts as a feeder into Apollo’s private credit strategy, which includes corporate lending, asset-backed deals and dislocated credit. Only qualified investors can participate, and the tokens are interoperable across blockchains via Wormhole, a cross-chain messaging protocol, allowing easier movement between networks and improving liquidity. Tokenized private credit is part of a broader shift in financial markets in which traditional instruments are represented on blockchain systems to speed up settlements and cut out intermediaries. The real-world asset market is now above $30 billion, RWA.xyz data show. "ACRED’s expansion to Sei further demonstrates how blockchain infrastructure can unlock new pathways for investor participation in private credit and accelerate digital innovation,” said Christine Moy, a partner at Apollo and the head of digital assets, data and AI strategy, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. Other funds will hit Sei in the near future, Securitize said. Securitize has already tokenized over $3 billion in assets, including offerings from BlackRock, KKR, and VanEck, the release said.

Title: Banks retreat from climate change commitments – but it’s business more than politics

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AAI.jhmy3ce5q Share article Print article Another business-led effort to fight climate change is unraveling. On Aug. 27, 2025, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance suspended its activities after several major U.S. and European banks backed out. While most observers are blaming the strong political backlash in the U.S. against climate change action and sustainable investing, we believe the banks didn’t need much of a push: These net-zero alliances never made much business sense and were not particularly effective at fighting climate change. Indeed, for us the puzzle was why they had flourished in the first place. To examine their rise and fall, we recently conducted a research project that encompassed interviews with more than 80 executives from various financial institutions, activist organizations and oil and gas companies. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance was founded in 2021. Members agreed to limit lending to carbon-intense sectors so that total greenhouse gas emissions from companies in the banks’ loan portfolios are close to zero by 2050. This target aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement but was not binding and lacked clear shorter-term targets and plans. Similar net-zero networks were established for insurance, asset management and other financial areas, all under the umbrella of the United Nations Environment Program’s Finance Initiative. Over the past 16 months, the insurance and asset managers’ alliances have also suspended their activities. These net-zero alliances were built on the premise that climate risk equals financial risk and that the challenge requires a collective response. Their goal was to leverage the power of finance to push companies to decarbonize their products and processes. Key financial regulators, central banks and a few of the largest asset managers propelled these alliances because they perceived that climate change poses serious long-term systemic risks to markets and economies around the world. Influential figures such as Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and former Bank of England head Mark Carney, now the prime minister of Canada, lent legitimacy to these initiatives. Some environmental groups also supported these alliances as a smart strategy to pressure companies on climate. Many other financial institutions then joined the net-zero bandwagon, but our research revealed that they didn’t do so because of concern about climate-related financial risks. Rather, they felt an array of pressure from peers, investors, activists, regulators and even their families. Many people we interviewed mentioned reputational risk as a key driver and saw a low-carbon transition as inevitable, driven by regulation, technological innovation and consumer demand. This was the Biden era, with billions of dollars flowing to clean energy through the Inflation Reduction Act. The burgeoning field also spawned a specialized but lucrative industry of data providers and consultants who actively marketed carbon management, disclosure and broader sustainability services. The global market for sustainability data and software was estimated at more than US$1 billion in 2024 and growing rapidly. Climate strategy and sustainability reporting was the fastest-growing business sector for accounting and consulting firms. And asset managers were happy to collect higher fees for funds screened for sustainability – even though these funds have not outperformed the broader market. These vested interests spurred continued expansion of net-zero networks. Indeed, at its peak in 2024, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance included over 140 members globally with $74 trillion in estimated total assets, representing over 40% of global banking assets. Given the size and scope of these net-zero networks, what triggered their rapid collapse? One major factor, of course, was the political backlash against anything connected with climate action and sustainable investing following the 2024 election of President Donald Trump. Finance officials in more than 20 U.S. states have demanded that major asset managers restrict the use of environment, social and governance benchmarks, accusing them of eroding “traditional fiduciary duty” and claiming they hurt investors. In August, 23 Republican attorneys general accused organizations created to set standards for corporate climate disclosures of operating an anticompetitive “climate cartel” and violating antitrust laws. While the political pressure in the U.S. has indeed been intense, the collapse of net-zero networks and the broader corporate retreat from climate commitments is largely due to the continued profitability of fossil fuels and the high costs and risks of deep decarbonization. Investors and banks, of course, want to keep on financing profitable companies and avoid pressuring their clients to take risky measures. Oil companies such as BP and Shell that had relatively strong climate targets suffered financially as a result, prompting them to retreat from these targets and shift capital from renewable projects back toward fossil fuels. High energy prices in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war made the sector even more lucrative. Low-carbon fuels and processes for industries such as aviation, steel and cement are still very expensive. Moreover, the Trump administration is abolishing most subsidies for clean energy and freezing permits for offshore wind, while easing regulations and opening more land for oil and gas exploration. These economic incentives made it hard for the banking alliance to reduce financing for fossil fuels – and the money has kept on flowing into oil and gas projects. European banks that sharply cut funding to fossil fuel companies saw their business diverted to other banks and to private, nonbank sources of finance, which has soared in the past two years. Facing this loss of business, major banks’ lending to oil and gas companies surged in 2024, driving loans to a three-year high of $869 billion. The costs of membership in the net-zero alliances also increased over time, with the adoption of stricter standards that called for specific plans and timelines for ending fossil fuel financing entirely. The new standards also required loan recipients to disclose Scope 3 emissions, which include emissions from a company’s suppliers and customers. Managers in financial institutions told us that the increasingly complex and demanding requirements were generating strong pushback from their clients. We also heard that membership was turning from a reputational asset to a liability, as activist organizations called out the hypocrisy of continued fossil fuel lending despite their commitments to phasing it out. Although banks are rushing back to finance fossil fuel projects, these loans typically have long terms of 10 to 25 years. This means they carry the risk that an eventual transition to clean energy will make these projects worthless, “stranded assets.” One study estimates that investors are currently exposed to more than $1 trillion in potential losses. Why do banks often ignore these risks? Our interviewees mentioned the organizational silos that separate analysts who assess climate risks from the loan originators. In other words, the employees deciding where to lend money may not be talking to the team that best understands the long-term risks. Moreover, current risk assessment tools are quite crude and don’t generate the quantitative metrics that loan underwriters want. Finally, loans are increasingly repackaged and sold, or securitized, into the larger corporate debt market, obscuring the risks. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance isn’t disappearing entirely. The group is currently deciding on whether to restructure into a much weaker “framework initiative” that provides voluntary guidance instead of binding commitments. And some banks leaving the alliance have stated that they will maintain their climate goals and sustainability policies. But climate risks are real and growing. The Boston Consulting Group recently estimated that just the physical risks – floods, drought and wildfires – could cost companies up to 25% of their profits by 2050 and substantially cut global GDP. A transition to a low-carbon economy will cost trillions of dollars and create massive disruption – as well as opportunities – as new technologies and companies emerge. The longer that action is delayed, the greater the risks to the planet – and of more drastic shocks to the global economy and financial system.

Zilch, the London-based fintech transforming the way people pay, today announces the appointment of Boriana Tchobanova as its Chief Operating Officer (COO) as it continues to strengthen its world-class management team. 0 25 September 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Tchobanova joins from American Express Global Business Travel, where she served as Chief Transformation Officer, leading the business’ post pandemic recovery and industry transforming M&A, and paving the way for its successful multiple billion-dollar IPO in 2022. Prior to this, Boriana spent almost 15 years with American Express across multiple senior roles in strategy, transformation and operations, including as COO of the company’s digital business. This appointment comes on the heels of Zilch doubling revenues to £110 million for the year ending March 2025 - marking a fourth straight year of 100% growth - with gross profit surging 143%. Zilch was recently recognised as EMEA’s fastest-growing tech unicorn by Deloitte and ranked the UK’s fastest-growing $1bn+ fintech by both the Financial Times and The Sunday Times. This impressive growth trajectory has seen the business attract a wide range of industry leading talent to turbocharge the next stage of its journey. Tchobanova’s appointment follows the appointment last year of Mark Wilson, BlackRock main Board Director and former CEO of FTSE 100 insurer Aviva, to the Board. Tchobanova will work closely with the CEO and business line leaders to drive operational excellence, transformational change and strategic delivery. Bringing her two decades worth of Fortune 100 experience, she will work with the team to deliver major initiatives that will support the organisation’s growth, unlock new revenue opportunities and improve efficiencies. Philip Belamant, CEO and Co-Founder of Zilch, said: “Zilch has achieved exponential growth over the past five years by pioneering a model that delivers better outcomes for consumers while building very strong operating leverage. This puts us in a powerful position as we enter the next phase of our journey, scaling a business built to stand among the most significant players in global finance. Attracting leaders from major incumbents is always a positive sign, but the real test is finding those who can bring deep institutional knowledge without being held back by the cultures, technologies or beliefs of those very institutions. We believe Boriana is one of those rare people, and I’m delighted to welcome her as we shape the future of Zilch.” Commenting on her appointment, Boriana Tchobanova said: “Zilch’s mission to eliminate the high cost of consumer credit for the mass-market and accelerate financial inclusion through advanced technologies is deeply meaningful to me. In just five years, the company has delivered record-breaking growth and is now building a category-defining business. The next phase - launching bold, customer-centric product innovation, pursuing transformative M&A and preparing for a potential listing - will demand operational excellence at scale. I’m supercharged to join Phil and his exceptional team for the road ahead.”Zilch has also appointed industry leading, full-service communications agency, MHP Group, who will deploy its specialist advisors across strategic communications, public affairs, creative campaigning and capital markets advisory. Its Financial Services team has supported fast-growth, pre-IPO fintechs on their journeys to going public, including Coinbase and Airwallex, with its Capital Markets and Corporate Advisory team ranked as one of the leading communications advisers. Alex Bigg, CEO of MHP Group commented: “We couldn’t be more excited to be working with Zilch, the UK’s fastest growing fintech unicorn. The business is on an extraordinary growth trajectory with ambitions of becoming a listed business. MHP Group has a long history of working with some of the most exciting high-growth private businesses and major listed brands, and our unrivalled depth of expertise and specialisms will see us support Zilch as it continues to build something truly powerful.”

Title: Can XRP extend its recovery after Ripple-BlackRock partnership?

XRP defended $2.7 support, but a bearish pattern could derail the recovery Fund holders of BlackRock’s BUIDL can redeem the shares to RLUSD for fast and efficient on-chain liquidity. The update did not stir XRP as the altcoin under the whims of the broader market sentiment. Ripple [XRP] has announced off-ramp support for BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, allowing fund holders to swap 1:1 with its stablecoin RLUSD. A similar feature will be enabled for VanEck’s tokenized product, VBILL, in the coming days. According to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the move was a ‘real utility’ for users to have on-chain liquidity on the go. He added that the swap feature will be available on Ethereum [ETH] but will be expanded into the XRPL ecosystem. Source: X The off-ramping will be achieved through a partnership with Securitize, the real-world asset tokenization powering the VBILL and BUILD products. Conventionally, the off-ramping for these two tokenized treasury funds involves off-chain through bank transfers or equivalent cash via Securitize. This could take more time for settlement, hence the on-chain exit like RLUSD can be more efficient. But RLUSD isn’t the first one to offer this feature. Circle made the first move in April 2024, allowing BlackRock’s BUIDL fund holders to cash out via USDC. As of writing, RLUSD had a market cap of $742 million, with an 8% growth in the past month. Circle’s USDC, on the other hand, had a $73.6B market size and ranked second only to Tether’s USDT. Source: DeFiLlama Some notable rival stablecoins that posted double-digit growth over the same period were Ethena’s [ENA] USDe and PayPal’s PYUSD. For Ethena, its high yield has been a key selling point, while PYUSD has scored several partnerships on top of its 4% yield rate. However, RLUSD was launched last December, so the current pace of growth was commendable too. In fact, its aggressive expansion towards institutional clients could fuel its growth. For Jack McDonald, SVP of stablecoins at Ripple, the latest partnership will be a ‘natural step’ to bridge traditional finance and crypto. For his part, Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, said the integration will help ‘automate liquidity for tokenized assets.’ That said, XRP, like the rest of the market, was barely holding itself together after the recent liquidation cascade. It was down about 10% from its September high of $3.2 but defended the H2 support at $2.7, raising recovery hopes. But price action formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, which could drag it lower if validated.

Title: AIL season preview: Clontarf looking strong but back-to-back titles a tall ask

Rarely has a new All-Ireland League campaign been so generously sprinkled with stardust. Most notably, of course, Carlos Spencer has pitched up as the new head coach at Terenure College, but it doesn’t stop there. There are also strong rumours of Cian Healy and Keith Earls making prodigal returns for Clontarf in 1A and Thomond in 2C, and there’s been a wide influx from the Ireland Sevens squad, the schools and abroad to augment the presence of provincial academy players. Nenagh Ormond also provide some novelty value as the first club from Tipperary to play in the top-flight while there’s also been plenty of player movement during the summer. Jordan Coghlan has made a return home to Clontarf, with his relocation to Malahide outbidding even the pull of his Terenure friends and King Carlos. The champions have also acquired a host of talent from UCD, including Ireland under-20s lock Alan Spicer, while backrower Richie Whelan has returned from his stint in La Rochelle and Angus Lloyd is back again. After last season’s trophy-laden season, and despite losing John Vinson to Australia, ‘Tarf look strong once more, although no team has retained the title since Shannon in 2006. Cork Constitution were the latest to come up just short, and last season’s beaten finalists have lost two of the star turns in their 2024 success (outhalf James Taylor and winger Matthew Bowen) to Australia, as well as John Forde and Daniel Hurley to Blackrock. But they have again recruited well from UCC, while another of that title-winning side, Rob Hedderman, and Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks, have both rejoined. And Con are, well, Con. St Mary’s, who host Clontarf on opening day, were the first newly promoted side to make the playoffs and have retained all their key men, while UCD/Leinster academy prop Andrew Sparrow and former Ireland under-20 prop Oisín Michel look like good signings. After their Bateman Cup win, Lansdowne were the form team in the second half of the season. Along with Coghlan, their acquisition of Bobby Sheehan looks like one of the signings of the summer. Ditto former Connacht centre Tom Daly, the ex-UCD captain James Tarrant and Leinster academy scrumhalf Tadhg Brophy from Naas. Inspired by Marks, newly installed as captain, they beat Clontarf in a full-on Leinster Senior Cup semi-final and host Con for their opener. But last season’s top four will be hounded by the chasing pack. Ahead of welcoming Young Munster on opening day, Ballynahinch, fifth in three seasons running, had a low-key summer featuring a June trip to Boston. Aaron Sexton has returned from his NFL sortie, and they’ve signed the captain of Wallace High School’s historic Ulster Senior Cup breakthrough, John Rodgers, and his outhalf team-mate Quinn Armstrong, albeit influential centre George Pringle has moved to Australia. Despite losing Coghlan, Harrison Brewer is back in Terenure from Japan, as is Conall Boomer from the MSL. Despite earning a senior contract at Connacht, John Devine has joined, as has scrumhalf Griffin Culver from Manawatu, lock Sean Rigney, and 22-year-old Argentinian outhalf Julian Leszczynski. Terenure beat St Mary’s and Lansdowne to win the Leinster Senior Cup, thanks to a hat-trick by under-20 winger Dan Martin and an eye-catching debut by Ben Blaney (last season’s captain in the school’s run to the final) in Spencer’s first official game at the helm. They start with three away games as their refurbished clubhouse won’t be open for business until the second half of the season and there’s a new gym coming on board. They ought not to be dull. Limerick club rugby is struggling, witness Garryowen and Shannon propping up on the top two flights, yet Young Munster defy this trend and could well be dark horses again despite losing Rigney and Leszczynski. As usual, they’ve cast their net far and wide. The 28-year-old former PBC, UCC and Cork Con scrumhalf John Poland has returned from the New England Free Jacks, Connacht duo Harry West and Orin Burke have joined, and so too has a 20-year-old Kiwi lock AJ Henson, on the recommendation of Lifeimi Mafi. “I’m very happy with what we’ve brought in,” says head coach Ger Slattery. “Hopefully we can gel them into a team to give us a successful season.” UCD head coach Emmet McMahon is sufficiently buoyed by the talent coming through and some shrewd acquisitions to target a quicker start than last season, avoiding the playoffs on the last day by a point. Old Belvedere, runaway 1B champions, have recruited heavily and in acquiring Hugh Hogan as head coach, the Irish women’s loss is surely their gain. After their dramatic playoff final win over UCC, Nenagh Ormond will bring boundless enthusiasm and several returning sons to supplement a home-grown core. Former Cresent Comprehensive and Munsters’ outhalf Oscar Davey returns from the USA to offset Ben Pope’s return to New Zealand. The 41-year-old player-coach Derek Corcoran will occasionally don his boots, and they’ve enjoyed a Donnacha Ryan-arranged preseason in La Rochelle. Nenagh’s first game in the top-flight at home to Old Belvedere on Saturday (kick-off 4pm) will be streamed live on IrishRugby+.

Outs: Ben Pope (returned home to NZ). Of the relegated duo, City of Armagh looked better equipped to bounce back than Garryowen on the basis of last season’s points tallies. Yet Garryowen were well beaten by Clogher Valley and Instonians in the Ulster Senior Cup. But City of Armagh have had a poor Ulster Senior Cup campaign, losing heavily to Instonians and Clogher Valley. By contrast, although relegation was compounded by departures, Garryowen’s Munster academy players have been swelled by the signing of Crescent and Irish schools fullback Fionn Rowsome. And after finishing last season strongly, Mike Sherry’s sky blues have had promising Munster Senior Cup wins away to Old Crescent and UCC. Having missed out in last season’s playoff semi-finals to Nenagh, Blackrock are strongly expected to mount another big promotion push under James Blaney. They’ve signed a couple of Leinster academy players in the powerful young Roscrea centre Jack Deegan and hooker Lee Fitzpatrick from Newbridge, as well as Connacht hooker Eoin de Buitléar. In Tomás O’Leary’s second season, UCC look less equipped after their late drive to last season’s promotion final having lost a few players to Con. Local rivals Highfield only just avoided a relegation playoff last season but good Munster Senior Cup wins over Cashel and Young Munster augur well. Morgan Lennon’s Old Wesley have been consistent contenders in recent seasons, although Reuben Pimm has moved to the Netherlands and they’ve lost Dan Campbell and Cronan Gleeson to UCD and Nenagh respectively. As was the case last season, Queens look like they’ll be heavily dependent on the availability of their sizeable Ulster academy contingent. As ever, Johne Murphy’s Naas will play some of the division’s best rugby, with Charlie Sheridan in midfield, although Leinster academy scrumhalf Tadhg Brophy has moved to Lansdowne. With James Cronin at the helm as player-coach, Highfield’s powerful maul and Ireland Sevens outside back Nicky Greene have shown up well in preseason and they could also be in the mix. Trinity, after Matty Lynch’s last-day dramatics against Cashel averted a second successive relegation, should be a year older and wiser after keeping their team largely intact, starting their campaign at home to Blackrock. Centre John O’Sullivan has joined from the ‘Rock’s Schools Cup-winning side, as has his team-mate Russian lock Artur Smykovskiy. Ambitious Instonians, with the Whitten brothers still in situ and Craig Gilroy a summer signing, will be seeking a fifth promotion in succession. Following a second successive relegation, nine-time champions Shannon have installed former captain Lee Nicholas as Director of Rugby to plot a return to the second tier, and the preseason form (featuring a 27-22 win away to Bruff) has been encouraging. Cashel will be itching to do likewise after their late mugging in the promotion final, although they look a little undercooked after a 32-12 loss in the Munster Cup at home to Highfield. The youthful, entertaining Corinthians set the early 2A pace last season but Connacht demands and midwinter triggered a fall-off and they missed out on the playoffs on points difference. Jim Harding has departed as head coach, and ex-Ireland under-20 centre John Devine has moved to Terenure. However, former Connacht and Terenure centre Colm de Buitléar has moved in the opposite direction, and under new coach Ambrose Conboy they’ve beaten Buccaneers (38-11), Galwegians (27-19) and Sligo (24-19) to win the club’s first Connacht Senior League crown since 1995. There’s a trio of Ulster sides in Banbridge, Ballymena and Dungannon (promoted via the playoffs). With Rob Lyttle in their ranks, Banbridge look the pick of the three. MU Barnhall beat Greystones, as they did in the playoff semi-finals last season, in the Leinster League final a fortnight ago to lay down a marker as both look like contenders again. Old Crescent will need to improve significantly as they were well off the pace last season, while newly promoted Wanderers, who had a poor Leinster League campaign, have enrolled Sean Skehan on a consultancy basis. On foot of the recent AIL survey, the main recommendation the IRFU has adopted is something they had wanted to do – regionalise Divisions 2B and 2C, in large part to save on travel expenses. This will not be popular with some clubs, who will understandably feel that the regionalisation of the lower two divisions will detract from the appeal of their campaigns and make them glorified junior clubs. This being the 11th season of the current format of five divisions of 10 teams apiece, it is also yet another redrawing of the AIL map. Depending on the make-up of the regions, it could also remove much of the jeopardy this season. After their relegations last season, Buccaneers (who have lost 33 of their last 36 AIL matches to suffer successive demotions) and Navan (who lost to Trinity and Greystones in the Leinster League) have had difficult starts to their campaign. So opportunity could knock again for Clogher Valley, who were denied a potential third successive promotion by their 23-22 semi-final playoff defeat to Dungannon but had good wins over Ballymena and City of Armagh in the Ulster Senior Cup before losing to Instonians. Nine of Galwegians’ 10 defeats last season were by a single score before they lost away to Navan in a playoff semi-final. With Stephen Mannion pulling the strings, Niyi Adeolokun has joined Brendan Guilfoyle’s ticket as attack coach. After encouraging Connacht League wins over Sligo and Buccs, they should be in the mix for promotion again and so avoid the IRFU’s expanded trapdoor. Ditto for Rainey Old Boys and UL Bohemians, while Malone’s early season form looks on a par with the former. After last season’s narrow escape, Sligo have hired former Connacht coach Grant Ross as their new Director of Rugby and have brought in four new forwards in Evan Ballantyne, Pat Lynch, Max O’Hehir, and Argentinian number eight Facundo Dellamea. Under New Zelander Ross their Connacht League form improved, beating Buccs and pushing Corinthians. Skerries, who survived via the playoffs, lost to MU Barnhall and Naas in the Leinster Senior league, but did have an encouraging win over Wanderers, whereas newly promoted Enniscorthy cancelled two of their Leinster League games and lost to Trinity in the other. After a seven-year absence and many near misses Bective Rangers are back in the senior ranks after a thrilling 39-34 win over Thomond in the playoff final augmented their first All-Ireland Junior Cup success. They’ve added to that momentum by beating Malahide, relegated to 2C from 2B, and Monkstown to claim the Leinster Shield and, as others have done upon emerging from the junior ranks, could even push for promotion. Thomond should also hold their own after their victory away to Omagh Academicals in the promotion/relegation playoff final ended their six-year absence from the AIL. They join fellow Limerick club Bruff, who gave Shannon a run for their money in the Munster Cup. Dolphin (who were a 1A club 11 years ago) were well beaten by Con in the Cup. They and Ballyclare lost in the playoffs last season, and the latter look likelier contenders than Belfast Harlequins, a 1A club 12 seasons ago, or Clonmel, beaten 60-0 by Young Munster in the Munster Cup.

Title: How a Billion Dollar Buy of Tesla Stock Set up a Trillion Dollar Vote
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/how-a-billion-dollar-buy-of-tesla-stock-set-up-a-trillion-dollar-vote/
Time Published: 2025-09-25T04:05:59Z
Full Content:
On September 15, 2025, Elon Musk filed a disclosure with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicating that he had acquired approximately 2.57 million shares of Tesla Inc. in open-market transactions on September 12, at a cost of nearly $1 billion. This represented his first meaningful open-market purchase of Tesla stock since 2020. Most of his holdings had come through exercising options granted under earlier compensation arrangements. According to the filing, the purchase prices averaged just under $390 per share. The market responded swiftly: Tesla’s stock surged to an intraday high of $425.70 before closing at $410.04. For a company with a market capitalization of roughly $1.4 trillion, such a reaction, amounting to more than a 5 percent move, was remarkable. Almost all major news outlets interpreted Musk’s purchase as a signal of renewed confidence in Tesla and, perhaps more importantly, of his willingness to devote more time and energy to the company amid his many competing ventures. That confidence proved contagious: Investors embraced the signal by imputing to the company nearly $70 billion of additional market value on the basis of the CEO’s $1 billion outlay. What the purchase does for Musk himself, however, runs deeper. First, there was a fortuitous coincidence: September 15, 2025, the date Musk’s purchase was disclosed, was also the record date for Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting scheduled for November 6. In practice, this means that all share acquisitions settling on or before September 15 are eligible to vote at the meeting. Purchases made on Friday, September 12, settled just in time under the new T+1 rule (excluding weekends) to be included on the record date. CEOs are generally predisposed to selling shares in their own companies, as they receive a ton through compensation, both to meet personal consumption needs and to diversify their portfolios. However, our prior research paper[1]discovered that when a contested voting event, such as a proxy contest, is on the horizon, CEOs slow their selling and may even accumulate additional shares to strengthen their voting and control power. In separate research, one of us documented record-date vote-buying by investors when controversial issues are on the meeting agenda.[2] This pattern maps exactly onto Musk’s behavior: He had been a consistent seller of Tesla stock in recent years, including liquidating tens of billions of dollars’ worth to finance ventures such as the acquisition of Twitter (now X), but in 2025 he made no sales, and, on the deadline for the record date, he executed a sizable purchase. So, what will be voted upon in the November shareholder meeting? At the center of the agenda is the proposed $1 trillion notional-amount compensation package for Elon Musk, a performance-based award of historic scale in corporate America. While the headline figure of $1 trillion has captured public attention, the actual realizable value will depend on whether an array of milestones are met, including market capitalization in multi-trillion-dollar increments, breakthroughs in full self-driving and robotics, and sustained profitability targets. What is clear, however, is that the vote will determine whether Musk receives the proposed package upon delivering the company’s most ambitious aspirations. At present, Musk beneficially owns 19.7 percent of shares outstanding (the percentage of votable shares could be a bit lower[3]) and other insiders such as his brother and board members hold an additional 0.2 percent.[4] For context, the largest outside shareholders are the usual “Big Three,” Vanguard (6.9 percent), BlackRock (5.7 percent), and State Street (3.5 percent). Put differently, Musk’s voting bloc by itself outweighs that of any single institution by a wide margin and is large enough to neutralize the combined opposition of two, or even three top outside investors. Tesla’s latest proposal may give some shareholders a sense of déjà vu. In 2018, they were asked to endorse what was then the most generous CEO pay deal in corporate history, an option grant nominally valued at $56 billion. That vote was advisory, a “say-on-pay” resolution that received about 73 percent support from unaffiliated shareholders (i.e., excluding Musk), allowing the board to justify implementing the plan. Yet in 2024, the Delaware Chancery Court voided the arrangement, faulting the board’s process and independence. Perhaps to avoid a repeat, the 2025 proposal has been structured differently on three key ways. First, the vote is binding (not “advisory”), i.e., approval by a majority of the shares present, and voting at the annual shareholder meeting is required for Musk to receive the award, ensuring that it has more legal force. Second, unlike in 2018 when Musk’s own shares were excluded, this time his stake will be included in the tally. This is perhaps because the current proposal has not been designated as a related-party transaction but instead as a board-approved employment agreement amendment, such that under the Nasdaq rule, Texas law, and Tesla’s bylaws all outstanding shares are entitled to vote. Musk needs about 40 percent of the outside votes to be cast in his favor. Given that 73 percent of more or less the same external shareholder base supported the 2018 package, achieving this threshold should not pose a significant challenge. Third, by disclosing the additional ownership, Musk was accidentally or effectively conducting an experiment that calibrates how the market would respond to a deeper personal commitment when concerns have been raised about the distractions faced by an unusually versatile CEO. Against that backdrop, a relatively small increase in his exposure, about 0.6 percent of shares outstanding, or $1 billion, triggered a nearly $70 billion rise in Tesla’s market capitalization. The leverage was striking: For every dollar Musk added, investors received seventy more. The implication is that if a marginal outlay can move the firm’s value so dramatically, then a fully focused CEO, dedicating his time and mind to Tesla’s most ambitious goals, could plausibly generate more in shareholder wealth over the next decade in $1 trillion units. Pope Leo has already expressed deep misgivings about the scale and symbolism of the package,[5] but much to his dismay, institutional investors may well vote it through.

Title: Ripple Powers New Offramp For BlackRock, VanEck Tokenized Fund

Ripple has added another institutional rail to its stablecoin strategy: through an integration with Securitize, holders of BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized US Treasuries can now redeem fund shares for Ripple USD (RLUSD) around the clock—initially on Ethereum, with support for the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in the pipeline. In a press release dated September 23, Ripple and Securitize said a new smart-contract flow “would allow holders of BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL to exchange their shares … for Ripple USD (RLUSD),” describing the mechanism as “an additional stablecoin off ramp for BUIDL and VBILL tokenized short term treasury funds.” The companies emphasized continuous availability—“24/7”—and framed the upgrade as programmable liquidity for compliant, on-chain investment products. Securitize also confirmed it is integrating with the XRP Ledger “to expand access and bring new utility to the XRPL ecosystem.” Jack McDonald, Ripple’s SVP of Stablecoins, positioned the move as a bridge between tokenized funds and transactional money: “RLUSD is for institutional use, offering regulatory clarity, stability, and real utility. As adoption grows, partnerships with trusted platforms like Securitize are key to unlocking new liquidity and enterprise-grade use cases.” On X, McDonald distilled the news for market participants: “RLUSD is now a key stablecoin offramp for BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL tokenized fund holders. The integration is starting with ETH, though Securitize is planning to integrate with the XRP Ledger.” Ripple President Monica Long linked the Securitize integration to a broader RLUSD tokenization push announced the prior week with DBS and Franklin Templeton, where RLUSD serves as a “liquid, stable and compliant exchange mechanism for tokenized assets in lending and trading use cases.” “This week, Securitize added RLUSD as a new offramp for BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenized funds,” she noted. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse underscored the 24/7 redemption promise and the XRPL roadmap: “Very excited to share that BlackRock’s BUIDL and @VanEck_US’s VBILL tokenized fund holders can redeem shares for RLUSD/ETH 24/7 365 through Securitize, and soon to come RLUSD/XRPL. Enterprise-grade instant onchain liquidity at your fingertips. That’s real utility.” The companies framed the design as explicitly regulatory-first. Ripple said RLUSD is issued under a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) trust charter, with “1:1 USD backing by high-quality liquid assets, strict reserve management and asset segregation, third-party attestations and clear redemption rights.” Ripple added that since launch in late 2024, RLUSD has integrated into DeFi and cross-border payment flows and surpassed $700 million in market capitalization. For tokenized funds, the off-ramp matters because it stitches together yield-bearing on-chain treasuries with settlement-grade stablecoin liquidity. BlackRock’s BUIDL and VanEck’s VBILL are tokenized short-term US Treasury strategies issued through Securitize on public blockchains; the new workflow lets qualified holders convert fund shares into RLUSD without banking hours friction, potentially improving collateral mobility for trading, lending, repo and treasury operations. The development also follows Ripple’s tie-up with DBS and Franklin Templeton, which is listing Franklin’s sgBENJI token on the DBS Digital Exchange alongside RLUSD to enable swapping between the tokenized fund and the stablecoin, and to explore using tokenized fund units as repo collateral—an example of how banks envisage tokenization rails meeting institutional liquidity needs. While the initial redemption path is live on Ethereum via Securitize, both firms signaled that XRPL integration is next, aligning with Ripple’s push to make RLUSD natively useful across multiple venues. If executed, XRPL support would extend the same institutional redemption mechanics to a different settlement environment—one that Ripple and parts of the treasury-tokenization market already touch via custody, payments, and prior Franklin Templeton XRPL issuance plans. Notably, BlackRock will be represented at Ripple Swell 2025 in New York on November 4–5 at Convene Hudson Yards. Maxwell Stein, BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, is slated to speak in a session titled “The Impact of Tokenized Financial Assets on Capital Markets,” alongside Rory Callagy of Moody’s. At press time, XRP traded at $2.88. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Independent presidential candidate Catherine Connolly has described America as an "imperial power" contributing to current volatility. "We have a very volatile situation in the world. We have imperial powers. America is one of those imperial powers. As a neutral country we have a duty [to] use our neutrality to call out the abuse of power, no matter where that is, whether by Russia or America," she said. Ms Connolly was asked about her comments at UCD last night drawing parallels between the current increase in military spending in Germany and its rearmament during the 1930s. She said that more and more there was a "profitable military industrial complex" that was heading in one direction rather than putting the money into peace. "After the Second World War, we said no more wars. And more and more, we have a more profitable military industrial complex that's heading in one direction. It's very hard to keep figures in my head. We're not putting that money into peace," she said. Last night, Ms Connolly contended that there are "parallels" between the rearmament policies of Nazi Germany in the 1930s and the recent decision by Chancellor Friedrich Merz to substantially increase military spending. She was outlining her concerns to UCD's Politics and International Relations Society, and remarked: "They're absolutely championing the cause of the military-industrial complex in Germany, as a booster for the economy ... Seems to me, there are some parallels with the ’30s." When the German Chancellor successfully campaigned in the Bundestag to boost defence spending earlier this year, he justified the move by citing the threat posed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the inauguration of Donald Trump as US president, saying: "We have for at least a decade felt a false sense of security." Around the same time, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said governments should be able to draw on €150bn in loans over the next five years, adding this would allow them to "massively step up their support to Ukraine". In her conversation with UCD students, Ms Connolly said she didn't want to "depress" them by referencing the "spend all over Europe on the military industrial complex", but added: "There is hope. And we have voices. And we can use them."

Ms Connolly, who is backed by the left-leaning parties in the Oireachtas, attended a meeting of the Dáil Public Accounts Committee this morning in her capacity as a TD for Galway West. Afterwards, and as a presidential candidate, she campaigned in the capital and is due to attend a rally in Harold's Cross this evening. Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys started her campaign today in Laois, with a lunchtime canvass in Portlaoise. Speaking in Portlaoise before travelling on to Limerick, Ms Humphreys said she's enjoying meeting people on the campaign trail and wants to be a president who focuses on the themes of "opportunity, unity and community". After canvassing in Limerick City, Ms Humphreys attended a Fine Gael rally in Patrickswell. Earlier, Ms Humphreys said housing supply is "the biggest challenge" facing the country and "very tough", but stopped short of agreeing with outgoing President Michael D Higgins that it has become a "disaster". Speaking this afternoon, Ms Humphreys said her focus is on securing 'number one' votes in the Presidential Election. Asked if she will be seeking Fianna Fáil 'number 2s', she said, "Regarding where people want to give their numbers twos, it’s a bit early at this stage. "My focus is going to be on looking for their support for me because if you don’t get enough votes, you don’t get elected," she said. Gavin had 'positive experience' in Defence Forces Fianna Fáil candidate Jim Gavin was in the capital this morning, with a canvass in Dalkey, Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire. Speaking in Dalkey, Mr Gavin said the Women of Honour, a group formed by current and former female members of the Defence Forces, have done a great service to the State by stepping forward and that lessons needed to be learned. When asked if he had witnessed any bullying or sexism in the Defense Forces, Jim Gavin said he did not. "I had a really positive experience in Defence Forces but I understand not everybody had that, and that's why I'm very proud of what they did, those women, they stepped forward. I'm fully behind them, and I'm really keen to see what comes out," he said. When asked if he would, as president, greet US President Donald Trump if he visited Ireland, Mr Gavin said: "Any elected head of state that comes, comes to the country that the president has to meet, I will meet them." Mr Gavin said he is looking forward to taking part in the upcoming presidential debates. "I'm really looking forward to it and enthused by it. I'll do my preparation as best I can and to represent my candidacy and what I'm going to offer and bring to the presidency of Ireland," he added. Yesterday, barrister Maria Steen failed to secure enough support to join the race, securing 18 Oireachtas nominations when 20 was required. After her campaign ended yesterday morning, Ms Steen told the media that "rarely has the political consensus seemed more oppressive or detached from the public's wishes". However, Taoiseach Micheál Martin rejected suggestions that the failure of Ms Steen to secure a nomination was "anti-democratic". Voting takes place on 24 October. With just three candidates, it is the smallest field in a Presidential Election since 1990. © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Longevity At Work: Why The Retirement Crisis Is A Unique Opportunity

ByJulian Hayes II, Contributor. For decades, 65 has been treated as the finish line of work. But that age marker signaling retirement was never designed for today's world. It originated in 19th-century Europe, when reaching the age of 70 was still a statistical rarity. Today, with people regularly living into their 70s, 80s, and 90s and thriving, the framework is becoming obsolete. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink underscored this in his 2024 annual letter to investors. He noted that if people are living longer and healthier lives, then the model of retirement must evolve in tandem with them. The old assumptions no longer fit. By mid-century, one in six people globally will be over the age of 65, according to Fink's letter. In the U.S., there's a high probability that the Social Security Administration program will be unable to pay full benefits by 2034. These demographic and financial pressures are often described as the core of a looming retirement crisis. But there's another issue that isn't readily discussed. Too many organizations still assume careers wind down at 65 and treat older employees as liabilities. In reality, longevity is extending careers by decades. Some countries are already adapting. The Netherlands, for instance, links its retirement age directly to life expectancy, acknowledging the current demographic reality and resetting expectations for both citizens and employers. The conversation typically comes to a halt at the point of system strain. However, another story is hiding in plain sight: older employees are staying in the workforce at record levels. A 2025 Newsweek survey found that 51% of adults nearing retirement age now expect to work indefinitely. That same report showed the share of Americans 65 and older in the workforce grew by 33% from 2015 to 2024, compared to less than 9% growth in the labor force overall. Among small businesses, the share of employees aged 65 and above has increased by 50% since 2019, according to Gusto's 2025 labor report. The drivers are financial—rising healthcare costs, disappearing pensions, shifting Social Security rules—but also deeply human. Many older workers mention purpose, mental stimulation, and social connection as reasons for staying employed. For organizations, this is a potential opportunity and can serve as a dividend for retention: experience, judgment, and cultural stability that compound over time. Workers who’ve weathered multiple business cycles bring perspectives and mentorship that younger teams can't replicate. With flexible arrangements, phased retirement, or hybrid roles, CEOs can leverage decades of knowledge and loyalty that might otherwise be lost. For much of the 20th century, the deal was straightforward: work 40 years, retire at 65, and rely on a pension. That contract has dissolved as careers now stretch six or seven decades, pensions are rare, and Social Security is under strain. Retirement is shifting from a hard stop to a glide path. Instead of abrupt exits, older employees are transitioning into flexible roles, project-based work, and different career arcs. For many, it is less about a paycheck than about relevance, stimulation, and purpose. Forward-thinking companies will design new principles and compacts that include: Longevity has already created a new class of late-career professionals. Companies that design and optimize for them will hold a distinct competitive advantage. Longevity is no longer a future variable; it is a present reality. The real question for leaders is whether they will treat it as a cost to contain or as capital to deploy. That requires a shift in both mindset and structure. CEOs and organizational leaders must: The retirement age of 65 may have been fitting for a different century, but today it is a relic of the past. What was once described as an impending retirement crisis can, in the hands of forward-thinking leaders, become a source of resilience and a unique competitive advantage.

Title: An ETF For Crypto Treasury Firms Could Launch Soon—Here’s What To Know

ByKirk Ogunrinde, Former Contributor. GSR Markets, a crypto trading firm, has filed to launch a new ETF that bundles a number of crypto treasury companies’ shares into one single fund, allowing investors to easily gain exposure to firms buying up crypto tokens. GSR's Digital Asset Treasury Companies ETF would bundle companies that buy and hold cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets—known as digital asset treasury firms—into one single fund that investors can buy. The ETF would also allow private investments in public equity (PIPE) deals—deals that allow investors to purchase equity directly from a publicly traded company—according to the filing. While other ETFs offer crypto exposure, GSR's fund is the first to offer exposure to the select group of crypto treasury companies. The ETF is expected to launch pending regulatory approval by the Securities and Exchanges Commission, but a date has not been given. GSR trades crypto tokens and provides venture funding for over 300 companies, according to its website. What Is A Digital Asset Treasury Company? Digital Asset Treasury Companies are firms raising capital through various measures to fund and hold significant portions of cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy , a software enterprise company turned crypto treasury, was the first to adopt this tactic in 2020 with bitcoin and crypto companies like Upexi Inc, Sharplink Gaming, and Bitmine Immersion Technologies have followed. Crypto ETFs, similar to stock ETFs, allow investors to invest in cryptocurrencies without directly owning them. These funds are overseen by professional fund managers and are under regulatory guidance. Investments can be managed through traditional brokerage accounts, without investors having to manage digital wallets or secure storages. Firms including BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale manage crypto ETFs across tokens like bitcoin, Ether, and Solana. Tangent The crypto treasury trend gathered steam this year, as companies rushed to take advantage of a crypto spike amid bitcoin's all-time high in August. According to crypto tracker bitcointreasuries.net, the 194 bitcoin treasury companies hold more than $117 billion worth of the token.

Solana continues to prove the power of utility-driven projects over hyped ones. Its tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) have soared to a record $671 million, setting a new all-time high and cementing Solana’s status as a hot blockchain. 🚨BREAKING: The total value of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on @Solana has surged to $671M, a new all-time high. The surge came after over $150M of inflows into @BlackRock’s $BUIDL fund on Solana. pic.twitter.com/51pkm0tFrA — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) September 24, 2025 The milestone comes after $150 million in new capital poured into Solana via BlackRock’s BUILD fund. That confirms robust interest from institutional players. Such breakthroughs indicate a key shift, with Solana’s low fees and speed now attracting massive on-chain transfers. Indeed, BlackRock’s fund has ignited Solana’s RWA marketplace, as anticipated. BREAKING: BLACKROCK BACKED BY SECURITIZE HAVE INTEGRATED WITH SOLANA TO EXPAND TOKENIZED REAL WORLD ASSETS ( RWAs ). TRILLIONS ARE COMING INTO MARKET pic.twitter.com/uuZCcOnzWN — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) January 30, 2025 BUILD focuses on tokenizing traditional assets and money market funds. Thus, the massive injection into the SOL network signals is a significant vote of confidence. Besides boosting numbers, institutional inflows bring attention, credibility, and liquidity. These factors are crucial for any project’s growth. It is not only the project’s dollar value that’s soaring. Solana has exhibited a healthy ecosystem lately. Its RWA transfer volume increased by roughly 23% to $12.19 billion in the past month. Moreover, RWA holders jumped 17% to 77,982 wallets. That confirms new participants joining the network as institutional players lead the charge. Also, stablecoin transfer volume surged 26.23% in the last 30 days to $318.99 billion. The $12.37 billion stablecoin market cap and 11.43 million holders affirm Solana’s position as a go-to platform for on-chain settlement. Growing grassroots activity amid increasing institutional inflows indicates a healthy ecosystem flourishing on all fronts. Solana sees activity from day-to-day users and wealthy financial institutions. The RWA breakthrough comes as institutional investors continue to transform Solana’s long-term narrative. Galaxy Digital-linked Forward Industries holds SOL worth approximately $1.63 billion. Also, Pantera Capital has invested over $1 billion, signaling trust in Solana’s long-term potential. Moreover, Helius Capital added over 760K SOL tokens to its treasury, with plans to scale using a significant $335 million cash reserve. 🚨 Breaking: Helius Medical has stacked 760,190 $SOL and is gearing up to scale with a massive $335M cash reserve! Extremely Bullish For Solana!! pic.twitter.com/SQ9To3Oc42 — Crypto Elias (@ItsCryptoElias) September 22, 2025 Solana’s native token performed well in the past few sessions, rallying to $250 monthly highs. However, the upside steam weakened, and bears seem to control the short-term trajectory. SOL is trading at $214 after losing 8% and 2% the past week and day. The altcoin’s underperformance is likely anticipated as prices cool down after the latest rally from around $150 in early August. Also, the downward trajectory coincides with broader market dips. Analysts remain bullish on Solana, citing bullish fundamental and technical factors. The digital asset is holding the key support zone at $210. Validating it could catalyze short-term gains toward the $250 target.

Native Markets claimed that over $15 million worth of the stablecoin was pre-minted in the 24 hours before it went live on Wednesday. Earlier this month, Hyperliquid opened proposals to take over the USDH ticker on the network. As a result, a stream of crypto companies put their hats in the ring, including the likes of Paxos, Agora, and Ethena—the last of those with backing from BlackRock. However, it was Native Markets, a company formed just “months” prior to proposals opening, that won the bid. “The next stage of Hyperliquid's ascendance will be driven by native stablecoins,” Native Markets co-founder Max Fiege wrote on X. “We're honored to be leading the charge with USDH and look forward to showing up for the ecosystem every single day.” The next stage of Hyperliquid's ascendance will be driven by native stablecoins. We're honored to be leading the charge with USDH and look forward to showing up for the ecosystem every single day. https://t.co/wnaOpwLs4r — max.hl (@fiege_max) September 24, 2025 The primary condition for proposals was for the USDH ticker to be a “Hyperliquid-first” and “Hyperliquid-aligned” stablecoin. Native Markets is doing this by donating half of USDH revenues to Hyperliquid’s Assistance Fund, a protocol-driven buy-back fund. The issuer’s proposal claimed the stablecoin is backed by a mixture of cash and “U.S. treasury equivalents” managed by Bridge—a platform acquired by payments giant Stripe in 2024—and will be compliant with regulations in the U.S. and Europe. It is worth noting that the USDH ticker will not receive any “special privileges,” the Hyperliquid Foundation said. That didn’t stop crypto heavyweights from fighting over the ticker, presumably seeing it as a premium ticker for a U.S. dollar stablecoin on a rapidly growing network. Despite the big names bidding for the stablecoin, three days before the vote commenced, predictors on Myriad thought it was 96% likely that Native Markets would win. (Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN.) Some Hyperliquid community members and builders called foul play, suggesting that Native Markets were given a head start and that validators were only considering the new firm’s proposal. Native Markets did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment. USDH’s debut comes at an interesting time for Hyperliquid, as it faces its first significant rival since launch. BNB Chain-based decentralized exchange Aster has seen its token skyrocket since launching last week, per CoinGecko, with the platform flipping Hyperliquid in revenue in the process. That said, according to DefiLlama, Hyperliquid remains ahead of Aster in weekly trading volume and revenue. Both projects are decentralized exchanges specializing in perpetual futures trading. Hyperliquid has dominated the field, although it appears that Aster is here to rival one of crypto’s biggest projects. Aster has surged 19% over the past 24 hours to a price of $2.31 and a nearly $3.8 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko, making it the 49th largest coin by market cap. Hyperliquid has fallen more than 6% on the day to $44.81, by comparison, although it remains well ahead with a $12.3 billion market cap and the 19th largest cryptocurrency. Even so, it's down almost 19% on the week, making it one of the biggest losers in the top 100 coins by market cap. Myriad users have turned bearish on HYPE's prospects in recent days, however, with 73% of predictors expecting the token to fall to a price of $39 sooner than it can rise to a new high of $69. The odds flipped on Sunday amid Aster's rise.

Now, as Goldman Sacks warns of U.S. dollar collapse, Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley is gearing up to offer bitcoin and crypto trading in 2026. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “We are well underway in preparing to offer crypto trading through a partner model to E-Trade clients in the first half of 2026,” Jed Finn, head of wealth management at Morgan Stanley, said in a memo seen by CNBC, adding that, “offering clients the ability to trade crypto is the tip of the iceberg.” At launch, E-Trade clients will be able to trade bitcoin, ethereum and solana, a Morgan Stanley spokesperson told Reuters. Eventually, Morgan Stanley expects tokenized versions of traditional financial assets on blockchains will “significantly disrupt” the wealth management industry. “Tokenized substitutes for cash begin paying interest as soon as it hits the wallet. The rest of the asset classes will follow suit in seeking this efficiency," Finn wrote in the memo, echoing BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink who has said crypto-based tokenization will create a “revolution” on Wall Street. “We see immense power in the cryptocurrency space, not just with crypto as an investment for our clients, but also around [blockchain’s distributed ledger technology] and tokenization more broadly." Morgan Stanley—which is among the most bullish of the Wall Street giants on bitcoin and crypto, making bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available to its wealth advisors in August last year—will offer crypto trading on E-Trade through a partnership with Zerohash, an infrastructure provider for the digital assets. This week, Zerohash, which provides crypto trading, tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure for financial institutions, raised $104 million at a $1 billion valuation in a round led by Interactive Brokers, it was reported by Fortune.

BlackRock, which manages around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with its IBIT bitcoin fund dominating a fleet of funds that launched in January 2024.

Title: Why Ethereum Treasuries Could Be The Next Big Business Strategy

BySandy Carter, Contributor. Ethereum treasuries are revolutionizing corporate finance, moving beyond idle Bitcoin holdings. Companies are now actively using ETH as a productive, yield-bearing asset through staking and DeFi lending, generating 3-5% returns. Liquid staking offers flexibility, allowing businesses to earn income while maintaining access to capital. This shift makes ETH a new, powerful tool for treasury management, impacting both large institutions and small businesses globally. Ethereum treasuries are quietly becoming one of the most consequential shifts in corporate finance. When the first corporate treasuries began buying Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs, it made headlines. Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square put digital gold on their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation and as a bet on a new monetary standard. Ethereum is quietly charting a different path (changing the world in different ways) that could prove even more transformative for corporate finance — and increasingly relevant for smaller businesses and investors too. According to the Block, nearly 70 organizations now hold more than 17 billion dollars worth of ETH directly, while ETFs account for another 25 billion. Together, close to 10% of Ethereum’s circulating supply is now under institutional control. An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is a familiar stock market product that lets investors buy and sell Ethereum the same way they trade Apple or Microsoft stock, without ever touching crypto directly. That scale is remarkable, but the real story lies in what institutions are doing with their ETH. Unlike Bitcoin, which often sits idle on corporate balance sheets, Ethereum treasuries are yield-bearing assets. Ethereum itself is more than just a digital coin. It is a programmable blockchain, like a global computer, where apps for finance, art, and identity are built. The coin, called ETH, is valuable both because it can be traded and because it powers those applications. According to Seeking Alpha, companies such as BitMine and SharpLink are now staking billions of dollars of ETH to generate predictable income streams. Staking is like putting money in a savings account, but instead of a bank paying you, the Ethereum network pays you for helping to keep it running. This is not speculation. It is balance sheet engineering. By staking or lending ETH, treasuries reduce circulating liquidity while creating new sources of revenue. According to Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, “Liquid staking captures the true magic of internet money and delivers it to asset managers on a silver platter. Institutional funds can now hold Ethereum that grows in value while staying liquid, a combination that traditional finance has never been able to offer. It is no wonder this strategy is spreading like wildfire across the globe.” According to Yellow.com, when ETH is staked, it generates yields in the range of 3 to 5%, often more than government bonds. ETH can also be deployed into lending markets, collateralized for credit, or structured into financial products. Traditional staking locks ETH away, which can be a problem if a company suddenly needs access to its capital. This is where liquid staking comes in. Think of it like a CD at the bank. With a CD, you earn interest but cannot touch the money until it matures. Liquid staking is like earning that same interest, but also getting a certificate you can borrow against, trade, or even spend while your deposit keeps working for you. For businesses, this is powerful because treasuries often need flexibility. They may want yield but also need to cover expenses or seize an opportunity on short notice. Liquid staking gives them both: productive assets and working capital. In Europe, liquid staking products have already been wrapped into regulated funds and exchange-traded products, allowing family offices and corporates to adopt the strategy without losing liquidity. Examples include Lido’s stETH and Rocket Pool’s rETH, which give holders a token they can move freely while still earning staking rewards. European adoption shows that liquid staking is not theory but an established practice that provides a roadmap for U.S. institutions. This matters well beyond Fortune 500 CFOs. A local business with extra reserves could stake a small amount of ETH to earn yield, much like putting idle cash to work in a savings account. A nonprofit could hold a fraction of its treasury in Ethereum ETFs to diversify beyond cash and bonds. Everyday investors could treat ETH staking like a higher-yield alternative to a bank account, understanding that the risks are different but the principle is similar — turning savings into income. Paul Frambot, CEO and co-founder of Morpho, the second largest lending protocol, emphasizes why risk safeguards are central here. “For institutions to adopt ETH treasuries at scale, they need the same credit and liquidity safeguards they expect in traditional finance. We are already seeing fintechs use DeFi lending as infrastructure, and corporate treasuries are following the same path. The difference is that Ethereum gives them programmable and transparent rails.” Institutions are beginning to establish a treasury playbook for Ethereum. Sam MacPherson, CEO of Phoenix Labs and core contributor behind Spark, explains the two most important sources of yield in practice. “When it comes to ETH, most of the fundamental yield comes from staking. I expect that actually to expand as more use cases in crypto come. Then there are onchain crypto lending markets such as SparkLend. These are people who are borrowing stablecoins. They have some ETH or Bitcoin, and want more exposure to the asset. So they’ll borrow stablecoins on an onchain market, and lever up that way, and they’re usually willing to pay a premium on top of the more base rate in TradFi.” These playbooks are not just about squeezing out returns. They point to a deeper shift in how companies treat digital assets. ETH is not simply something to hold on the side of the balance sheet. It is becoming a productive working asset. For investors, that means ETH is starting to look less like a speculative token and more like a hybrid between a growth stock and a bond — combining upside with regular yield. For businesses, it means treasury management is evolving. Where once the choice was between cash, bonds, or equities, ETH now represents a new category. Kean Gilbert, Head of Institutional Relations at the Lido Ecosystem Foundation, highlights this rotation. “Institutional money is rotating into Ethereum because ETH is both productive and liquid. That is a major change from Bitcoin reserves. This is not just holding crypto, it is re-engineering corporate digital asset strategy around programmable yield.” Several hurdles still need to be addressed. Risk management remains central, from validator penalties to smart contract exploits. Liquidity versus lockup is a real tradeoff, since staking yields require time commitments and occasional withdrawal delays. Liquid staking reduces this friction, but it still introduces complexity and counterparty risk. Regulation adds another layer of uncertainty. The SEC has raised questions about whether staking counts as a securities offering, while Europe has taken a more favorable approach with Ethereum ETFs and liquid staking products. Finally, governance questions remain: who decides how ETH treasuries are deployed, the CFO, the board, or specialized committees? Ethereum treasuries are becoming the next big business strategy. ETH serves a dual role: a strategic reserve asset and a yield-bearing instrument. That combination is powerful. In the coming years, we may see treasuries managed like corporate bond portfolios, balancing staking, lending, liquid staking, and ETF exposure. Platforms such as Lido, Spark, and Morpho may emerge as the BlackRock or Fidelity equivalents of Ethereum treasuries, building the rails that allow adoption at scale. More broadly, Ethereum is evolving into the financial operating system for balance sheets — from global corporations to local businesses to everyday investors. Ethereum treasuries are not simply digital reserves. They represent a new kind of financial strategy: programmable, productive, and accessible. The question is no longer whether ETH belongs in a portfolio, but how much, and how to manage it responsibly at scale. Ethereum treasuries will impact the markets.

By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) BTC$109,621.01 rebounded from Asian session lows of $111,000 to $112,800, repeating a pattern seen on Tuesday. However, the token remains below its 50- and 100-day simple moving averages (SMAs), with liquidity analysis and retail crowd sentiment signaling a potential for a deeper pullback. The CoinDesk 20 Index was down 0.7% over the past 24 hours, standing at 4,027. Two notable developments have emerged. The competition between on-chain decentralized exchanges Hyperliquid and Aster has intensified, with Aster surpassing Hyperliquid in daily revenue. According to DefiLlama, Aster generated $7.2 million in revenue in the past 24 hours compared to Hyperliquid’s $2.79 million. This divergence is also reflected in their native tokens: ASTR’s market cap has soared from $931 million to $3.74 billion in seven days, while HYPE’s market cap has dropped from $14.88 billion to $11.73 billion. ASTR has surged 37% over 24 hours, the best performance among the top 100 tokens by market cap, whereas HYPE ranked among the worst performers. In recent months, Hyperliquid has lost market share to competitors like Aster and Lighter, making this an area investors should watch closely. Meanwhile, data from CryptoRank shows Solana’s launchpad activity has sharply declined, with combined volume hitting a four-month low of $117 million. Active wallets have fallen below 100,000, and daily token project graduates – projects that have successfully completed their initial fundraising or token sale phases and moved on to public trading – have dropped to just 88, indicating reduced user engagement and fewer new launches. Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, challenged the idea of a broad crypto bull market, emphasizing that the 2025 rally is narrow and selective, focused on certain coins backed by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and digital asset trusts (DATs) such as BTC, ETH, and SOL. In traditional markets, the U.S. dollar rose 0.4%, likely influenced by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s cautious remarks on rate cuts earlier in the week. Nasdaq futures showed gains, offering risk-on cues to the crypto market. Stay alert!
