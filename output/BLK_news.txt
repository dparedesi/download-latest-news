Title: ONDO’s TVL hit new ATH with Ripple partnership – Will prices follow?

Time Published: 2025-06-12T03:00:08Z

Despite the ONDO x Ripple partnership, the two cryptocurrencies did not react instantly. Ondo Finance [ONDO] continued to lead in the Real World Asset space with its recent partnership with Ripple’s XRP Ledger to enable 24/7 access through the RLUSD stablecoin. The partnership of Ondo Finance and Ripple has seen the tokenization of the U.S. Treasuries cross stay at the XRP Ledger with 24/7 get right of entry to and redemption in RLUSD. The mixing was enabled via the BUIDL fund, a BlackRock initiative, making ONDO the hub of institutional DeFi infrastructure. But this was not merely a story game — this was operational capital investment in the quest of scalable income. ONDO sprang a new all-time high on its Total Value Locked of $1.368B. This was more than $20 million in additional growth since the previous milestone. Source: DefiLlama The market cap was equal to $2.824 billion, and the daily volume was $167.02 million. The revenue was less impressive though — annualized fees stood at $54.24 million. The platform revenue was $11.69 million as holders continued to get in revenue share. That was indicative of the growth momentum in ONDO but also indicative of the absence of direct holder returns, which may become an issue as the sector matures. Nevertheless, as the XRPL integration went live and the TVL was increasing, the strategy of ONDO proved to bring results. This was in terms of bringing real-world assets to DeFi rails. The extent to which it can maintain this rate will relate to its success in balancing institutional attractiveness with community incentives. Technically, ONDO kept increasing along the trendline, and the support as it approached the $0.867 area. The price was circling around $0.88 and indication of pressure was seen as price retested trendline. Provided this support beneath ONDO held, it may rebound back to the $0.90 area and even come a second time to challenge the swing high at around $0.98. Nevertheless, a decrease to the levels under $0.867 could result in the pullback to $0.84 or even deeper. The MACD indicated a deteriorating bullish trend, with the MACD line falling below the signal line ($0.0053) and heading into negative territory. This reversal indicated possible near term weakness unless momentum could get restored. Source: Trading View The trend structure was intact in the meantime, though a confirmed break below the rising support would turn the sentiment bearish. The traders may observe $0.867 and $1 as directional validation areas. Meanwhile, the price of XRP on the other hand saw modest gains in the last 24 hours while maintaining its stay around the $2.30 zone. This stressed that the partnership did not have direct impact on prices of the crypto in the short-term but would in the long-term.

Title: XRP Ledger Adds BlackRock-Backed Treasuries In Ripple Deal
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-blackrock-backed-treasuries-ripple-deal/
Time Published: 2025-06-12T01:30:20Z
Full Content:
The XRP Ledger (XRPL) moved from theory to production-grade finance today as Ondo Finance switched on its tokenized US Treasury fund, Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries (OUSG), directly on the network. The launch lets Qualified Purchasers mint or redeem OUSG around the clock by settling with Ripple’s enterprise-grade stablecoin RLUSD, effectively marrying BlackRock-custodied Treasury bills to a 24/7 public chain and its native decentralized exchange. OUSG is no boutique proof-of-concept. The fund already commands more than $670 million in total value locked and sits alongside BlackRock’s own BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX at the top of the rapidly expanding tokenized-Treasury league table. Ondo’s broader real-world-asset (RWA) platform manages roughly $1.3 billion, but this is its first deployment on a non-EVM chain—an endorsement of XRPL’s purpose-built tokenization rails. Institutional investors create or redeem OUSG in a single transaction by delivering or receiving RLUSD, Ripple’s dollar-pegged stablecoin that settles natively on XRPL. Because RLUSD itself moves in finality within three to five seconds, OUSG subscriptions bypass legacy cutoff times and traditional bank wires. Ripple and Ondo have committed liquidity to market-make both legs—RLUSD ↔ USD off-chain and RLUSD ↔ OUSG on-chain—so investors can scale in or out without slipping on spreads. The entire flow remains permissioned at the edges and permissionless in the core. Qualified Purchasers authenticate through Ondo’s compliance portal (leveraging Decentralized Identifiers and verifiable credentials), receive an allow-list flag on-chain, and then interact with the built-in DEX like any other asset pair. Settlement remains atomic: OUSG units burn or mint the moment RLUSD transfers, eliminating the daylight-risk gap that plagues traditional T-plus settlement cycles. XRPL’s deterministic order book, low fees, and native token-issuance primitives spare issuers the need to bolt on smart-contract wrappers for basic custody logic. Forthcoming Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) will allow OUSG to embed cash-flow rights and compliance fences at the protocol level, while the planned lending protocol will let desks rehypothecate OUSG as repo collateral without bridging to another chain. Permissioned Domains will give asset managers namespace-level control over who trades within walled gardens—a prerequisite for regulated liquidity pools. For treasury teams juggling intraday cash buffers, tokenized bills on XRPL unlock immediate redeployment of idle dollars. A fund manager who redeems OUSG at 21:00 ET on a Friday receives RLUSD within seconds and can cycle into overnight reverse-repo, stablecoin liquidity farming, or FX settlement in Asia before traditional markets even open. Conversely, corporates that sweep surplus RLUSD into OUSG every evening now capture US Treasury yield without operational drag. Markus Infanger, SVP of RippleX, framed the launch as a watershed: “Ondo’s OUSG going live on the XRPL demonstrates that tokenized finance is no longer theoretical—it’s maturing in real markets. Institutions can now access high-quality assets like US Treasuries on public blockchains, with the compliance and efficiency they need. This represents progress in bringing trusted financial assets into a 24/7 market—enabling greater liquidity, operational efficiency, and faster access to capital.” Ripple and Boston Consulting Group’s joint report projects that tokenization will convert $19 trillion of real-world assets into programmable instruments by 2033. Treasuries have emerged as the beachhead: they are low-risk, deeply liquid, and already digitized in the Federal Reserve’s master ledger, making them ideal for the first wave of on-chain replication. Total tokenized-Treasury value has surged past $7 billion this year, more than doubling since January, and is on track to eclipse the entire stablecoin float of 2017 by year-end. OUSG’s migration to XRPL could accelerate that trend. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund—the underlying asset pool into which OUSG deposits—distributes interest daily and permits same-day stablecoin redemptions, giving on-chain holders a money-market-fund experience without bank-hour limitations. By anchoring that mechanism in XRPL’s always-on settlement layer, Ripple and Ondo have effectively created a composable Treasury bill that “plugs and plays” with any XRPL-native application. The immediate roadmap is functional rather than speculative: open a secondary RLUSD-OUSG order book on XRPL’s DEX, integrate OUSG as collateral in XRPL-based lending markets once live, and extend mint-and-burn access to additional Qualified Purchaser jurisdictions as regulators sign off on the identity stack. Longer term, Ripple plans to use RLUSD as the hub currency for other RWAs—starting with commercial paper and municipal notes—turning XRPL into a full-spectrum capital-markets substrate.

Title: Report: Irish Church abuse allegations jumped 50% in 1 year
URL: https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/264693/report-irish-church-abuse-allegations-jumped-50-percent-in-1-year
Time Published: 2025-06-11T22:18:00Z

By Madalaine Elhabbal Washington, D.C. Newsroom, Jun 11, 2025 / 18:18 pm Allegations of sexual abuse of minors within the Catholic Church in Ireland significantly spiked this past year, a newly published report has found. The total number of allegations rose by more than 50% from 252 in 2023-2024 to 385 in 2024-2025, according to the latest report by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland. The figure represents the highest number since the organization began publishing annual reports on child sexual abuse in the Irish Church in 2009. The majority of these allegations, 73%, date to the period between 1960 and 1989, with only two cases relating to the period after 2000. Forty-seven cases had no time frame attributed to them. According to the report, which covers allegations from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, the increase in allegations took place predominantly in September 2024 immediately following the announcement of a government-sponsored investigation examining historical abuse in religious-run day and boarding schools in Ireland. “These events in September 2024 appear to have given individuals renewed strength to tell of their experiences,” National Board CEO Aidan Gordon said in a June 10 press release. According to the report, 291 of the allegations received by the National Board were categorized as sexual abuse as the primary complaint. The report records 55 additional allegations of physical abuse, four boundary violations, one count of neglect, one emotional abuse, one bullying, and 32 cases where the alleged abuse was not categorized. The report indicates that 385 allegations were made against 376 people, including 318 male religious, 39 diocesan priests, 16 female religious, and three males of unknown affiliation. Of the 39 diocesan priests accused of abuse, 20 (64%) are deceased, three are laicized, three are in prison, four are out of ministry, four are under a management plan, one remains in active ministry, and four are of unknown status. Of the remaining accused, 221 of them are deceased, five are laicized, five are in active ministry, 31 are in prison, 21 are under a management plan, 12 have left the Church, 17 are out of ministry, and 22 are of unknown status. The National Board received 287 requests for advice in relation to safeguarding children from abuse within the Church in 2024-2025. The announcement of the Irish government’s September 2024 investigation came after the government-backed scoping inquiry, published in March 2023. The inquiry was initiated in the aftermath of a 2022 radio documentary called “Blackrock Boys,” which revealed extensive abuse at the Spiritan-run Blackrock College, a boys’ boarding and day school in Dublin. The scoping inquiry revealed that 2,395 allegations of abuse had been made in 308 schools between 1927 and 2013, including extensive accounts of sexual abuse, rape, and sexual assault. Bishop Kevin Doran of Elphin described the scoping inquiry as “a tragedy” at the time, lamenting not only the sheer number of allegations in the report but also “that so many of them had to carry their experience alone for so many years before they felt sufficiently free to tell someone else.” (Story continues below) Your monthly donation will help our team continue reporting the truth, with fairness, integrity, and fidelity to Jesus Christ and his Church. The Dublin-based Iona Institute for Religion and Society has released a comprehensive report that highlights significant shifts in religious attitudes and practices in Ireland. The announcement comes as a report from the Irish government revealed that 2,395 allegations of abuse had been made in 308 schools between 1927 and 2013. A recent Eucharistic procession in Derry, Ireland, highlighted an inspiring revival of Catholic faith in a city synonymous with some dark days in Ireland’s troubled history.

Privy will continue as an independent product – but now we’ll move faster, ship more, and serve you even better, so you can stay focused on your users.” Earlier this year, Stripe completed its purchase of stablecoin issuer Bridge, the company behind USDB, a programmable dollar-pegged crypto asset backed by a combination of cash and money market funds held by BlackRock. As stated by Zach Abrams, co-founder of Bridge, at the time, “We closed our acquisition with Stripe! Together we’re scaling digital dollars to businesses everywhere. Stablecoins aren’t the future- they’re already transforming how people move money today.” Earlier this month, Stripe reportedly was in talks with unnamed banks regarding their potential use of stablecoins. Stripe co-founder and president John Collison said that banks seem eager to work with dollar-pegged digital assets. “In the conversations we have with them, they’re very interested. This is not something that banks are just kind of brushing away or treating as a fad. Banks are very interested in how they should be integrated with stablecoins into their product offerings as well.” Featured Image: Shutterstock/DEYASA_346 Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Ivies, Index Funds, And Incarceration: How Universities Became Financial Stakeholders In The Prison Economy

ByMichelle Mbekeani ByMichelle Mbekeani, Contributor. Nashville, Tennessee USA - May 10, 2022: Entrance sign to the private research school Vanderbilt ... More University located in the west end district The private prison industry did not emerge fully formed from a corporate boardroom. It was seeded quietly, often indirectly, by capital from university endowments. American universities, as institutional investors, have long shaped emerging markets by deploying billions through private equity, hedge funds, and index‑tracking portfolios. At the time, these decisions drew minimal public scrutiny, guided by fiduciary responsibility, and framed as financially neutral. But universities’ expanding financial footprints have exposed them, directly and indirectly, to sectors with profound social implications. Now, amid growing demand for transparency and responsible investing, students, faculty, and alumni are asking: What systems have our institutions funded, and at what cost? Seed Money and the Rise of Private Prisons The modern private prison industry traces back to the early 1980s, when governments sought alternatives amid rising incarceration rates. The model: privately operated correctional facilities financed through government contracts. In 1983, Corrections Corporation of America (now CoreCivic) was launched by former Chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party, Thomas W. Beasley, with formative investments that included Vanderbilt University, the Tennessee Lookout reported. I have reached out to Vanderbilt University for comment and will update the post if I receive a reply. Three years later, CoreCivic executed its initial public offering (IPO) in October 1986, listing 2 million shares on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol CCAX at an offering price of $9.00 per share. In December 1994, the company transitioned its listing to the New York Stock Exchange, where it began trading under the symbol CXC, signaling its maturation into a more established publicly traded entity. Today the corporation runs over 100 facilities nationwide. According to its 2024 Annual Report, the company reported $2.0 billion in revenue and $68.9 million in net income. CoreCivic continues to derive a significant portion of its revenue from federal contracts, including those with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has expanded to support mass deportation efforts of the Trump administration. Its main competitor, The GEO Group, earned $2.424 billion in revenue and reported $31.97 million in net income in 2024, as detailed in their 2024 Annual Report. ETF Exposure and Indirect Investment Although universities like Vanderbilt have since disavowed direct holdings in private prison companies, some universities may still have indirect exposure within passive index funds. This indirect retention of financial ties stems from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and passive investment vehicles managed by BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. An analysis by OpenSecrets highlighted that broad real estate ETFs—like Vanguard’s VNQ and BlackRock’s IYR, include private prison Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), such as CoreCivic in their holdings. ETFs are commonly used by university endowments for low-fee diversification. Because ETFs weight their portfolios based on sector representation, not ethical considerations, private prison companies could be bundled alongside shopping malls, office parks, and senior housing properties. That means universities pursuing passive real estate ETFs can unknowingly gain financial exposure to incarceration-related businesses. While some institutions have moved to ESG-screened portfolios, much of the endowment landscape remains opaque, structured through fund-of-funds vehicles and outsourced managers. According to the 2023 NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments, U.S. colleges and universities manage around $839 billion in endowment assets, with a mean immediate return of 7.7%. Procurement: University Purchases from Prison Labor University interactions with the carceral system extend beyond financial markets. Some universities procure goods from prison labor programs—furniture, garments, and institutional supplies made by incarcerated workers. According to a 2020, Inside Higher Ed report, some of the furniture at the University of Virginia was made in prisons, and so was some of the furniture at George Mason University and the University of Mary Washington. This requirement stemmed from a statewide mandate at the time, requiring all public universities in Virginia to purchase furniture from Virginia Correctional Enterprises (VCE), a state-owned entity that employs approximately 1,300 incarcerated individuals, Inside Higher Ed reported. These types of procurement mandates and restrictions tend to be governed by state-level governments and their statutory and administrative codes, as opposed to university-level administration. I have reached out to each university for comment and will update the post if I receive a reply. Madison, Wisconsin, USA-May 4, 2023: The University of Wisconsin campus in Madison, Wisconsin, USA In some states, public universities have a history of being mandated by their state government to buy prison made furniture. According to the 2020, Inside Higher Ed report, University of Wisconsin campuses have in the past been required to purchase from Badger State Industries, Wisconsin’s prison labor enterprise. According to the ACLU, some incarcerated workers earn as little as $0.13 per hour and many earn nothing at all. The Prison Policy Initiative notes wages range from $0.33 to $1.41 per hour. I have reached out to each university for comment and will update the post if I receive a reply. Institutional Values Follow the Money Capital is not neutral. Where it flows, systems follow. Universities are not merely academic institutions, they are powerful economic actors. Through investments and procurement, many have become stakeholders in the carceral system, often unintentionally. As debates around racial justice, incarceration, and institutional accountability gain momentum, the financial ties between higher education and the prison industry continue to encounter scrutiny. The pressing question is not whether these ties exist, it is whether universities can redesign their capital frameworks to reflect their values.

Title: World Bank Agrees with President Trump Position of Unsustainable, Unbalanced Trade Status – Global Trade Taking Advantage of USA

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/11/2025 11:38:45 AM PDT by SoConPubbie This is actually a very surprising development. The World Bank (WB) is a heavily controlled multinational exploit of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and World Economic Forum assembly (WEF). This could be looked upon as the WTO/WEF taking a knee as they finally accept Godzilla Trump is not going to relent. Remember, the Build Back Better agenda was a construct from the WEF/WTO.Looking a little more deeply at the people behind the latest shift in tone and paying close attention to the wording they are using, there’s an inference the World Bank is telling Europe to stop being intransigent or they will lose U.S. military support. A very unusual shift in WB tone.In my first review opinion, as the legal arbitration system for trade complaints, the WB are trying to mitigate President Trump’s full-frontal assault on the global trade imbalance that brings the global trade wealth back to the USA.NEW YORK POST […] – Top economists at the international institution, which helps finance low and middle-income countries, acknowledged that many nations do not provide reciprocal trade access to the US.“This [situation] could not be sustained indefinitely,” the World Bank’s chief economist, Indermit Gill, said during a news briefing, the Washington Post reported.[Gill] contended that Trump’s actions were merely a response to uneven trade access between other countries and the US.Other experts at the World Bank concurred with that assessment and indicated that Europe, Japan and China should all take steps to reduce trade barriers on the US, while calling for an across-the-board rollback on tariffs on all sides.

Title: Bitcoin Poised For Rally To $1 Million, Says Michael Saylor — Here’s What Will Catalyze The Epic Ascent

Michael Saylor, cofounder and the executive chairman of Bitcoin-powered giant Strategy, has ruled out the chances of a full-blown crypto winter returning, at least not anytime soon. Crypto winter, as widely known within the cryptosphere, is a period typically characterized by a cruel correction in Bitcoin prices. According to Saylor, BTC is not going to $0 but is headed towards the $1 million per coin coveted milestone based on a number of key factors that he believes will supercharge the price of the oldest cryptocurrency. Speaking to Bloomberg on Tuesday, Michael Saylor highlighted that roughly 450 Bitcoin (BTC) are minted by miners every day. At current Bitcoin prices of $109,559 as per CoinGecko, that amount is equivalent to around $50 million. “If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up,” Saylor posited. The Bitcoin bull further noted that the increasing number of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is buying “the entire natural supply.” Saylor’s software intelligence-turned Bitcoin Treasury firm Strategy has amassed 582,000 BTC since it started purchasing in 2020, which is valued at around $63.59 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. “At the current price level, it only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy one turn.” Notably, Saylor acknowledged that if Bitcoin surges to $500,000 or $1 million, it may be more realistic to expect it to fall by about $200,000 a coin. According to Saylor, there are enough confirmations in the wider economy to support his all-or-nothing prediction for Bitcoin. “You have all the evidence you need to determine that,” the Strategy co-founder quipped. Saylor also pointed out that US President Trump’s backing of Bitcoin and his efforts to create a more friendly regulatory environment will buoy the asset’s uptrend. Meanwhile, traditional banks have started to leverage this improving regulatory scene to foray into the fast-growing market, as they prepare to provide BTC custody services. He further pointed out that demand for the scarce asset is going through the roof. For instance, BlackRock and other spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers and nation states are buying up Bitcoin daily. Bilal Bin Saqib, head of Pakistan’s crypto council, recently disclosed that the country is set to create its own United States-esque strategic Bitcoin reserve. Saylor described the growing demand for Bitcoin as a “digital gold rush,” suggesting the top crypto has “gotten through its riskiest period; the accounting has been corrected.” It’s worth mentioning that Saylor is not the only uber-bullish pundit in the crypto market. As ZyCrypto previously reported, asset manager ARK Invest bumped its “bull case” Bitcoin price target from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030, bolstered mainly by institutional investors and Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as “digital gold.”

Title: Remember when corporate America steered clear of politics on social media?

A series of random questions answered by Harvard experts. Elisabeth Kempf. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Christina Pazzanese Harvard Staff Writer There was a time when corporate America was not very online. Most companies used social media for promoting products and services or engaging with consumers in a friendly fashion. Political posts on a company Twitter account were rare. That all changed between 2012 and 2022, when the volume of partisan speech on Twitter (now called X) from large corporations surged, more than doubling beginning in 2017, according to a new National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. Researchers said the spike was driven disproportionately by companies using language associated with Democratic politicians. The moves frequently had negative effects on company stock prices. In this edited conversation, the paper’s co-author Elisabeth Kempf, Jaime and Raquel Gilinski Associate Professor of Business Administration, explains corporate Twitter’s abrupt shift. It seems ubiquitous now, but corporations putting out partisan-sounding tweets is only a recent development. What did you find? Partisan speech was very rare for companies. Less than 1 percent of all the tweets they sent between 2012 and 2017 would constitute what was, according to our measures, very partisan speech. Wading into partisan, polarized issues can be tricky for companies. We saw the first big change in 2017 where both Democratic and Republican partisan speech picks up, and then this big asymmetry starting in 2019. That was the part that I found the most surprising. I was expecting to see some companies also start to use more Republican-sounding speech — to see, essentially, evidence of polarization. It was quite surprising to see that everybody seemed to adopt more Democratic speech after 2019 and that it was happening across the board, companies in blue states, red states, companies that are in consumer-facing businesses, also B2B [business to business]. “It was quite surprising to see that everybody seemed to adopt more Democratic speech after 2019 and that it was happening across the board, companies in blue states, red states.” How did you define partisan corporate speech? We built on previous work by Jesse Shapiro, my colleague at Harvard, and his co-authors. They developed this methodology to look at partisan speech in Congress that identifies phrases that allow you to correctly guess a speaker’s political party. We used their methodology and applied it to tweets sent by Democratic and Republican politicians. That allowed us to identify highly partisan phrases and then apply it to corporate speech. Essentially, phrases that sound like they could be coming from a Democratic or Republican politician is what we consider partisan speech. What did you learn about how partisan corporate speech has changed over time? The first fact is that partisan corporate speech has become more common over this time period, 2012 to 2022. The second fact is that this growth was really asymmetric. Starting in 2019, we see rapid growth in Democratic-sounding speech, while Republican-sounding speech stayed constant or, if anything, decreased toward the end. And third, when we look at stock returns around these partisan corporate statements, we see that they tend to be followed by negative abnormal stock returns. That said, we also see a lot of heterogeneity depending on the investor composition. For example, if there are more funds with ESG [environmental, social, and governance] objectives, then we see that the stock return after a Democratic-sounding statement tends to be less negative. Is it clear why these partisan Twitter statements suddenly escalated during this time? In 2017, we see both Democratic- and Republican-sounding speech go up for the first time. We don’t have so much to say on that. What we do have more to say on is when we start to see this divergence between Democratic- and Republican-sounding speech, which is in January 2019. That was when BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink put out a pretty influential letter, his “Dear CEOs” annual letter. He explicitly called on CEOs to be more vocal, take more stances on polarizing issues. This would be another potential piece of evidence to suggest that large institutional investors may have also played a role in this. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager so there was a lot of news reporting that this had kicked off a lot of discussion in the business world. Also in 2019, the Business Roundtable [a CEO lobbying association] came out saying shareholder value maximization should not be the sole purpose. So, I do think it was quite influential. We also see that 2019 was a massive growth in terms of the assets under management with a sustainability mandate. This is when a big shift happened in the investment industry. Recently, we’ve seen protest campaigns against Tesla and Bud Light spurred by perceived partisan corporate statements. Could robust consumer boycotts that threaten profits have contributed to declines in shares as opposed to just public or investor reaction to statements? This was the finding we struggled the most to make sense of. One possibility is, as you say, that maybe there could be facts of this partisan speech that affect what we would call the cash flows in finance or the profits that the companies make. For example, it might be losing employees or losing customers. We argue that partisan speech can affect a third potential stakeholder group — investors — and how much they are willing to hold the stock. We were looking at the 500 largest companies by market capitalization, so these are very big companies that need to raise capital from a pretty heterogeneous investor base. It’s hard for these large companies to raise capital only from Democrats or only from Republicans. And so, once you make a partisan statement that aligns with one group but not with the other, you might see precisely this negative stock price effect. It is also difficult to explain the growth in Democratic-sounding speech with consumer or employee preferences alone. To be clear: We wouldn’t want to conclude that investor or consumer preferences did not play a role at all. But we thought it was worth pointing out that it was hard to explain everything just with consumers or just with employees. Why is that? Because we see this rapid growth both for companies that are in consumer and non-consumer-facing industries. Boycotts could explain why maybe certain retail companies might adopt a certain speech, but we see it even in materials, which is a sector with companies that make metals, chemicals, coatings and things like this. It’s hard to think that there the consumer preferences for partisan speech would be super strong. I thought employees could be quite relevant, but we saw the same trend in companies with employees located in very Democratic areas versus Republican areas. We also didn’t see that labor market tightness played a role. You might imagine that if you’re really in desperate need of talent, maybe you would engage more in this partisan speech if you thought it would help in hiring. There were a couple of results that just made it hard to explain this with consumers or employees alone. Whereas, if you think about this investment channel, it could explain why we see it in companies that are based in blue areas, red areas. It could explain why this is such a broad-based phenomenon. Are there other aspects of corporate speech ripe for further research? Yes. I don’t think we have fully answered the question of why this big shift was happening then. We have suggestive evidence that investors could have played a role. But I don’t think there’s a full, causal relationship yet. So that is one big open question: How influential were investors versus consumers versus employees? The second question is what were the more long-term effects? We’re looking at stock prices over a relatively short window. What does this do in the longer run to companies, and potentially also to their relationship to politicians or how partisan speech by companies influences politics, I think, are exciting areas for future research.

Dart services between Lansdowne Road and Dún Laoghaire in Dublin have recommenced after a “major disruption” saw services suspended until 8pm. While services have resumed, ongoing delays and alterations are expected into Wednesday evening, Irish Rail said. Services were suspended at 2.40pm after overhead lines between Booterstown and Blackrock were damaged during vegetation maintenance works. Irish Rail said the damage had caused a “major disruption to Dart services” with significant delays to wider services as crews arrived on-site to rectify the issue. The fault caused knock-on delays to Dart and commuter services through the city centre due to congestion on the line with Dublin Bus services honouring rail tickets throughout the disruption. Services were solely operating between Howth/Malahide and Lansdowne Road as well as from Greystones to Dalkey until late on Wednesday evening while trains to Dundalk, Drogheda, Maynooth were also affected. Services to and from Rosslare departed and terminated at Bray due to the disruption with bus transfers being arranged. A spokesman for Irish Rail said the line between Lansdowne Road and Dún Laoghaire reopened shortly before 8pm after the overhead lines were repaired.

Title: Adani Group to raise ₹2.5 trillion over five years to fund capex

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: Adani Group needs to raise about ₹2.5 trillion (about $30 billion) over the next five years to meet its $100-billion capital expenditure plan and meet its debt obligations, two top executives said, outlining the conglomerate’s growth strategy as it emerges from last year’s bribery allegations. The capital investments will be focussed on the energy and utilities and the infrastructure and logistics sectors, said Sagar Adani, executive director of Adani Green Energy Ltd and nephew of Adani Group chair Gautam Adani. Sagar Adani spoke with Mint on Wednesday in his first media interview since US authorities in November charged him along with Gautam Adani and group executive Vneet Jaain with securities fraud. He did not comment on the subject. Gautam Adani said in his recent annual address to shareholders of flagship company Adani Enterprises Ltd that the group would invest $15-20 billion ( ₹1.3-1.7 trillion) annually over the next five years. That investment figure was the base case, said Jugeshinder Singh, Adani Group’s chief financial officer, adding that under ideal circumstances the investments could be higher. Adani Group invested ₹1.26 trillion in FY25 and is looking to increase its capital expenditure this financial year, Singh said, adding that the group accounts for a fifth of the private capex in India. While the bulk of the group’s capex needs will be met through the cash it generates, the conglomerate will need additional fund infusion, including to service its debt, Singh said. The Adani Group has about ₹1.6 trillion in debt maturities between 2025-26 and 2029-30, as per an investor presentation. “We will borrow to refinance the debt that we need to pay back.

We only do two things as a group—one is energy and utilities and the second is transport and logistics," he said. “All the other things we do are around these two fundamental pillars." For instance, in the cement sector, three-fourths of the cost are energy, raw materials, and logistics, Adani explained. Adani Group, which has become the second-largest cement maker in India by a wide margin through a string of acquisitions starting 2022, is betting on group synergies to source cheap electricity and coal and on low transportation costs to beat peers in terms of margins, Adani said. “No one can supply electricity at scale and cost better than us, and no one can handle and operate logistics in a more streamlined way that we can," he said. The group also plans to invest in copper, aluminium and other metals in the coming years. Adani Group operationalized a copper smelter with capacity for 0.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in Mundra earlier this year, which it plans to ramp up to 1 MTPA. The copper relies on ore imported from Chile. For aluminium, the group plans to bid for bauxite ore mines through government auctions. Once raw material supply is secured, it will invest in aluminium. Both the metals consume significant energy for production, giving Adani Group an edge by sourcing cheap power, he said.

The airports business, which operates eight airports including Mumbai and Ahmedabad, will be ready for demerger from Adani Enterprises by FY28, said Singh, Adani Group’s chief financial officer. Meanwhile, the group’s multiple listed cement companies, including Ambuja Cements Ltd, ACC Ltd, Sanghi Industries Ltd, and Orient Cement Ltd, as well as unlisted Penna Cement Industries Ltd, will eventually be merged, but only after the operations are streamlined, he added. “The bigger objective is to first operationally stabilize everything. Currently we are not 100% there," Singh said, adding that streamlining brands, supply chains, and distribution across the group’s cement companies would take about 18 months. Sagar Adani added that although Adani Group focusses on energy and infrastructure, it does not face any risk of concentration of assets. “No single asset contributes more than 9% of our Ebitda." Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, is a key measure of operational efficiency. Adani Group’s emphasis on its growth strategy comes after Gautam Adani, as per media reports, began talks with US President Donald Trump’s administration earlier this year to seek dismissal of the criminal charges against him in the bribery probe. The Adani Group had been previously battling allegations raised by short-seller Hindenburg Research in January 2023. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had in November alleged that the Adanis paid or promised over $250 million in bribes to Indian officials to secure favourable solar energy contracts for Adani Green Energy, the company headed by Sagar Adani. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that the DOJ was investigating whether Adani’s companies violated US sanctions on Iran. Adani Group has denied all the allegations.

Title: The Bond Market Is Cracking, And This 9% Dividend Is Ready For It

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Coupons, rates, yields and other informations are displayed. Interest rates concept. 3D ... More illustration BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is turning its back on long-term Treasuries—and that’s rattling the bond market. That, in turn, has the mainstream crowd turning its back on ALL bonds. Mainstream crowd turning its back? That’s all we need to hear! In a second, I’ll reveal a 9% “contrarians only” dividend that’s tailor-made for this critical time in Bond-land. First, let’s break down what the global investment titan is telling us here: In its weekly commentary, released June 2, BlackRock laid things out in stark terms (or at least as stark as a stuffy financial institution gets!): “Our strongest conviction [bolding mine] has been staying underweight long-term US Treasuries.” Then the real kick in the teeth: “We prefer the euro area to the US.” Ouch. BlackRock’s not alone in turning up its nose at long-term government bonds. DoubleLine Capital, led by “Bond God” Jeffrey Gundlach, is turning away, too—especially when it comes to the longest of the long bonds: “Where we can outright short [30-year Treasuries], we are,” one of the firm’s portfolio managers recently said. We’re talking about 30-year Treasuries here. Invest for three decades and get your cash back at maturity, with a steady payout kicked your way every year. Till now, these have been seen as among the safest of the safe investments. Yet as I write this, investors are demanding a near-5% yield to take on the “risk” of owning them! All of this—not to mention weak demand at a recent 20-year government bond auction—has investors fretting over bonds, corporate and government alike. We, meantime, are targeting select corporate bond closed-end funds (CEFs) like the one we’ll name below, quietly kicking out yields of 9%, 10% and more. Let’s get into why, starting with Uncle Sam. It’s not hard to see why investors aren’t keen to boost his credit line. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)—famous for its rose-colored glasses—has already projected a $1.9-trillion deficit for 2025. This leaves the government with a $40-trillion debt hole, deepening by $2 trillion a year. Congress is also working through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which the CBO estimates will add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next decade. And, of course, Moody’s recently lowered America’s credit rating. With buyers of government debt thin on the ground, long-term government bond yields are rising (and prices are falling, as yields and prices move in opposite directions). That’s a giant red flag for all bonds, right? While this interpretation isn’t exactly wrong, it focuses too much on the numbers and not enough on the human factor, specifically Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Fed Chair Jay Powell—or more specifically, Powell’s likely successor. Let’s start with Bessent, who has straight-out said he wants to lower the 10-year Treasury rate—pacesetter for consumer and business loans. He’s got plenty of tools at his disposal, including leaning more heavily on short-term debt to fund the government. That limits the supply of “long” bonds, offsetting future lame auction demand and driving up bond prices (while reducing their yields). This is something Bessent criticized former Treasury Secretary Yellen for doing. But he’s been quietly keeping it up. Finally, we’ve got an administration fixated on tariffs (which slow growth) and lowering energy prices. It won’t take much extra drilling to pull off the latter—WTI crude is already on the mat, at $63 a barrel as of this writing, on rising OPEC production. Slower growth + lower oil = lower inflation (and lower rates). Then there’s Jay Powell, who, yes, has been holding off on rate cuts. (Jay controls the “short” end of the yield curve, the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans.) But Jay’s term ends in 11 months, and it’s highly likely the administration will appoint a successor who would work with the government to reduce rates. Lower “short” rates would act as a weight on long rates, helping push bond prices higher. All of this is a prime setup for high-yield corporate debt, which is being shunned along with the federal government’s credit. A top play comes from the Bond God himself: the DoubleLine Yield Opportunities Fund (DLY). As I write this, DLY yields 9%, and its real strength is its wide mandate—Gundlach is free to invest in any form of high-yield credit, anywhere in the world. That’s what we want: This bond savant unchained and working for us! He’s taking a smart approach, too, keeping most of DLY’s portfolio (just under 70%) in high-yield corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (which despite the fact that they touched off the 2008 financial crisis are highly regulated today), emerging-market debt and a range of other debt instruments with durations of three years or less. That’s a prudent setup, as shorter-term bonds still kick out strong yields and won’t be hit as hard as longer-term bonds if rates stay stuck at these levels for a while, or even rise. It also frees up Gundlach to reinvest faster as the rate picture shifts. Beyond that, since Gundlach can invest across the globe, DLY can benefit as more capital, spooked by Uncle Sam’s bloated budget, hunts for yield abroad. As I write, DLY trades at a 0.6% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its portfolio) down from a roughly 1.5% premium earlier this spring. The fund also pays that 9% annual dividend with monthly distributions. It has paid special dividends in the past, too. DLY Dividend The bottom line? With Bessent working to bring down rates now, and more help likely from the Fed down the road, we’ve got a flexible setup for income and upside, guided by Gundlach himself. Let’s buy before this discount grows into a healthy premium. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: The Art Of Effective Board Leadership: How To Truly Add Value

ByMarie Holive ByMarie Holive, Forbes Councils Member. Marie Holive is the COO of Proteus International and 3-time board member of public and private companies in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. When I first entered the boardroom as an independent director, the weight of expectation was palpable. It’s a space where strategic oversight, ethical stewardship and a drive for excellence converge. In my experience, effective leadership isn’t about being the smartest person in the room. It’s about being the most effective: listening intently, asking the right questions and knowing when to support or challenge. The most valuable contributions often happen outside formal meetings: over coffee, in late‑night emails and during quiet reflection. They are built on genuine relationships, relentless curiosity and rigorous preparation. The journey to becoming an impactful, independent director is ongoing and multifaceted. It demands vigilance, humility and constant adaptation. Based on my experience across multiple boards, here are six disciplines that can help you have the greatest impact as a board director. The boardroom is an arena where diverse perspectives, competing priorities and high stakes intersect. Influence typically comes less from having all the answers and more from nurturing a space where the best answers surface. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, reminds us that “boards meet only periodically, but their responsibility is continuous.” A strong board director should be able to cut through complexity and safeguard the company’s best interests, speaking up when necessary and listening when wisdom lies elsewhere. Powerful moments can spring from a well‑timed question that reveals hidden risk, creating clarity from ambiguity. And remember: Having diverse voices across age, gender, geography and discipline in your board can sharpen oversight and reduce blind spots. Behind the scenes, it's important for directors to devote significant time to preparation. The National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) reports that "annual independent director time commitment has increased from less than 250 hours to more than 300 hours over the last decade." The learning agendas for many directors include things like site visits, scenario drills, outside courses and formal briefings during meetings—time deliberately reserved to expand the board’s collective expertise. Stay attuned to industry shifts, geopolitical currents and emerging risks. For example, I've found that understanding climate disclosures, generative AI and political volatility can reshape strategy. Read voraciously, ask questions relentlessly and admit what you don’t know. Schedule quarterly deep dives, invite external experts, attend director‑education programs and benchmark against peers to stay ahead. When you treat learning as a lifelong mandate, you can help your board pivot faster and with greater confidence. Facilitation is a mindset. Create dialogue, not monologues. In practice, that means ensuring every voice is heard, listening deeply and interjecting with questions that refocus discussion. For example, as Audit and Risk Committee Chair, I am responsible for fostering an environment where divergent views can thrive, and the most effective way I have found for doing this is asking probing questions that challenge assumptions while maintaining respect and collaboration. Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, notes, “I learned the importance of listening and really understanding people—and listening to understand, as opposed to just thinking you have all the answers because you looked at some data.” Yet listening alone isn’t enough; the craft lies in discerning when you should intervene and framing questions to draw out perspectives that might otherwise remain unspoken. Timing is an art that involves balancing assertiveness and restraint. Silence can be as powerful as speech. Offering space can spark breakthroughs, while stepping in decisively can avert costly mistakes. I recommend using this simple practice: Pause before responding—count to five and ask yourself whether your input will add clarity or merely reiterate. Tune into the body language and energy shifts of the other person or people involved—these can signal when emphasis or breathing room is needed. In my experience, the ability to know when to speak and when to listen separates good directors from great ones and demands constant refinement, emotional intelligence and self‑awareness. Governance doesn’t begin and end in the boardroom; it extends to subcommittees, where critical topics receive deep scrutiny. Chairing Audit and Risk for three companies (two publicly listed and one private) has given me an appreciation for this engine‑room work. The role of subcommittee member goes beyond reviewing financial statements; it requires meticulous oversight of reporting, a sharp eye on risk, and transparent communication with auditors and management. Committees shoulder tremendous responsibility amid complex regulations, evolving cyber threats and heightened stakeholder expectations for transparency. The key to effective leadership here is to ensure that this risk oversight by your committees and subcommitties stays proactive rather than reactive—anticipating threats, stress‑testing controls, and creating frameworks that allow both agility and resilience. Behind every meeting lies the essential work of cultivating authentic relationships with stakeholders. Engaging with executives, employees and fellow directors outside formal settings can offer vital insight into your organization’s heartbeat. I've found that these interactions can deepen understanding and build trust, but they also demand self‑awareness. Reflect on how you show up and how your presence impacts others, especially in high‑stakes settings. Relationships rooted in trust, empathy and mutual respect are important for good governance. Understanding the people behind the data is as crucial as understanding the metrics, and in my experience, that begins with understanding ourselves. Ultimately, board service transcends strategy and finance. It’s about embodying integrity, demonstrating unwavering commitment and fostering an environment where diverse perspectives are valued. It’s about being present—not just in meetings but in the fabric of the organization’s journey. Whether you’re pursuing or practicing directorship, I encourage you to embrace the multifaceted nature of the role, remain steadfast in your pursuit of knowledge and never underestimate the power of genuine relationships. That’s where lasting impact begins. Forbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders. Do I qualify?

Title: Bitcoin To $1 Million? Michael Saylor Laughs Off Crypto Winter Fears

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin’s price outlook remains sky-high after Strategy founder Michael Saylor told Bloomberg on Tuesday that a market freeze won’t come back. He argued that growing demand and limited daily supply point straight to a rally toward $1 million. According to Saylor, miners release only about 450 BTC each day. That adds up to roughly $50 million at today’s price of around $109,859. Many are trying to figure out which will be the next 1000x crypto. He said once that $50 million is snapped up by buyers, there’s no choice but for the price to climb. His view rests on the idea that active demand now matches or exceeds what miners sell. Based on reports, asset manager ARK Invest recently boosted its bull case for Bitcoin from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by the end of 2030. Saylor went even further. He said that as long as Bitcoin doesn’t head to zero, it’s bound for $1 million. His own firm has picked up 582,000 BTC since 2020. That stash is worth nearly $64 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data. Saylor pointed to big names backing Bitcoin. He mentioned US President Donald Trump, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and SEC chair Paul Atkins as signs that the asset has won its toughest battles. He also noted that banks are lining up to offer custody services. And he praised Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and others for buying coins daily. Saylor didn’t shy away from a cautionary note. He suggested that if Bitcoin hits $500,000 or $1 million, a fall to about $200,000 could follow. That’s almost a 60% drop from the peak. His point was that big price swings are part of Bitcoin’s history—and likely its future. Beyond miner sales and whale wallets, analysts say wider market moves matter too. Spot and futures trading often top $10 billion a day, so $50 million of fresh buys might only nudge the price. Regulation could swing the other way if concerns over energy use or consumer protection grow. And rival cryptocurrencies keep popping up with new features. Reports disclose the real test will be whether steady new buyers can outpace both miner supply and selling by holders looking to bank profits. Saylor’s figures make a strong case for continued upside. But investors who build a plan around a $1 million Bitcoin should brace for big dips along the way. In the end, daily demand, political moves and how the rest of the financial world reacts will decide if those eye-popping targets really come to pass.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

The launch was announced on June 11 and is seen as a move to expand the reach of institutional-grade tokenized assets across the fast-rising blockchain network. According to the statement, the integration allows institutional investors to mint and redeem OUSG on XRPL using RLUSD, Ripple’s new stablecoin. This offers an alternative to traditional finance rails by enabling seamless access to tokenized Treasury exposure around the clock. At the same time, Ripple and Ondo have also committed liquidity to ensure the product launches with strong trading activity on XRPL. RLUSD will act as a key enabler for cross-network utility and settlement. OUSG provides permissioned on-chain access to short-term US Treasury yields. According to RWA. XYZ data, the platform currently ranks among the largest tokenized Treasury products worldwide, with a reported market value of approximately $692 million. Following the announcement, Ondo’s native ONDO token recorded a 4% price gain, trading near $0.90 at press time, according to data from CryptoSlate. OUSG’s XRPL launch aligns with Ripple’s broader efforts to position the network as a competitive platform for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Over the past year, Ripple has pursued multiple partnerships, including one with Guggenheim Partners, to advance tokenization initiatives on XRPL. The firm’s strategy is driven by forecasts that the tokenized asset market could reach $19 trillion by 2033. This is already evident in the rapid traction of tokenized treasury and money market products as asset managers like BlackRock explore new ways to modernize fund distribution and settlement processes. As a result, the market is gaining broad adoption across the board. Markus Infanger, Senior Vice President at RippleX, said: “Institutions can now access high-quality assets like US treasuries on public blockchains, with the compliance and efficiency they need. This represents progress in bringing trusted financial assets into a 24/7 market—enabling greater liquidity, operational efficiency, and faster access to capital.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

June 11, 2025 07:19 ET | Source: EBC Financial Group EBC Financial Group LONDON, June 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EBC Financial Group (EBC) has announced the launch of over 100 new U.S.-listed Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) CFDs, expanding its multi-asset product suite and offering global client's deeper access to diversified, thematic trading opportunities. The rollout highlights EBC’s ongoing commitment to delivering institutional-grade tools across asset classes, underpinned by flexibility, transparency, and efficiency. The new offering includes ETFs listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, issued by leading asset managers such as Vanguard, iShares (BlackRock), and State Street Global Advisors. Thematic coverage spans a wide range of global macro and sectoral narratives. “This expansion reflects our vision to bridge intelligent product design with market relevance,” said David Barrett, CEO of EBC Financial Group (UK) Ltd. “The new products are a natural evolution for traders seeking targeted exposure with greater strategic flexibility. At EBC, we’re building an ecosystem that empowers both precision and performance.” Thematic Access Meets Tactical Flexibility The additional ETF-linked instruments cover a variety of market exposures, including geographic allocations like the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF; fixed income-focused strategies such as the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond Fund; and sector- or commodity-based indices including the United States Oil Fund LP and the Vanguard Health Care ETF. Other themes include dividend-related baskets, mid-cap equities, and style-based index tracking. These developments reflect wider industry interest in instruments that mirror trends in asset allocation without direct ownership of the underlying securities. Across many markets, sector-tilted and style-based index products are gaining relevance as participants seek flexible ways to align with global narratives. Historically, ETFs tracking specific economic cycles—such as commodity recoveries or emerging market rebounds—have demonstrated performance differentiation. The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF, for example, notably outperformed the S&P 500 during the post-pandemic recovery period in 2021, highlighting how thematic instruments can diverge from broad indices depending on market cycles. These additions serve as both stand-alone trade ideas and complementary instruments alongside EBC’s existing product lineup, enabling advanced portfolio structuring and thematic trading. Smarter Exposure: Leverage, Shorting, and Cost Efficiency in One Product Compared to direct ETF investments, it presents several key advantages as traders benefit from a simplified cost structure, with no traditional fund management fees or broker commissions. The flexibility to take both long and short positions allows for strategic trading regardless of market direction, while the use of leverage enhances capital efficiency and return potential. These trades are executed in real time via EBC’s recognised platforms, providing seamless access to market opportunities. During key market cycles, for example the post-pandemic V-shaped recovery of 2021—certain thematic ETFs, like the iShares MSCI Brazil ETF, significantly outperformed broader indices such as the S&P 500. Our portfolio enables traders to participate in similar trends, adapting quickly to shifting market dynamics with precision and speed.

Title: Singapore-backed realty company bets on India entertainment boom

Prestige Estates Projects Ltd., which ranks among India’s top five real estate developers by market value, is looking to sell more entertainment and dining spaces in malls while cutting back on apparel retailers, a top official said. “Shopping can be done from anywhere once you know the brand, entertainment cannot be bought online,” Muhammed Ali, chief executive officer-retail of the Singapore government-backed firm said over phone. The developer, which counts Blackrock Inc. and Vanguard Inc. as its investors, plans to allocate 40% space in malls to entertainment and restaurants, twice of what its older properties offer. At the same time, retail space will be cut from as much as 85% to 60%, Ali added. His strategy mirrors the rapid transformation in India’s consumer landscape driven by a combination of rising income levels, aspirations and demographics. It also comes as e-commerce is challenging traditional retail, and malls are trying to reposition themselves as experience-driven destinations with shopping, leisure and lifestyle thrown in the mix. India’s top cinema chain PVR Inox Ltd. is betting on a slew of big-ticket Bollywood and Hollywood releases to bring back audiences while consultancy firm Mordor Intelligence notes that quick service restaurants are seeing a steady rise in average order value and increasingly establishing themselves in retail spaces to capture a broader customer base. Prestige plans to grow its presence to 15 malls spanning 10 million square feet in cities such as Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Goa by 2030. It operates four malls at present. Prestige is expanding the scope of entertainment to include physical activities that engage people of all ages and help them “burn a few hundred calories.” Prestige shares have fallen 11% over the last year, nearly twice the decline in the NSE Realty index. The company’s profit for the year ended March 31 was down 62% on year to 6.16 billion rupees ($72.1 million), the lowest in five years. Analysts at JM Financial said in a note on Monday that they expect growth in residential sales to moderate after surging in the last two to three years. That makes it imperative for Prestige and other developers to diversify their revenue stream. “These are the things that online cannot compete with us, where senses are involved, where you need to physically be there,” said Ali, referring to entertainment and dining. The company is also focused on live performances. The new mall structure is expected to generate around 12.50 billion rupees in rentals annually by 2030, Ali said. That is a sixfold jump from a little over two billion rupees the company made in rentals in the financial year through March 2025. “We are challenging the status quo. These malls are going to be very exciting platforms,” said Ali. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: BlackRock: Bitcoin ETF Mania Is Still in ‘Very Early Days’
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-mania-very-early-days/
Time Published: 2025-06-11T03:30:40Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, says the explosive success of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is only the beginning. Speaking with Bloomberg’s ETF IQ on June 9, Mitchnick described the Bitcoin ETF phenomenon as being in its “very early” phase, with institutional capital still gradually working through onboarding and due diligence pipelines. “There has been nothing like this,” Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas said, citing IBIT’s unprecedented growth. The ETF reached $70 billion in assets under management in just 341 days—a record-breaking pace compared to the previous fastest, GLDY, which took 1,691 days. “Just ridiculous numbers here,” Balchunas added. Mitchnick credited this historic inflow to a combination of retail enthusiasm and the beginning stages of professional allocation. “It is a lot of things coming together,” he said. “You don’t get a chart like that without a confluence of actors all occurring at the same time.” He continued: “Out of the gate it was retail and investor demand, and that ran the gamut of small retail investors to ultra net worth. Now, more recently, we have seen steady progress of more wealth advisor adoption, more institutional adoption.” But despite IBIT’s dominance and the sector-wide momentum, Mitchnick stressed that institutional penetration remains low. “Very early,” he said when asked how far wealth advisor adoption is. “What we have seen is a concerted effort by most of the largest firms to progress through their diligence and research and approval process… You’ve seen that fast-tracked by a number of firms. We’re talking by quarters, not months.” That timeline reflects the structural reality of traditional asset management, where new ETF approval involves multi-year workflows. “Slowly but surely,” Mitchnick noted, “you have seen an acceleration, particularly in the last couple months, of more notable firms lowering barriers, granting approval to their advisors to use this, and that is set to continue.” Beyond regulatory comfort, Bitcoin’s evolving risk profile is playing a pivotal role in institutional interest. “Bitcoin is a volatile asset,” Mitchnick acknowledged. “At the same time, its risk and return drivers are markedly different from most of the rest of the assets in a traditional portfolio. That is important.” He underscored the appeal of Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets. “When institutions are looking at this, they are heavily focused on that correlation—whether it is zero or, even in some periods, negative. Then the portfolio construction case is compelling to them,” he explained. “When you look at this as a global scarce emerging monetary alternative with a whole set of risk and return factors, that correlation is what should prevail.” Asked whether the crowded Bitcoin ETF market—with a dozen products now trading—might need consolidation, Mitchnick responded optimistically. “A lot of them have been very successful. IBIT has been the leader by a fair margin, but there’s such demand that it is exciting… That is a good thing.” On the subject of Ethereum and the forthcoming iShares ETH ETF, Mitchnick was more cautious. “It is a little more of a retail-concentrated investor base than we have seen with IBIT,” he said. “The institutional investment thesis with Bitcoin as a growing global alternative is resonating quite strongly. But when we talk about Ether, there is an exciting story there, but it is more about a technology story. That is a much harder case for a lot of institutions to underwrite, especially compared to other technology things.” Ultimately, Mitchnick framed BlackRock’s digital asset strategy not as a short-term marketing play, but as a gradual integration of Bitcoin into global portfolio theory. “Many of our clients are watching closely,” he said. “We believe this is just the beginning of a multi-year journey that will redefine asset allocation globally.” With IBIT continuing to lead the pack in flows and performance—up 121% since inception—BlackRock appears well-positioned not only to ride the ETF wave but to shape its direction. “This is still the very early days,” Mitchnick reiterated. “The story is far from over.” At press time, BTC traded at $109,625.

Roughly half the participants said that their companies had increased spending on blockchain while one in five said it was a key part of their firms' strategies, although many also expressed concerns about regulation. "So, the future of money is here and it has only just begun," the report said. "But it's clear greater regulatory certainty is still required for the potential of crypto to be fully realized." The Q2 2025 State of Crypto report just dropped. TL;DR: The world loves stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/agOZ8naqoF — Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) June 10, 2025 The report underscores the growing embrace of digital assets and their underlying technology with many companies that were once crypto skeptics now part of the mix of adopters. Financial services powerhouses BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are among others, have kickstarted blockchain initiatives but the survey found that companies in a range of industries and sizes have also incorporated blockchain into their businesses. The number of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) using blockchain has doubled over the past year, with more than 80% of these firms saying that crypto could help them "address at least one of their financial pain points," Coinbase found. "The future of money is nowhere more visible than among small and medium businesses, the backbone of the U.S. economy," the report said. "Onchain technology, especially for payments, holds great appeal to a group who see transaction fees and processing times as their top financial related pain points." Blockchain is the underlying tech on which Bitcoin's network runs: a distributed, online ledger that records transactions and cannot easily be tampered with as it uses cryptography. The technology has now lots of other uses, other than payments, with the likes of Walmart using it to track its food supply chain and major banks deploying it for their own financial products. A number of small Nasdaq-listed companies have started buying Bitcoin as a way to secure better returns for their shareholders, a trend popularized by Strategy—formerly MicroStrategy—which pivoted from software development to become a Bitcoin treasury and now manages more than 582,000 BTC worth over $62 billion. The survey also found that 18% of the small and medium businesses surveyed used stablecoins. Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to the value of non-volatile assets—typically the dollar. Coinbase contracted a third party to undertake the research, which looked at 100 of the Fortune 500 firms. It said that the initiatives included "internal company projects, investments, partnerships, and product/service launches."

Sign up here to get Crypto Confidential days earlier free in your inbox. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - MAY 28: U.S. Vice President JD Vance delivers a keynote address at The Bitcoin Conference at The Venetian Convention & Expo Center on May 28, 2025, in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) Yet another Bitcoin Conference has thundered to a close. This year’s pilgrimage for the faithful took place at the Venetian, Las Vegas’ most ostentatiously faux palace—a mock Venice built in the Nevada desert, complete with a casino, chlorinated canals and costumed gondoliers. Fitting, really, for the new reality of bitcoin: loud, celebrated, and depending on your vantage point, either triumphant or gaudy. Some 35,000 people poured in, an all-time high for what began as a fringe gathering of cypherpunks. The conference even set a Guinness World Record for the most bitcoin payments in a single day, if that sort of thing impresses you. Bitcoin itself hit $111,000 days before the event, a milestone barely celebrated in a market where all-time highs are now routine. At last year’s conference in Nashville, Donald Trump promised to make America “the crypto capital of the planet” and “the bitcoin superpower of the world.” This year’s installment felt like, well, proof-of-work. Trump’s lieutenants Vice President JD Vance and Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks took the stage in the main venue to offer receipts: The Securities and Exchange Commission’s warfare against crypto is over. Gary Gensler is out. Landmark crypto bills are making their way through Congress. The bitcoin reserve is in the works. Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder, is free. Operation Chokepoint 2.0, the campaign to choke crypto’s access to banking, has become a phrase mentioned mostly in postmortems. Major financial institutions, once terrified of reputational blowback, are swiftly rolling out digital asset desks again. And dozens of companies, including public ones, are adopting crypto treasury strategies. All this within the first 100 days of Trump’s second presidency. “Promises made, promises kept,” as Trump’s crew likes to say. "I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House," Vance boomed at his 9 a.m. keynote (doors opened at 5:30 a.m. to handle the traffic). “We prioritize eliminating the rules, the red tape and the lawfare that we saw aimed at crypto by our predecessors.” During his panel with the Winklevoss twins, David Sacks asked the audience what else was on the industry’s wishlist. The loudest answer? “Remove the capital gains tax.” Cameron Winklevoss added: “It would be great if the American government started proactively buying bitcoin.” The irony is hard to overlook. Bitcoin was meant to be apolitical, decentralized, pure—a middle finger to the traditional financial establishment and states’ monopoly on money. And yet, the conference at times felt like an RNC spinoff, complete with speeches by Eric and Donald Trump Jr., and ovations for politicians who wouldn’t have touched the asset five years ago. The president himself called bitcoin a scam in 2021. Now he’s all in. After all, crypto has boosted Trump’s net worth by about $1 billion in under a year, according to Forbes’ calculations. His digital asset holdings are now worth more than any single piece of real estate he owns, including the combined value of Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower, writes Dan Alexander. A week before the conference, Trump hosted the largest buyers of his meme coin at a White House dinner. His family has not-quietly-at-all seeded an entire portfolio of crypto ventures: DeFi-focused World Liberty Financial, the publicly traded crypto miner American Bitcoin, and Trump Media, which announced during the conference it’s raising $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin for its corporate treasury. I kept wondering what Satoshi would say. Maybe he’s watching. If so, I doubt he’s smiling. Some purists did complain. Not just about the politicization of bitcoin, but about the creeping presence of “shitcoinery.” Companies behind cryptocurrencies like XRP and Sui, long associated with the other side of crypto’s ideological divide, were apparently among the sponsors/supporters. Among prominent panel topics were stablecoins and tokenization. “Most bitcoiners don’t care about the SEC’s opinion or what BlackRock and Robinhood have to say. Most bitcoiners, I guess, want to see more bitcoin stuff. Don’t forget bitcoin is about the separation of money and state. We should not invite the state. We can’t forget all the pain, suffering, murders, famine, and stealing that the state has done for centuries. bitcoin liberated us from the state,” vented one observer. Of course, internal squabbles like this barely register outside the crypto echo chamber. The reality is that the conference, like bitcoin itself, has outgrown its rebel roots, morphing into something far bigger, louder and more institutionally embedded than its earliest adopters ever imagined. Among other high-profile guests were billionaires Michael Saylor, Justin Sun (a major investor in Trump’s crypto ventures), Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, members of Congress and Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets. Ross Ulbricht delivered a closing speech, his first after being freed from prison. Three themes dominated the agenda. First, the rise of crypto treasuries. There are now over 70 public companies holding bitcoin (and we were early to spot this trend). It may still be the center of gravity, but it’s no longer the only asset in the orbit: there’s also growing attention on companies adding solana, ether and even XRP to their balance sheets. Second, legislative momentum. The stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act is on track to pass Congress. Excitement is building around the U.S. market structure bill, which could finally bring clarity and codified legitimacy to crypto in America at large. Third, cultural mainstreaming. The asset once thought of as a tool for opting out of the financial system is now being folded neatly into it: politicians are using it as a campaign plank, nation-states are buying in (the head of Pakistan’s crypto council announced at the conference that the country is also planning to establish a bitcoin reserve) and corporations are writing playbooks around it. “There’s an old-time saying ‘Everything is good for bitcoin’,” assured me Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike and Twenty One Capital—one of the new bitcoin treasury companies, backed by Tether and SoftBank Group. “Do I love every single thing Trump is doing? No, there's plenty of stuff I would do differently personally if I were president. But are there things I love about the administration? Yes, I love having a bank account in the United States, where my passport is issued,” he said, alluding to the unraveling of Operation Choke Point 2.0. Perhaps he’s right. After all, partially thanks to the administration’s push on the bitcoin reserve and its wholesale embrace of the industry born out of Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation, more people than ever know about bitcoin and use it. Meme coins too, but that’s besides the point. Turns out, decentralization scales best with help from the state.

Title: How a flood of retail investor money into private markets could stress the whole financial system

Retail investors are increasingly being offered access to private markets as investing heavyweights compete for their business. But the shift has created a host of risks for individuals and the broader financial system. That's the takeaway of a new report from Moody's, which warned of "systemic implications" as ETFs and retirement funds facilitate a flood of money from individual investors. Once reserved for the investing world's elite echelons, the booming private equity and private credit markets are slowly being opened up to Main Street investors. The development has sparked some debate about the wisdom of offering everyday people access to illiquid, complex investments. The report from Moody's comes as the $1.4 trillion market for private equity and credit investments has exploded in recent years. As public listings have dried up, more companies have turned to private markets for funding; however, investments from institutional investors are slowing, driving the big players to look for new frontiers. In recent months, giants including BlackRock, State Street, KKR, and Apollo have unveiled ETFs, target date retirement funds, and other investment vehicles aimed at Main Street — and there's reason to be wary, Moody's said this week. Among other risks, a flood of new money into the space could set off a race among money managers to deploy capital, the firm said. "If competition for retail capital outpaces the supply of quality assets, and if growth outpaces the industry's ability to manage these complexities, such challenges could have systemic consequences," Moody's analysts wrote. "Some managers may be tempted to compromise on underwriting standards or stretch into riskier assets to keep pace with inflows and capitalize on the opportunity." What's more, retail investor participation risks heightening volatility in times of market stress, and the market itself is less liquid and more complex than stocks. One of the big draws of the stock market for investors is that you can buy or sell shares at a moment's notice. Not so with private investments, which don't necessarily have "mark to market" valuations. "One of the most pressing concerns for 'Main Street' investors is liquidity and the inherent lack of it in private markets. Retail investors often require quicker access to their capital and have less long-term investment flexibility," Moody's wrote. The ratings agency points to the Great Financial Crisis, when people turned to their 401(k)s for cash while the economy soured. In such a situation, if money is locked up in private market investments, people could have trouble accessing their money. "In volatile markets, retail investors may run for the exits, which would exacerbate liquidity needs and the risk of potential mismatches between a product's available liquidity and what investors are expecting."

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund hits $70B faster than any ETF in history

With this pace, could BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF really surpass Satoshi Nakamoto as the world’s biggest BTC holder? BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF has made history by becoming the fastest exchange-traded fund to exceed $70 billion in assets under management. The milestone reflects broader market confidence and positions BlackRock’s offering as a potential game-changer in the evolution of crypto investment products. Remarking on the same, Eric Balchunas took to X (formerly Twitter) and noted, “IBIT just blew through $70B and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days.” Balchunas also highlighted that BlackRock’s IBIT is surpassing expectations, reaching $70 billion in assets under management nearly five times faster than SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)—the previous record-holder. Eric Balchunas on IBIT While GLD took over 1,600 trading days to achieve the milestone, BlackRock’s IBIT accomplished it in a fraction of the time, reinforcing its explosive market entry. That being said, since its 2024 debut, the ETF has secured over $9 billion in inflows in 2025 alone, earning a spot among the top five U.S. ETFs. This coincided with BlackRock recently acquiring 2,704 Bitcoins valued at roughly $283.9 million, along with 28,239 Ethereum [ETH] tokens worth an estimated $73.2 million. This rise in BlackRock’s prominence is also being reflected in the number of institutions joining the list of embracing IBIT. For instance, the Moscow Stock Exchange has listed Bitcoin Futures tied to IBIT. Additionally, JPMorgan has also planned to roll out ETF-backed loans, beginning with BlackRock’s flagship crypto fund, indicating growing confidence and utility in Bitcoin-focused investment products. Hence, with over 661,000 BTC under management, BlackRock’s IBIT has officially become the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, surpassing both Binance and Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Currently valued at $71.9 billion, the ETF’s meteoric rise has also positioned it to potentially overtake even Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated holdings by next summer, according to Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. Therefore, as IBIT shares trade near $62 and Bitcoin crosses the $110,000 mark, the ETF continues to dominate its peers, securing nearly $49 billion in net inflows since its 2024 debut. As expected, this trajectory paints IBIT as the most influential player among spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. market.
