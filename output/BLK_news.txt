LG Electronics India Ltd. has raised nearly Rs 3,475 crore from anchor investors on Monday, ahead of its initial public offering. The company allotted 3.04 crore shares at Rs 1,140 apiece to 149 anchor investors. SBI Large & Midcap Fund got the highest allocation of 4.6%, followed by INQ Holding LLC at 3.9%, Government Of Singapore at 3.4%, and Government Pension Fund Global at 3%. Marquee investors including Goldman Sachs and Blackrock Global Funds also bagged shares of the issue. A total of 26 domestic mutual funds applied through 84 schemes, the electronics firm said in an exchange filing on Monday. They have collectively netted 48.9% of the anchor portion. These include mutual funds from the likes of SBI, Axis, Kotak Mahindra, HDFC, Nippon, Bandhan, Aditya Birla, Edelweiss, HSBC, and more. Morgan Stanley India Co., JPMorgan India Pvt., Axis Capital Ltd., BofA Securities India Ltd. and Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt. are the bankers for the IPO. The company is set to launch its initial public offering on Oct. 7 with the issue closing on Oct. 9 according to the company’s red herring prospectus. The IPO will only comprise offer for sale of up to 10.18 crore equity shares. The price band for the issue is set at Rs 1,080-1,140 per share. Through the IPO, the South Korean parent — LG Electronics Inc. — will offload 10.2 crore shares. LG Electronics India operates in two key segments: home appliances and air solutions and home entertainment. It has firmly established itself as the market leader in major home appliances and consumer electronics, excluding mobile phones. The company holds the top position in India across product categories such as washing machines, refrigerators, panel TVs, inverter air conditioners, and microwaves as per the value market share in the offline channel, stated the draft red herring prospectus. This dual focus on high-demand product categories and offline market strength has positioned LG as a go-to brand for Indian consumers. While the company made a profit of Rs 1,511 crore in the fiscal 2024, it paid a much more liberal dividend of Rs 2,093 crore at Rs 185 per share. In the first quarter of the current fiscal, the company reported a revenue of Rs 6,409 crore and a profit of Rs 680 crore. Operating income stood at Rs 958 crore and its margin against the top line came up to 14.94%.

Grayscale has introduced this functionality to its Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE), the second-largest such fund on Wall Street with assets of $4.82 billion, as well as its Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH). The firm, which filed its staking addendum with the SEC on Monday, will rely on institutional custodians like Coinbase and a “diversified network of validator providers” to stake its Ethereum. Staking has also been activated within the Grayscale Solana Trust, which is awaiting regulatory approval to be turned into an ETF. The move is a significant development, given that institutional investors have only been able to capitalize on ETH's price gains until now. Ethereum made an ambitious upgrade to a proof-of-stake blockchain in 2022, meaning validators voluntarily lock ETH away and receive rewards for taking a role in securing the network. It’s a much less energy-intensive approach than the previous proof-of-work consensus model, which Bitcoin and some other chains still use. Grayscale’s Ethereum exchange-traded products were among the first to hit the traditional financial market, with its trust-style product ETHE dating back to 2017. Last year, after Ethereum spot ETFs gained SEC approval, the firm successfully converted its products into spot Ethereum ETFs in July. The absence of staking rewards in ETFs have been cited as a key factor in the slower adoption of Ethereum funds since they launched in the summer of 2024. Data from SoSoValue shows the total net assets in Bitcoin ETFs currently stands at $164.5 billion—equivalent to 6.7% of its market capitalization. Ethereum ETFs lag behind with net assets of $30.5 billion, 5.6% of this cryptocurrency's valuation. However, demand has been growing in recent months—driven by ETH's outperformance in the crypto market. Ethereum has surged by 156% over the past six months, compared with BTC's gains of about 50%, and set a new all-time high price mark shy of $5,000 in September. In a statement, Grayscale CEO Peter Mintzberg said staking was "exactly the kind of first-mover innovation" that the company was designed to deliver. “As the #1 digital asset-focused ETF issuer in the world by AUM, we believe our trusted and scaled platform uniquely positions us to turn new opportunities like staking into tangible value potential for investors," he added. Grayscale says it plans to roll out staking to more of its products "as the digital asset ecosystem evolves." The unique selling point could help Grayscale close the gap with BlackRock, whose Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominate the market. Crypto exchange-traded products just capped off a record week, pulling in a total of $5.95 billion worth of investments last week, according to CoinShares. That tally included $1.48 billion worth of inflows into Ethereum funds, with both Bitcoin and ETH funds rebounding after being in the red the previous week.

Title: PLUME Rises 25% as Network Registered by SEC as Transfer Agent for Tokenized Securities
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/06/plume-network-registered-by-sec-as-transfer-agent-for-tokenized-securities
Time Published: 2025-10-06T15:00:22Z
Full Content:
Plume Network, a modular Layer 2 blockchain dedicated to real-world assets (RWAs), is now an SEC-regulated transfer agent, streamlining the issuance, transfer, and management of tokenized securities. The network's native token (PLUME) rose by 25% following the announcement as daily trading volume rose by 186%, according to CoinMarketCap. As a registered transfer agent, Plume will now manage digital securities and shareholder records directly onchain, supporting interoperability with the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) settlement network, according to the press release shared with CoinDesk. Further, it will facilitate a range of use cases, including onchain IPOs, small-cap fundraising, and registered funds. Most notably, the technology aims to reduce tokenization timelines from months to mere weeks via smart-contract automation. Plume's registration provides a much-needed regulatory infrastructure for institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity and Apollo seeking compliant on-chain asset transfers. "At Plume, we believe transfer agent regulation exists to protect investors’ rights as shareholders. With this fully onchain transfer agent protocol, we are streamlining the issuance of digital securities with a built-in partnership with regulators,” said Chris Yin, CEO and Co-Founder of Plume. "The crypto industry has been searching for a viable bridge between DeFi’s speed and TradFi’s safeguards. With the issuance of this license places Plume as the ideal solution for this search," Yin added. A transfer agent in the traditional sense is a financial institution that maintains official records of a company's shareholders, manages ownership changes, issues stock certificates, and handles dividend and interest payments. A blockchain transfer agent, such as Plume, performs similar functions on-chain by leveraging distributed ledger technology, offering a secure, immutable and transparent digital record of asset ownership and transfers. Plume’s achievement comes after its active collaboration with regulatory bodies, including its contributions to discussions surrounding the GENIUS Act. The announcement follows SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce’s remarks last week expressing the regulator’s openness to engaging with issuers of real-world asset tokenization projects. Plume's regulated transfer agent is operational, which allows interested funds to engage with Plume’s infrastructure with immediate effect, even as broader regulatory frameworks continue to evolve. Building on this foundation, Plume plans to launch its initial product offerings, involving Nest protocol vaults, in the first quarter of 2026. Within Plume Network, Nest is one of the significant protocols focused on staking mechanisms for real-world asset (RWA) protocols. Nest allows fund managers to create vaults backed by regulated financial instruments. Users can then deposit stablecoins into these vaults to earn yield in a permissionless way from the underlying real-world assets. Plume said that it has already garnered interest from SEC-registered investment funds (40 Act funds). And while regulatory challenges, such as asset custody issues, present hurdles, the company anticipates these will diminish as the SEC proposes new rules through 2026 and finalizes them by 2027. The 40 Act funds are publicly offered, pooled investment vehicles, such as open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds and unit investment trusts, registered under the Investment Act of 1940. The timing aligns with a broader market shift toward onchain securities and positions Plume at the forefront of this transition. "The license enables Plume to support the migration of offchain securities into compliant digital forms, especially 40 Act funds—the traditional backbone of the U.S. asset management industry representing over $39 trillion," the firm told CoinDesk. Plume is also seeking additional licenses, including Alternative Trading System (ATS) and broker-dealer registrations, to develop a fully compliant onchain capital market infrastructure for 40 ACT funds.

Title: US shutdown and weak jobs data drive record $6B crypto inflows

Investors turn to digital assets as US government shutdown and weak jobs data raise fiscal stability doubts. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. A US government shutdown and the weak jobs report have pushed digital asset investment products to their strongest weekly inflows on record. According to the latest CoinShares report, crypto-related investment products attracted $5.95 billion in inflows last week, pushing total assets under management (AUM) to an all-time peak of $245 billion. The rally did not emerge from retail excitement or online speculation. Instead, it stemmed from macroeconomic unease following the US government shutdown and disappointing employment data. Investors appeared to interpret both as warning signs about the country’s fiscal resilience and the Federal Reserve’s policy direction. James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, explained that the inflows reflected a delayed investor reaction to the Federal Open Market Committee’s recent rate cut and current US government events. According to him: “We believe this was due to a delayed response to the FOMC interest rate cut, compounded by very weak employment data, as indicated by Wednesday’s ADP Payroll release, and concerns over US government stability following the shutdown.” This resulted in a wave of capital seeking refuge in assets perceived as both liquid and resilient. The CoinShares report suggested that investors appear to be treating digital assets not as speculative plays but as macro hedge instruments that respond to fiscal turbulence and liquidity shifts. As expected, Bitcoin absorbed most of last week’s inflows, capturing a record $3.55 billion in fresh capital. This is its strongest week in history. Notably, the 12 US-based Bitcoin ETF providers, including BlackRock, accounted for roughly $3.2 billion of that total, which is their second-strongest weekly performance since launch last year. Conversely, short Bitcoin products saw no flows for the week, signaling renewed investor confidence as prices approach new highs. BTC price reached a new all-time high of more than $125,000 during the weekend. This move highlights Bitcoin’s enduring role as the market’s liquidity anchor and a preferred hedge in uncertain times. Ethereum also turned a corner during the period. After weeks of redemptions, the asset drew $1.48 billion in new capital, lifting its year-to-date total to $13.7 billion. Notably, this is nearly triple its total inflows for last year. At the same time, Solana-focused funds hit an all-time high of $706.5 million, pushing their 2025 tally to $2.85 billion, while XRP saw $219.4 million amid anticipation of new spot investment products. These inflows show that crypto markets are no longer reacting to hype but to macro signals, including liquidity trends, rate policy, and institutional sentiment.

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs’ Rising Strength Challenges Dominance Of Spot Market Trading, A Pivotal Shift Ahead?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etfs-rising-strength/
Time Published: 2025-10-06T13:30:04Z
Full Content:
As the price of Bitcoin pushes near its all-time high, several areas involving the crypto king, especially the Spot ETFs, are starting to turn remarkably green once again. With the Spot ETFs recording bullish closes, this renewed momentum is beginning to challenge the spot market trading. The historic Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are returning to their bullish state as the market recovers. A recent research by Darkfost, a market expert and CryptoQuant author, shows that BTC spot ETFs are quickly gaining traction in the cryptocurrency investment market. While gaining serious traction, the BTC spot ETFs appear to be challenging and heavily drawing attention away from direct spot market trading. Such development implies that these products may be becoming the ideal gateway between traditional finance and digital assets due to their regulated accessibility, institutional confidence, and increasing inflows. According to the expert, the market is currently in a period where ETFs are becoming increasingly popular compared to the spot market. This is changing the way that institutional and individual investors are exposed to Bitcoin, indicating a fundamental shift in the dynamics of the market. When examining trading volumes, without taking into account derivatives, the spot market continues to dominate by a wide margin. However, it is clearly evident that ETF volumes are growing substantially. As a result, Darkfost believes it is highly relevant to monitor the ETF flows in those days. Generally, volumes have ranged between $1 billion and $2.5 billion between May 2024 and November 2024, excluding the initial launch period of spot BTC ETFs. Meanwhile, these days, they are more in the range between $2.5 billion and $5 billion. Darkfost highlighted that this increase in volume is probably due to the robust expansion of Bitcoin spot ETFs, especially in the United States. With this growth, ETF volumes are already catching up to spot volumes, which might signal the start of a paradigm shift if the trend keeps getting stronger. In the midst of this paradigm shift, the expert stated that ETFs have made cryptocurrency more accessible to a wider range of investors, particularly in the US. While ETFs may have taken away liquidity from the spot market, the funds have also absorbed a sizable portion of Bitcoin. As ETFs are also well-structured instruments for institutional investors, these BTCs are still being traded like any other crypto asset, but under a different framework. Another crucial aspect highlighted by Darkfost is that these BTC holdings become less reactive. This development is driven by the fact that supply is currently controlled by large asset management companies such as BlackRock and Fidelity. Instead of using Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) or market panic, these companies manage based on supply and demand dynamics. In the meantime, Darkfost noted that all of this supports the notion that there is a significant shift taking place in the Bitcoin market. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: It’s Time for Soft Secession

Clara JefferyNovember+December 2025 Issue Edmon de Haro Edmon de Haro In 2013, venture capitalist Tim Draper launched a “Six Californias” ballot initiative. The upshot was that with some 40 million people, more than the population of the 20 smallest states combined, California was too big, too diverse, to be “efficiently” governed. So why not, Draper argued, break it up into six new “startups,” a.k.a. states? Instead of two senators, we erstwhile “Californians” would get 12. Draper’s scheme was part of a long tradition—since California was admitted to the Union as part of the Compromise of 1850, there have been more than 220 proposals for it to divide or secede—but derided as a Silicon Valley ploy to create a libertarian deregulation zone. (Tellingly, the Bay Area state was to be named “Silicon Valley.”) And aside from the feasibility of making it happen, state and federal constitution-wise, people worried that it would cleave four rich populous states from two poorer rural states (fair) and weaken Democrats’ voting share in the Senate (in retrospect, nah). Draper’s measure gleaned valid signatures from some 753,000 people—more, it must be said, than the populations of America’s three smallest states—but in California, that wasn’t enough to get on the ballot. After the 2016 election, which put the anti-majoritarian provisions of the US Constitution very much front of mind, Draper came back with a simpler proposal—three Californias, or Cal 3. This initiative got enough signatures to head to voters, but the day before the 2018 ballots were to be printed, the state Supreme Court blocked the measure—what about things like existing water treaties, the justices worried—and Draper eventually gave up. While his motives were murky, Draper tapped into something now excruciatingly felt. The assignment of two senators per state, no matter its population, was always a deeply flawed (and deeply racist) proposition. But the unfairness has only gotten more acute. As my colleague Ari Berman has noted: “In 1790, the country’s most populous state, Virginia, had 12 times as many people as its least populous, Delaware. Today, California has 67 times the population of Wyoming. Fifteen small states with 41 million people combined now routinely elect 30 GOP senators; California, with 39 million residents, is represented by only two Democrats.” The Golden State is the fourth-largest economy in the world but doesn’t have political clout proportional to its population, let alone to our status as a global cultural, technological, and agricultural juggernaut. In case it’s not obvious why I’m taking a leisurely drive down a byroad of California electoral history, let’s review some of the abuses and usurpations that President Donald Trump has visited upon us. California, and the country, cannot await the outcome of the midterms to repel Trump’s siege on democracy. More drastic action is required. The most vicious of those abuses has been over immigration. On June 6, at the urging of his deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, ICE escalated raids in California, hitting farms, factories, construction sites, and schools, separating families and detaining undocumented people, legal residents, and even citizens. Federal agents arrested and hospitalized David Huerta, the head of one of the state’s most powerful unions. When protests erupted, Trump jumped at the chance to federalize the National Guard against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s wishes—something that hasn’t been done since LBJ acted to protect civil rights protesters from segregationists. Border czar Tom Homan threatened to arrest Newsom, which Trump agreed was a “great” idea. When a reporter asked for what crime, Trump responded that his “primary crime is running for governor” and called protesters “insurrectionists.” Speaker of the House Mike Johnson chimed in that Newsom should be “tarred and feathered.” Then Trump sent Marines into LA. When California Sen. Alex Padilla—who was voted for by more Americans than 18 GOP senators combined—tried to ask Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem questions at a press conference, federal officials knocked him down and cuffed him. One-quarter of California’s population are immigrants, and the continual attack on them—and anyone who is brown—is a moral injury that plays out in our streets and our feeds day after day after day. But the direct assaults on California are by no means limited to raids and those protesting raids. Trump has dragged his feet about providing federal aid to address the devastation of LA’s wildfires, saying he’d release it only if we pass a voter-ID law; taken our own National Guard off fire lines; and made bizarre claims about sending us water for the fires from the Pacific Northwest. He’s canceled our car efficiency and emissions rules, attacked our renewable energy plan, and zeroed out federal money for rooftop solar and high-speed rail. He’s revoked federal grants to UCLA over spurious charges of antisemitism, then gave the school a list of demands, including a $1 billion settlement and the end of ­gender-affirming care in its hospitals. Amid all of that came Trump’s demand that Texas engage in midcycle redistricting to give the GOP five extra congressional seats that he says it’s “entitled to.” Newsom, both legitimately enraged and sensing an opportunity to help his presidential ambitions, has rallied California Democrats to mount a ballot initiative to temporarily set aside its nonpartisan redistricting commission and draw congressional maps to counterbalance Texas’ scheme. We will vote on that initiative in November, and my bet is it will pass. But California, and the country, cannot await the outcome of the midterms to repel Trump’s siege on democracy. More drastic action is required. Unfortunately, especially as Trump berates generals and admirals on “the enemy within” and suggests they use US cities as “training grounds,” it’s all too easy to imagine a world where the commanders of California’s military bases are compelled to choose sides. (If you think such scenarios are out of the realm of possibility, ask yourself why he and Pushup Pete Hegseth have been purging the brass.) Our boundaries of oceans and mountains and deserts, our copious natural resources, and our technological prowess make a return to an independent California Republic more feasible than it might be for other states. But in advance, and hopefully in lieu, of that, it’s time to start applying our economic muscle. When Trump first said he was gutting federal funding to California’s public universities, a system that is the envy of the world, Newsom responded: “Californians pay the bills for the federal government. We pay over $80 BILLION more in taxes than we get back. Maybe it’s time to cut that off, @realDonaldTrump.” Remember when Mitt Romney called 47 percent of Americans “takers,” layabouts who fed off the “makers” that he claimed to represent? (We do, since Mother Jones’ own David Corn broke that story, arguably changing the course of the 2012 election.) This persistent GOP talking point is especially odd when you consider the residents of 19 mostly blue states pay more to the US Treasury than they get in federal benefits; to Newsom’s point, none pays more than California. (This includes our undocumented residents, who pay billions in federal taxes and receive no federal benefits.) We’re mostly happy to do it because we believe in things like Social Security, public education, pandemic preparedness, and research institutions. But why should we sit by while you take our money, defund our priorities, and shit on our values? California can’t claim no power in Congress, like DC—home to 700,000 people, more than either Vermont or Wyoming—can. But it’s time to think outside of the electoral box and start flexing our considerable leverage. We are the nation’s largest agricultural state—growing more than a third of the country’s vegetables and ­three-quarters of its fruits—and the fifth-largest food producer in the world. We produce the most milk and the most wine, copious amounts of rice and cattle, and, crucially, 90 percent of US avocados. Other states may be poster children for farms, but we’re No. 1. Hollywood is a $47.2 billion industry exerting, for better or worse, immeasurable global cultural power. The $623 billion tech sector is even mightier. Were California to secede, almost 15 percent of America’s GDP would go with it, and the US could slip behind China as the world’s biggest economy. Short of actual secession, what could California do? It could learn from the Jimmy Kimmel showdown and lead a financial “countervalue” rebellion, using “the full weight of blue states’ market power, cultural influence and legal authority to raise the stakes of Republican red-state aggression,” Democratic strategists Arkadi Gerney and Sarah Knight wrote in the Washington Post, by imposing “regulatory and economic costs that bite hard enough to make the constituents of even the most insulated legislator feel the pain.” We could start by disinvesting our pension funds from red-state companies like AT&T, American Airlines, ExxonMobil, and Tesla. “The 15 blue trifectas (states where Democrats control the governor’s mansion and both houses of the state legislature), with their larger state budgets and more generous pensions, have state investments that total almost 75 percent more than the 23 red trifectas,” they note. If that seems a reach, consider that Texas effectively got BlackRock to drop its “woke” investment and governance policies by blackballing it. Blue states could lure away techies, doctors, nurses, and electricians with relocation bonuses. We could institute tax and other incentives to pull new factories and data centers away from red states. We could selectively terminate professional licensing reciprocity. We could ease commerce between friendly states and make it difficult for unfriendly ones. Economic retribution is just part of a broader constellation of tools that law professors Jessica Bulman-Pozen (Columbia) and Heather K. Gerken (Yale) call “uncooperative federalism” and others call “soft secession.” It’s not, writes Substacker Chris Armitage, “the violent rupture of 1861, but something else entirely. Blue states building parallel systems, withholding cooperation, and creating facts on the ground that render federal authority meaningless within their borders.” Some of this is already underway. Led by California’s Rob Bonta, the attorneys general of blue states have been having almost daily Zoom calls to plot strategy and file briefs and suits. Democratic governors have devoted tens of millions to hire lawyers for those fights and banded together to oppose Trump’s threats to send troops to their states. In early September, California, Oregon, and Washington created the West Coast Health Alliance to formulate their own vaccine standards and distribute shots, no matter what lunacy Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unleashes. Hawaii signed on a day later. Other blue states are honing similar coalitions. Unified action could further preserve what the federal government is destroying, law professors Aziz Z. Huq (University of Chicago) and Jon D. Michaels (UCLA) wrote in the Los Angeles Times. Blue states could create “large regional research consortia; re-create public-health and meteorology forecasting centers servicing member states; and finance pandemic planning.” (A proposal to do much of this is underway in Sacramento.) With the Justice Department doing little more than acting as Trump’s goon squad, states could also “mobilize interstate criminal task forces to track and prosecute corruption by politicians, ­lobbyists and government contractors (who invariably, when violating federal laws, run afoul of myriad state laws, too).” Ditto consumer and environmental investigations—the cost of which could be offset by fines, even as they lay the groundwork for federal prosecutions if America is ever restored to sanity. But we need to be clear-eyed: Such a restoration may not come in time. So far, this year has been marked by a collective action problem. Media conglomerates, law firms, universities, banks, CEOs—too many powerful institutions and individuals have failed to meet the moment. This is why people all over the country, desperate for pushback against Trump’s autocracy, have embraced Newsom’s redistricting plan, whatever their broader opinions of him. With Trump provocatively sending troops into blue cities, and using recision and the shutdown to claw back congressionally appropriated funds from blue states, it’s time to turn the tables on him. Soft secession, powered by the presidential ambitions of multiple blue-state governors, could, should it come to that, be the proving ground of a new confederacy. Hopefully the threat of CalExit or a new Union will be enough. But that extreme measures might be necessary to ensure that American democracy shall not perish from the Earth is becoming more self-evident with every passing day.

(Bloomberg) -- Som Seif, the entrepreneur bent on disrupting Canada’s financial industry, has found himself at the center of an unprecedented showdown with the country’s top markets watchdog. The asset management executive is a consummate marketer — a skill that helped him build a firm that was one of Canada’s early winners in exchange-traded funds, sell it to BlackRock Inc., then start another, Purpose Investments Inc. But that knack for self-promotion has caught the attention of the Ontario Securities Commission, which now alleges that Purpose made false or misleading statements about its use of environmental, social and governance factors in investment decisions. The regulator, in its first enforcement action against greenwashing, also went after Seif himself, saying he failed to stop the claims — and laid out potential penalties that would, at the extreme end, see him banned from being a senior executive in Ontario’s investment industry. Purpose, with about C$26 billion ($18.6 billion) of assets under management, is hardly a global player. But its founder has a public persona in Canada created through years of television appearances and in-flight ads, and that makes him a high-profile target. “There’s been a longstanding perception in industry that Canadian securities regulators as a whole are relatively weak on enforcement,” said Doug Sarro, a law professor at the University of Ottawa who previously worked at the OSC. With this filing, Sarro believes Ontario’s watchdog is trying to “deliver on their new head of enforcement’s vision of more impactful, high-visibility enforcement.” That head is Bonnie Lysyk, Ontario’s former auditor-general, who’s known for a bombshell report on a land development scandal that rattled the government of Premier Doug Ford. Several industry players expressed surprise that the commission went after Purpose, which voluntarily stopped making certain ESG claims in 2023. During the heyday of ESG fund releases between 2020 and 2022, sustainability expert Tim Nash said he saw marketing “throughout the industry that I felt was pushing the boundaries of greenwashing.” The founder of Toronto-based Good Investing said he welcomes enforcement in this realm, but “it does feel to me that there is a little bit of a target on Purpose.” “While this case is the first ESG-related enforcement action brought by the OSC, the issue at the heart of it relates to false and misleading statements,” the regulator said in an email. Seif and Purpose are contesting the claims, with their first hearing set for Monday. “We remain confident about our position and look forward to the proceedings,” Purpose said in a statement. True to form, Seif is also making his case to the court of public opinion in a video, saying the OSC is going after his firm for taking a “genuinely innovative” approach to ESG at a time when no regulatory guidelines existed. In an interview when the allegations were first unveiled, Seif argued the regulator is seeking to score political points, not protect investors. “A regulator is using their position for political greenwashing goals, as opposed to going after people who cause real investor harm.” ‘ESG Always’ Seif, an engineer by training who got his start in finance as an investment banker with Royal Bank of Canada, rose to prominence on Toronto’s Bay Street by building Claymore Investments Inc., one of Canada’s first standalone ETF providers. After Claymore was sold to BlackRock in 2012, Seif founded Purpose Investments. It’s now part of his broader firm, Purpose Unlimited Inc., which has received financial backing from the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and the digital investments unit of Allianz SE. Seif has long advocated for innovation in the financial industry and beyond, and sits on the boards of Wealthsimple Inc. and an entrepreneurship charity. Purpose, meanwhile, launched Canada’s first physical Bitcoin, single-stock and high-interest-savings ETFs, and also has private-asset and retirement-focused products. What it doesn’t offer is standalone ESG funds. Instead, “we had the ambition of embedding ESG considerations as a factor across all of our investment processes,” Seif said in a video uploaded to LinkedIn after the OSC released its allegations — eliciting a supportive comment from a former senior securities regulator. Ontario’s securities regulator, however, says Purpose’s ambition was more about marketing than action. Its case takes issue with at least 19 statements that Purpose or its leader made about ESG between September 2019 and March 2022, including on Purpose’s website and in media interviews. For example, the company said one of its principles was “ESG Always” — a slogan it changed to “ESG Conscious” in 2023, following an OSC review. All but one of the 19 statements came before January 2022, when Canadian securities regulators published their first ESG-specific guidance. The regulator alleges that Purpose didn’t consider ESG in making investment decisions for many of its funds and didn’t even have a formal policy. Less than 35% of assets under management in 2019 considered ESG, the OSC added, despite Purpose saying the percentage was 75%. The watchdog included a range of potential remedies in its filing, from procedural changes to a permanent registration ban. Monetary penalties could be as high as C$5 million for each of five alleged violations. The regulator won’t necessarily seek all of those sanctions. “Once the merits of the case have been decided, the OSC will set out specifically what it is seeking to the Capital Markets Tribunal — and this will be informed by a number of considerations, including the Tribunal’s decision, reasons, and factual findings,” said spokesperson Andy McNair-West. Some securities lawyers say the maximum penalties look too severe for the nature of the infraction. “I don’t think most of it is proportionate,” said Amanda McLachlan, a partner with law firm Bennett Jones in Toronto. Cases in which Canadian regulators have permanently banned people from the capital markets include the Bridging Finance Inc. case, in which investors are estimated to have lost at least C$1 billion due to fraud, and the Sino-Forest Corp. scheme, when a Canadian-listed Chinese forestry company collapsed after it was found to have wildly misstated its assets. The OSC’s filing against Purpose doesn’t allege any investor losses. Enforcement Push The OSC’s action comes after the regulator “has had some high-profile decisions come out that have either not gone well for them or have been critical of enforcement efforts,” McLachlan said. In 2022, the OSC’s case against three former executives of CannTrust Holdings Inc. fell apart in the middle of a trial, resulting in an acquittal. In November, the Capital Markets Tribunal dismissed the OSC’s case against Cormark Securities Inc. and others regarding illegal distributions, calling the allegations an “overreach.” McLachlan said it shouldn’t be surprising that the OSC brought a greenwashing case, given that it completed 128 fund reviews across 41 managers between January 2022 and March 2024. Ambiguous ESG materials have led to multimillion-dollar fines in the US. Invesco Advisers Inc. agreed last November to pay $17.5 million to settle allegations that it misled clients about the share of companywide assets under management that integrated ESG factors into investment decisions. Under the Trump administration, however, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved to end climate-related reporting requirements, leading to a rollback of such rules worldwide. But while there may be less focus on climate and diversity, Canadian securities regulators have emphasized they’ll still go after misleading statements. Regardless of the outcome of the Purpose case, a regulator “is putting out there that they’re going to be reviewing disclosure very carefully,” said Barbara Hendrickson, managing partner of BAX Securities Law in Toronto, who previously worked at the OSC. “It sends a message to the market that they should clean up their existing disclosure if it doesn’t comply with the guidance.” --With assistance from Paula Sambo.

Title: Bitcoin Price Hits An All-Time High, But Here’s What Really Matters
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/10/06/bitcoin-price-hits-an-all-time-high-but-heres-what-really-matters/
Time Published: 2025-10-06T12:49:24Z

ByDan Runkevicius, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin’s price just hit an all-time high at $124,688, pushing its market cap past $2.47 trillion. As Wall Street debates whether it’s a risk-on or risk-off asset, BlackRock says it’s something else entirely. Before we go any further, let’s get one thing out of the way. Bitcoin is not a currency in the way that the dollar or peso is and it is unlikely to ever become a currency in the way that some advocates imagine it to be, with daily purchases being the global norm. A decentralized means of exchange is a lovely democratic idea, but no government (left or right) seems to prefer a decentralized currency to run its books, which would reduce the government’s power over both monetary and fiscal policy. A good example is the Great Depression. In 1931, the U.S. experienced of the worst financial crisis in history. But, unlike today, the Fed’s hands were mostly tied. It couldn’t print more dollars to prop up the economy because the currency was linked to gold. So President Franklin Roosevelt passed Executive Order 6102, later dubbed the “Great Confiscation.” In short, it forced Americans to turn in their gold and sell it to the government at well below market rates. Banning bitcoin today would be a political walk in the park compared to the Great Confiscation and some measures that other governments have taken in the past, like the way that Argentina briefly restricted citizen bank accounts in 2001. That’s because a smaller percentage of the population owns bitcoin, even today, than owned gold or bank accounts in the previous examples. But that doesn’t mean bitcoin is worthless. Bitcoin doesn’t compete with paper money. It competes with insurance against paper money. So the real story behind bitcoin’s rise today isn’t the price but how quickly institutions are adopting it and how much it’s grown out of a speculative asset label into something of a “hedge.” Last month, BlackRock stopped just short of naming bitcoin a risk-off asset, calling it a unique “diversifier." First, bitcoin has a relatively low correlation with stocks. It has little to no exposure to the macro variables that drive traditional assets. And it’s well positioned for global monetary instability because it’s not tied to any jurisdiction. Perhaps more interestingly, bitcoin has risen in six out of six major global crises within 60 days since 2020 — more often, and at a much higher rate, than gold. “In most instances, including with the recent global market sell-off of April 2025, bitcoin has recovered back to its prior level within days or weeks, and in many cases has rallied further as a recognition of the positive potential impact of such disruptive events on bitcoin’s fundamentals begins to predominate,” wrote BlackRock analysts. So even if bitcoin never becomes a global reserve currency or daily transaction currency, it can still carry a lot of perceived value as a “unique diversifier,” "store of value," or a digital alternative to gold. After all, gold is not a legal tender (with few exceptions), you generally don’t buy anything with it. Gold’s industrial and jewelry applications make up just a sliver of demand. Yet private investors, institutions, and central banks still hold $26 trillion worth of it, just in case. And, as we see the price of bitcoin continuing to rise, some may argue that the same dynamic is unfolding with digital gold as well.

Morgan Stanley now likens Bitcoin to digital gold and advises up to 4% allocation for growth portfolios. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee has issued new guidance encouraging investors to dedicate a small but deliberate portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin. The bank’s analysts now view the world’s largest crypto as a “scarce asset similar to digital gold,” recommending an allocation of 2% to 4% depending on risk appetite. Given that Morgan Stanley’s GIC oversees strategy for about 16,000 financial advisors managing roughly $2 trillion in client wealth, even modest adoption could introduce tens of billions in new inflows to Bitcoin. Consequently, the bank’s recommendation could translate to as much as $40 to $80 billion in potential fresh investment into BTC. Exhibit 12: GIC Recommendations for Maximum Cryptocurrency Allocations in Multiasset Portfolios According to the guidance, investors with Opportunistic Growth portfolios (i.e., those comfortable with greater volatility) can hold up to 4% in Bitcoin or similar digital assets. Meanwhile, those with Balanced Growth strategies are advised to keep exposure below 2%, while portfolios focused on preserving capital or generating income should avoid crypto entirely. Still, GIC cautioned that Bitcoin could experience sharper swings during macroeconomic stress, though it acknowledged that the asset’s volatility has significantly reduced in recent years. Nonetheless, this decision reflects a shift in tone from the firm’s earlier caution, when crypto exposure was limited to select high-net-worth clients. Under that framework, qualified investors with at least $1.5 million in net worth and a high risk tolerance were allowed to invest in Bitcoin. Morgan Stanley’s recommendation perfectly illustrates the broader reappraisal of digital assets within the traditional financial ecosystem. The bank’s view now aligns with that of BlackRock, which argued that allocating up to 2% of a diversified portfolio to Bitcoin is a “reasonable” approach for long-term investors. Similarly, billionaire investor Ray Dalio has argued that a small Bitcoin position can function as an inflation hedge, comparable to gold, due to its finite supply. Industry observers see these shifts as a cultural turning point that would spark further adoption and growth for the emerging asset class. Samuel Grisanzio, chief marketing officer at Wolf Financial, said: “The shift from ‘stay away’ to ‘flexibly allocate’ in traditional wealth management language is absolutely massive for adoption honestly.” That evolution follows growing client demand since the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. Those products unlocked easier access to the asset and helped propel its price past $125,000, reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate component of modern wealth strategies and a bridge between traditional finance and the digital economy.

They're still in the early innings of their careers, but these dealmakers and investors are already setting the agenda for the next era of finance. Each year, Business Insider spotlights up-and-coming Wall Streeters who are making an outsize impact in investing, trading, and dealmaking. The process starts with nominations from bosses, colleagues, recruiters, and other industry insiders. To be considered, nominees must be US-based, 35 or younger, and stand out among their peers. Business Insider's editors make the final selections. This year's class reflects some of the hottest areas of the industry, from private credit to advising on multibillion-dollar data center deals. They come from powerhouse firms like JPMorgan, Apollo, Citadel, and Bridgewater. One was recently promoted to chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Meet the 25 newest inductees to Business Insider's annual list of young people who exemplify the drive and creativity needed to succeed in one of the most competitive industries in the world. After a slow start to the year amid uncertainty over tariffs, geopolitical risks, and recession fears, dealmaking is regaining momentum. Bankers and private-equity investors are finding their stride, driving major IPOs, carve-outs, and buyouts. Here are some top dealmakers to watch. Jack Levendoski is riding the rebound in M&A after a rocky start to the year. An executive director in JPMorgan's M&A group, he has worked on some of 2025's largest technology transactions, including Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk and Xero's $2.5 billion purchase of Melio. After a choppy first half marked by rate uncertainty and geopolitical risk, he says the market now "feels extremely busy." He's used to big-ticket transactions: In 2022, Levendoski was part of Twitter's $44 billion sale to Elon Musk, a transaction that unfolded under global scrutiny. "The pace at which that all happened, the level of public scrutiny‚ it was pretty amazing," he told Business Insider. He also worked on Squarespace's $6.9 billion take-private with Permira in 2024, Savvy Gaming Group's $4.9 billion acquisition of Scopely in 2023, and the merger of World Wrestling Entertainment and UFC, valued at about $21 billion. Levendoski's father worked in oil and gas, and the family moved often, living in Louisiana, London, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Australia. "Growing up where the environment was always changing and kind of always finding your feet and figuring it out," he says, adding that it also gave him an appreciation for different viewpoints and the ability to adapt quickly. That flexibility has been essential across more than $300 billion in deal value he has advised on. Artificial intelligence has been a recurring theme in recent deals, in how companies are valued and in how bankers operate. Being an early adopter has given Levendoski "quick answers to hard questions that perhaps before required significant research," he said. After starting his career at Chevron, where he worked as a facilities engineering project manager, Levendoski joined JPMorgan in 2016, supporting capital projects and offshore oil and gas projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Having benefited from mentors early on, he now tries to do the same for others: "I saw the value that it created for me, and so I've tried to play that forward." Mary-Grace Papatheodorou worked on her first IPO in 2012, as an analyst on Jefferies' equity capital markets desk. She remembers watching in awe as the woman running Manchester United's equity syndicate negotiated prices and stake sizes with hungry investors. "I remember thinking to myself at the time, wow, that's the coolest job I've ever seen," Papatheodorou told Business Insider. She went right up and asked if she could join the equity syndicate team. Years later, she thinks that directness was a secret weapon that has helped propel her up the ranks. Today, she's a managing director on Morgan Stanley's global capital markets' equity syndicate desk. "I have to ask investors to step on price or to accept smaller or larger allocations to move the demand. You have to ask — the worst that can happen is someone says no, and at least then you know your answer," she said. "It's tough to put yourself out there, but it's a lot worse not to." Papatheodorou spent nearly 10 years at Jefferies before joining Morgan Stanley in 2021. She managed the equity syndicates of some of this year's highest-profile IPOs, including Figma, Chime, and CoreWeave. Her role, she admits, is "incredibly high pressure." Her calls on price, sizing, and risk can dictate how a stock trades the very next day. Making those calls is also part of the fun, she said. Like the markets, her job is always evolving. She doesn't get a lot of sleep when IPO season is in full swing. Now on maternity leave after giving birth to her first child in August, she's embraced a similar routine. "Having a child is a little bit of a different animal, but equally as demanding as some of our clients," she joked. As a principal investing in sports teams for Blue Owl, Lamar Cardinez is living a version of his dreams he didn't know was possible. Cardinez had ambitions to play professional football, but when that didn't happen, he pivoted to working in sports — interning at Madison Square Garden and joining the 2014 Super Bowl host committee. That led him to the National Football League's rotational program, where he worked in media, business development, and strategy. He planned to climb the ladder there, then realized that the work he was most interested in was reserved for those with finance backgrounds. Encouraged by longtime NFL executive and ex-Goldman Sachs banker Eric Grubman, Cardinez pursued an MBA at Cornell before landing in investment banking at Guggenheim Securities. Then came a fateful call from Dyal Capital Partners (soon to become Blue Owl). The firm had just launched HomeCourt Partners, a fund partnership with the National Basketball Association, to buy minority stakes in teams. It was a "no-brainer" for him, he said. Cardinez joined in 2021, shortly after the fund's first investment in the Phoenix Suns, then valued at $1.55 billion. He later worked on the franchise's $4 billion sale to mortgage magnate Mat Ishbia in 2022 and has since contributed to four more NBA deals — a period during which the average value of an NBA team nearly doubled, according to Blue Owl. He sources potential deals by "hanging around the hoop" and getting to know the league's hundreds of minority investors and would-be buyers. His team spent two years engaging with Alex Rodriguez's consortium before striking a 2024 deal for the Minnesota Timberwolves. Cardinez's skill in underwriting sports teams as they turn from "vanity and trophy assets" to money-makers is built on his operational knowledge of sports and his financial expertise. His blueprint for valuation has since been replicated across sports leagues and geographies, the firm said. Golf was Jackie Shepherd's training for Wall Street. She was a competitive player from age 7 through college, where she earned a full-ride scholarship and was a two-time captain of the University of Minnesota team. Though she dreamed of turning pro, Shepherd carried over her patience and precision to a career advising companies on breaking out parts of their business. "Golf is all about strategy," she said. "I think a lot of that really translated over to the separations work that I do, where it's very detailed, you really have to get into the weeds, it's hyper strategy focused — and these are really long lead time transactions." Shepherd is a vice president in Morgan Stanley's Separations and Structured Solutions group, which specializes in helping companies transform subsidiaries into standalone entities. She has advised on about $250 billion worth of corporate spin-offs, including Comcast's pending carve-out of its cable networks into Versant Media Group. She says it's a "unique way" for Comcast to become more focused on where the future of media is going. The goal with the deals she works on is to "disentangle" businesses that don't make sense together but are strong and "have agendas that they want to do on their own." Shepherd started her career in accounting on EY's international tax team, where she first saw the work of investment bankers up close. "I didn't realize that there was an intersection between the two," she said. "I wanted to be the person coming up with more of the cool ideas." She restarted her career in M&A and was recruited as an analyst by Goldman, where she found her mentor, Michael Kagan; she later followed him to Citi and Morgan Stanley, which she joined in 2023. Shepherd still plays golf, and her goal is to play on all seven continents. Asia was checked off last summer: "My golf clubs have seen a lot of airline miles." In 2022, Florian Plath got a call from one of his bosses at JPMorgan Chase with an assignment: Join the deal team on Broadcom's $90 billion acquisition of VMware, one of the largest tech acquisitions in history. It was a pivotal and fast-moving experience for the banker, who's since advised on other multibillion-dollar transactions, including Altair's $10.6 billion sale to Siemens and Altium's $6 billion sale to Renesas. Earlier in his career, he worked on Maxim Integrated's $29 billion all-stock merger with Analog Devices — one of the largest semiconductor transactions on record. Plath started at JPMorgan as an intern in the London office. Today, he is an executive director and top advisor in its mergers and acquisitions group, working with leading technology clients. Reflecting on these deals, Plath said the constant across them is how quickly teams must mobilize and solve problems in dynamic markets — especially those as ever-changing as the tech sector. He has observed that strategic corporate buyers, after a quieter stretch, have recently begun revving the engine of dealmaking activity again — especially around AI and software — while private equity sponsors continue to search for bargain buys. Plath is based in San Francisco, and the native of Germany has studied in Asia and lived in London, so he's formed a global worldview. He moved to California in 2018. "Right from the start, I knew I wanted to, at some point if the opportunity arose, to live and work in the US," he said, pointing to its position as the leading capital market. His international upbringing, he added, "further sparked my interest in global markets." At JPMorgan, he has also served as a staffer — the linchpin for team coordination — for the North America analyst and associate program, working hand-in-hand with junior bankers on the front lines of deal teams. An avid runner who also enjoys golf and tennis, he credits sports with keeping him grounded in a high-pressure business. "For me, it has always been a team sport," he said, "doing what's right for our clients, the firm, and the employees." From working as a Radio Disney DJ through middle and high school to graduating in the top 5% of her Harvard Business School MBA class as a Baker Scholar, Natalie Lamberton has long been a high achiever with an entrepreneurial streak. It makes sense she's found success at GTCR, the Chicago-based private equity firm where she became one of its youngest directors. "I can chase whatever opportunities I like, which is motivating," she told Business Insider. As an associate in 2016, she played a key role in GTCR's $500 million investment in Lytx, a global leader in video telematics, together with a firm partner. Two years later, GTCR sold a stake in the company, whose valuation had more than tripled to $1.7 billion, to a Clearlake Capital—led investor group. Lamberton joined GTCR after starting her career at Goldman Sachs in leveraged finance. She's since worked on over a dozen deals, including the 2023 acquisition of Once For All, a construction supply chain platform. She helped bring on a new CEO — a key part of GTCR's playbook — and later spearheaded its 2024 expansion into Spain with the acquisition of Nalanda. Returning from parental leave after the birth of her first child in March, Lamberton is focused on vertical software across government technology, supply chain, and workforce tools — and how AI can help portfolio companies achieve their goals more efficiently. "It helps us accelerate our development road map materially," she said. Her father, a salesman in the industrial sector, taught her to approach challenges with curiosity rather than a fear of failure. That has allowed her to walk into situations with the mindset of "why not try to apply myself and see what happens." Lamberton nearly pursued theater before choosing Wharton for undergrad. The “calculated risk taker” in her decided a career onstage wasn’t the right fit. She'd love to get back into it at some point, but right now her performances are reserved for her 6-month-old daughter in their kitchen. Infrastructure has become one of Wall Street's hottest bets. Investors are pouring billions into everything from power grids and data centers to roads and airports, fueling the AI boom and energy transition while upgrading aging assets. Investor assets in private infrastructure funds have soared to $1.5 trillion in 2024 from $500 billion in 2016, according to McKinsey. Meet some of the names you should know as the space continues to gain momentum. The data center industry has become a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity that has transfixed Wall Street. Aman Mittal, a managing director at Moelis & Company, is helping the storied advisory firm establish itself as a leading player in the mergers and acquisitions, investments, and debt deals that are fast shaping the sector. The 35-year-old advised the data center company Core Scientific on its announced $9 billion sale to CoreWeave and worked with Apollo on its deal to buy a majority stake in the data center developer and operator Stream Data Centers. He also helped another large data center platform, Prime Data Centers, arrange the sale of an undisclosed ownership stake in it to institutional investors Snowhawk and Nuveen. And that was just over the summer. In the past three years, Mittal has worked on more than 15 data center-related transactions with a total deal value exceeding $25 billion. Mittal got his start studying electronics and communications engineering in his home country of India before getting an MBA at the NYU Stern School of Business. He began as an analyst at Bain & Company in technology, media, and telecom, before moving to Evercore to advise in those sectors. In 2022, he joined Moelis to help lead its growing practice in the booming digital infrastructure space, particularly data center deals. Mittal said that he keeps his focus straightforward: knowing his clients and anticipating the solutions that match their business needs. "The idea is that you need to know what is important to the company and the company needs to feel comfortable about sharing their constantly changing objectives with you," Mittal said. "My position is like: this is what you're doing, and this could become better if you do this also." Mittal starts his day by jotting down three Post-it notes outlining his priorities. He ends every day with a call, "that is not related to my immediate tasks." "I'll just reach out to someone I have not talked to in three months or six months," Mittal said. "To reconnect with potential possibilities." A demanding career on Wall Street requires resilience, a quality that Arting Chang had mastered before she landed in the industry. As an eighth grader, her father's investment banking job moved her and her family from Taiwan to California. Before that, her family had lived in Shanghai and Tokyo. The frequent moves taught her to be adaptable in a way that helped her career. "I think I have a way of talking to myself very kindly and giving myself encouragement to be like — you know how to do this, you've done this, you've been in more chaotic environments," she said. Now a vice president at Advent International, a private equity firm that manages $94 billion, Chang has emerged as a young star in its industrials team. She helped lead Advent's $1 billion acquisition of LayerZero Power Systems, a producer of data-center power equipment, earlier this year. Chang co-launched Advent's first dedicated data-center sourcing effort. The team built a bottom-up model of how growth would unfold, assembled a bench of executives, and networked with regional, niche bankers so that they'd come to her when deals arose. The introduction to LayerZero came through a relationship at Citizens Bank, months before a formal sale process began. Chang said she's a "big proponent of always getting on the ground." At AEA Investors, where she worked before Advent, she spent a year in Dallas helping prepare retailer At Home for its IPO. While digging into LayerZero, time at the Ohio headquarters revealed an opportunity for an expansion that became central to the deal. She still visits monthly for board meetings. Off the clock, Chang is a regular at Barry's Bootcamp, a restaurant lover, and a proud collector of 50-plus statement blazers. She sits on the steering committee for Advent's LGBTQ+ employee resource group and is the youngest board member of Out for Undergrad, a nonprofit that helps LGBTQ+ college students explore careers in finance and other competitive industries. When Mohini Chakravorty joined Blackstone Infrastructure in 2019, the team had around $5 billion in assets and only a handful of staff. Five years later, a team of around 100 manages $64 billion — and she's had a front-row seat to explosive growth that has shaped her career. "It's been just a wild ride. It's really rare to see that kind of growth and that kind of rapid evolution," Chakravorty said. Chakravorty's first stop after Wharton was Bank of America, where she followed her older brother into investment banking. It wasn't surprising to anyone, as he'd always been a role model, she said, but she quickly found herself drawn more to private equity. Since joining Blackstone, Chakravorty has contributed to more than $16 billion in transactions across the infrastructure sector. One key moment came when she helped acquire a stake in Phoenix Tower International in 2022, the biggest private cellphone tower platform in Europe and the Americas. Chakravorty credits much of her success to keeping a positive attitude, even when making rapid and stressful judgment calls. She remembers when, minutes before a key meeting, her team identified a downside scenario they needed to review. Even with the time crunch, Chakravorty helped create a straightforward analytical approach to quantify the potential problem, which became the focus of the discussion. The same composure came into play when she helped acquire the largest yacht and marina servicing company, Safe Harbor Marinas, for $5.6 billion on a "very accelerated" timeline earlier this year. Much of Chakravorty's job involves relationship-building, which comes easily since she's a natural extrovert. Chakravorty also focuses on showing other young women who are interested in investing that there's room for them in the profession. "The advice that I tell myself and give to young women is to run towards what scares you. Facing challenges head-on helps you break down some of those roadblocks," she said. Benson Kane was in seventh grade in Weston, Connecticut, when the 2008 financial crisis hit, and he remembers being fascinated by the underpinnings of the unfolding calamity. "All of a sudden, this big event happened and I was interested in understanding what this was and how it had such a massive impact on the broader world," Kane said. Throughout middle and high school, his interest in debt and credit persisted. He avidly followed Elliott Investment Management's efforts in the news to collect on its investment in Argentine bonds that the country had defaulted on. After studying finance at Brigham Young University, Kane joined Angelo Gordon in 2020, which became part of TPG in 2023. He's now a vice president on its credit solutions team. The group focuses on extending debt and providing other capital solutions to companies that often face financial distress or complex business challenges. Kane focuses on companies in the chemicals and materials manufacturing sectors, as well as those involved in energy infrastructure, including power plants and pipelines. "I love complex problems, trying to figure them out," Kane said. In 2023, for instance, Kane, 29, worked on a $1 billion-plus loan provided to Trinseo, a materials company, funded by TPG, Oaktree Capital, and Apollo. "We were able to provide liquidity to a company in need of it and that wasn't able to get it from other sources, and we were able to preserve the business," Kane said, explaining that the company and others like it in the materials and chemicals industries had been hit by a downturn in demand post-pandemic. Kane is excelling in a newer world of distressed credit where, he said, there is often a more congenial relationship between lenders and borrowers. "We're working in a much more collaborative fashion, trying to be solutions providers, a little bit less sharp-elbowed maybe than the past," Kane said. "Relationships matter, reputations matter. People want to work with people that are good to work with in terms of company." The growth of private markets has reshaped Wall Street, turning private equity, credit, and secondaries into some of the most dynamic parts of finance. Behind the growth is a new generation of talent driving major buyouts, capital raises, and fund innovations. Meet the rising stars helping define the strategies and structures that will shape how trillions of dollars flow through global markets. Private credit's first iteration was all about lending to companies that do not have access to traditional bank financing. Now, private credit 2.0 — the shift to customizing loans for investment-grade companies — is on the rise, and Madelaine O'Connell is helping write the playbook. O'Connell is a managing director in HPS' $25 billion private high-grade business. Her team designs creative alternatives to issuing a plain-vanilla bond, such as helping a Fortune 500 company finance a new project through a joint venture — keeping the debt off its balance sheet while giving investors, like insurers, a steady return. She thinks the industry has "just scratched the surface" of structuring bespoke deals that can't be found in the public bond market, she told Business Insider. "Every transaction we work on has nuances that have definitely pushed me personally to think outside the box," she said. O'Connell began her career at Citi in the securitized products division before Goldman Sachs tapped her and her then-boss to help rebuild its private placement franchise, which had been dormant since the 1990s. She said the effort was like a "de-risked startup," integrating with investment-banking teams, winning trust deal by deal, and building relationships on the buy side. She led the team from 2020, and by the time she left in 2024, it was lending to fund managers and lending against esoteric assets like media rights. They were also early to financing data centers — something that was cutting-edge at the time, she said. The explosive growth in private credit was "very much the thesis" behind her move to HPS, which the $12.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock acquired in July, giving her team even more firepower. A lifelong dancer, O'Connell began teaching fitness classes at Boston College and even led 6 a.m. Pilates sessions while working as an investment banker. She still teaches online occasionally when travel allows. "Working out is just as important to my mental health as it is to my physical health," she said. In Knut Kirchhoff's nine years of working in private credit, the segment has grown to become one of the hottest places for young job seekers in finance. As a leader of the analyst and associate recruiting efforts for Blackstone's Credit and Insurance team, he's seen this transformation firsthand. At a Georgetown recruiting event that drew more than 100 students, Kirchoff had nonstop conversations about private credit and "lost my voice by the end of the night," he said. A Norwegian who attended Boston University for college, Kirchoff began his career on Citi's leveraged finance team. He quickly became fascinated with the world of debt, and after two years, he realized he wanted to move to the buy side. His interest was piqued by a few successful deals that Blackstone Credit (then GSO) did with Citi during a period of energy price volatility in 2015. When he joined Blackstone in 2016, the firm's credit unit had roughly $80 billion in assets. It has since swelled to over $400 billion, becoming the firm's largest and fastest-growing business. "The first deal I did was $125 million," Kirchoff said. "Now we're doing billion-dollar deals almost every single week." Last year, Kirchoff helped create the professional services vertical, lending to consulting and accounting firms. The team, which Kirchoff now leads, has made over $10 billion in credit investments. The deal that catapulted his career occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kirchoff was tapped to work on lending to cruise lines. As some deals were launching, the leading managing director went on paternity leave, leaving Kirchoff to step into a leadership position. "I had been promoted four months earlier and was working from home, and now had the responsibility of a team under me," Kirchoff said. He led diligence on the deal and brought it through the investment committee. Blackstone's purchase of the cruise line debt "ended up being a really good transaction for the firm," Kirchoff said. Patrick Kearney has developed a specialty for buying airlines and packaging companies during his eight years at Apollo. It's a product of Apollo's "generalist" model, the principal told Business Insider, which has new hires rotate through different business units and industries. His first deal was the 2018 acquisition of Sun Country Airlines, and aviation has been a constant since. Airline ownership allows Kearney to flex his business-building muscles — navigating Trump's tariffs, investing in more aircraft, and modernizing operations at a portfolio company, Atlas Air. "There's never a dull day when you own an airline in terms of the problems that you have to solve," he said. And even though he's based in the firm's flagship private equity arm, he still works closely with Apollo's ground-breaking credit team. "We don't have any walls at Apollo," he said about the firm he joined in 2017 after spending two years at Moelis & Company. Credit and equity teams share research, insights, expertise, and even deals. The credit side can help make equity investments possible when financing is tight, such as with the firm's 2022 $5.2 billion take-private of cargo airline Atlas Air, Kearney said. "We financed Atlas when the financing markets, frankly, were not open," Kearney said. Kearney's work on the 2022 acquisition of Novolex and the 2025 combination with Pactiv, both food packaging businesses, is another example of his ability to grow companies. When Kearney and his team initially considered Novolex, they evaluated what the combined business would look like with Pactiv, given their complementary products. It didn't pan out, but at the end of last year, Novolex announced it would acquire Pactiv, with the deal expected to close this year. "It's rare to have something like that in your original investment committee dialogue and actually have it come to fruition," Kearney said. The first deal of Alex Park's career was far from the sleek software buyouts he's versed in now — it was a Chapter 11 bankruptcy for a school bus company that he happened to use as a kid. "Buses were stolen out of the parking lot in Staten Island, and I actually had to work with the local police force to try and locate these buses," he laughed. That experience sparked his interest in working in credit: "I wanted to see what a healthy and growing company looked like." That realization carried Park from restructuring at Rothschild to Ares Management, and ultimately to Thoma Bravo, where he joined the credit team shortly after its inception in 2019. Now a principal, he's helped the credit team invest more than $8 billion across about 100 transactions. Miami-based Park is "incredibly proud" of sourcing and leading financing for Blackstone's acquisition of Irth Solutions in 2021 and Warburg Pincus' financing of Softeon in 2023 — two "best in class" SaaS companies, he said. "Everyone wants to lead deals for these sponsors," Park said. While Thoma Bravo's credit team has been well established, it's "still relatively new" compared to some players, he noted. Outside of investing, Park has played a key role in fundraising, including helping to complete the $3.6 billion Credit Fund III, the platform's largest pool of capital to date, in early 2025. He credits his career success to a "chip on my shoulder" work ethic, a love of building relationships, and especially a commitment to mentorship. In fact, a banker from Rothschild, Brendan Fox, who took him "under his wing," is on his team at Thoma. He said a number of colleagues "played such a formative role in shaping me that I always wanted to pay that forward going forward." Today, Park leads recruiting for the credit team, creating an "open-door" culture for juniors: "I want you to feel comfortable asking me anything and everything — no dumb questions." When Joe Slevin started specializing in the resale market of private equity stakes in 2015, it was a niche that "barely existed," he told Business Insider. Now, secondary deals are on the rise — with a record $103 billion worth of activity completed globally in the first six months of 2025, according to Jefferies. UK-native Slevin started his career as a JPMorgan investment banker in London, then sought "an area of finance where there was huge growth potential," that was "off the beaten path." He joined Coller Capital, a pioneer in what was then the nascent secondaries industry. After three years on the buy side, Slevin returned to banking to advise investors on secondary transactions at PJT Partners and Guggenheim Partners because, he said, he preferred being "at the center of things between all the stakeholders in a transaction." He said his time on the buy side made him a better advisor since he had to bring "extremely nuanced" deals through investment committees. In 2021, he joined Jefferies to cofound their Private Capital Advisory team, which now has more than 120 members and advises investors on selling some of their private portfolios to other investors and fund operators on spinning out select assets into new funds. In the first half of this year, the PCA team advised on over $31 billion in secondary transactions. Slevin focuses on deals led by private equity or credit operators, recently working with ONCAP, Gryphon Partners, and Trinity Ventures. The most well-known version of this is a continuation fund, which is set up to buy one or more assets they already own — giving liquidity to investors who need it while continuing to wring returns out of assets. This segment of the industry has experienced a surge in popularity in recent years, as private equity distributions have fallen short of expectations. Earlier this year, Slevin moved to Los Angeles from New York to expand his team's geographic reach, focusing on West Coast private equity and venture capital operators. About four years ago, Josef Menasche was working at a boutique secondaries firm on a deal alongside Goldman Sachs bankers. He came away convinced that his industry, which deals in sales of private fund stakes, was headed for change. "My whole thesis was big banks are going to dominate this space eventually," he said. So he called Goldman and said, "Hey, you should just hire me because we already had a great working dynamic on this deal. Wouldn't it be better if we were actually working together?" He joined the bank's secondaries business at the end of 2021 and today is a managing director and global cohead of secondaries advisory. He said 2025 has been a turning point, following several years of caution among investors regarding capital commitments. "The level of creativity that we've seen in 2025 has been really, really exciting to work with," he said — a sign that the market is picking up. His team has executed transactions across infrastructure, real estate, private equity, and venture capital. The highlights include a $3.1 billion single-asset continuation vehicle — allowing a private equity firm to extend its investment in a company — with New Mountain Capital for Real Chemistry. "Half of it was providing the distribution to original investors, half was actually primary capital for future M&A, which is pretty unusual," he said. "The fact that they're willing to put so much fresh money into the new M&A through another business is pretty unusual. It's a general sign of people feeling good about the world." His team has just over a dozen bankers, compared with about 150 at its largest competitor, he said. Clients often tell him: "You give us very different advice to other bankers, and it seems to work out well for us." Menasche studied chemistry at Cambridge. He found the lab environment too slow and shifted into finance. Early experience at secondaries-focused boutique Campbell Lutyens gave him a foothold in the industry. "I think fundamentally, if you just pick what you're interested in, you will do well," he said. ​​Reading the tea leaves of geopolitics, policy, and markets has never been more important. These rising macro minds spend their days researching and understanding global risks and opportunities — whether to arm clients with insights for critical decisions or to pull the trigger on trades themselves. Citadel portfolio manager Adam Theriault-Shay's obsession with digging into obscure corners of global markets and conducting on-the-ground research to get satisfying answers sets him apart in a world fixated on data and artificial intelligence. It has also helped him earn a rates-and-currencies trading book of more than $1 billion before the age of 30, managing risk in line with that of macro hedge fund veterans. As a math student at MIT, Theriault-Shay was thorough and never took the easy way out, according to professor Bjorn Poonen. Theriault-Shay once encountered a confusing passage in the class textbook, written by one of the world's most renowned mathematicians. Poonen said that while most students might have skipped over it, he flagged it — and with good reason, it turned out: "There was an error in the book!" He applied to intern at quant hedge fund D.E. Shaw and stood out among an "extremely competitive applicant pool," one person who interviewed him said. After graduating in 2019, he started at Shaw full-time in its macro unit, researching and trading currencies and emerging-market rates, especially in Asia. "He has this inner, deep desire to figure out the truth and figure out what's really going on in markets," a former colleague said, adding that Theriault-Shay would get almost "giddy" about esoteric aspects of the market. Theriault-Shay had a penchant for disappearing down rabbit holes in individual countries and companies and resurfacing with insights sharp enough to nudge the group's thinking on some of its currency positions — an impressive feat for a junior, they said. Theriault-Shay was poached in 2021 by Citadel, joining as an associate PM in the group run by vaunted bond basis trader Jon Tipermas. Within two years, he was promoted to portfolio manager and now runs a small team. Theriault-Shay thrives on shoe-leather research, traveling to Asia multiple times a year to inform his trades. "He loves being on the ground and getting a sense of the local flavor and talking to people in Asia about markets," the former colleague said. Citadel declined to comment or make Theriault-Shay available for an interview. Just days into her new role as chief of staff to Larry Fink, Catherine Kress is already feeling the faster pace, she told Business Insider. The post puts her at the center of the world's largest asset manager — gatekeeper to BlackRock's cofounder and CEO, and offers what excites her most: "unparalleled exposure" to global business leaders and policymakers. Kress long knew she wanted a career at the "intersection of geopolitics, policy, economies, and markets." Until recently, she was BlackRock's head of geopolitics and research, unpacking issues from the AI race to trade protectionism and sharing them at conferences, boardrooms, and in meetings with major C-suite leaders. She helped turn the $12.5 trillion firm's first geopolitics team, led by former US national security advisor Tom Donilon, into a permanent fixture within the BlackRock Investment Institute. When she applied to be Donilon's advisor, she called it a "dream job" — even asking her husband to confirm the posting was real. Demand for her team's insights surged after the COVID pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as clients "realized national security and resilience concerns were increasingly taking priority or at least on par with pure cost efficiency and market objectives," she said. A psychology and anthropology major at the University of Notre Dame, she conducted fieldwork in Sierra Leone and pursued graduate research in Angola's energy sector at Oxford as a Clarendon scholar. She thought she might pursue a Ph.D. until a mentor urged her to apply her work in the private sector. Before joining BlackRock in 2018, she worked closely with Ian Bremmer, the political scientist and the founder of Eurasia Group, where she led training sessions on integrating geopolitical risk thinking with investing. She credits academia with teaching her to ground every view in facts, "never shooting from the hip," and for instilling in her the confidence to brief everyone from investors to world leaders. Now, as Fink's chief of staff and a mother to two young boys, she's entering what she calls the "culmination" of her career. A decade ago, while living in New Delhi and before he had ever set foot in the US, Nikunj Jain spent his free time Googling which colleges offered the best computer science programs. Now, after graduating from the University of California-Berkeley in two and a half years, he's the head of Asia research for Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund with $98 billion. Jain credits his rapid journey to the upper echelon of finance to a mix of persistence, strong familial support, and internal mentors, including the firm's co-chief investment officer, Karen Karniol-Tambour. From New York, Jain helps Bridgewater steer its coverage of all things Asia, where its flagship fund trades securities and its China-based funds have become a go-to investment for the country's elite. It's the type of day-to-day excitement and challenge that drew the 27-year-old to finance in the first place. After graduating, he studied machine learning, taught undergraduates math, interned for Apple, and worked for the Department of Defense, but found the Bay Area "a little slower than I would have liked." A friend suggested quantitative finance, leading him to apply to Bridgewater, the systematic investment manager founded 50 years ago by billionaire Ray Dalio, which has returned 26.4% in its flagship fund through September this year. He spent time focused on equities and fixed income, but in his current role, geography is the only boundary. His 15- to 20-person team, depending on the subject matter of the day, synthesizes activities across Asia into trading signals for Bridgewater's strategies. Jain sees macro investing as the culmination of answering "one of the toughest intellectual challenges." Asian markets, in particular, can be a puzzle thanks to relatively less reliable economic data. Jain's team stays on top of the latest shifts with a blend of quantitative know-how and "old-school macro investing practices," such as on-the-ground research and knowledge. Bridgewater has offices in Singapore and China, and Jain tries to visit the continent often. Seven years in, Jain says he has found a home in the industry: "I love the world of investing." From running multibillion-dollar books to navigating volatile markets, these young standouts are central to how their firms make money and manage risk. At hedge funds specifically, the battle for talent remains fierce. Some declined to make their stars available for interviews. When COVID shut down the world in 2020 and Manhattan offices emptied as workers isolated at home, distressed credit trader Jake Woodson was on a skeleton crew that never left Goldman Sachs' trading floor. It felt unusual at the time, but having the opportunity to navigate once-in-a-lifetime swings in airlines, retailers, and car-rental companies was "a blessing in disguise," says Woodson. "You can end up learning in a few weeks, or a couple months, more than in certain years," Woodson said. A couple of years later, he was promoted to his current role as head of US distressed credit trading. Shortly after, he navigated the 2023 banking crisis, generating tens of millions in profits for the firm — a seminal moment in his career. Woodson's unlikely path started at the University of British Columbia — hardly a recruiting target for US investment banks. There, he pulled off an impressive feat: he became the first varsity football player — and second athlete ever — admitted to the school's Portfolio Management Foundation, an intensive training program founded in the 1980s, in which a select group of students help manage a multimillion-dollar endowment. He started full-time at Goldman in 2014 in investment-grade credit, though he knew he eventually wanted to trade riskier securities. A year later, he jumped at an opportunity to work in junk bonds under Thomas Malafronte, who's now a PM at Millennium. Woodson earned a reputation as a reliable, insightful, and generous trading partner. He's "trustworthy and honest" and "people love working for and with him," one buy-side client said. "You'd rather be respected than liked, but he does things the right way and is in a special category where he's both," said Malafronte. Woodson presses his team of around 10, including traders and researchers, not just to identify mispricings, but to figure out what's behind the inefficiency — a forced seller or herd bias against a business model or company? (Goldman declined to comment on team head count.) "When things seem too obvious, they probably are," he added. Under his leadership, Goldman's US distressed team has ranked third in industry league tables for the past two years and is ranked No. 2 so far in 2025, according to Vali Analytics. Ilya Katz, the new portfolio manager for Citadel's Ashler Capital unit, has spent his short career investing for several billionaires. Katz, who has two degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, started at Steve Cohen's Point72 in 2016. He worked as an analyst for a team trading healthcare stocks — including companies that manufacture medical devices — that managed a book of more than $2 billion, according to his LinkedIn profile. He joined Cowen as the firm's head of healthcare data in 2019, prior to TD Bank's acquisition of the New York-based financial services company. He then rejoined the buy side, trading for London billionaires Ian Wace and Paul Marshall at their self-named megafund. There, Katz worked under healthcare portfolio manager Vijay Shankaran, who managed money for the firm's Eureka fund, a person familiar with the asset manager told Business Insider. He started as an analyst, blending quantitative tools with fundamental research to find opportunities in therapeutics and medical technology companies. He was given his own sleeve of capital to run under Shankaran, this person said, managing some of Marshall Wace's billions before being poached by Ken Griffin at the end of last year. Now at Ashler, Citadel's equities unit, his pod naturally focuses on the healthcare space, where he's been able to lean on his science background: He has a master's in biotechnology and an undergraduate degree from Penn's competitive Wharton program in economics. Even in the ultra-competitive world of multistrategy hedge funds, where every portfolio manager and analyst seemingly has an Ivy League degree and a sterling résumé, Katz stands out. One word an Ashler colleague used to describe the under-30 trader: savant. Christian Woo likens his work to building a Formula 1 car engine: The technology team provides the raw materials, the traders are the drivers, and his job is designing the machinery that makes everything run faster. At Bank of America, Woo is a managing director and who leads the credit systematic trading strategies team. They conduct quantitative research and develop a credit market-making algorithm, which handles smaller electronic inquiries and spreads risk from big client orders. Since joining in 2019, Woo has helped grow the bank's algorithm-based electronic trading volume in investment-grade credit fivefold. He said that it's been gratifying to see everyone's work "compound" as it continues to expand, especially since he was involved from the very beginning. Woo's team designs the algorithms that enable traders to quote bonds autonomously, manage risk after large portfolio trades, and process thousands of trades simultaneously — a leap from just a few years ago. That progress also reflects a broader market trend as Woo points out: Today, more than half of all corporate bond trading is done electronically, up from roughly 20% a decade ago. Honolulu isn't a traditional Wall Street launchpad, but his father, a wealth manager, exposed Woo to markets early, bringing him along to meet with clients across the Hawaiian islands. After starting on Citi's credit trading desk in 2015 in New York City, where he's based, he moved to Bank of America in 2019 and dove into electronic credit trading. He credits his drive to his mother, a nurse and healthcare worker who threw herself into every endeavor — including her passions such as pickleball and her stint in entrepreneurship. "She goes all in on things and commits very hard, and it's something I find that I do, as well," he said. He approaches his work the same way: tackling problems with curiosity and persistence. A mantra from Einstein has guided his career: "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." In the cutthroat world of hedge funds, especially at the multistrategy giants that have come to rule the industry, there's not much upside for portfolio managers to be a sounding board for others. Colleagues, much less people at rival funds, can be slow to share wisdom or hacks for fear of losing their own edge. Everyone is, more or less, competing against everyone else at all times. It's one of the reasons John Huh stands out. Huh, a portfolio manager at $14 billion Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, is a talented investor and a strong mentor for younger colleagues, according to those who know him. After graduating from New York University's Stern School of Business in 2012, he worked at Wells Fargo in equity research and then moved to the buy side in 2015. He joined Point72 in 2016, when it was trading its founder's cash and before it officially reopened to outside investors. He worked as an analyst covering stocks in the telecommunications, media, technology, and internet sectors through the firm's 2018 relaunch, and left the following year to join Schonfeld. Huh worked under Simon Silverston as an associate portfolio manager before being promoted at the end of last year to run his own team. Still specializing in technology, media, and telecommunications, Huh is a go-to source for many young stockpickers at the firm with questions or problems, according to one individual who works at the New York-based manager. Wall Street is constantly looking for an edge, which means firms are always racing to create new products and tools that give them — and their clients — an advantage. Whether it's reimagining how bonds are traded or bringing complex products like CLOs and tokenized funds to a broader investor base, these rising stars show how fresh ideas can quickly scale into breakthroughs that reshape markets. Sarah Naylor wanted to be in the room where decisions were made. After six years in investment-grade bond sales at big banks, she knew that room was usually reserved for senior staff. So when Citadel Securities tapped her in 2024 to help launch its corporate bond trading business, she jumped at what she called a "once-in-a-career" opportunity. Her readiness for that leap traces back to a turning point a few years in at Citigroup, which she joined in 2016 after graduating from Colgate. A senior salesman covering a major asset manager departed, and Naylor was asked to temporarily oversee the account. Lacking experience, she compensated with preparation — studying the client's portfolio and grilling traders for insights. Citi's standing improved, and she kept the account permanently. The episode shaped her philosophy to be an "internal expert" on her client. "I try to hold myself to the standard that anytime anyone internally has a question pertaining to my client, I should have the answer," Naylor said. One of her mentors at Citi, Sam Berberian, recruited her to Citadel Securities after he joined as head of credit trading in 2023. She joined the buildout in early 2024 and quickly found herself "in the room," weighing in on key decisions. One objective for the team has been tackling the "gray market," the window when newly announced bonds trade before official issuance. Citadel Securities views that period as critical for clients, but historically inefficient, since banks can't immediately resell the bonds they've issued, and pricing is often fragmented and handled over the phone. Naylor pitched Berberian an idea: a tool that would stream live data and pricing from Citadel Securities. Working across teams, Naylor helped propel that idea to reality this September with the launch of the "Gray Trading Panel" on Bloomberg terminals. The impact has been swift, she said. A large asset manager executed its first gray market trade, block trades increased, and market share ticked up. "I have learned more in the last 18 months than I had in my entire career combined," Naylor said. Jessica Shill didn't know she'd be working with niche CLO ETFs when she took a job with Janus Henderson in August of 2019. But shortly after she joined, that became a focus, bringing a traditionally opaque product for institutions to mainstream investors. Her team has grown to more than 20 people, and she's now a portfolio manager of three ETFs overseeing a combined $24.3 billion in assets. "Launching and management of the ETFs are definitely the keystone moments of my career," Shill said. She recently helped launch and develop the strategy of Janus' first tokenized fund — which has gathered nearly $800 million in assets since its June debut — and thinks blockchain will help asset management become more efficient. Shill credits her success to her diligence, such as rotating out of a bond as soon as she becomes uncomfortable holding it, and believes that the best choices are often the hardest ones. She's worked through "some pretty turbulent markets," like COVID, and thinks her ability to raise capital and willingness to "grind out sales" during that time helped prove her chops to management. "I am a firm believer in measure twice, cut once. Honestly, at work, it turns into measuring three or four times and cutting once," Shill said about her process for evaluating each bond. "As long as you're never trying to cut your corners, over time, you become confident." Shill, who didn't grow up in a family with Wall Street ties, said finance has been a good fit in part because it's "intellectually stimulating." The Maine native studied at Bryn Mawr College and spent two years at Wells Fargo before joining Janus in Denver. Since she works market hours but lives on Mountain Time, Shill begins her days early and typically has some time after work. In the summer, she'll often go for a bike ride before cooking dinner for herself and her husband and, no matter the season, reading for a bit before going to sleep.Interactive development by Randy Yeip.Corrections: October 6, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated Joe Slevin's age.

Mumbai: A recent regulatory change proposing banks enter into acquisition financing could potentially disrupt the fast-growing private credit industry in pricing and deal-picking, and over the long term transform the way deals are structured, according to sector experts. The Reserve Bank of India, as part of its Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies released alongside the monetary policy statement on October 1 proposed allowing banks to fund corporate buyouts. At a broader level, the RBI’s proposal is “very proactive and progressive" and is expected to go a long way in reducing the cost and enhancing availability of capital pools for individuals and corporates, said Bhavdeep Bhatt, chief executive officer of Northern Arc Investments. Private credit growth has been strong in 2025. Total private credit deployment touched $9 billion across 79 deals in the first half of calendar 2025—a 53% jump from the first half of 2024 and close to three times the value for the latter half of 2024, a report by EY in August noted. The biggest of deals was the $3.1 billion raised by Porteast Investment of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group—the biggest onshore private credit transaction in India to date. Indian private credit players include Kotak Alternative Asset Management, 360 One, Avendus Capital, and Edelweiss Funds, among others; international players include Blackrock, Blackstone, KKR, Abudhabi Investment Authority, and several others. A key factor for the growth of the private credit market in India until now has been the RBI’s restrictions on banks providing acquisition finance, said Geeta Chugh, managing director, sector lead, financial services ratings at S&P Global Ratings. Longer term impactThe proposed entry of banks, with their relatively larger balance sheets and readiness to lend amid muted corporate growth, could potentially result in lower yields, looser terms, and weaker collateral structures. In some cases, enforcing collateral or ensuring debt coverage may be weaker than with traditional bank loans, other experts told Mint. Still, in the short to medium term, the overall impact on private credit funds is expected to be small, given the limited ability and skill sets of banks to fund complex deals and the flexibility at private credit firms on with customisations and value-addition. Private credit funds command superior returns because they offer customised funding structures—tailored for complexity, risk, scale and quick turnarounds. Bound by tight regulations, banks often lack flexibility and are likely to be limited to larger, simpler, and less risky transactions, said Ashwin Patni, head, wealth management services, Julius Baer. Most takers for private credit deals are mid-market corporates who require a nimble approach. Also Read | Buy now, pay later is surfing the private credit wave "Acquisition financing is just a small slice of the private credit pie, so any minor capital shift toward banks will not impact the broader opportunity set," said Patni. But, the crucial difference could be in how deals are structured with the entry of banks. Cost of fundingBanks with their lower cost of funds will have the advantage of lower pricing, something that private credit funds cannot compete with, experts said, adding that the latter will also then have to look at what value proposition they offer clients. Private credit currently prices at 14-17% IRR, and if banks are permitted to finance acquisitions, they could come in at a materially lower cost—around 10–12% all-in, given their access to low-cost deposits, said Atul Thakkar, executive director, Anand Rathi Investment Banking. Raghunath T, senior portfolio manager at Vivriti Asset Management, believes that this pricing dynamic is sustainable given that investor allocations to private credit have grown regardless of rate or liquidity considerations and driven by consistent outperformance compared to public debt markets. What’s more is that the deal flow for private credit funds is diversified across sectors, he said, adding that typically, sectors with M&As and extraordinarily high growth seek credit solutions from private credit funds. “Today, a lot of infrastructure platforms across renewable energy, transportation and high-growth segments like electronics manufacturing and logistics are contributing to a large share of the deal flow," Raghunath said. Red flagsDespite the proposed RBI norms expected to open up capital for acquisition financing, some market participants remain sceptical and warn that this comes with a higher risk of bank exposure to certain corporates. Also Read | Private credit is booming business. Where one pro sees risks and opportunities. While bank loans would likely carry tighter covenants and security packages compared to private credit, the only risk factor is the need for the central bank to set an overall limit on how much exposure each bank can take on in the private credit segment, said Thakkar of Anand Rathi Investment Banking. Others worry that if banks are allowed to finance acquisitions, it could lead to indirect promoter funding through backdoor loans, and without clear rules, acquisition finance might be misused. Regulators would likely require strict monitoring to ensure funds are not for equity buybacks or share pledges. “The systemic risk is limited right now because private credit is still a small slice compared to total bank lending," said Vishal Bansal, partner, debt and special situations, EY India. Risks such as asset quality deterioration could emerge if funds loosen standards to win deals or liquidity mismatches crop up if investors want to exit before loans mature, he cautioned. But Nilesh Dhedhi, MD & CEO, Avendus Finance Private Ltd ruled out systemic risks pointing to the fact that private credit assets under management (AUM) is not even 1% of total banking AUM. Besides, he said: “Private credit looks at risk… mostly in micro terms rather than macro terms [as banks do]. There are also very specific risk-driven analysis for a particular company or situations rather than a standardised approach [at banks]."

Raghunath T, senior portfolio manager at Vivriti Asset Management, believes that this pricing dynamic is sustainable given that investor allocations to private credit have grown regardless of rate or liquidity considerations and driven by consistent outperformance compared to public debt markets. What’s more is that the deal flow for private credit funds is diversified across sectors, he said, adding that typically, sectors with M&As and extraordinarily high growth seek credit solutions from private credit funds. “Today, a lot of infrastructure platforms across renewable energy, transportation and high-growth segments like electronics manufacturing and logistics are contributing to a large share of the deal flow," Raghunath said.

French investment firm Ardian is buying one of Ireland's largest energy utilities Energia Group in a deal that values the firm at more than €2.5 billion, betting on a power supplier poised to serve the surging artificial intelligence industry. Ardian has agreed to buy Energia Group from infrastructure investment firm I Squared Capital. I Squared Capital had acquired the company in 2016 for €1 billion. The companies said today's deal will have no impact on Energia's customers, employees, partners or suppliers, adding that Energia remains committed to delivering on its strategy and supporting Ireland's sustainable energy future. The deal underscores surging investor interest in data centres that cater to the booming market for AI tools and power their growing adoption across the globe. BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners is nearing a deal to acquire Aligned Data Centers that could value the data centre operator at around $40 billion, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters last week. Energia represents Ardian's first deal in Ireland. Energia owns onshore wind farms with a capacity of 358 mega watts, supplies gas and electricity to over 898,000 clients and employs 1,117 people, according to its website. It supplies about 17% of the island of Ireland's total electricity requirements and 20% of its total wind power. "Energia's focus remains on transforming Ireland's energy system by deploying renewables and other low carbon solutions at scale, while continuing to deliver secure and affordable energy to our domestic and commercial customers. We are grateful for I Squared’s support over the past nine years and the strong, future-ready platform we have built together," its CEO Ian Thom said. "Ireland is at a pivotal point, with rapid electrification, growing demand from new technologies, and global investment in digital infrastructure all accelerating. Energia is ideally placed to meet these needs, and with Ardian's long-term backing, we’re excited to continue scaling our business to help power this next phase of Ireland’s growth for our customers, partners and employees," he added. "We are proud to be investing in Energia, which marks Ardian’s first investment in Ireland. The company has demonstrated its market leadership in Ireland and Northern Ireland over many years and has ambitious plans to grow, driven by secured capital projects and increasing energy demand," Juan Angoitia, Ardian's co-head of infrastructure Europe and senior managing director said. "Ardian is a highly experienced investor in essential infrastructure and European utilities. We have been impressed by Energia's strong growth and resilience in the context of a volatile energy market, and look forward to sharing our expertise to further develop its renewable generation portfolio, flexible capacity and enhance the efficiency of the whole company, " he added. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: US Govt Shutdown Clouds Economic Outlook: What Keeps Equities Buoyant? Ben Powell Explains

The ongoing US government shutdown has so far been overshadowed by the “AI megaforce,” which continues to provide huge tailwinds for equities, said Ben Powell, Chief Investment Strategist for the Middle East and Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. “It’s hard to say how long this will persist. Sometimes it lasts longer than a week,” Powell told NDTV Profit in an interaction, adding that economists are “flying blind” without the usual flow of data. “Last Friday should have been weekly initial jobless claims numbers, job reports data, nonfarm payrolls data— but we did not have any numbers. The implication is that it makes life difficult for all of us, and critically for the US Federal Reserve. The Fed no longer has access to cutting-edge data,” he said. Powell noted that the lack of updates was "not at all helpful for people trying to assess the economic outlook." The US government shut down after President Donald Trump and Congress failed to reach a funding agreement by Oct.1 deadline, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal employees facing furloughs and forcing many offices to close. During a shutdown, federal agencies cannot spend money beyond essential emergencies, meaning all “nonessential” functions are suspended until Congress restores funding. The disruption has already delayed the release of payroll data, deepening uncertainty around the economic outlook. Still, swap traders remain confident that the Federal Reserve will push ahead with another quarter-point interest rate cut in October, according to Bloomberg report. Meanwhile, the US government shutdown continued with unions representing hundreds of thousands of federal workers asking a judge to immediately block any mass firings by the Trump administration, the report further added. On the other hand, gold rose to another record — closing in on the $4,000 an ounce mark — as the US Federal government shutdown dragged on. "Rates traders are still pricing in a quarter-point cut for the end of the month, which will benefit gold further as it doesn’t pay interest," Bloomberg report added.

At a time when global investors have been cautious, India's equity market stands out as one of the most promising opportunities for investors in the coming quarters, according to Ben Powell, Chief Investment Strategist for the Middle East and Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. “India has an important part to play in portfolios going forward,” Powell said, adding that the country’s macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong despite headwinds from global trade dynamics. “It has had a few quarters buffeted by U.S. trade dynamics. Looking forward, I am optimistic about Indian equities. There seems to be a general lack of enthusiasm from global investors, and I think that presents opportunities for us as investors to pick our spots,” he said. Powell added that India's macro environment looks good while the economy is supported by low inflation and the room for the Reserve Bank of India to issue further rate cuts. "The Indian economy continues to be resilient from a macro context. Inflation is pretty low, thus giving the RBI room for rate cuts. That’s a good starting point for Indian equities to do better in the coming quarters,” he said. Powell's comments on India comes against the backdrop of the US government shutdown and an uncertain macro environment. But despite the immediate headwind linked to the US government shutdown, Powell believes the AI-driven "megaforce" will be supporting the markets. “This kind of confusion has been overwhelmed by the ongoing AI megaforce, which continues to be a huge tailwind for markets,” he said, adding that investors should also think about hard assets such as copper, given the energy demands that will come with large-scale AI and electrification trends. Powell went on to talk about portfolio diversification, adding that gold and Bitcoin, which recently touched the $125,000 mark for the first time, could be excellent hedges against ongoing volatility. “Commodities can play a part in a well-diversified portfolio,” he said. “Having a 2% exposure to Bitcoin, for example, could make sense. The same goes for Gold."

ByRob Toews, Contributor. We stand at the cusp of a massive technology paradigm shift that promises to transform human civilization. Sam Altman and Elon Musk are building rival companies to compete over what will be one of the biggest market opportunities in history. No, we are not talking about generative AI. We are not talking about OpenAI and xAI. We are talking about brain-computer interfaces. Musk’s Neuralink and Altman’s newly launched Merge Labs are among a handful of companies at the forefront of this fast-moving field. To most people, brain-computer interfaces (BCI) sound like science fiction. But this technology is getting real, quickly. BCI is nearing an inflection point in terms of real-world functionality, though most people haven’t yet realized it. Before long, these products will be ready for mainstream use and will begin to spread through society. Far-fetched though it may sound, capabilities like telepathy will soon be possible. One reason why BCI matters so much is that it will play a central role in defining how human intelligence and artificial intelligence fit together in a world with powerful AI. Now is the time to start paying serious attention to this field. Brain-computer interfaces are technologies that enable humans to interact directly with digital devices and the outside world using their minds. BCI is not one product or one technology. It is an entire discipline, encompassing various technical approaches, sensor types, capabilities and use cases. It includes both technologies that can interpret what is happening in the brain (i.e., ”read from” the brain) and technologies that can change what is happening in the brain (i.e., “write to” the brain). Products that enable you to control your computer using only your thoughts; products that send personalized electrical pulses to your brain to make you focus better or sleep better; products that can instantly translate your thoughts into written text; products that can enable blind people to see; products that can treat conditions like depression or OCD or PTSD by directly modifying your brain’s activity—these are all examples of BCI products under development today. BCI is not a new field. The first successful demonstration of a brain-computer interface in a human came in 1973, when participants in a UCLA study directly controlled a cursor on a computer screen with their minds based on EEG signals. Today, when most people think of brain-computer interfaces, they think of Neuralink, the BCI company launched by Elon Musk in 2016. Though it was not the first and is not the only BCI startup, Neuralink has played a central role in advancing this field in recent years. A fundamental divide lies at the heart of the field of BCI: invasive methods versus non-invasive methods. In order to understand this technology and its future, it is essential to understand this divide. Invasive approaches to BCI entail putting electronics inside the skull, directly in or on the brain. They require surgery. Most frequently the surgery is a craniotonomy, which involves cutting open the skull to implant a BCI in the brain. Neuralink is the most well-known example of an invasive BCI company. (The term “implantable” is sometimes used as a more neutral alternative to “invasive.”) Non-invasive approaches, on the other hand, do not require a medical procedure. They rely on sensors that sit outside the skull (say, on a headband or a hat) to collect and interpret signals from the brain. The divide between invasive and non-invasive methods boils down to a tradeoff between accessibility (how easy the technology is for people to use) and signal quality (how detailed and accurate the information exchanged between brain and computer can be). Cutting open the skull to implant a BCI in the brain is a high-risk, high-cost undertaking. It represents a major barrier to the technology’s widespread adoption. But conventional wisdom has long held that invasive methods are the only path to building the most sophisticated brain-computer interfaces, because non-invasive approaches simply cannot provide sufficiently high-fidelity information about brain activity. In recent years, innovations in hardware and in AI have begun to challenge this conventional wisdom. Higher-performing sensors are unlocking richer brain data non-invasively. More importantly, powerful new AI technologies are making it possible to extract greater signal from this data. If non-invasive methods can approach parity in performance with invasive methods, there is little doubt that they will win out, given how much easier they are to adopt. But that remains a huge “if.” No one can say with certainty where the performance ceiling will be for non-invasive methods. Many billions of dollars have been invested into both invasive and non-invasive BCI approaches in recent years. Much is at stake as this technology race unfolds over the coming years. Whether invasive or non-invasive, how exactly do brain-computer interfaces work? How is it possible for a digital computer to directly read from and write to a human brain? A quick exploration of how the brain works will sharpen our understanding of BCI technology. Like the rest of your body, your brain is made up of cells—in particular, a special kind of cell called a neuron. The human brain consists of roughly 86 billion neurons. These neurons connect to one another in complex and intertwining ways, with any given neuron connecting to as many as tens of thousands of other neurons. (Hence the term “neural network.”) In total, there are over 100 trillion connections between neurons in the human brain. Information flows through the neurons in your brain via electricity—the same force that powers kitchen appliances and lightbulbs and iPhones. This basic fact is the foundation of BCI technology. Whenever your brain does something—for instance, when you think a thought, or speak a sentence, or move your arm, or recognize a face—your neurons are sending electrical signals to one another, at massive scale, in particular patterns. At the most basic level, the information that a neuron communicates is binary: either it fires (i.e., propagates an electrical charge to its neighboring neuron) or it does not. This represents an important parallel between human brains and digital computers, which also encode information in binary form (i.e., 0 or 1). The electrical signal that comes from a single neuron firing is tiny: about a billionth of an amp and a tenth of a volt. But it is a concrete, detectable physical event in the world. And it triggers other detectable physical events in the world. For instance, because electricity and magnetism are two sides of the same underlying phenomenon—electromagnetism—when a neuron fires and generates a tiny electrical signal, it also generates a tiny magnetic field. Blood flow also increases to neurons when they fire, another physiological change whose patterns can be measured and analyzed. It is these physical events that BCI sensors detect and interpret in order to decode what is happening inside the brain. A range of different BCI sensor technologies have been developed that tackle this challenge in different ways. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Invasive BCI systems generally use sensors called electrodes—simple devices that sense electrical activity—to detect when neurons fire. Invasive systems are in direct contact with neurons, after all, so they have little need to rely on indirect indicators of neural activity. Non-invasive BCI, too, often uses sensors based on electricity, most commonly the electroencephalogram (EEG), the world’s oldest and most widely used brain sensor. But a number of other non-invasive sensor modalities have been developed more recently. These include magnetoencephalography (MEG), which detects changes in the brain’s magnetic fields, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which uses light beams to detect changes in blood flow in the brain. The best way to understand the state of the art in BCI technology today is to explore what today’s leading BCI startups are doing. Let’s start on the invasive side. In order to understand today’s invasive BCI startup landscape, the best place to start is with a brief history lesson. The first BCI technology to be implanted into a human’s brain was the “Utah array,” developed at the University of Utah in the 1980s and implanted into humans in clinical trials starting in the 1990s. The Utah array consists of a bed of 100 rigid needles measuring about one millimeter in length, each of which has an electrode at its tip. It looks like this: Implanting the Utah array entails cutting open the patient’s skull via a surgery called a crainiotomy and pushing the device into the patient’s brain. The Utah array was an important breakthrough in the development of brain-computer interfaces. It was the first technology to enable a human to control external devices like a computer or a robotic arm purely by thought. For a long time, it represented the gold standard in invasive BCI research. However, the Utah array also faces serious limitations that have precluded it from having widespread real-world clinical utility. Because it entails sticking a foreign object into brain tissue, it can activate a strong immune response, lead to scarring and inflammation, and disrupt the brain’s microbiome. The best way to understand the Utah array’s shortcomings is through an important concept in BCI technology known (vividly) as the “butcher ratio”: the ratio of the number of neurons that a BCI technology kills relative to the number of neurons that it can record from. The Utah array has a terrible butcher ratio. For every one neuron that it can stably record from, it kills hundreds or thousands of neurons (because its needles pierce through them). The first invasive BCI startups were based on the Utah array. This included Blackrock Neurotech (founded in 2008 as a spinout of the original University of Utah research) and Paradromics (founded in 2015). Despite years of effort and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, these companies have not had success in advancing their technologies into clinical trials, due largely to the shortcomings of the Utah array form factor. Last year, Tether (yes, the crypto company) acquired majority control of Blackrock Neurotech for $200 million. Another early competitor is worth mentioning—Synchron, founded in 2012 in Australia. Synchron has taken a different and quite clever approach to getting electronics into the human brain. Rather than cutting open the skull, Synchron has developed a BCI device that is inserted into a patient’s blood vessel. The device is then guided via the blood vessels to the brain, where it comes to rest in one of the major veins directly adjacent to the brain. This surgical procedure is simpler than a crainiotomy. It is very similar to the procedure used to implant coronary stents, which for decades has been one of the most common procedures in all of medicine. And it avoids sticking a foreign object into brain tissue, meaning its butcher ratio is zero. As a result, Synchron has made meaningful progress on the regulatory front. It was one of the first invasive BCI companies to receive FDA clearance to begin clinical trials. Its devices have been successfully implanted for years now in several patients with no serious adverse health effects. Synchron has raised over $100 million from leading venture capital firms including Khosla Ventures and ARCH Venture Partners. Earlier this year, the company announced high-profile partnerships with Nvidia and with Apple. But the same thing that makes Synchron’s approach safer and simpler may make it fundamentally limited. Because Synchron’s device does not directly interface with the brain’s neurons but rather sits inside a blood vessel next to the brain, the signals that it collects from the brain are less granular than other invasive methods. Synchron’s device is also meaningfully lower bandwidth than its competitors: it has only 16 electrodes (compared to, for example, Neuralink’s 1,024). And Synchron’s device can only “read from,” not “write to,” the brain. To date, the primary capability that patients with Synchron’s device have demonstrated is the ability to complete a simple click on a computer with their thoughts. While this can be a useful capability for a paralyzed patient, it is a far cry from more sophisticated BCI tasks like decoding thought into language. Synchron has plans to expand its BCI platform beyond a single 16-electrode device in a blood vessel. It remains to be seen whether the company can execute on this roadmap. This brings us to the most famous BCI company of all: Neuralink, founded in 2016 by Elon Musk, the world’s most successful (and polarizing) entrepreneur. Neuralink has aimed to fundamentally improve upon earlier BCI efforts. The company’s most important innovation compared to the BCI companies that came before has been to develop flexible threads, rather than rigid needles, to penetrate into the brain. These flexible threads are a marvel of modern engineering: each one is thinner than a human hair and contains 16 electrodes. They are less harmful than the Utah array’s needles, killing fewer neurons and causing less scarring. Other important innovations that Neuralink has pioneered include developing a neurosurgical robot to automate parts of the implantation surgery; making its BCI device fully wireless and battery-powered; and increasing the total number of electrodes on its BCI (1,024 channels for Neuralink’s current array versus 96 channels for the original Utah array and 16 channels for Synchron’s device), which enables richer information exchange between computer and brain. Like Synchron, Neuralink has progressed to clinical trials, successfully implanting its devices in 12 human patients to date. Videos of Noland Arbaugh, the first patient to receive Neuralink’s BCI, playing computer chess with his mind went viral last year, educating and inspiring the world about the potential of BCI. As with most Elon Musk companies, Neuralink has had no problem fundraising: the company has raised over $1 billion to date, most recently at a $9.7 billion valuation earlier this year. Yet ultimately, Neuralink’s approach remains within the decades-old Utah array paradigm: it involves sticking foreign objects into the patient’s brain tissue, killing some neurons in order to record from other neurons. To be clear, in many cases, it can be a worthwhile tradeoff to kill some neurons in order to unlock valuable functionality for the patient: say, enabling a paralyzed person to communicate with the outside world. The human brain entails plenty of redundancy, so it is possible to kill some neurons and still leave the patient’s brain functional. But this approach does not scale well. As more arrays are inserted into a patient’s brain in order to increase brain coverage, the number of neurons killed inevitably scales in tandem. If the goal is to scale BCI to whole-brain coverage in order to enable diverse and wide-ranging capabilities, this is a serious shortcoming of penetrating electrodes. Each Neuralink array is small, covering less than 0.1% of the brain’s total surface area. Many Neuralink arrays would therefore need to be implanted in order to cover a meaningful portion of the brain. But the butcher ratio presents a real problem for scaling the number of Neuralink arrays. For now, only single Neuralink arrays have been implanted in humans. Soon after Noland Arbaugh’s implantation surgery, 85% of the flexible threads implanted into his brain retracted out of his brain. Neuralink was able to stabilize and recover performance for Arbaugh’s BCI by reading local field potentials from his brain’s surface. Aside from fueling skepticism about the durability of Neuralink’s flexible threads, this incident raised a more fundamental question: are penetrating electrodes actually necessary in the first place? In recent years, a new generation of invasive BCI companies has emerged to explore newer technology approaches. While these companies are pursuing different research and product directions, they are united by one core insight: penetrating electrodes are inherently flawed because of the butcher ratio and will never be able to scale to whole-brain devices. Two startups in particular are worth highlighting: Precision Neuroscience and Science Corporation, both founded in 2021 by departed Neuralink cofounders. Precision Neuroscience is led by neurosurgeon Ben Rapoport. A few years after cofounding Neuralink with Elon Musk, Rapoport decided to leave the company because he concluded that penetrating electrodes were the wrong path forward for BCI. “For a medical device, safety often implies minimal invasiveness,” Rapaport said in an interview last year. “In the early days of brain-computer interfaces, there was this notion that in order to extract information-rich data from the brain, one needed to penetrate the brain with tiny little needle-like electrodes. But this method has one big drawback: it causes some amount of brain damage when they’re inserted to the brain. We realized it was possible to extract information-rich data from the brain without damaging the brain.” How does Precision’s approach work? Precision uses a BCI technology known as electrocorticography, or ECoG. Like other invasive BCI methods, it requires surgery to implant. It goes underneath the skull and makes direct contact with the brain. But rather than penetrating into the brain’s tissue, it sits directly on top of the brain. This means it does not kill neurons (butcher ratio of zero), cause scarring or trigger an immune response from the insertion of a foreign object into the brain. Precision’s current array contains 1,024 electrodes, the same number as Neuralink’s. Because of its safer, lower-risk approach, Precision has progressed rapidly in clinical trials. Its device has already been temporarily implanted in a few dozen patients. The company received FDA Breakthrough Device designation in 2023 and FDA 510(k) clearance earlier this year. The safety advantages of a BCI device that stays on the brain’s surface rather than penetrating into its tissue are easy to understand. But does it work as well as penetrating electrodes do? If ECoG avoided brain damage but could not deliver advanced BCI capabilities on par with penetrating electrodes, then it would not be a particularly compelling solution. Years of clinical research, in particular from Dr. Edward Chang’s lab at UCSF, indicate that ECoG-based BCI can in fact enable the most sophisticated BCI use cases without needing to penetrate into brain tissue. In 2021, Dr. Chang’s UCSF lab was the first in the world to show that an invasive BCI system could accurately turn a person’s thoughts into written words. In a followup study in 2023, the same UCSF research team went further, showing that its system could decode a paralyzed patient’s thoughts into words, speech and facial expressions at the same time, with an average speed of 78 words per minute. Earlier this year, moving beyond language, UCSF researchers showed that an ECoG system could enable a paralyzed patient to control a robotic arm and hand with their thoughts. All of these research breakthroughs were achieved using non-penetrating ECoG devices. These capabilities do not just match but in fact surpass anything that Neuralink or any other company has yet demonstrated publicly with penetrating electrodes. Neuralink’s focus to this point has been to enable patients to control a computer cursor with their thoughts. While computer control is an important and useful ability, it is significantly lower-dimensional and less complex of a feat than accurately decoding language. Precision expects to receive FDA approval and begin commercializing its BCI product by 2028 or 2029. The final invasive BCI startup that we will discuss, Science Corporation, is the most ambitious and mind-bending of them all. Science was founded in 2021 by Max Hodak, the polymathic cofounder and former president of Neuralink. The company has raised close to $300 million to date from investors including Khosla Ventures. Science is pursuing two main product lines. The first is an implant that goes into the retina and can restore sight to certain types of blind patients. Last year, Science completed a successful clinical trial for this technology in which blind patients regained the ability to, for instance, read books and complete crossword puzzles. The company is aiming to receive final regulatory approval and begin commercializing this product as soon as next year in Europe, with the U.S. following thereafter. Restoring sight to the blind is ambitious enough—it is literally biblical. But Science’s second product seeks to push the frontiers of brain science far further. The company is developing a biohybrid neural interface. All the other brain-computer interface technologies that we have discussed in this article are made of traditional materials like metal and plastic. Science’s biohybrid BCI, on the other hand, combines engineered hardware with living cells. How does it work? The company grows living biological neurons (originally derived from stem cells) in a lab. They embed those biological neurons into an electronic device and then implant the combined biological/electronic system on a patient’s brain. Once implanted, the engineered neurons gradually grow into and form connections with the patient’s own neurons, essentially becoming an extension of the patient’s brain. This approach eliminates the need to harmfully jab metal or plastic into a patient’s brain in order to bring electrodes and neurons next to one another. Instead, the patient’s own neurons grow toward and form natural connections with the bioengineered neurons, which themselves are already connected to electrodes. Biohybrid BCIs ingeniously leverage biology, harnessing biological neurons’ natural ability to safely integrate with brain tissue and to efficiently transmit information. No entity in the known universe, after all, is better suited to interface with the brain’s neurons than…other biological neurons. Consider how much higher-bandwidth a biohybrid BCI could be than a conventional BCI. Since neurons form many connections with one another, if a biohybrid BCI contained one million engineered neurons (which would fit in less than one cubic millimeter—quite feasible from a space perspective), that could produce one billion connections between the patient’s brain and the BCI. Compare that to the 1,024 electrodes of today’s Neuralink or Precision devices. It is important to note that this technology is still in the early stages of development. It is not yet clear that it will work in humans. Many thorny scientific and engineering challenges remain to be solved. Many years of research and development lie ahead. But, if they work, biohybrid BCIs could prove to be the safest, highest-performing and most elegant invasive BCI technology of all—the ultimate way to meld the human brain and digital technology. Stay tuned for the second part of this two-part article series, coming out in a few weeks, which will dive into non-invasive BCI technology and startups. Before we conclude, let’s zoom out and ask a basic question: how big of a deal is brain-computer interface technology? BCI is fascinating and futuristic technology, no doubt. But, relative to other cutting-edge fields like artificial intelligence or nuclear energy, how much will it ultimately matter to the world? How big of an impact will it have on humanity? The short answer: BCI will have an enormous and transformative impact on humanity. The nearest-term applications of BCI will be medical, so let’s start there. Tens of millions of people around the world today are paralyzed due to stroke, spinal cord injuries, ALS and other causes. Brain-computer interfaces could give these people their lives back, enabling them to communicate with others, move physical objects, and engage with the outside world in ways that previously would have been impossible. Beyond giving the gifts of speech and movement to the paralyzed, novel forms of BCI that can precisely modulate patients’ brain activity may offer powerful solutions for a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions: depression, alcoholism, OCD, chronic pain, insomnia, PTSD, epilepsy, Parkinson’s and more. This is not just a hypothetical possibility: recent peer-reviewed research has clearly demonstrated the potential of these next-generation, AI-based neuromodulatory approaches. The price per patient for an invasive BCI implant is expected to be on the order of $150,000 (with insurance providers expected to play a key role in covering it). This means that, in addition to its tremendous positive human impact, medical BCI represents an enormous market opportunity—up to hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States alone. But medical applications of invasive BCI are just the beginning. The technology’s most far-reaching and profound impacts will come as BCI is adopted across the broader population. Consider the following possibilities, all of which should in principle be feasible: People will be able to communicate via direct brain-to-brain telepathy, bypassing the need for language altogether. Language is, after all, a lossy and imprecise way to compress and transmit one’s higher-dimensional inner thoughts and experiences to other people. It will become possible to directly convey states of mind without using words—to transmit ideas, feelings and memories to one another instantaneously. Natural language is one of humanity’s most important inventions. It is the bedrock of human civilization. BCI could eventually render it obsolete. Going beyond one-on-one communication to group interaction, BCI technology will unlock radical new forms of collective intelligence: groups of human scientists, engineers or entrepreneurs could literally “mind meld” to tackle complex problems or produce new creations in ways that individuals never could. Humans will integrate more closely with AI than ever before. Your thoughts will be continuously augmented by an artificial intelligence connected directly to your mind. Think a question and an answer will surface in your awareness; brainstorm on a topic and you will have an infinitely knowledgeable thought partner brainstorming with you in real-time. AI systems will become a natural extension and multiplier of your own cognitive processes. Ultimately, no clear dividing line will exist between human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Imagine being able to instantly gain new skills—say, karate or scuba diving or golf—merely by “uploading” them to your brain, directly reinforcing the appropriate neural pathways. Or, imagine being able to recall and relive any memory with perfect “sensory fidelity.” Imagine, too, how entertainment and art will change. Totally immersive experiences that engage all five senses with complete fidelity will be possible, far more powerful and authentic than anything virtual reality could achieve. It will be possible to experience, in the truest sense of that word, what it feels like to visit the Taj Mahal or to be a pharaoh in ancient Egypt. Artists will be able to transmit particular emotions and states of mind to their audiences instead of creating works of art that merely hint at them. BCI should also make it possible to reprogram your brain to see or feel things that today’s human brains cannot directly sense: Wi-Fi signals, or radio waves, or the direction “true north.” Along similar lines, synesthesia (the intermingling of different senses) on demand will become possible: imagine seeing music as colors, or hearing a painting, or tasting a mathematical formula. The future will be weird and wonderful. Keep an eye out for our followup article on this topic, focused on non-invasive BCI technologies and startups, which will be published in a few weeks.

Tom Dunne has recalled the "torturous path" to starting a family, saying there were times when he "wondered was this ever going to happen". The musician-turned-radio broadcaster appears in the latest episode of the new series of Keys To My Life, the RTÉ show in which presenter Brendan Courtney meets Irish personalities who reveal how the places they've lived in have shaped their lives. In an emotional and wide-ranging episode, Dunne recalls his years fronting the acclaimed Irish band Something Happens, known for their hit singles Parachute and Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello, Hello (Petrol). Despite the band calling it quits after they were dropped from their label Virgin Records following the release of their third album, Dunne said he has only fond memories of that time. "I never take away from what we did," he said. "Being in Something Happens was the thing I felt most alive doing. It was a great experience." The mid-90s marked a decline in the band's fortunes, but 1996 proved to be a golden year for Dunne when he met his future wife, Audrey. Three years later, they moved to Blackrock and in 2002 they got married in The Plaza Hotel in New York. However, one piece of life's puzzle was still eluding the couple. Becoming emotional about their attempts to start a family together, Dunne said: "There was a torturous path to that, IVF, and there was times when you really wondered was this ever going to happen." Dunne, who shares daughters Eva and Sky with his wife, continued: "We were just getting knocked back a lot, it seemed. "It goes so easy for so many people and is so difficult for so many other people. When we became pregnant that was the greatest day ever. We stuck at it and got our reward, two very special young ladies." In 2017, Dunne received a shocking health diagnosis with the discovery of a malformed heart valve that could end his life at any moment. He recalled: "I got a phone call to go in and see the surgeon. He said I had a 70% chance of dying within the next two years. It just stops opening and then you're dead, there's no warning about it." Dunne said he had surgery to replace the damaged valve with a pig valve. "It's like a miracle," he said. "I love my life, I really do. I didn't want to change things afterwards, I just wanted to have more of it. I love music, I love my family, I love everything." When asked by Courtney if he had any big takeout from that time in his life, he said: "I certainly enjoy every moment. "I think the most searing thing was holding Sky's hand, at the time she was about eight, and she's just a beautiful girl. And I just thought, 'This is so precious'. "Life is full of those precious little moments, you're holding somebody's hand. Worth their weight in gold." Keys To My Life airs on RTÉ One and RTÉ Player at 8:30pm on Sunday, 5 October.

Title: Althera42: The New Fund Bringing the Music Royalties Model to Tech Investments

If you can invest in music royalties, why can't you also invest in "technology royalties?" That's what Althera42 wants to make possible, betting on revenue growth and scalability of technology startups without having to buy in at high valuations. Founded by Caspar Macqueen, a former BlackRock executive, and Christian Czernich, founder of the private credit firm Round2 Capital, the new fund plans to provide working capital to technology companies in Europe without taking an equity stake. Althera42 will focus on investing in intellectual property that transforms society through agentic AI, data infrastructure, defense and security, robotics and automation, software-enabled services and health and well-being. Don't Miss: "Althera42's royalty investments allow companies to access capital without diluting equity or taking on rigid debt obligations," Business Insider reported from a company factsheet released in September. According to its website, Althera42 looks to invest in founder-led and late-stage private companies that have software and proprietary technology at their core. Althera42 will build customized deals to receive a fixed percentage of the technology companies' future revenue over several years. Through the royalties model, Althera42 can combine the upside of venture capital with the consistent cash flow of private debt, Czernich told Business Insider. Fund gains will go out to investors quarterly. The fund will charge a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee. Althera42 is targeting companies with annual revenue between roughly $17 million and $117 million (€10 million and €100 million) from recurring or licensing models. Trending: Kevin O'Leary Loves ‘Wonderful Recurring Cash Flows' — These Small Industrial Assets Deliver Just That Royalty investing is the new capital paradigm in an intellectual property-based global economy, according to the company's website. In its stated mission, Althera42 wants to establish technology royalties as a new asset class. It hopes to copy the successful playbook used for tapping into the predictable revenue streams of music and pharmaceuticals. Althera42's website boasts being architects of a new capital model, "transforming recurring revenue into investable royalty streams." Czernich told Business Insider, "I do genuinely believe it will be a new asset class." See Also: Microsoft's Climate Innovation Fund Just Backed This Farmland Manager — Accredited Investors Can Join the Same Fund Althera42 believes royalty investing aligns its success with that of the company it funds. However, the firm does so by empowering companies to "retain control, by accelerating their impact with capital support that does not compromise their vision or leadership." According to Pitcher Partners, a national association of independent accounting firms in Australia, royalty investing is found across several industries: music, energy, mining, pharmaceuticals and software. Major private equity firms Blackstone and KKR entered the music industry in 2021 and 2022, deploying $500 million to $1 billion, and the energy royalties sector in North America is estimated to be worth between $500 billion and $1 trillion, according to Pitcher Partners' website. Macqueen, formerly BlackRock's head of U.K., Middle East and Africa for the alternatives business Aladdin, told Business Insider the firm plans to pull in $300 million with its first fund and complete 15 to 20 deals. Most deals would likely be in Europe and the U.K., potentially with some North American investments. Althera42 has offices in London and New York.

Title: Is JioBlackRock Flexi Cap worth a bite?

The scheme comes after a set of passive launches earlier in the year. With this fund, the asset manager enters the well-established flexi-cap category which already has 40+ options and manages nearly ₹5 lakh crore in assets. JioBlackRock fund’s distinct proposition is that it will be managed using a rules-based, technology-led approach rather than a purely discretionary style. At the core of the design is BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) framework. It combines human expertise with data-driven models and draws from a wide universe of about 750 Indian stocks, narrowed down from more than 1,000 using liquidity, turnover, and execution feasibility filters. Each stock is scored on the basis of signals (over 400 of them specific to India) covering fundamentals, market behaviour, and alternative data. The models appear to be refreshed weekly. A benchmark-aware risk process is meant to keep deviations controlled vis-a-vis Nifty 500 Total Return Index whose current top holdings include HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, RIL, Infosys, Bharti Airtel, L&T, ITC, TCS and SBI. The fund’s aim will be to deliver consistent long-term alpha while managing volatility. For perspective, flexi-cap funds as a category have a three-year monthly standard deviation of 3.7 per cent and a Sortino ratio of 0.25, according to ACEMF. The technology backbone is BlackRock’s Aladdin platform, which is widely used by global institutions for portfolio risk analytics, transaction cost modelling, and compliance. In principle, this could provide the fund managers with an advantage in managing costs and risks at scale. Another selling point is that a systematic approach can reduce behavioural biases that affect human decision-making, such as overconfidence or recency. On the investor-facing side, JioBlackRock Flexi Cap Fund has several interesting features. It has no exit load, unlike many equity funds that impose a fee for exits within a year (0.10-1 per cent). The indicative total expense ratio for the direct plan is 0.5 per cent, placing it in the 1st quartile (lowest cost group) basis direct plan offerings. Fund managers Tanvi Kacheria and Sahil Chaudhary bring experience in quantitative and index portfolio management. India’s equity market has expanded significantly in recent years, with higher trading volumes, broader sector representation, and more IPOs adding to the listed universe. A larger opportunity set makes systematic strategies easier to apply. That said, the gaps are clear. As an NFO, there is no live performance record. The back-tested numbers shown in the presentation are hypothetical and cannot substitute for real-world data. Investors should also be aware that regular rebalancing, while intended to capture opportunities quickly, could increase churn and costs if not managed tightly. Flexi-cap funds are designed to provide long-term growth by giving managers the freedom to invest across large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks without restriction. They can suit investors who want equity exposure but prefer to leave the market-cap allocation decisions to professionals. The flexi-cap space already has proven schemes with long track records. On average, existing actively managed funds in the category have delivered about 16.9 per cent CAGR over three years and 20.9 per cent over five years, broadly in line with the Nifty 500 TRI’s returns of 16.9 per cent and 20.8 per cent over the same periods. Fund portfolios are typically tilted towards large-caps (57 per cent), with decent allocations to mid-caps (20 per cent) and small-caps (17 per cent). Investors will need to weigh whether an untested quant-driven offering is worth adding alongside established names. Overall, JioBlackRock Flexi Cap Fund represents an ambitious attempt to bring systematic active investing into India’s retail mutual fund space. Its differentiators are breadth of stock coverage, use of alternative data and AI, governance filters, and lower cost. The risks are the lack of a live record and dependence on models that may behave differently in stressed conditions. Also, small bets across a large number of stocks to beat Nifty 500 may result in a very diffused portfolio. For investors seeking core flexi-cap exposure, established funds remain more reliable choices. JioBlackRock Flexi Cap may be tracked as an option for satellite allocation once it builds a live record. bl.portfolio Star Track Mutual Fund Ratings’ current preferred choices include HDFC Flexi Cap Fund, Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund, and Franklin India Flexi Cap Fund.

Title: Sea views on Dublin Bay’s south side to go if planned flood walls for Dart line are built

Plans for new flood defences along the Dart line in south Dublin will replace household sea views with concrete walls, residents have learned. They say the plan will also kill off hopes for a long-promised walking and cycling path along Dublin Bay. Irish Rail says the work is vital to protect the rail line from rising sea levels, intensifying storms and heavier rainfall, but local people are appealing for a rethink. “If this goes ahead, there will be a lot of saddened people,” Marie Baker, a Fine Gael councillor for the area said. The new defences would run for 4km from Merrion Gates to Seapoint – one of five stretches of rail line prioritised for works under the East Coast Railway Infrastructure Protection Projects scheme (ECRIPP). [ Rising sea levels, more storm surges and shifting weather patterns put properties at riskOpens in new window ] They would be built of concrete on top of the existing stone walls, adding 1.3 metres to the height on average. Some glass would be installed at stations along the route to preserve views for waiting passengers, but Irish Rail said it was not possible to use it more extensively. “Flood glass, on its own, is unable to withstand the size of wave and storm loads we expect to experience by 2075, for which we are designing these interventions,” a spokeswoman said. Ms Baker said the loss of views was no trivial issue, as the connection with the sea defined the character of the whole area. She said she had suggested installing storm drains and attenuation tanks to quickly drain and hold flood waters, and hoped this might still be considered. “I don’t think people realise the extent of what is planned. We needed better drawings from Irish Rail to show what it looks like now and what it will look like when they do what they’re planning as a comparison. “If you’re sitting on the Dart, you’re not going to see a thing. I’m not denying we need to do something, but we need to look more at this proposal.” Retired architect Michael Collins said the proposal would end hopes of completing the Sutton to Sandycove (StoS) walking and cycling path. The northern half from Sutton to the Dublin Docklands has been completed, but the southern half has not progressed. “StoS would not only provide a tremendous amenity but it would actually solve the flooding problem,” Mr Collins said. He said a continuous promenade on the seaward side of the rail line, bounded by a wall of moderate height and bolstered by rock armour, would block the waves and allow any overtopping to spill on to the path, saving the tracks and the views. [ Areas on Dublin’s northside among most at-risk from ‘extreme coastal events’Opens in new window ] He said the additional cost could be offset by savings from an Eirgrid plan to lay a high voltage cable from Blackrock to Poolbeg, by running it out into the bay and back. “Eirgrid could lay the cable under the promenade, which would cut the length in half and save an awful lot of money,” Mr Collins said. “We have a solution that works for everyone, and it’s very frustrating when agencies don’t work together for the common good.” Irish Rail said flood defences outside the existing walls were considered, but were ruled out because of the expected impact on protected habitats. Special dispensation from Europe would be needed, and this could significantly delay the project, it said. “The works proposed in these areas would not preclude a walk or cycleway seaward of the rail boundary being delivered in future by a body responsible for active travel,” it added. However, it said these too would likely need permission from Europe. ECRIPP is open for public consultation and submissions until October 13th.

Title: Stripe Unveils Stablecoin Issuance Tool With Phantom’s CASH, Expands Into AI Commerce with OpenAI

Editor Crypto Coin Desk, Krisztian Sandor With Open Issuance and AI payment standards, Stripe is doubling down on its bet on the rising role of blockchain and digital agents in payments. Payments giant Stripe unveiled a stablecoin issuance platform and AI commerce tools at its New York showcase on Tuesday, marking a push to tie its payments business to the growing role of digital dollars and artificial intelligence in online transactions. Open Issuance, underpinned by stablecoin infrastructure platform Bridge that Stripe acquired for $1.1 billion last year, enables firms to launch their own stablecoins, minting and redeeming tokens with just a few lines of code. Phantom’s CASH token, an open-loop stablecoin by the popular crypto wallet provider, will be the first to debut through Open Issuance, the firm announced. The recently-launched stablecoins of decentralized exchange Hyperliquid’s USDH and MetaMask’s mUSD will also be issued through the protocol, with more projects already in the pipeline, the firm said. “If money movement is core to your business, you should build with stablecoins. But don’t build on top of someone else’s coin,” Zach Abrams, co-founder and CEO of Bridge, said in a statement. “With Open Issuance, businesses can build on top of stablecoins that they customize and control, so that the benefits of this important technology flow directly to the people and businesses using them.” Issuers can balance reserves between Treasuries and cash, with asset management handled by BlackRock, Fidelity, Superstate and Lead Bank. Stripe’s network ensures interoperability across tokens and aims to offer lower conversion costs. The AI side of the showcase centered on the Agentic Commerce Protocol, developed with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. The offering allows merchants to transact with AI agents while keeping control over fulfillment and customer relationships, the firm said. Partners including Microsoft Copilot and Anthropic are also testing the standard. These product launches build on a series of blockchain-focused moves by Stripe. In addition to acquiring Bridge, Stripe recently bought crypto wallet provider Privy, expanding its in-house crypto infrastructure tools. The firm is also working with crypto venture firm Paradigm to develop Tempo, a payments-oriented blockchain designed to handle transactions at scale. “With the advent of stablecoins and AI, we’re at the dawn of a new online economy,” Will Gaybrick, Stripe’s president of technology and business, said in a statement, adding that the company is focusing on “pulling frontier technology out of the experimental into the mainstream.” Read more: Why Circle and Stripe (And Many Others) Are Launching Their Own Blockchains Crypto Crypto Crypto

Dear friends, Welcome to the October issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. We’re glad you’re here. And welcome to the Dog Days of Autumn! The natural world is scrambling to keep up with the changes we’ve triggered, and continue to intensify, upon it. As I walked one of the many bike/hike trails in the Quad Cities on Sunday, I confronted two worlds. One was defined by 90-degree temperatures, hot sunshine, and cracked earth. The other by the rhythm of birds called southward and plants quietening for the season to come, ready for the renewal that heralds the spring. Some plants need the signal of darkness to trigger their autumnal bloom. The mums in our south garden once attended my mum’s funeral; today, they celebrate, triggered by the lengthening night. A sort of “geez, it’s getting dark around here, I better get my butt moving” response. I wonder if we might take inspiration from them? Common milkweed, the Augustana College Quad, late September 2025 Our colleague Lynn Bolin addresses portfolio construction for uncertain times with two complementary October pieces. In “Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control,” he presents a ten-fund “all-weather” strategy targeting 8% returns with 12% maximum drawdown, emphasizing Alternative Global Macro, Alternative Multi-Strategy, and globally diversified funds. Drawing on Rob Dix’s The Price of Money and Kenneth Rogoff’s Our Dollar, Your Problem, Bolin argues that Quantitative Easing inflated asset prices, while current high valuations suggest below-average future U.S. stock returns, leading him toward funds like FPA Flexible Fixed Income (FPFIX), PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX), and BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX). His companion article, “Long-term Inflation Protection for Conservative Portfolios,” explores hedges against what Dix and Rogoff predict will be “more frequent bouts of inflation” and financial instability. While gold has soared past $3,750, Bolin seeks lower-volatility alternatives, comparing funds like AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX) and Frost Credit (FCFAX) against his target portfolio. Though Lynn is not expecting 1970s-style stagflation imminently, he’s adding fifty funds to his evaluation system for potential portfolio modifications, balancing inflation protection with his conservative risk tolerance. Stay tuned! We had an unusual wealth of fund launches to report on, resulting in two Launch Alerts and one not-quite-Launch-Alert. Tweedy, Browne International Insider + Value ETF launched on September 10, 2025. It is active, quantitative, and research-driven. It works from two assumptions, which are corroborated by a lot of evidence. You should: If the folks in the know are pouring money into stocks you’ve identified as undervalued, that’s a powerful confirmation. It has worked well with its sibling, Tweedy, Browne Insider + Value ETF, which launched in 2024, falls in the mid-cap value box, and is up 23% YTD. RACWI US ETF launched on September 11, 2025, and is Research Affiliates’ permutation of an S&P 500 index fund. Here’s the tweak: RAFI starts with the question, “Should these firms even belong in the investable universe?” They answer that question by looking at corporate fundamentals (do they make money?) and then excluding companies that are failing, without regard to their stock price. Currently, they exclude about 25 of the S&P 500 companies, but then market-cap-weight the remainder just as the S&P does. The Militia Long/Short ETF is the not-quite-a-Launch-Alert. Launch Alerts target funds launched in roughly the past 6-8 weeks, while Militia launched in January 2025. We wanted to put it on your radar because Sam Lee, former Morningstar editor and strategist, founder of SVRN Asset Management, former MFO contributor, and a remarkably smart guy, wanted to put it on ours. Finally, The Shadow reports on the industry’s latest tribulations, including T. Rowe Price’s decision to liquidate its once-promising T. Rowe Price Multi-Strategy Total Return Fund, a bunch of funds deciding they’d rather go to the ETF dance, and Dodge & Cox triggering three sets of share splits. The conversion story took a twist in early October with the SEC’s imminent announcement of a decision to permit ETF share classes of mutual funds. That means that you might be able to choose either the Fidelity Low Priced Stock fund’s no-load retail share class or the same fund’s ETF share class. According to Morningstar, at least 75 fund firms have lined up to create ETF shares of their existing funds, which might well blunt the incentive for the fund-to-ETF conversions that have proliferated in the past year or two. Geoff Colvin, senior editor-at-large at Fortune, made two useful observations in late September: His simple statement that stocks are highly valued is indisputable. Most measures are screaming that the S&P is insanely overpriced. The Shiller Cyclically Adjusted Price/Earnings ratio is the highest it has been since the dotcom peak. The price-to-sales ratio hit a new all-time high this week. The Buffett Indicator—ratio of the market’s capitalization to GDP—says stocks are highly overvalued, and Warren Buffett is holding an enormous cash cache because he can’t find bargains. But also: Greenspan gave his [Irrational Exuberance] speech in December 1996—almost four years before the market plunge. As he told Fortune years later, “If you had left the market when I gave my irrational exuberance speech, you would have missed another 80% of increase” in stock values. (Actually, it was closer to 100%.) (“Back in the ’90s a Fed chief warned about ‘irrational exuberance’ in the markets. Stocks rose 105% over the next 4 years,” Fortune, 9/30/2025) CNN notes the same anomaly: “Hiring is at a standstill. Inflation is on the rise again. Consumer sentiment is slipping near historic lows. Americans are increasingly fed up with the economy” (“Why are stocks setting records when the economy feels down in the dumps?” CNN, 9/15/2025). Satya Pradhuman, once the chief small cap strategist at Merrill Lynch and now director of research at Cirrus Research, claims that the market is already in crazy-land: “The melt-up of risk-taking in U.S. equities has pierced the upper boundaries of a normalized range. A combination of a very crowded equity market, combined with an extreme risk appetite, places the U.S. equity market into an overtly speculative chapter” (“Stock market’s relentless rally threatens to turn into a ‘melt-up’,” via Dow Jones, 9/13/2025). Quartz reports, “Wall Street’s penny aisle is back in business. More than 90 companies — including a Hong Kong noodle shop and a smattering of obscure startups — have floated IPOs this year at $5 a share, the highest number since the Regan years. Penny stocks’ comeback has less to do with solid fundamentals than it does with commission-free apps that turn speculation into a swipe, crypto-fueled investors chasing the next moonshot, and a regulatory spotlight that has wandered elsewhere. For retail traders shut out of $4 trillion tech titans and six-figure Bitcoin, penny stocks offer a cheap thrill: thousands of shares for less than the price of a single iPhone” (Quartz Daily Brief, 9/25/2025). On the day I write this (a) the federal government shut down, (b) the jobs report from ADP was disastrous, and (c) the stock market went up. The federal response has been “to boldly implement” Trump’s order to get alternative assets into retirement plans (Department of Labor News Release, 9/23/2025), while FINRA moved to relax the rules surrounding day-trading, so both retirement and non-retirement investors can treat their portfolios like a roulette wheel! Whee? The key to all of this is the willingness of the American consumer (aka “you”) to continue having confidence in Mr. Trump’s steady hand on the tiller, which leads you to continue buying more and more stuff, relying on more and more debt (currently a record $18.4 trillion) to do so. And the level of stock ownership is now at a record high; almost 45% of Americans’ net wealth rests in their stock portfolios (Federal Reserve data, 9/28/2025). So the American consumer is propping up the stock market, and the stock market is propping up the economy, and now consumer confidence is cratering. Will there be a devastating market crash? Yep. Soon? Maybe. Maybe not. What’s an investor to do? The same as always, dear friends. Act before the storm, not during it. Find an asset allocation (mine, as readers now, is 25/25/25/25) that will likely produce the returns you need to meet your goals with a level of volatility that allows you to continue enjoying life and sleeping regularly. Our recommendation has always been to look for managers who earn their keep and your trust: they have an enormous dislike of losing your money, they’re fully invested with you, they speak sensibly, and have a record of success across friendly and hostile markets. Do not ever sit at the same table with someone who preens and struts and talks about beating the market; they’re fools and potentially contagious. The goal is not to “beat the market,” it’s to live a good life and then move on. Jonathan Clements, who died this week of cancer at 62, was that rarest of financial journalists: someone the industry couldn’t buy, couldn’t charm, and couldn’t seduce into softening his message. For nearly two decades at The Wall Street Journal and later as founder of Humble Dollar, he wielded his pen like a scalpel, cutting away the jargon, the self-serving studies, and the expensive nonsense that Wall Street had convinced investors was gospel. Jonathan Clements and I corresponded once, around the launch of Humble Dollar. He was amiably cool from my perspective, which I expected and respected. I invited him to add his voice to Mutual Fund Observer when it called to him, but he had other plans and, as it turned out, far greater success. Clements’s prescription was elegant in its simplicity: eliminate human agency wherever possible, invest in broad market index funds, keep costs ruthlessly low, and refuse to believe that anyone, whether broker, advisor, or fund manager, could consistently beat the market. He had the data on his side, the integrity to say it plainly, and the courage to sustain a “nonstop blizzard of complaint and criticism” from an industry that hated what he wrote. MFO pursued a different path. I’ve argued for considering small, boutique managers whose strategies made sense and whose understanding of themselves as “risk managers” rather than “return managers” was deeply ingrained. I believe that thoughtful human judgment, properly applied and fairly compensated, can add value for investors willing to do their homework, most especially in turbulent markets. Jonathan would have seen this as precisely the kind of thinking he spent his career arguing against. And he wouldn’t have been entirely wrong to be skeptical. But here’s what mattered more than our tactical disagreement: we shared an absolute commitment to helping people achieve financial security in the face of forces designed to enrich an industry at the expense of those it claimed to serve. Clements and I arrived at different answers, but we were working on the same problem, and we were both trying to solve it honestly. That honesty was Clements’s defining characteristic. Jason Zweig noted that in over 1,000 columns, Jonathan “never once, to the best of my knowledge, wrote anything that was flagrantly wrong. He never misled or fibbed, or lied to his readers.” In an industry built on obfuscation, that record is astonishing. But what strikes me most, reading the tributes from those who knew him, is how Clements understood that money was never the point. Money was a tool for building relationships, for creating experiences with family and friends, for making a difference, and for achieving peace of mind. He wrote about raising financially responsible children. He mocked the industry’s obsession with accumulating possessions rather than celebrating meaningful experiences (which is not the same as “selfies”). And in his final year, he wrote with grace and humor about his own dying, making space for others to talk about what we’re all moving toward and helping them feel less alone. “To philosophize is to learn to die,” wrote Montaigne (with thanks to Jason Zweig for the reminder of Montaigne’s words). Jonathan Clements spent his career teaching people how to live, how to use money as a means rather than an end, how to see through the fog, how to protect themselves and their families from predation dressed up as advice. And then, at the end, he taught us how to face death with laughter and courage and generosity. The financial services industry will not mourn him. But millions of investors who achieved comfortable retirements because of his clear, consistent, principled guidance will remember him with gratitude. Those of us who disagreed with some of his investment philosophy can still honor the integrity with which he held and expressed it. In a field that rewards complexity, obfuscation, and self-interest, Jonathan Clements chose clarity, honesty, and service. The example matters more than the investment strategy. Rest in peace, Mr. Clements. You fought the good fight. After a small struggle to get their shareholders to endorse or reject a proposal to make AKREX the largest-ever fund-to-ETF conversion. A majority of shareholders finally voted in September to endorse the change. The upcoming benchmarks: October 10, 2025, the retail ARKEX shares merge with the institutional AKRIX ones October 24, AKRIX-the-fund becomes AKRE-the-ETF October 27, ARKE begins trading on the NYSE While Akre shareholders were considering, BlackRock moved to swiftly convert two funds into active ETFs: the BlackRock GA Dynamic Equity Fund and the BlackRock GA Disciplined Volatility Equity Fund. The new ETF names are iShares Dynamic Equity Active ETF (BDYN) and iShares Disciplined Volatility Equity Active ETF (BDVL). Both are managed by a Global Allocation team headed by the firm’s CIO, Rick Rieder. Both are three-star funds. Since both are part of BlackRock’s “managed portfolio” business, I suspect that the conversion was made to simplify their use for that program. Before signing off and getting back to the work you rely on, we want to take a moment to pause and express our deepest gratitude to the readers who truly keep this project alive: our incredible donors. The messages and the money you send are a profound source of encouragement, and they ensure we can keep the lights on (the server lights in this case). To our bedrock supporters, Greg, William, S & F Advisors, William, Stephen, Wilson, Brian, David, Doug, Altaf: Thank you. We are genuinely humbled by your ongoing commitment. And, to Fred, John, and David who sent donations this month: Thank you for the wonderful lift. Your gifts are an immediate vote of confidence and a powerful reminder that this community is full of people who value the work we do. I’m utterly diffident about encouraging folks to contribute to the Observer when there are so many pressing needs to address: serious, adult journalism is struggling to find readers willing to pay for reliable information, food banks are being drained at an alarming rate, conservation groups are desperately trying to compensate for the insanity that’s gripped the executive branch, and so on. Here’s our recommendation: Go do good. Don’t talk about doing it. Do it. Do something. That has two benefits: (1) it steadies you—action is the antidote to despair—and (2) it helps a beleaguered world. Support your local foodbank Pay for reliable journalism and pay for reliable local journalism Plant a tree (or a seatree) Support climate action near you Volunteer at your library Support independent local booksellers (Bookshop, an Amazon alternative, contributes directly to local bookstores with each book sold) Support a worthy cause, support a worthy candidate. Support MFO The key isn’t what you do. The key is that you do. The chrysanthemums don’t wait for perfect conditions. Neither should we. As ever, David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts).

Title: Long-term Inflation Protection for Conservative Portfolios

Gold is considered one of the best hedges against inflation and uncertainty. Gold fell from about $385 in 1995 to a low of around $250 by 2001, to a high of $1,750 in 2011 before falling to $1060 in 2015. It is now over $3,750. For the past ten years, iShares Gold Trust (IAU) has had a total return of 195% compared to 289% for Vanguard 500 Index ETF (VOO). In this article, I compare funds with lower volatility than stocks and gold to protect from inflation. Preparing for inflation should be part of an overall strategy and not just timing the market when inflation rises. Most of my career was in the precious metals industry on the technical side. It was a stable industry to be in during the financial crisis, but stressful when gold tumbled. Recently, the price of gold has increased significantly due in large part to central banks buying gold, the weaker dollar, geopolitical risk, economic uncertainty, falling interest rates, and inflation. The price of gold and stocks of gold miners have risen so fast, I don’t consider either category appropriate for my conservative, low-turnover portfolio in retirement. Tariffs are making the headlines for increasing inflation. Core inflation has risen from 2.3% in April to 2.9% in August. New tariffs were just added for heavy trucks, drugs, and kitchen cabinets. Economists in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Third Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters estimate that headline CPI inflation will begin to fall from third-quarter levels, but the rules keep changing. The Federal Reserve is now lowering short-term rates to stimulate employment at the risk of aggravating inflation. Keep in mind that inflation is the change in price levels, so the increase from tariffs will be a temporary bump in inflation to a “permanently” higher price level. In addition to tariffs, the value of the dollar has fallen by eleven percent this year. As inflation increases, the purchasing power of the dollar decreases. The falling value of the dollar raises the price of imports while making U.S. exports less expensive. The falling dollar hurts investments in U.S. held by foreigners who finance part of the national debt. The cost of buying a dollar of earnings of the S&P 500 is now $30 per dollar of earnings. It is known as the price-to-earnings ratio and has doubled since 2010. I recently read The Price of Money by Rob Dix, who suggests that we may be in for a period of higher inflation and lower interest rates. I also finished reading “Our Dollar, Your Problem” by Kenneth Rogoff, in which he expects “a sustained period of global financial volatility marked by higher average real interest rates and inflation and more frequent bouts of debt and financial crises.” The reasons have a lot to do with the burden of rising national debt and how it is financed, along with the decline of the dominance of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. I am more concerned about long-term inflation as described by Rob Dix and Kenneth Rogoff; tariffs may play a role. Mr. Dix explained that Quantitative Easing was not highly effective for raising inflation to the Federal Reserve target of 2% initially because the money went into the financial system and largely resulted in inflating asset prices such as stocks. QE was more effective following the COVID recession because it increased the money available to the Treasury to create stimulus for the consumer. Along with disruptions to the supply chain from COVID and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, inflation rose to levels not seen since the 1970s. Figure #1 captures the annual inflation rate of the personal consumption expenditures price index and the Federal Funds rate, which is the rate at which commercial banks lend to other banks overnight. The COVID bear market occurred in 2020, inflation rose dramatically in 2021, and the Federal Funds rate was raised to slow inflation in 2022. My analysis of fund performance in this article focuses to a large extent on 2021. Figure #1: Federal Funds Rate and PCE Year-Over-Year Inflation Source: Author using St. Louis Federal Reserve FRED database. Wolf Richter discusses mortgage rates being between 6% to 7% following a large increase in home prices after the COVID recession in Longer-Term Treasury Yields & Mortgage Rates Jump after Rate Cut, Yield Curve Steepens, Bond Market Gets Edgy on Wolf Street: “But that’s a bubble-pricing problem now that should have never occurred, not a rate problem. The rates are fine. They’re historically at the low end of the normal range. The 5% and below mortgage rates were a creature of massive QE during the Financial Crisis and after, when the Fed loaded up on trillions of dollars of Treasury securities and MBS to push down long-term rates. But the Fed has been doing the opposite since the second half of 2022 and has shed $2.4 trillion of those securities as QT continues.” The Federal Reserve has been gradually unwinding its balance sheet when the economy and markets are strong. I expect the long end of the yield curve to stay higher for longer because of the high national debt, specter of inflation, unwinding of Quantitative Easing, and rising geopolitical risks. Federal Reserve independence is gradually being eroded. The Federal Reserve is lowering short-term rates, and a coordinated effort by the Treasury and Federal Reserve may lower intermediate-term rates. I anticipate that short- and intermediate-term rates will be lower over the next year, but remain higher than they were from 2009 to 2021. Table #1 shows Lipper Categories that have traditionally hedged against inflation, along with those I identified by looking at the recent period of high inflation. They are sorted by a Ranking System composed of my proprietary ranking system, three-month return, return in 2021 when inflation was rising, four-year Martin Ratio for risk-adjusted return, and yield. I have added toggles to my investment system to add or tilt weights for “Tax Efficiency” for after-tax accounts, “Risk Off” for my outlook, and “Yield” if income is an objective. Table #1 is rated for a conservative, tax-advantaged account where I am seeking income. Metrics in the table are shaded red for “worst” and blue for “best”. Table #1: Categories That Did Well During High Inflation – Four-Year Metrics Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, and Morningstar returns as of Sep 26th. The Commodities Precious Metals category did not provide much protection against inflation in 2021, but has performed well since then because of rising rates, falling dollar, and uncertainty. Notice the high maximum drawdowns of Precious Metals Equity, Real Estate, and the S&P500 relative to other categories. Inflation-protected bonds are considered safe protection against inflation. The green shaded categories are the ones that I identified in this month’s companion article, “Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control”. The gold shaded categories are what I consider to be possible lower-risk hedges against inflation; however, commodities can be very volatile, as we will see later. The green shaded funds are the ones that I currently own, and the blue shaded funds are in my Conservative Target Portfolio for future investments. I like the Flexible Portfolio, Alternative Global Macro, and Alternative Multi-Strategy categories, where managers have the discretion to adjust according to market conditions. I used Mutual Fund Observer metrics and Portfolio Visualizer to select the following funds in Table #2 to be added to my watch list for inflation. As a general observation, they either have higher MFO Risk or lower MFO Rating for risk-adjusted returns compared to the funds in “Putting My Conservative Retirement Portfolio on Cruise Control”. Table #2: MFO Metrics for Selected Funds – Six Years Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. In Table #3, I substituted Frost Credit (FCFAX) and AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX) for Calvert Flexible Bond (CUBAX) and BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX) in my conservative portfolio from the companion article. This adjusted portfolio has an APR of 9.5% compared to 8.4% for the Conservative Portfolio; however, it also has a higher drawdown of -14.8% compared to -12.4% and the Ulcer Index increases from 2.2 to 2.9. The portfolio continues to have an MFO Risk of “Conservative” (MFO Risk =2). Table #3: MFO Portfolio Modified for More Inflation Protection – Six Years Source: Author using MFO Portfolio Tool. Figure #2 compares Frost Credit (FCFAX) and AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX) to BlackRock Systematic Multi-Strategy (BAMBX), Calvert Flexible Bond (CUBAX), and PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX). The funds being tested have higher returns and higher volatility than the funds in my target portfolio. Figure #2: Comparison of Total Return for Selected Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. After doing the research for this article, I added around fifty funds to my investment system, which I have not had time to evaluate thoroughly. This is a task for next month to see if I want to modify my Conservative Target Portfolio. When looking to invest in a fund, I generally start with the five funds with the highest rating per Lipper Category from my spreadsheet. In a stagflationary environment like the 1970s, I would want to own a fund that invests in commodities such as the AQR Risk-Balanced Commodities Strategy (ARCNX). I don’t expect inflation to reach that extreme in the near term. I prefer the lower volatility of PIMCO Inflation Response Multi-Asset (PZRMX). More aggressive investors and those with major concerns over tariffs may prefer ARCNX. Frost Credit (FCFAX) and Calvert Flexible Bond (CUBAX) are both good funds, with FCFAX having higher returns and yield with slightly more risk. I have rungs on my bond ladder maturing next year, and I will continually reevaluate the funds in my Conservative Target Portfolio.

The conversion of Akre Focus Fund into an ETF was authorized by its investors in September and is proceeding apace. Thanks to all who took the time to vote their shares! On October 17, abrdn International Small Cap fund and the $36m abrdn Intermediate Municipal Income fund will become the abrdn International Small Cap Active ETF and the abrdn Ultra Short Municipal Income Active ETF, respectively. The BlackRock GA Dynamic Equity fund has been converted into the iShares Dynamic Equity Active ETF, and the BlackRock GA Disciplined Volatility Equity fund has been converted into the iShares Disciplined Volatility Equity Active ETF. JPMorgan Unconstrained Debt Fund has been reorganized into the JPMorgan Flexible Debt ETF effective September 26th. Deepwater Beachfront Small Cap ETF is in registration. Joe Robillard will be the portfolio manager; expenses have not been disclosed. The ETF will primarily invest in small-cap companies. Hood River Emerging Markets Fund is in registration. Lance R. Cannon, CFA, Rohan B. Kumar, and Ruoshi Qi will be the portfolio managers. Expenses have not been stated. Sterling Capital has registered five new ETFs. Sterling Capital Ultra Short Duration; Short Duration Bond, National Municipal Bond, Multi-Strategy Income, and Equity Premium Income ETFs. Many managers, no expense ratios. The Truth Social American Energy Security ETF, Truth Social American Icons ETF, Truth Social American Next Frontiers ETF, Truth Social American Red State REITs ETF, and Truth Social American Security & Defense ETF are in registration. Matthew Tuttle will be the portfolio manager for each of the funds. Expenses have not been stated. Vanguard Core-Plus Bond Index ETF is in registration. Joshua C. Barrickman, CFA, will be the portfolio manager. Expenses have not been stated. Westwood Enhanced Income Opportunity, Enhanced Multi-Asset Income, and Enhanced Alternative Income ETFs are in registration. Numerous managers; expenses have not been stated as of this filing. Dodge and Cox is forward splitting several of its mutual funds: Balanced, International, and Stock in the amounts eight for one, four for one, and sixteen for one, respectively, at the close of business on October 24. Their reason for the stock split was the following: New mutual funds generally launch with an initial NAV of $10.00 per share. Given their earlier inception dates and asset classes, the NAVs of the Balanced Fund, International Stock Fund, and Stock Fund have grown considerably. We believe the share splits will better align these Funds’ NAVs with the other Dodge & Cox Funds’ NAVs. As of September 27, 2025, the NAV for Balanced is $110.13/share, Stock is $276.70, and International is $64.85. Leuthold Grizzly Short Fund underwent a one-for-four reverse stock split at the close of business on September 22nd, which boosted its per-share NAV from about $5 to about $20. Effective on January 21, 2026, Virtus is eliminating the Class C Shares on virtually all of its funds. Given that “C” shares are and always were a marketing malignancy (“hey, look! There’s no sales load though we do …umm, charge you 1.76% annually forever”), we always celebrate their disappearance. None that we’ve found. DoubleLine Floating Rate Fund will be reorganized into the American Beacon DoubleLine Floating Rate Income Fund once it is approved by shareholders. The reorganization will occur sometime during the first quarter of 2026. Quick history: The American Beacon FEAC Floating Rate Income Fund was previously the Sound Point Floating Rate Income Fund until it was acquired by American Beacon. First Eagle Alternative Credit, LLC’s (FEAC) investment advisory agreement ended on June 20, 2025, at which time DoubleLine Capital commenced managing the fund, and the name of the fund was changed to American Beacon DoubleLine Floating Rate Income Fund. DoubleLine Income Fund and DoubleLine Infrastructure Income Fund will change their names to DoubleLine Securitized Credit Fund and DoubleLine Select Income Fund, with predictable rewrites to their prospectuses, on October 28th. The hottest trend in prospectus writing? “The fund may terminate and liquidate at any time without shareholder approval,” a phrase now used by the AIM, Amplify, Collaborative Investments, ETF Opportunities, Innovators, Northern Lights, REX, SCM, Truth Social, and Ultimus ETF trusts, among others. Sub-text: “We’re just tossing s**t against the wall to see what sticks, we got no commitment to any of this stuff and want to be able to flush it as quickly and easily as possible! Welcome aboard!” 2x Daily Software Platform ETF will be liquidated on October 10, 2025. The fund launched on July 1, 2025, and no one, including the managers, cared. September 25, 2025, was a big day for the AXS Real Estate Income ETF! It managed to cease operations, liquidate its assets, and prepare to distribute proceeds to shareholders of record. Battleshares TSLA vs F ETF (ticker: ELON) will be liquidated on October 10, 2025, because “the Fund could not conduct its business and operations in an economically efficient manner over the long term due to the Fund’s inability to attract sufficient investment assets to maintain a competitive operating structure.” Here’s the strategy: short Ford, long Tesla, trust Elon. If the Morningstar charting is correct, it seems to have lost 50% in its first two weeks. Apparently, the fund, which launched in mid-February 2025, somehow lost faith and only drew $1.1 million in assets. Per Morningstar, neither of the managers risked their own money on the fund. BlackRock Sustainable High Yield Bond Fund is closing to new purchases on November 12, 2025, and will be liquidated on December 12, 2025. Franklin Sustainable International Equity ETF will liquidate and dissolve on or about January 16, 2026. One-star fund that was wildly successful from 2017-2021 and hasn’t been able to find its butt with both … well, it has trailed 95-100% of its peers over the past 1, 3, and 5 year periods. Harding, Loevner Chinese Equity and Emerging Markets ex China have begun the process of liquidating their assets, which the managers expect to complete by November 19, 2025. Same team, negligible assets. Johnson International Fund, which was launched in 2008, will be liquidated on November 21, 2025. A curious development, really. The fund has had the same manager since inception. He’s been very successful as the lead manager on the Johnson Opportunity Fund, but international has managed to pretty consistently trail 80-100% of its peers and has attracted negligible assets. Kempner Multi-Cap Deep Value fund will be liquidated on or about October 15, 2025. Penn Mutual AM Strategic Income Fund and Penn Mutual AM 1847 Income Fund will cease operations and liquidate on or about November 14, 2025. Themes Airlines ETF and Themes European Luxury ETF closed and liquidated on September 12, 2025. T Rowe Price Global Consumer Fund will be liquidated on November 14, 2025. T Rowe Price Multi-Strategy Total Return Fund will experience liquidation and dissolution on or about January 23, 2026. No reason given, though performance sort of sucks. It’s a Price fund whose five-year records (1.89%) barely exceed its expense ratio (1.19%). The mandate was to outperform cash with low volatility and low correlation to the stock and bond markets. The “edge” was that the managers had immediate and ongoing access to other T Rowe Price managers, which gave them exceptional insights into movements across asset classes. The system may have broken down when Price had an internal restructure, which impeded the managers’ daily strategy pipeline. The Shadow here! Like Mark, I’m a long-time member of the MFO community. I’ve started over 2300 discussion threads, most focusing on developments in the fund industry. I am a personal investor that was introduced to mutual funds when I was young to fund my college education. As I have grown older, I have expanded my mutual funds holdings to a point where I probably have too many; however, this year they all did extremely well due to the overall performance of the market. I work in the financial industry regulating the consumer finance industry in my state. My hope for the months ahead is that I might share word of developments in the finance industry – the comings and goings, launches and liquidations, the fun and the follies – with you.

Title: BlackRock’s $40 Billion Bet on a Lesser-Known Data Center Firm

(Bloomberg) -- At the start of the year, a lesser-known infrastructure company called Aligned Data Centers managed to pull off a $12 billion fundraise — more than some of the world’s leading artificial intelligence startups have been able to secure in a single round. The goal: dramatically expanding its footprint to support surging demand for the facilities that power AI systems. Nine months later, with much of that build-out still in the works, Aligned is in advanced discussions to be acquired by BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners in a $40 billion deal. It’s on pace to be one of the largest transactions of the year and potentially the biggest ever for any data center company. The takeover talks, which Bloomberg News reported late Thursday citing people familiar with the matter, are indicative of just how much money investors are willing to throw at companies viewed as integral for the AI boom. According to a Goldman Sachs report issued Thursday, AI-related companies have accounted for $141 billion in corporate credit issuance so far this year, already eclipsing the $127 billion in total debt last year. As tech companies say they’re prepared to spend hundreds of billions, if not trillions, on physical infrastructure for AI, there’s growing demand for firms like Aligned that promise to meet those needs. That’s true even if most of Aligned’s data center capacity – and the revenue expected from it – is still in the planning stages. “They have a lot of planned activity,” Ari Klein, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said about Aligned in particular. “You’re probably seeing companies paying up for that planned activity, or what could come.” Founded in 2013, nearly a decade before the generative AI boom, Aligned has long focused on providing custom data centers for businesses, with an emphasis on efficiency and sustainability. The company is backed by Macquarie Asset Management and has 78 data centers under management or in development across the Americas, according to its website. As with other data center providers, Aligned has come under new pressure to build more and bigger data centers in recent years for AI. In January, Aligned said it had raised $12 billion in equity and debt to speed up its plans to build out 5 gigawatts of data center capacity, or enough to power half of New York City on a hot day. The investment was intended to help Align “seize opportunities driven by the surging demand for AI-ready infrastructure,” said Andrew Schaap, the company’s chief executive officer, in a social media post at the time. “Aligned is ready to meet this moment.” The only challenge is that data centers — and all the infrastructure, including power supplies to support them — take time. Currently, Aligned has just over 600 megawatts of data center capacity that’s live, with another 700 megawatts of capacity under construction, according to DC Byte, a market intelligence firm that tracks the industry. Still, the combined capacity makes Aligned a “decent-sized operation,” according to DC Byte founder Edward Galvin. Coreweave Inc., a cloud provider that has struck deals with OpenAI and Nvidia Corp., has 470 megawatts of live capacity, according to public filings, with much more planned. CoreWeave reported just over $1.91 billion in revenue in 2024. And while Aligned is in talks to sell potentially for $40 billion, Coreweave has a market value of more than $65 billion. Aligned has not publicly disclosed its sales figures. If it charged about $210 per kilowatt per month, the industry standard for data center pricing according to commercial real estate services firm CBRE, Aligned’s annual revenue would be nearly $1.6 billion. That figure would rise to $3.4 billion, including the capacity under construction. Representatives for Aligned did not respond to a request for comment. By comparison, Fermi Inc., a real estate investment trust looking to draw data center tenants, saw its market value top $19 billion in its public debut this week. The company, co-founded by former US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, has no revenue – a sign of the frothy market for any business tied to the AI infrastructure boom. On its website, Aligned said its customers have included Nutanix Inc., a cloud software company, Datto, an IT provider, as well as an unnamed government agency and multinational fintech company, among others. Aligned is also developing a new data center in Texas for Lambda Inc., a cloud infrastructure company that’s backed by Nvidia. The data center is still under construction. --With assistance from Olivia Solon. More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.
