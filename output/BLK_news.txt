Trump warns of strategic risks as BlackRock seeks $22B Panama Canal ports deal. Panama Canalâs US-built legacy at stake amid Chinaâs opposition to the acquisition. BlackRockâs global port control could weaken Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative influence. Military experts highlight Panamaâs vulnerability to port blockades disrupting global trade. US-China tensions escalate as battle for critical maritime infrastructure intensifies. Panama Canalâs US-built legacy at stake amid Chinaâs opposition to the acquisition.

US-China tensions escalate as battle for critical maritime infrastructure intensifies. President Donald Trump's recent congressional address has thrust the Panama Canal into the spotlight of a new geopolitical contest. Trump highlighted BlackRock's proposed $22 billion acquisition of ports at either end of the Panama Canalâcurrently owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchisonâcalling attention to the strategic risks of foreign control over vital infrastructure. The Panama Canal remains a flagship symbol of American engineering prowess. As Trump noted, the canal was constructed at tremendous human cost with 38,000 workers losing their lives during its construction. "It was built by Americans for Americans," Trump declared, referencing the 1977 Carter administration treaty that transferred control to Panama for $1. Trump stated this agreement "has been violated very severely" and vowed, "We're taking it back." The ports at Balboa (Pacific) and CristÃ³bal (Atlantic) handle significant U.S.-China trade. Their acquisition by BlackRockâAmerica's largest asset managerâwould impact China's global port network. According to The Wall Street Journal, communication between BlackRock and the Trump administration suggests the government had advance knowledge of the deal. China's opposition Beijing's response was swift. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reportedly told CNN that China "has always firmly opposed the use of economic coercion, hegemonism and bullying." Interestingly, this comment doesn't appear in the transcript on the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. China's market regulators are now reviewing the sale under anti-monopoly pretexts. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce countered: "It's no surprise that the CCP is upset at this acquisition, which will reduce their control over the Panama Canal area. We are also glad to see U.S. investors acquire a controlling stake in the Panama Ports Company." Global strategic implications The deal extends beyond Panama's ports. The proposed CK Hutchison sale would give BlackRock operational control over 43 ports in 23 countries. Journalist Ann Vandersteel noted this would affect "199 berths across key maritime chokepoints" and significantly impact China's Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure. "This would have instantly wiped out about one-third of the PRCâs global port reach, dealing a colossal blow to Chinaâs Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure,â she specified. Military strategist Michael Yon highlighted Balboa Port's vulnerability: its narrow channel could easily be blocked, similar to the 2021 Suez Canal incident where the Ever Given container ship halted traffic for six days. Past incidents, including a 2020 ship collision that destroyed the Panama Canal railway bridge, demonstrate these risks aren't theoretical. Washington is taking a more assertive stance on shipping chokepoints. The Federal Maritime Commission recently launched investigations into global maritime chokepoints, including Panama, citing risks to supply chains and U.S. interests. The ultimate resolution may depend on Panama's patience with Beijing's delay tactics and congressional support for infrastructure investments. For many, the Panama Canal represents both historic sacrifice and current strategic interestsâa reminder that secure trade corridors remain pillars of national strength. As China attempts to block the deal, the United States faces a critical test: Can it reclaim strategic infrastructure while competing in global markets? BlackRock, with its $11.5 trillion portfolio and CEO Larry Fink's ties to Trump, represents this challenge of balancing private investment with national security concerns. The Panama port debate ultimately transcends real estateâit crystallizes a century of shifting superpower priorities and demonstrates that control of maritime chokepoints remains essential to national security in an era of global economic competition.

The ultimate resolution may depend on Panama's patience with Beijing's delay tactics and congressional support for infrastructure investments. For many, the Panama Canal represents both historic sacrifice and current strategic interestsâa reminder that secure trade corridors remain pillars of national strength. As China attempts to block the deal, the United States faces a critical test: Can it reclaim strategic infrastructure while competing in global markets? BlackRock, with its $11.5 trillion portfolio and CEO Larry Fink's ties to Trump, represents this challenge of balancing private investment with national security concerns. The Panama port debate ultimately transcends real estateâit crystallizes a century of shifting superpower priorities and demonstrates that control of maritime chokepoints remains essential to national security in an era of global economic competition.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/17/2025 9:09:19 PM PDT by bitt Nikita Casap sent a series of direct messages to an individual with a Ukrainian phone number, discussing relocating to Ukraine after carrying out the plot. The Wisconsin teen accused of killing his parents to obtain financial means to assassinate President Trump and overthrow the United States government was allegedly working with foreign entities, including someone with a Ukrainian phone number and someone in Russia, according to an FBI affidavit. He also asked his contact who would be blamed for the attack, and was told "Russia will be blamed for it, this is the goal." Nikita Casap, 17, of Wisconsin, allegedly sent a series of direct messages to an individual with a Ukrainian phone number, who writes in Cyrillic, discussing going into "hiding" before relocating to Ukraine after carrying out the plot. It's unclear if the individual he messaged is Ukrainian. Additionally, Casap sent messages to two other individuals, one of whom wrote in Cyrillic, about purchasing weapons intended to kill President Trump as well as his extensive travel plans. He also told a classmate he was in touch with a man in Russia. "He was in touch with other parties about his plan to kill the President and overthrow the government of the United States. And he paid for, at least in part, a drone and explosives to be used as a weapon of mass destruction to commit an attack," the FBI affidavit states. "The information contains directions on how to extend the range of an attack drone by using repeater drones and ways to avoid detection, such as making a drone from a kit rather than a commercial off-the-shelf brand. The instructions provide direction to use a small dropper to drop an explosive, Molotov cocktail, or very strong topical poison. Additionally, to avoid detection, the instructions advise to not bring a cell phone." In a Telegram chat from January 21, 2025, it was revealed that the goal of the operation was to blame Russia for the assasination. ...more TOPICS: KEYWORDS: assassinationplot; heroofzeeperland; nikitacasap; trump; ukraine; zeeperhero Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-34 next last 1 posted on 04/17/2025 9:09:19 PM PDT by bitt [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: bitt Wow, what a genius. 2 posted on 04/17/2025 9:10:31 PM PDT by yldstrk (Nothing like the truth) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: bitt What was his Reddit/Bluesky handle? 3 posted on 04/17/2025 9:10:44 PM PDT by RushIsMyTeddyBear ("Uncle Sugar" is being audited and having an enema.)

Mumbai: Ahmedabad-headquartered Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) said Thursday that it will buy a port terminal in Australia’s Queensland from a promoter company in a non-cash deal that values the 50-million-tonnes-per-annum (MTPA) capacity asset at an enterprise value of A$3,975 million (approximately ₹21,640 crore or $2.5 billion). The Adanis’ flagship port company will issue 143.8 million equity shares to Carmichael Rail and Port Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd, Singapore (CRPSHPL). CRPSHPL is a promoter-owned entity that ultimately owns the North Queensland Export Terminal (NQXT). The transaction will see promoter shareholding in APSEZ go up by 2.13 percentage points to 68.02%. APSEZ had first purchased the port terminal in 2011 for about ₹9,000 crore, as per news reports. However, the asset was sold to the Adani family in 2013 to manage the debt of the listed company. Also read | BlackRock buys nearly third of Adani group promoters’ $1 bn private bonds “NQXT’s acquisition is a pivotal step in our international strategy, opening new export markets and securing long-term contracts with valued users,” Ashwani Gupta, whole-time director & CEO, APSEZ, said in a press statement. The terminal is strategically located on the East-West trade corridor, he said. The company is aiming to grow the Ebitda from the asset to A$400 million (about $255 million) in four years, Gupta further said. It recorded an Ebitda of A$ 228 million in FY25. Ebitda refers to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The terminal has a rated capacity of 50 MTPA and the company estimates that the capacity can be ramped up to 120 MTPA as demand grows. In the previous fiscal year (FY25), the terminal handled 35 million metric tonnes of cargo, the company said. As part of the transaction, APSEZ will also assume other non-core assets and liabilities associated with the terminal. However, APSEZ’s leverage will remain at similar levels post the transaction, the company said. Read this | Adani Green is weighing its biggest equity sale ever NQXT is a natural deep-water, multi-user export terminal at the Port of Abbot Point, approximately 25 km north of Bowen, in North Queensland on Australia’s east coast. It is under a long-term lease from the Queensland Government till the year 2110. The terminal has a “high quality customer base” operating in the Bowen and Galilee mining basins. These mining companies export metallurgical and energy coal to over 15 countries from NQXT. APSEZ is India’s largest commercial ports operator, and accounts for almost one-fourth of the cargo movement in the country. The expansion is part of APSEZ’s stated goal of handling 1 billion tonnes per annum capacity by 2030. It handled 450 million tonnes in FY25, as per an investor presentation. The company reported consolidated revenue of ₹26,711 crore in FY24, and net profit of ₹8,104 crore, per data from the BSE. The company's shares closed 2.2% higher at ₹1,259.90 on the BSE on Thursday.

Title: Strange sell-off in the dollar raises the specter of investors losing trust in the US under Trump

Bernard Condon Associated Press Published: April 17, 2025 at 7:25 PM Updated: April 18, 2025 at 3:26 PM Bernard Condon Associated Press NEW YORK – Among the threats tariffs pose to the U.S. economy, none may be as strange as the sell-off in the dollar. Currencies rise and fall all the time because of inflation fears, central bank moves and other factors. But economists worry that the recent drop in the dollar is so dramatic that it reflects something more ominous as President Donald Trump tries to reshape global trade: a loss of confidence in the U.S. Recommended Videos The dollar's dominance in cross-border trade and as a safe haven has been nurtured by administrations of both parties for decades because it helps keep U.S. borrowing costs down and allows Washington to project power abroad — enormous advantages that could possibly disappear if faith in the U.S. was damaged. “Global trust and reliance on the dollar was built up over a half century or more," says University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen. "But it can be lost in the blink of an eye.” Since mid-January, the dollar has fallen 9% against a basket of currencies, a rare and steep decline, to its lowest level in three years. Many investors spooked by Trump don't think the dollar will be pushed quickly from its position as the world's reserve currency, instead expecting more of a slow decline. But even that is scary enough, given the benefits that would be lost. With much of world's goods exchanged in dollars, demand for the currency has stayed strong even as the U.S. has doubled federal debt in a dozen years and does other things that would normally send investors fleeing. That has allowed the U.S. government, consumers and businesses to borrow at unnaturally low rates, which has helped speed economic growth and lift standards of living. Dollar dominance also allows the U.S. to push around other countries like Venezuela, Iran and Russia by locking them out of a currency they need to buy and sell with others. Now that “exorbitant privilege," as economists call it, is suddenly at risk. Dollar drop is odd "The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded," said Deutsche Bank in a note to clients earlier this month warning of a “confidence crisis." Added a more circumspect report by Capital Economics, “It is no longer hyperbole to say that the dollar’s reserve status and broader dominant role is at least somewhat in question." Traditionally, the dollar would strengthen as tariffs sink demand for foreign products. But the dollar not only failed to strengthen this time, it fell, puzzling economists and hurting consumers. The dollar lost more than 5% against the euro and pound, and 6% against the yen since early April. As any American traveler abroad knows, you can buy more with a stronger dollar and less with a weaker one. Now the price of French wine and South Korean electronics and a host of other imports could cost more not only due to tariffs but a weaker currency, too. And any loss of safe-haven status could hit U.S. consumers in another way: Higher rates for mortgages and car financing deals as lenders demand more interest for the added risk. Federal debt troubles More worrisome is possible higher interest rates on the ballooning U.S. federal debt, which is already at a risky 120% of U.S. annual economic output. “Most countries with that debt to GDP would cause a major crisis and the only reason we get away with it is that the world needs dollars to trade with,” says Benn Steil, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ”At some point people are going to look seriously at alternatives to the dollar. ” They already have, with a little help from a U.S. economic rival. China has been striking yuan-only trading deals with Brazil for agricultural products, Russia for oil and South Korea for other goods for years. It has also been making loans in yuan to central banks desperate for cash in Argentina, Pakistan and other countries, replacing the dollar as the emergency funder of last resort. Another possible U.S. alternative in future years if their market grows: cryptocurrencies. Said BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink in his annual shareholder letter about dollar dominance, ”If deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” Not everyone is convinced that a big reason the dollar is falling is because of lost faith in the U.S. Steve Ricchiuto, an economist at Mizuho Financial, says dollar weakness reflects anticipation of higher inflation due to tariffs. But even if investors aren’t as comfortable holding dollars, he says, they really don't have much of a choice. No other currency or other asset, like yuan or bitcoin or gold, is vast enough to handle all the demand. “The U.S. will lose the reserve currency when there is someone out there to take it away," Ricchiuto says. "Right now there isn’t an alternative.” Erratic policy spooks investors Maybe so, but Trump is testing the limits. It's not just the tariffs, but the erratic way he’s rolled them out. The unpredictability makes the U.S. seem less stable, less reliable, and a less safe place for their money. There are also questions about his logic justifying the policy. Trump says U.S. tariffs will drive down trade deficits, which he cites as evidence that countries are “ripping off” America. But in calculating the tariffs, he looked at trade deficits only in goods, not services in which the U.S. excels. Most economists think trade deficits are not a sign of national weakness anyway because they do nothing to impede economic growth and prosperity. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to chip away at the independence of the Federal Reserve, raising fears that he will force interest rates lower to boost the economy even if doing so risks stoking runaway inflation. That is a sure fire way to get people to flee the dollar. After Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he would wait to make any rate moves, Trump blasted him, saying “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Economists critical of Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement recall another event, the Suez Crisis of 1956, that broke the back of the British pound. The military attack on Egypt was poorly planned and badly executed and exposed British political incompetence that sank trust in the country. The pound fell sharply, and its centuries-long position as the dominant trading and reserve currency crumbled. Berkeley’s Eichengreen says Liberation Day, as Trump called April 2, could be remembered as a similar turning point if the president isn't careful. “This is the first step down a slippery slope where international confidence in the U.S. dollar is lost."

Title: All Yellow - Frank McNally on singing Emily Dickinson, Joyce’s advanced maths, and quantum mechanics in Blackrock

The fact had somehow escaped me until an email responding to Wednesday’s column about Emily Dickinson. And I’m not sure if I wasn’t better off without the information. But as I now know, for good or bad, most if not all of Dickinson’s poems can be sung to the tune of a traditional American ballad, The Yellow Rose of Texas. For this, I’m indebted to reader Seán Lyons, who tells me he first learned it from a lecture by an American professor at Listowel Writers’ Week a few years back. A long-time admirer of Dickinson, Lyons now sees her in a completely different light: “I cannot read her poems since without mentally donning a 10-gallon hat, and heading towards the sunset, just my rifle, my pony, and me.” Sure enough, I too have suddenly taken to humming “Hope is the thing with feathers–/That perches in the soul”, in a jaunty, thigh-slapping, hoedown rhythm. “I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,/And Mourners to and fro” has also acquired a whole new personality. But it’s not just The Yellow Rose of Texas, apparently. There are many other songs you can sing Dickinson’s poems to just as well. That’s in part because she wrote in ballad (or hymnal) meter. It may also be an effect of her famous dashes, which break up the lines in a way that Ronnie Drew might have done, to pause for beneath. Whatever the reason, it makes my image of her sharing a bench on the Royal Canal with Brendan Behan seem even more plausible. I don’t know if The Yellow Rose of Texas was one of Behan’s party pieces, but in his memoir Hold Your Hour and Have Another, he mentions someone else singing it in his presence during a pub session in Co Down once. Yellow was not an apt colour that day. It was the Twelfth of July, in the overwhelmingly unionist village of Millisle. Despite being a red-roaring republican, the mischievous Behan was disappointed the old man singing did not choose “something more Orange”. Discussing Euler’s Identity, “the most beautiful equation in maths”, in Thursday’s Irish Times, Peter Lynch was nevertheless mystified as to why a recent visitor to the James Joyce Tower in Sandycove wrote the formula into the visitors’ book. I don’t know either, but perhaps the tower’s circularity inspired thoughts of Pi, one of the numbers used in the equation? Or maybe the visitor was responding to what he saw as the beauty of Joyce’s maths, especially in the construction of Finnegans Wake. I’m thinking of a study by physicists in Poland some years ago, which analysed sentence-length and other patterns in 100 works of literature. FW was the standout result. The study found that its structures mimicked “purely mathematical multifractals”. By his own estimation at the time he was writing it, Joyce was attempting to square the circle. “I am making an engine with only one wheel,” he told his benefactor Harriet Weaver. “No spokes of course. The wheel is a perfect square. You see what I’m driving at, don’t you? […] It’s a wheel ... And it’s all square.” Joyce was of course born in a square, in 1882. But even then, there were complications. The square – Brighton Square in Rathgar – was and remains, notoriously, a triangle. The same Martello tower was the venue on Wednesday for the announcement of a new, marathon Bloomsday event, the first instalment of which will take place on June 14th. No, it’s not a mere reading marathon: there are plenty of those already. This will involve athletic activity, the more enthusiastic participants in which will cover 100km. The goal is to run from Sandycove to Mullingar, a town in which the young Joyce spent a formative summer and which also features in Ulysses. Hardline athletes will leave the Martello tower at 6am on the Saturday in question. But the event is not a race, organisers insist. Nor are most of those taking part are not expected to make the full trek. Other suggested starting points include Maynooth, Enfield and Kinnegad. Even 5km sections of the route are encouraged. The main thing is to get to Mullingar around 5pm, for further fun. The Joycean connection aside, half the point is to celebrate the aforementioned Royal Canal and its Greenway. Hence the “Royal Canal Odyssey”, to give the event its full name. More details are at royalcanalodyssey.ie Getting back to advanced maths, I was briefly alarmed by the subheading on our restaurant review yesterday: “Tucked away above a main street bar, Blackrock gets its Barcelona moment.” The thought of Blackrock being tucked away in the upstairs room of a pub somewhere suggested an experiment by Flann O’Brien’s mad scientist De Selby gone wrong. He was last seen running amok in a neighbouring suburb (The Dalkey Archive, 1964). But his creator was a regular in at least one Blackrock pub, so De Selby could well have been implicated here too. Happily, as the story revealed, Blackrock has not turned into a black hole. It’s only a new restaurant that is tucked away over a bar, not that the entire suburb has collapsed in on itself. This must have been a great relief to all concerned. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Editor Activism OffGuardian Our successor to This Week in the Guardian, This Week in the New Normal is our weekly chart of the progress of autocracy, authoritarianism and economic restructuring around the world. Klaus Schwab, founder and leader of the World Economic Forum, is “beginning the process” of stepping down from his duties as chairman of the board of trustees. This “process” is apparently going to take until at least January 2027, so right there you have to wonder how real any of this is at all. But there is precedent, as this announcement follows on from his resignation as Chief Executive in 2023, a role he was succeeded in by Norwegian politician Børge Brende. Now, while an 87 year old man (allegedly) retiring is not, of itself, newsworthy it does raise interesting questions. Such as “why now?” and “who is replacing him?” As to the former, I would guess it’s because Klaus is now tainted. He is too publicly associated with Covid and the “Great Reset”. His presence immediately turns people off, his ideas are instantly suspected. It’s the same reason you don’t see Bill Gates giving as many interviews as you did during Covid. These are the faces of the New Normal agenda, and as that agenda becomes more covert than overt the people who proudly nailed their colours to its mast need to be pushed aside so the greater work can continue. That’s not to say they are being actually rejected or their ideas repudiated, of course, just that their public association is damaging. In the latter case, one early rumor suggested Tony Blair would be taking the job, but (if my reasoning can be trusted) that was never likely. Replacing Schwab with Blair to reduce bad press is like replacing your toaster with a flamethrower so you don’t burn your muffins. Other potential replacements include the other members of the board – Christine Lagarde of the ECB, Kristalina Georgieva of the IMF, Larry Fink of BlackRock, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries. But they largely have the same issue as Blair – namely, they are creepy and everyone hates them. I would suspect that a good portion of the next 18 months of “stepping down process” will be spent holding auditions for some bland-faced Trudeau-like “nice guy” type who can say all the same things Uncle Klaus used to say, without looking and sounding like a Bond villain. Tariffs and Trump and trade are taking up the headlines right now, with online censorship and Adolescence rushing to fill any gaps. Behind that, the now-familiar strains of music still play on a loop. Digital currency this, Covid that and – among other things – Bird Flu. Mexico’s Health Ministry recorded its first official human case of Bird Flu this week, according to Reuters In India, it’s being reported that a two-year-old child died of bird flu after eating raw chicken. The details are unclear, but on the face of it that story makes no sense. In England, DEFRA have ordered stricter measures be put in place in the north after more cases of H5N1 were allegedly found in wild birds. The Conversation warns that bird flu “could be on the cusp of transmitting between humans”. There’s some background noise building. Just in time for an Easter – or post-Easter – scare maybe? I’m not a monster, screams the headline, but I regret having children: And you know what, fine. Maybe regretting having children doesn’t make you a monster, but writing an article about it that your children will likely one day see, does. But that’s just taking the story at face value. The author is anonymous, the names apparently made up, so maybe the whole thing is just a piece of propaganda attacking the idea of having a family. We’re all more than used to the “free speech is hurting our kids!” argument; there’s always someone somewhere mewling out some variation. This week that someone is Ian Russell, an “online safety campaigner”, and the somewhere is BBC Newsnight: "We cannot keep waiting for change to come." Online safety campaigner Ian Russell, says there is a "rising anger" amongst bereaved families and calls for Ofcom to be "less timid".#Newsnight pic.twitter.com/W0B9jgrG6j My favourite bit is the part where he says that OfCom need to be “less timid” about enforcing an act…that only came into force 3 weeks ago. I also like how vague the term “real change” is. Just a little tip: When pundits get vague it’s for one of two reasons. Either they don’t know what they’re talking about, or they know the specifics will make them sound stupid. I’m guessing, in this instance, it’s the second one. All told a pretty hectic week for the new normal crowd, and we didn’t even mention the Colorado Bill that classify misgendering your child as “child abuse” or San Francisco’s “equity-based” speeding tickets, which charge you more (or less) depending on your income.

Title: FDA Approves Neuralink Rival’s Brain Implant
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/04/17/fda-approves-neuralink-rivals-brain-implant/

The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday cleared a core component of a brain implant made by Precision Neuroscience, a company created by a cofounder of Elon Musk’s Neuralink that claims its device could be used to assist patients with severe paralysis—a clearance that comes as biotech companies reportedly face challenges for regulatory approval under the Trump administration. Precision Neuroscience said its brain implant system could help patients with severe paralysis. Precision said Thursday the FDA cleared its Layer 7 Cortical Interface, a component of the company’s brain-computer interface implant that helps record, monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain’s surface. The FDA’s clearance allows Precision to implant Layer 7 in patients for up to 30 days and market the technology for use in clinical applications, including during procedures to map brain signals, the company said. Precision announced it will expand its clinical research program for the implant, after the company had already tested the device in 37 patients, as the FDA’s approval allows Precision to collect data over weeks instead of hours. Precision told Forbes in a statement the company expects to start selling its implant in 2026.

Precision’s Layer 7 implant is a small, yellow device thinner than a piece of hair made up of 1,024 electrodes, or a conductor that carries electrical signals. The electrodes can detect electrical activity on the brain’s surface, allowing researchers or medical practitioners to better observe which parts of the brain are in use, according to Precision. The company has marketed its implant as minimally invasive and claims the product could restore functions like speech and movement among patients with paralysis. Some clinical trials and drug tests by biotech companies have been delayed as mass layoffs impair functions at the FDA, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. One company, Daré Bioscience, told the Journal a late-stage study of a treatment for a sexual-arousal disorder in women was delayed indefinitely, as the FDA has pushed back a date when it would provide guidance on how to measure the study’s results. The FDA said in a statement to Forbes the agency is “actively working to ensure continuity of operations during the reorganization period and remains committed to ensuring critical programs and testing continue.” Benjamin Rapoport cofounded Precision Neuroscience in 2021, four years after he helped cofound Musk’s Neuralink. Precision is one competitor for Musk’s brain implant company, including Blackrock Neurotech and Synchron, a company backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Precision raised about $102 million in venture capital funding in December, bringing the company’s total funding to $155 million. Neuralink implanted a brain chip in its first human subject last year, and the company has since implanted two other patients as of January, Musk said. Musk said the company expected to implant between 20 and 30 more patients in 2025, as Musk has claimed Neuralink’s implant could bestow “cybernetic powers” on people and allow people to control robots with their mind. He has also claimed the device could help treat epilepsy and fully cure paralysis, an issue Musk said is a “tough problem, but ultimately solvable.” Some experts have criticized Neuralink for its lack of transparency, however, as some raised questions about patient safety and risks pushing back the neurotechnology industry.

Title: As demand for AI rises, so do power thirsty data centers

By Paige Gross, Stateline.org The next time you’re on a Zoom meeting or asking ChatGPT a question, picture this: The information zips instantaneously through a room of hot, humming servers, traveling hundreds, possibly thousands of miles, before it makes its way back to you in just a second or two. It can be hard to wrap your mind around, said Vijay Gadepally, a senior scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Lincoln Laboratory, but large data centers are where nearly all artificial intelligence systems and computing happens today. “Each one of these AI models has to sit on a server somewhere, and they tend to be very, very big,” he said. “So if your millions or billions of users are talking to the system simultaneously, the computing systems have to really grow and grow and grow.” As the United States works to be a global AI superpower, it’s become a home to hundreds of data centers — buildings that store and maintain the physical equipment needed to compute information. For users of the new and increasingly popular AI tools, it might seem like the changes have been all online, without a physical footprint. But the rise of AI has tangible effects — data centers and the physical infrastructure needed to run them use large amounts of energy, water and other resources, experts say. “We definitely try to think about the climate side of it with a critical eye,” said Jennifer Brandon, a science and sustainability consultant. “All of a sudden, it’s adding so much strain on the grid to some of these places.” As society traded large, desktop computers for sleek laptops, and internet infrastructure began supporting AI models and other software tools, the U.S. has built the physical infrastructure to support growing computing power. Large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) technologies — the foundation of most modern AI tools — have been used by technologists for decades, but only in the last five to seven years have they become commercialized and used by the general public, said David Acosta, cofounder and chief artificial intelligence officer of ARBOai. To train and process information, these fast-learning AI models require graphic processing units (GPUs), servers, storage, cabling and other networking equipment, all housed in data centers across the country. Computers have been storing and processing data off-site in dedicated centers for decades, but the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and the move to cloud storage demanded much more storage capacity over the last decade. As more things moved online, and computing hardware and chip technology supported faster processing, AI models became attainable to the general public, Acosta said. Current AI models use thousands of GPUs to operate, and training a single chatbot like ChatGPT uses about the same amount of energy as 100 homes over the course of a year. “And then you multiply that times the thousands of models that are being trained,” Acosta said. “It’s pretty intense.” The United States is currently home to more than 3,600 data centers, but about 80% of them are concentrated in 15 states, Data Center Map shows. The market has doubled since 2020, Forbes reported, with 21% year over year growth. For many years, nearly all of the country’s data centers were housed in Virginia, and the state is considered a global hub with nearly 70% of the world’s internet traffic flowing through its nearly 600 centers. Texas and California follow Virginia, with 336 and 307 centers, respectively. Tech companies that require large amounts of computing power, the private equity firms and banks that invest in them and other real estate or specialized firms are the primary funders of data centers. In September, BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, Microsoft and AI investment fund MGX invested $30 billion into new and expanded data centers primarily in the U.S, and said they will seek $100 billion in total investment, including debt financing. Investment in American data center infrastructure is encouraging considering the global “AI arms race,” we’re in, Acosta said. “If you own the data, you have the power,” Acosta said. “I just think we just make sure we do it ethically and as preemptive as possible.” Current estimates say data centers are responsible for about 2% of the U.S.’ energy demand, but Anthony DeOrsey, a research manager at sustainable energy research firm Cleantech group, projects data centers will be about 10% of demand by 2027. As data centers are developed in new communities across the country, residents and their state legislators see a mix of financial benefits with energy and environmental challenges. The development of data centers brings some infrastructure jobs to an area, and in busy data center communities, like Virginia’s Loudoun and Prince William counties, centers can generate millions in tax revenue, the Virginia Mercury reported. Local governments can be eager to strike deals with the tech companies or private equity firms seeking to build, but the availability and cost of power is a primary concern. New large data centers require the electricity equivalent of about 750,000 homes, a February report from sustainability consultancy firm BSI and real estate services firm CBRE. Under many state’s utilities structures, local residents can be subjected to electric price increases to meet big electric needs of data centers. Some legislators, like Georgia State Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, have sought to protect residential and commercial customers from getting hit with higher utility bills. Granville Martin, an Eastern Shore, Connecticut-based lawyer with expertise in finance and environmental regulation, said the same problem has come up in his own community. “The argument was, the locals didn’t want this data center coming in there and sucking up a bunch of the available power because their view — rightly or wrongly, and I think rightly — was well, that’s just going to raise our rates,” Martin said. Some states are exploring alternative energy sources. In Pennsylvania, Constellation Energy made a deal to restart its nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island to provide carbon-free electricity to offset Microsoft’s power usage at its nearby data centers. But climate experts have concerns about data centers outside of their power demand. “The general public is largely unaware that cooling industrial facilities, whatever they might be, is actually a really, really important aspect of their function,” Martin said. The equipment in data centers, many of which run 24/7, generate a lot of heat. To regulate temperature, most pump water through tubing surrounding the IT equipment, and use air conditioning systems to keep those structures cool. About 40% of data center’s energy consumption is used for cooling, the Cleantech group found. Some have a closed-loop system, recycling grey water through the same system, but many use fresh drinking water. The amount of water and energy used in cooling is enormous, Brandon, the sustainability consultant. said. “The current amount of AI data centers we have takes six times the amount of water as the country of Denmark,” she said. “And then we are using the same amount of energy as Japan, which is the fifth largest energy user in the world, for data centers right now.” Energy is now a material issue to running an AI company, DeOrsey said, and unrestrained, quickly evolving AI models are very expensive to train and operate. DeOrsey pointed to Chinese AI company DeepSeek, which released its attempt at a cost-conscious, energy efficient large language model, R1, in January. The company claims it trained the model on 2,000 chips, much fewer than competitors like Open AI, ChatGPT’s parent company, and Google, which use about 16,000 chips. It’s not yet clear if the model lives up to its claims of energy efficiency in use, but it’s a sign that companies are feeling the pressure to be more efficient, DeOrsey said. “I think companies like DeepSeek are an example of companies doing constrained optimization,” he said. “They’re assuming they won’t just get all the power they need, they won’t be able to get all of the chips they need, and just make do with what they have.” For Gadepally, who is also chief tech officer of AI company Radium Cloud, this selective optimization is a tool he hopes more companies begin using. His recent work at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center focused on the lab’s own data center consumption. When they realized how hot their equipment was getting, they did an audit. Gadepally said simple switches like using cheaper, less-robust AI models cut down on their energy use. Using AI models at off-peak times saved money, as did “power capping” or limiting the amount of power feeding their computer processors. The difference was nominal — you may wait a second or two more to get an answer back from a chatbot, for example. With Northeastern University, MIT built software called Clover that watches carbon intensity for peak periods and makes adjustments, like automatically using a lower-quality AI model with less computing power when energy demand is high. “We’ve been kind of pushing back on people for a long time saying, is it really worth it?” Gadepally said. “You might get a better, you know, knock-knock joke from this chatbot. But that’s now using 10 times the power than it was doing before. Is that worth it?” Gadepally and Acosta both spoke about localizing AI tools as another energy and cost saving strategy for companies and data centers. In practice, that means building tools to do exactly what you need them to do, and nothing more, and hosting them on local servers that don’t need to send their computing out potentially hundreds of miles away to the nearest data center. Health care and agricultural settings are a great example, Acosta said, where tools can be built to serve these specialized settings rather than processing their data at “bloated, over-fluffed” large data centers. Neither AI developer sees any slowdown in the demand for AI and processing capabilities of data centers. But Gadepally said environmental and energy concerns will come to a head for tech companies when they realize they could save money by saving energy, too. Whether DeepSeek finds the same success as some of its American competitors is yet to be seen, Gadepally said, but it will probably make them question their practices. “It will at least make people question before someone says, ‘I need a billion dollars to buy new infrastructure,’ or ‘I need to spend a billion dollars on computing next month,” Gadepally said. “Now they may say, ‘did you try to optimize it?’” ©2025 States Newsroom.

Title: Neuronal responses in the human primary motor cortex coincide with the subjective onset of movement intention in brain–machine interface-mediated actions

Self-initiated behavior is accompanied by the experience of intending our actions. Here, we leverage the unique opportunity to examine the full intentional chain—from intention to action to environmental effects—in a tetraplegic person outfitted with a primary motor cortex (M1) brain–machine interface (BMI) generating real hand movements via neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). This combined BMI-NMES approach allowed us to selectively manipulate each element of the intentional chain (intention, action, effect) while probing subjective experience and performing extra-cellular recordings in human M1. Behaviorally, we reveal a novel form of intentional binding: motor intentions are reflected in a perceived temporal attraction between the onset of intentions and that of actions. Neurally, we demonstrate that evoked spiking activity in M1 largely coincides in time with the onset of the experience of intention and that M1 spike counts and the onset of subjective intention may co-vary on a trial-by-trial basis. Further, population-level dynamics, as indexed by a decoder instantiating movement, reflect intention-action temporal binding. The results fill a significant knowledge gap by relating human spiking activity in M1 with the onset of subjective intention and complement prior human intracranial work examining pre-motor and parietal areas.

This same subjective experience can be elicited by direct electrical stimulation of frontal [2] and parietal areas [3], with subjects reporting the “urge to move” upon stimulation. Further, spiking activity from neurons in frontal cortical areas anticipates the subjective experience of intending actions by up to ~1.5 s [4]. These findings suggest that a frontoparietal circuit initiates movements prior to the agent being aware of this intention [5–10], fueling a long-term debate regarding the nature of free will. However, the neural mechanisms co-occurring with the subjective experience of intending actions remain unknown. The study of the subjective phenomena accompanying motor intention has largely relied on two paradigms based on time perception: the “Libet task” [5] and “Intentional Binding” [11, 12]. In the former, participants self-initiate movements and report the perceived time of their intention while neurophysiological measures are taken. Libet’s seminal observation [5] was that a slow drift of neural ensemble activity, the readiness potential [13], preceded not only the onset of voluntary actions but also the subject’s perceived timing of intention (but see [14,15] for studies questioning the interpretation of these findings and [16] for a recent review highlighting the difficulty in estimating the timing of subjective intention). In the “Intentional Binding” paradigm [11,12], participants perform a simple action leading to an effect on the environment. Then, participants report on the timing of their action or its consequent environmental effect. The seminal observation [11,12] is that voluntary actions (but not involuntary ones) lead to a compression in the perceived timing between actions and effects. Studies employing these paradigms have significantly advanced our understanding of motor intention, and have highlighted a common neural circuitry including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), supplementary motor areas (pre-SMA and SMA proper), and the posterior parietal cortex leading to self-initiated behavior [5,11,12,17–22]. However, these studies have not examined the full intentional chain; from intention to action to effect. Indeed, the voluntary actions in the “Libet Task” omit environmental effects, while “Intentional Binding” invokes intention, but does not measure it (querying action and effect, but paradoxically not intention). More vexingly, there is a dearth of cellular recordings surrounding intentional processes and examining subjective experience—which is only possible in humans. For instance, “Intentional Binding” has never been examined during invasive single-cell recordings in humans. In turn, the relative timing between the subjective experience of intention, action, and effect, and their associated neural activity remains unclear. Finally, most previous work has focused on preparatory or precursor activity in higher-order areas of the frontal motor hierarchy, yet have failed to consider the contribution of primary motor cortex (M1) in the intentional chain. Primary motor cortex is the last cortical node guiding action—what Sherrington [23] called “the final common path”—and the neural node most targeted in building and deploying invasive brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) to restore motor control. Yet, we do not know if and how M1 reflects subjective intention and its temporal binding to other elements of the full intentional chain. To bridge these gaps in knowledge, here we leveraged the unique opportunity to examine the full intentional chain in an expert intracortical M1 BMI user who is outfitted with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) leading to movements of his own, real body [24–26]. This unique setup allowed us to realize a novel intentional chain paradigm in which we systematically enable or disable each element of the intentional chain while recording neural activity in M1 and collecting subjective reports regarding the perceived timing of intentions, actions, and environmental effects. The participant was a C5/C6 tetraplegic person outfitted with a Utah microelectrode array (96 electrodes) in the hand region of M1 (Fig 1A). He is an expert BMI user [24–26] able to perform dexterous movements with his real forearm/hand given that appropriate NMES is provided based on neural decoding. To this end, prior to each session, the participant was asked to attempt two movements, right hand opening (HO) and closing (HC). From these, a non-linear support vector machine (SVM, [27]) was trained to detect and discriminate between intended movements (evoking HC when requested: 89.2%; evoking HO when requesting HC: 0%; see Methods as well as S1 Fig and its caption for additional detail). During experimental sessions (total of 12 sessions, ~35 hours total), HCs were associated with an environmental effect (i.e., it was an operant action), and the participant was asked to initiate these actions at his own urge. His intention to move was decoded via the BMI system and NMES was used to realize the action. The participant held a ball in his hand, serving as an apparent actuator causing an auditory tone 300 ms after squeezing it, i.e., an effect in the environment. In different blocks of trials, distinct elements of the intentional chain were bypassed by generating an involuntary hand movement via NMES (i.e., absence of intention), by not activating the NMES when an intention was decoded (i.e., absence of action), or by not generating the sound after HC (i.e., absence of effect). During the task, the participant viewed a rendering of a clock with a single hand that would complete a full cycle in 2,560 ms. The clock had ticks spanning from 0 to 60 (overlapping at “noon”) and marked every 5 units (see Fig 1A). After each trial (~2.5–3 s post-movement), the participant was prompted to orally report the timing of a single element of the intentional chain by indicating at which location (i.e., from 0 to 60) was the hand (i.e., red dot in Fig 1A) when he either intended the action, actually moved, or the tone was played. The participant was informed prior to each trial which element of the intention chain he would have to report on upon trial completion. The oral report was noted by a hypothesis-naïve experimenter.

This bias may stem from long-term sensorimotor recalibration due to the participant’s medical condition and/or training with BMI systems, or could be a consequence of the delay between experience and report (although see [28] for a similar effect in healthy humans, and see the Discussion for important considerations regarding the putative generalization of the effects herein reported given the participant’s condition). Importantly, the relative timing between hand movement and the following auditory cue was accurate (median of all possible permutations of differences between action to effect estimates = 257 ms; objective timing difference = 300 ms) and precise (S.E.M = 17 ms), demonstrating that the participant was able to accurately and precisely observe and report the timing of environmental events. The variance associated with repeated queries of the onset of subjective intention was ~1.5× larger (1 S.E.M = 37.2 ms) than when querying phenomena with an overt physical consequence (action, S.E.M = 21.4 ms; effect, S.E.M = 17.2 ms). Under the full intentional chain, when intentions led to actions which in turn led to environmental effects, the participant perceived intention to lead actions by 71ms, and the effects to follow actions by 314 ms (error from objective timing = 14 ms. Fig 1B, Row 1). When removing intention and instead provoking HCs at arbitrary times, actions were perceived to occur much later in time (with intention: −526 ms ± 44 ms relative to the objective time of action; without intention; −355 ms ± 18 ms, p = 9.09 × 10−5, Fig 1B, Row 2). When removing actions by transiently disabling the NMES command, and instead activating the tone at a fixed delay after the decoder reached threshold for motor execution, intention was perceived to occur much earlier in time (with action: −597 ms ± 79 ms; without action: −796 ms ± 129 ms, p = 0.02, Fig 1B, Row 3). In neither manipulation—selectively bypassing intention or action—did the estimated timing of the tone (i.e., effect) change (all p > 0.1). Lastly, eliminating environmental effects from the full intentional chain did not alter the perceived timing of intentions (p = 0.41) or actions (p = 0.07) relative to the full intentional chain (Fig 1B, Row 4). These results show a novel form of intentional binding; a compression in the subjective timing between intention and action. Whereas previous temporal binding was observed for the association between two physical events, actions, and effects [11,12], here we describe a new form of binding between a purely internal phenomena (intentions) and a physical action (see S1 Text for a partial replication of the traditional action-effect binding [11,12]). Intention-action binding could have not been revealed in previous work given that only in a participant with a disconnection between brain and end-effectors can intention and motor output be independently controlled and measured. Multi-unit activity (MUA) was aligned to movement onset, or in the case of movement-absent intentional trials, to when movement onset would have occurred given the BMI decoding. Results demonstrated robust evoked MUA in M1 during intention-only trials (peak ~5–8 Hz occurring ~338 ms prior to movement onset, Fig 2A), as well as during NMES-activated movement (peak ~20 Hz occurring ~373 ms after movement onset, Fig 2B). There was no evoked MUA response to tones (S2A Fig). These results demonstrate that intention (but not auditory tones), even in the absence of overt movement, result on average in evoked neural activity in human M1. These intention-only evoked responses precede action-related activity, and are expectedly smaller than action-related activity. Further, a direct comparison of intended versus unintended actions confirms the presence of a gradual rise in firing rate prior to action initiation when actions were intended (S3 Fig, pink and green). When actions were evoked via NMES in the absence of intention, neural activity on average rose shortly before movement onset, an effect that is due to (1) the autocorrelated nature of biological signals and the fact that M1 fires during movement and (2) the need for convolutions (i.e., akin to low-pass filter) to estimate firing rates from discrete spiking activity. Later, at the level of single units (as opposed to multi-unit activity here), we examine whether this gradual rise in firing rate is observed on single trials, and/or whether it may be better characterized as ‘steps’ in activity, as opposed to ramps (see [29–31] for a broader discussion regarding whether decisions reflect continuous ramps or binary thresholds). For now, these results show dissociable signals in M1 related to intention or action (i.e., evoked activity present in intention-only trials, different timing and magnitude for intention- and motor-evoked responses). (A) MUA evoked during intention-only trials aligned to the time of decoder crossing threshold for movement. (B) MUA evoked during movement-only trials aligned to the time of movement onset. (C) MUA evoked during intention-only trials aligned to the report of subjective onset of intention. (D) MUA evoked during movement-only trials aligned to the report of subjective motor onset. (E) Zoomed-in version (x-axis spanning −200 to 500 ms) of (C) and (D), directly contrasting MUA aligned to subjective experience during intention-only and movement-only trials (“I” and “A”, respectively). (F) MUA during intention-only trials, aligned to the subjective timing of intention (red, same as in C. and E.) and to the timing at which the SVM decoder was first able to reliably detect intentionality (“objective” timing of intention and matching on average the relative subjective delay between intention and actions, black). Shaded areas surrounding the average MUA are 1 S.E.M. The data underlying this figure can be found at https://osf.io/k8r93/.

The data underlying this figure can be found at https://osf.io/k8r93/. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003118.g002 Next, we were interested in the temporal relation between this activity and the subjectively perceived timing of events along the intentional chain—an aim solely possible when recording extra-cellular activity and simultaneously requesting a subject to explicitly report on the timing of intentions, actions, and effects. Thus, we aligned MUA to the subjective timings (i.e., reports) of intentions, actions, or environmental effects. Results showed that averaged MUA largely followed the subjective experience, with the onset of evoked responses (defined as +5 standard deviations from baseline) being evident 14 ms after the subjective timing of intention (Fig 2C) and 7 ms after the subjective timing of action (Fig 2D; see Fig 2E for a zoomed-in version directly comparing intention and action). No responses were found to the subjective timing of environmental effects (S2B Fig). We note that these are relative timings between subjective reports (of intention and action in this case) and the onset of evoked and average firing rates and are (1) just averages and not fully descriptive of individual events (see below), (2) depend on an arbitrary definition of the onset of evoked responses, and (3) are corrupted by sources of uncertainty at different scales (e.g., perception of the dot along the clock, drifts in an internal criterion for what constitutes “the experience of intention”, or Poisson variability of spiking activity, to name just a few). Thus, to ascertain a confidence interval over these temporal relationships, we repeated the above analyses while “perturbing” in time individual trial reports by a random amount (uniform distribution of increasing widths, from 10 ms to 1,000 ms in steps of 10 ms) and ask: when are evoked responses significantly degraded? Our estimate is that evoked responses (both to intention and action) remained robust for temporal perturbations of up to ~120 ms (S4 Fig). Quite uniquely, within this BMI context, we could also determine on a trial-by-trial basis an “objective” timing of intention. We operationalized the latter as the first time point within a trial wherein the BMI decoder surpassed 5 standard deviations above its noise level. Note that this criterion is more liberal than that for motor initiation, and on average precedes motor execution by ~70 ms. This matches the average subjective delay between intention and action during the full intentional chain (Fig 1B, Row 1), but on a trial-by-trial basis differs from the reported—subjective—timing of intentions. Aligning MUA during no-movement trials to both “objective” and “subjective” timing of intention showed that average evoked activity in these trials largely coincided with the subjective report of intending an action (Fig 2F, red), but not with the “objective” timing of this intention (Fig 2F, black), as indexed by the BMI-decoder. This argues that while decoders (either artificial or downstream neural areas) may have access to an anticipatory or preparatory “intention-signal” (e.g., in SMA or ACC; REF 4), the subjective experience of intention largely co-occurs (± ~120 ms) on average with the onset of robust evoked spiking activity in human M1. To examine the average temporal relationship between the subjective experience of intention and population dynamics, we projected spiking activity for all 96 channels onto their first two principal components. This accounted for 81.9% of the total variance. The contrast between conditions differing solely by the presence (versus absence) of intention showed that trajectories in a low dimensional latent space bifurcated (S5A Fig). The distance (Euclidian in 2D) between these conditions gradually grew prior to movement, peaked 300 ms post movement onset, and then precipitously dropped (S5A Fig; see S5B Fig and S5C Fig for the same analyses for trials missing either actions or environmental effects). We further investigated whether population dynamics in M1 reflect subjective experience by testing whether they discriminate between trials matched for the presence of intention, action, and environmental effects, but differing in their subjective temporal onset. The contrast between trials where motor intention was perceived relatively early versus late differed between −1,360 ms and −360 ms post-movement onset (S6A Fig, see S6B Fig and S6C Fig for the same analysis examining timing of actions and effects). Similarly, we examine if and how conditions differing by the presence or absence of a single element of the intentional chain (intention, action, effect) differed at the level of power spectra in different frequency bands of the local field potential. The presence of intention appeared to be reflected in sustained power in the delta band (0.5–4 Hz) and perhaps more intermittently (or varied across trials) in theta (4–8 Hz) and alpha (8–13 Hz) bands (S7A Fig). Indeed, while power in these lower frequency bands were present even before movement in conditions with intention, they were only induced after movement when NMES-activated actions were provoked in the absence of intention (S7A Fig, rows 1, 3, and 4 versus 3). Movement was most readily reflected by a transient increase in power in the alpha and lower beta bands (S7A Fig, rows 1, 2, and 4 versus 3). To further quantity these effects (and draw parallel to the decoding used to evoke movements, see below), we trained an SVM classifier ([27], 10-fold cross-validation) to establish the degree of separability between baseline (−2,200 ms to −2,000 ms) and induced power (from −2,000 ms to 2,000 ms post-action, in steps of 100 ms). We then compare this classification accuracy in the full intentional chain relative to conditions lacking a single element (S7B Fig, red = intention; green = action; blue = effect). Results show that conditions differing by the presence versus absence of intention are most separable in lower frequency ranges (delta, theta, alpha) with significant differences across conditions (p < 0.01) emerging as early as 1.09s (delta), 0.98s (theta), and 0.87s (alpha) prior to movement. The peak difference between conditions with and without intention occurs 290 ms and 210 ms prior to movement in the delta and theta bands, and co-occurs with movement onset in the alpha band (S7B Fig). Movement decoding (relative to baseline) is most prominent in alpha and beta bands and peaks after movement onset (~330 ms post-movement for both the alpha and beta bands). Overall, these results demonstrate an interesting dichotomy between linearly and independently averaged spiking activity (MUAs) and population dynamics (PCA or LFP, which by definition incorporate covariance information). While the former largely co-occurs with the subjective onset of intention (Fig 2), the latter (1) index intention up to ~1 s prior to movement, and (2) show strongest correlates of intention within a ~200–300 ms window surrounding movement onset. Importantly, even in low frequencies of the LFP domain (i.e., the slowest evolving dynamics), intention is not evident in M1 as early as it may be detected in ACC, SMA, and pre-SMA ([4], ~1.5 ms prior to movement). Next, we questioned whether well-defined single neurons may track the subjective timing of intentions and actions on a trial-by-trial basis. In a first approximation, we restrict this analysis to the first day of recording to assure that single units would not be included in duplicates (i.e., across sessions). Thus, here we examined 66 well-isolated units (examples shown in Fig 3A). (A) Example units—raster plots and PSTH. Top: The raster plots show every trial as a row and each black dot is a spike.

The data underlying this figure can be found at https://osf.io/k8r93/. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003118.g003 We performed a spike count during the 11,000 ms-period preceding actions. Eight neurons (12% out of 66) showed a significant correlation between their spike counts within this period and the reported perceived timing of intentions (all p < 0.05 see Fig 3B, first and second column). All eight neurons are shown in S8 Fig. We note that Fried and colleagues [4] report ~17% of neurons responding to intention (as opposed to co-varying in time with intention here) in frontal areas, and ~8% in temporal regions [4]. Surprisingly, only a single neuron in the present study showed a correlation between its spike counts during this period and the subjective timing of actions (Fig 3B, third column, r = −0.62, p = 0.01). We did not observe any neuron whose spike count correlated with the perceived timing of environmental effects (see S9 Fig for similar results across different time periods and including neurons recorded in all sessions, not solely the first one). Together, these results suggest that a fraction of single units in M1 may predict the onset of the experience of intention. We also examined if, when, and how rapidly single unit firing rates on individual trials indexed an upcoming “urge to move” (recall, the report of this timing occurs seconds later, at the end of trials). To do so, we fit a logistic function (Eq 1) of the form, to individual trial firing rates as they approach the reported intention-time (see [4] for a similar approach). and are respectively asymptotic firing rates during baseline and at the onset of the subjective experience of intention. and are parameters dictating (1) the location (i.e., time) of the central point of the sigmoidal curve describing firing rates, and (2) the steepness of this function (inversely proportional to ). In other words, dictates when firing rates change with respect to the onset of subjective intention, and dictates how quickly this firing rate changes (e.g., from “ramp-like” for a large to “step-like” for small , see [29–31]). All four parameters were fit to individual units and trials, and we retained 177 trials with > 0.5 (see S10A Fig for example individual trials and average responses from 4 units). On average, these units increased in firing rate 108ms prior to the experience of intention (; see S10B Fig for the full distribution), or approximately 700–800ms after a similar effect occurs in SMA, pre-SMA, and ACC [4]. Similarly, the change in firing rates in M1 are more “step-like” (i.e., smaller ) than what is observed in frontal areas (mean = 23 in M1, and mean = 54 in [4], see S10B Fig for the full distributions). Lastly, we look at the impact of each of the elements of the intentional chain on the behavior of real-time BMI neural decoding. First, we contrasted the decoder time-course during the full intentional chain to conditions missing a single element of the sequence. Fig 4A shows that when actions were intended, there was a gradual rise toward the movement initiation threshold. Inducing a non-intended movement through NMES also affected the BMI classifier, but through a delayed and more abrupt rise toward threshold. These two conditions (i.e., intended versus not) strongly bifurcated 1,100 ms prior to movement (p < 0.01; time of actions at 0 ms), a timing that comfortably precedes the median timing of perceiving intentions during the full intentional chain (−597 ms ± 79 ms relative to A-time). When intention did not lead to action, the decoder rose to threshold normally, but plummeted earlier (p < 0.01, 100 ms post-movement onset, Fig 4B). Lastly, during the condition lacking environmental effects, the decoder was sustained for a longer period (Fig 4C, p < 0.01, 500 post-movement onset). These results suggest that the decoder, and thus population dynamics, (1) can index intention to move and (2) that it is sensitive to all aspects of the intentional chain. (A) Effect of intention. Contrast of the decoder time-course during the full intentional chain (“IAE”, black) and a chain without intention (“AE”, red) suggests that intention causes an early and gradual rise toward the movement threshold (y = 0). Shaded vertical area enclosed by dashed lines is the median ± 95%CI of the subjective timing of intentions (“I-time”). AU refers to “arbitrary units”, given that the decoder output was normalized between −1 and 1, with the movement threshold being zero-crossing. (B) Effect of action. Contrast of the decoder time-course during the full intentional chain (black) and a chain without action (green) suggests that the decoder output decreases shortly after crossing movement threshold when no motor output occurs. Shaded vertical area enclosed by dashed lines is the median ± 95%CI of action reports. (C) Effect of tone. Contrast of the decoder time-course during the full intentional chain (black) and a chain without a consequence to movement (blue) suggests that the absence of tone results in a sustained heightened decoder output. Shaded vertical area enclosed by dashed lines is the median ± 95%CI of environmental effects reports. Shaded area around the decoder output is ± 1 S.E.M. All trials are shown in transparent in the background. (D) Decoder performance and perceived time of intention. Trials where the area under the decoder curve (AUC) was high (yellow, meaning the decoder was performed well) resulted in the perceived timing of intention to occur later (closer to action) in contrast to trials with a low AUC (orange). (E) Decoder performance and perceived time of actions. Trials where the AUC was high (yellow) resulted in the perceived timing of actions to occur earlier (closer to intention) in contrast to trials with a low AUC (orange).

The data underlying this figure can be found at https://osf.io/k8r93/. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003118.g004 Next, we questioned whether performance of the decoder may reflect intention-action binding (see Fig 1). As a measure of decoder performance, we used the area under the curve (AUC) of the decoder, as this measure collapses performance over time, and thus reduces the total number of potential comparisons (e.g., decoder performance at each time point versus behavior). This curve is also normalized between −1 and 1 (Fig 4A–4C), hence controlling for potential spurious effects that could be caused by variations in raw decoder performance across sessions and days. We coalesced all trials of a particular judgment type (i.e., reports on intention, action, or environmental effect). Then, we computed the AUC of the decoder for each trial and kept the top (high; yellow) and bottom (low; orange) third of trials defined by AUC. Examining the participant’s reports—sorted by AUC of the decoder and independently from behavior—showed that in trials with high AUC (yellow), intention was perceived as occurring later than on trials with low AUC (orange, Fig 2D, p = 3.77 × 10−4). Applying the same approach to judgments regarding the timing of actions, we found the opposite pattern: actions were perceived as occurring earlier (Fig 2E, p = 0.01) in high (yellow) versus low (orange) AUC trials. In other words, on trials where the BMI decoder more reliably evoked the intended movement (i.e., HC, higher AUC), there was mutual attractive pull between intentions and actions. The perceived timing of effects was not modulated by AUC of the decoder (Fig 2F, p = 0.22, see S1 Text and S11 Fig for a further control). Together, these results suggest that M1 population dynamics, as indexed by the multivariate decoder the participant uses to move, reflects intention-action temporal binding. In turn, the behavioral results (Fig 1B) argued that actions within a full intentional chain result in a perceived temporal binding between intentions and actions. We leveraged the unique opportunity to selectively bypass intentions, actions, or the corollary consequences of these actions in a tetraplegic person fitted with an intracortical M1 implant and NMES leading to movements of his own body. This allowed us to index for the first time the perceived temporal binding between all elements of the intentional chain while simultaneously performing extra-cellular recordings in a human. Further, it allowed us to fill a critical gap in knowledge: while prior seminal work indexed the temporal relation between the onset of intention and spiking activity in pre-motor [4] or parietal regions, the temporal relation between M1 spiking activity and the subjective onset of intention remained unknown. Behavioral results demonstrated a novel form of intentional binding, not between actions and effects [11,12], but between intentions and actions. The time distortions caused by intention-action binding are stronger than those engendered by action-effect binding, which likely reflects long-term and permanent associations between intending and performing an action, in contrast to the more sporadic association between actions and a specific auditory consequence (see S1 Text). Importantly, it must also be noted that this intention-action binding may be amplified in the current participant by virtue of the BMI-based control of actions. Hence, it will be important to confirm these behavioral results in neurotypical subjects employing non-invasive BMIs. Neurally, results demonstrate that unit and population-level dynamics in M1 index the presence of intention. Further, spiking activity largely co-occur (on average, with an acknowledged degree of uncertainty) with the onset of the subjective experience of intention, and spike counts of subset of the population may co-vary with the onset of the subjective experience of intention on a trial-by-trial basis. Population dynamics (which by definition index a large ensemble of units and may also be detected by non-invasive methods) show a looser temporal association between neural activity and the subjective onset of intention. That M1 reflects intention is implied by earlier work [24–26] demonstrating the ability to detect motor intention in this area. It is also perhaps not surprising, given that M1 is the final central nervous system node in the motor pathway [23]. In contrast, the determination of the temporal relationship between the onset of intention and evoked activity in M1 is a novel and important one, particularly in the context of prior work. Namely, Fried and colleagues [4] showed that neurons in the pre-SMA, SMA, and ACC all anticipate the subjective timing of intention by about 700–1,500 ms. Here, we close a critical gap in knowledge by recording from M1, an area downstream from those previously probed in humans. We show that evoked multi-unit spiking activity in M1 on average largely co-occurs with (± ~120 ms) and does not precede (as in pre-SMA, SMA, and ACC) the experience of intention. The fact that there are direct synaptic connections between pre-SMA/SMA and M1, and yet their relation to the onset of subjective intention differs by ~700–1,500 ms implies that the subjective experience of intention may be mechanistically engendered by a relatively slow accumulation process. Indeed, in this line, it has recently been shown that a fraction of neurons across the entire brain accumulate evidence toward a decision/action on a relatively slow temporal scale and that this accumulation occurs in a “movement-null” subspace [32]. Then, almost instantaneously this neural activity is projected onto a “movement-potent” subspace, enacting movement [32] (also see [33,34]). Putatively, may explain why we may accumulate evidence without causing movement, why there is a fairly large delay between intention-related signals in pre-SMA/SMA/ACC and M1, and why the temporal relation between the onset of subjective experience and neural activity in M1 may differ between evoked MUAs (i.e., perhaps a movement-potent subspace) and higher-dimensional population dynamics (i.e., perhaps a movement-null subspace). The speculation is that the experience of intention may co-occur with a re-formatting of neural activity in M1; from a movement-null to a movement-potent subspace. This speculation is in line with our findings suggesting that while (multivariate) signals related to intention may be present (i.e., are decodable, Fig 4) in M1 and elsewhere [9,24–26,35–41] well before the onset of the subjective experience of intention, this latter one largely coincides with evoked MUA activity in M1. This observation, along with our emphasis on relating neural activity with the subjective onset of intentionality, breaks with the dominant effort to ascribe intention at ever-earlier stages of the cortical action hierarchy [42–45]. We do not claim that intention does not originate at earlier nodes—it undoubtedly does—nor we claim that M1 is the necessary and sufficient area for intention. We simply note that the subjective experience of intending an action seemingly largely co-occurs with evoked activity in M1, while it tends to follow neural activity in other pre-motor and parietal areas. In the present study, we could not record from other important sites for intention, such as anterior cingulate, supplementary motor areas, pre-motor, or parietal cortex, as electrodes placement is dictated by clinical and not experimental purposes. Multisite implants or integration of results from multiple patients with electrodes in other sites may contribute to gather a more comprehensive view. It must also be explicitly stated that our findings are correlational in nature. In future experiments, it will be interesting to attempt direct, causal perturbations approaches (such as stimulation, as in [2,3]). These perturbation approaches will likely be most informative with concurrent recordings, such that we may estimate if perturbations are “on-manifold”, or orthogonal to subspaces that eventually lead to movement. Likewise, we must also explicitly acknowledge the temporal uncertainty that exists with reporting the onset of any subjective experience, and in particular the experience of “an urge to move” [16]. Lastly, we must emphasize that the observations we report herein are from a single tetraplegic patient and a skilled BMI user who may have experienced a large degree of neuroplasticity, learning, and sensorimotor adaptations. That these important biological mechanisms are likely at play in the current patient is highlighted by the fact that he shows a large bias in the temporal perception of his actions. However, we must also note that in the current setting, a large delay between “objective” and “subjective” estimates of elements within the intentional chain may have aided in establishing neural correlates of the subjective experience of intention. Indeed, intention is typically too tightly linked to the true onsets of motor actions, thus challenging the parsing of motor intention from motor acts in normal conditions. For now, we must emphasize that it will be critical for future work—including work employing more causal manipulations—to ratify (or not) the current observations, and highlight that there is prior work (albeit of more indirect nature, such as employing scalp electroencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation, or work in patients with widespread lesions) both supporting [46] and questioning [47,48] the role of M1 in motor intentions. We must also highlight a recent report [49] demonstrating the generalizability of findings from the current patient to a wider healthy population undergoing scalp EEG. In conclusion, we show a novel form of temporal binding between the perceived time of intentions and actions and demonstrate that M1 evoked activity (i.e., a linear operation) largely coincides in time (± ~120 ms) with the onset of the subjective experience of intention, may predict trial-to-trial fluctuations in this onset, and reflects perceived intention-action binding. Instead, population dynamics in M1 show a looser association with the subjective onset of intention, preceding the subjective experience by 200–300 ms, but not 700–1,500 ms, as in ACC, pre-SMA, and SMA [4]. Together, these results close a critical gap in our knowledge describing the temporal relationship between neural activity in M1 and the onset of intention. Approval for this study was obtained from the US Food and Drug Administration (Investigational Device Exemption) and The Ohio State University Medical Center Institutional Review Board (2013H0164). The study met institutional requirements for the conduct of human subjects and was registered on the http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov website (identifier NCT01997125). The participant referenced in this work completed an oral and written informed consent process before taking part in the study. He also provided written permission for photographs and video. This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The participant was a 27-year-old male with stable, non-spastic C5/C6 quadriplegia from a cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) sustained 8 years prior to the current experiment. The participant’s International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI neurologic level is C5 (motor complete) with a zone of partial preservation to C6 [50]. He is an expert BMI user, with over 5 years of usage [24]. The subject has full range of motion in bilateral shoulders, full bilateral elbow flexion, a twitch of wrist extension, and no motor function below the level of C6. His sensory level is C5 on the right (due to altered but present light touch on his thumb) and C6 on the left. He has intact proprioception in the right upper limb and the shoulder for internal rotation through external rotation, at the forearm for pronation through supination, and at the wrist for flexion through extension. Proprioception for right digit flexion through extension at the metacarpal-phalangeal joints was impaired for all digits. The patient underwent a left frontoparietal craniotomy for implantation of a Utah microelectrode array (Blackrock Microsystems Inc, Salt Lake City, Utah) in the (dominant) hand region of primary motor cortex. This region was identified via pre-operative functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging where the patient was asked to imagine performing hand movements (Fig 1). The area was targeted via an intraoperative navigation system (see [24] for details). The array contained 96 channels (4.4 mm × 4.2 mm × 1.5 mm in depth) and was implanted into the cortex using a pneumatic inserter. Reference wires were placed subdurally. Neural data were sampled at 30 kHz and hardware band-pass filtered between 0.3 Hz and 7.5kHz (3rd order Butterworth). Once digitized, the data were transmitted to a central computer running MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA), where signal artifacts due to NMES were removed by blanking over 3.5 ms around the artifact (defined as signal amplitude >500 μV simultaneously in at least 4 of 12 randomly selected channels). A non-linear SVM was used to translate neural activity to intended hand movements. The inputs to the SVM were mean wavelet power (MWP) over 100 ms bins. That is, neural activity was decomposed into 11 wavelet scales (Daubechies wavelet, MATLAB), and the coefficient of wavelets 3–6, corresponding to the multi-unit frequency band spanning from 235 to 3.75 kHz, were then normalized and averaged within 100 ms bins resulting in 96 values, one for each channel. The processed features (i.e., mean wavelet values) were then used as input to a support vector machine algorithm that used sparsity optimization to improve decoder accuracy by zeroing out the least valuable MWP features. Training data for the decoder were obtained by prompting the participant at the beginning of each recording session to imagine performing one of two specific hand movement; HO or HC using an animated virtual hand displayed on a computer monitor. The subject performed seven blocks of classifier training (five repetitions per hand movement type) prior to starting the main experiments (S1 Fig). Training took approximately 10 min per session. Two decoders were built (HO versus rest and HC versus rest), and output classes were computed for each movement that had scores ranging from −1 to 1 (arbitrary units). A score of −1 indicated that the classifier estimated the subject to be at rest, a score of 1 indicated that the classifier estimated the participant to perform an action (see [24–26] for additional detail). During experimental sessions, only HC were used (i.e., operant movement resulting in a consequence in the environment), but two movements were trained during decoding to assure detection and discrimination of intention. The appropriate NMES (see below) became active when the output score for a given movement crossed zero (threshold crossing). A NMES system was used to evoke hand movement by stimulating forearm muscles. The NMES system consisted of a multi-channel stimulator and a flexible, 130-electrode, circumferential forearm sleeve. The coated copper electrodes were 12 mm in diameter, spaced at regular intervals in an array (22 mm longitudinally × 15 mm transversely), and delivered current in monophasic, rectangular pulses at 50 Hz (pulse width 500 μs, amplitude 0–20 mA). Desired hand movements were calibrated at the beginning of each session by determining/confirming the intensity and pattern of electrodes required to stimulate intended movements. This procedure took approximately 5–10 min per session. From a baseline rest position the subject was asked to perform two movements, right HO and HC. Hand closing resulted in an auditory tone being played 300 ms after movement onset (or the decoder surpassing movement threshold, see above). The analyses in the current report focus on HC trials, as these were associated with consequences in the external environment (i.e., the tone), and thus had all components of a full intentional chain. While performing these movements, the subject observed the rendering of a clock with a single hand that would complete a full cycle in 2,560 ms [5]. The initial position of the clock hand was random on each trial. Over the course of 12 separate sessions (~2–4 hours/session, including setup) the participant completed five different experiments, containing variations where he reported either the time of intention onset, the time of action onset, or the time of sound onset. In the first experiment, on different blocks, we randomly activated the NMES resulting in HC, or we presented the tone at a random time without NMES (50 repetitions per condition). This experiment was a baseline experiment to assess the subject’s temporal perception of movement and auditory stimuli in the absence of any causal structure (i.e., no intention to move, nor a movement causing the effect in the external environment). The second experiment was the “full intentional chain” where intention resulted in movement, and a particular movement (HC, but not HO) resulted in a tone being played. On different trials, the subject reported the timing either of his intention, movement onset, or tone onset (50 repetitions per condition). The third experiment broke the expectation that HC results in an external consequence, and on different trials the subject was asked to report the timing of his intention to move or actual movement (50 repetitions per condition). In the fourth experiment, the subject was instructed not to imagine moving, and instead at a random time, we activated the NMES resulting in HC. Thus, in this experiment there was movement and an effect to this movement, but no intention. On different trials, the participant indicated either movement or tone onset (50 repetitions per condition). Lastly, and quite uniquely given the experimental setup (BMI coupled with NMES), in the fifth experiment, the subject intended to move, and this resulted in the decoder crossing the threshold that would ultimately evoke a consequence, the tone, but no movement. On different trials, we asked the subject to report either when he first intended to move, or the time of sound onset (50 repetitions per condition). Report type (intention, action, effect) was varied in “mini-runs” of 5 trials, and a full experiment was not run in 1 session, but instead experiments were intermixed between sessions. Behavioral estimates of each judgment type (intention, action, effect) and different combinations of elements of the intentional chain (Fig 1B, different rows) were coalesced and their circular median was computed. Targeted non-parametric statistics were conducted, as reported in the main text. Regarding single-unit spiking activity, data files were concatenated across an entire session, filtered with a 300 Hz–30 kHz bandpass filter, and spike sorted via WaveClust [50] in MATLAB. Clusters were then manually inspected for waveform shape and violation of the inter-spike interval. Spikes were binned in 1ms intervals and then spike counts were performed. Correlations with the subjective timing of intention, actions, and effects were computed by Pearson correlation. For firing rate plots in Fig 3A, binned spikes were convolved with a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 50 ms. Only units from the first session were kept for the main analyses in main text, to avoid observing units in duplicate. Multi-unit spiking activity from all 96 recording channels was separated as a function of judgment type and the different combinations of the intentional chain. Spikes were then convolved with a Gaussian distribution (50 ms standard deviation). We summarized this activity by averaging each channel across trials. The onset of evoked MUA was defined as the signal being five times the noise level (standard deviation). To account for spiking activity of the population of neurons as a whole, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the average firing rate for each condition. We kept the two components that explained the most variance. For statistical analyses, we re-sampled trials (with replacement) 1,000 times, before conducting PCA, and determined the 95% confidence intervals. Power within different frequency bands of the local field potential was determined by wavelet decomposition, and further quantitative analyses of evoked power relative to baseline were computed by SVM (10-fold cross-validated). Lastly, regarding the neural decoder analyses, the outputs of the decoder were amalgamated as a function of judgment type and different combinations of the intentional chain. Statistical contrasts as specified in the main text were conducted via time-resolved unpaired t-tests corrected for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni). Evoking hand closure (HC) via M1 decoder. The BMI user was asked to perform HC movements in a self-paced manner, but only during specific intervals (each internal being ~11 s long). These intervals are marked by the red curve being equal to 1. The decoder output spanned between −1 and 1, and would cause movement via NMES upon zero-crossing. Trials were performed in short blocks of five trials, and the figure shows five example blocks of five trials. Decoder output is represented in black. As indicated in the main text, during the course of the entire experiment (12 sessions of ~3–4 hours/session), the user was able to produce HC on 89.2% of requests. On no occasion (0%) was a second action, hand-opening, produced when requesting a HC. However, on occasions, there would be an HC (caused by decoder zero-crossing) without such an explicit request. To estimate the frequency of this occurrence in analyses, we randomly shifted the periods in which a given HC was requested, and estimated how frequently HC occurred during these surrogates. They occurred on 8.1% of surrogate “trials.” Of note, we cannot ascertain whether the participant self-initiated the intention for HC during these periods, even though it was not explicitly requested.

In this manner, we ask: by how much can we perturb/move reported timings without degrading the evoked response to the subjective timing of intention/action. For statistical contrasts, we conclude a response has been degraded once at least 10 time points are different from the original at p < 0.01. Acknowledgedly, this is an arbitrary threshold. This statistical threshold is met once timings are perturbed within a ~120 ms window (i.e., −120 ms to +120 ms) surrounding the reported timings of intention and action.

(B) Difference in SVM decodability (induced power versus baseline) as a function of whether intention (red), action (green), or effect (blue) was missing from the full intentional chain.

The absence of action is most evident in alpha and beta bands, is more transient in nature, and occurs post-movement.

Results demonstrate a clear over-representation of neurons correlating with the subjective timing of intentions rather than actions or effects. This effect is sustained from ~−2,000 ms to 0 ms post-movement onset. After the movement, no estimate (intention, action, or effect) more frequently correlated with single-unit spiking activity.

Top: their average response (black) and logistic fit (red) of this response, as we approach the timing of the reported “urge to move.” Below each average response, example trials from each of the units. These show two broad classes. The first two columns show examples where the averaging of variable timing “step-like” behavior on individual trials results in an average “ramp-like” behavior. The second two example units (columns 3 and 4) show examples where a robust response only exists in a subset of trials (second row), also yielding an average “ramp-like” behavior. (B) The average response of single units (top, black, n = 34) and individual trials from these units (bottom, red, n = 177) were fit to sigmoidal functions (units and trials are kept if r2 > 0.5). The histograms show the full distributions of estimated t0 values (left) indicating when the step occurs (relative to the reported time of the subjective experience of intention), and alpha parameters (right), which is inversely proportional to how “step-like” the sigmoidal functions are.

Stellar, a superfast and low fee-public blockchain, says it plans to hold $3 billion in real-world asset (RWA) value and power $110 billion in RWA volume by the end of 2025. The goal set by the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), the nonprofit that supports the development and growth of the Stellar network, is building on existing partnerships with the likes of Franklin Templeton and Wisdom Tree. In addition, Stellar is welcoming a new round of tokenization specialists such as Paxos, Ondo, Etherfuse and SG Forge, the blockchain innovation division of French bank Société Générale. “We have a goal of powering $3 billion in real-world asset value on Stellar in 2025,” Lauren Thorbjornsen, VP and chief of staff at Stellar Development Foundation, said in an interview. “That would be more than a 10x increase from the $290 million in RWA we had in Stellar at the end of December 2024. But already we see a lot of growth happening on the network, just in the first quarter of this year.” Tokenizing a range of existing financial assets has become all the rage among traditional finance firms over the past year or so, with major companies including BlackRock entering the space. Stellar, established in 2014 by former Ripple CTO Jed McCaleb, is designed to facilitate fast and low-cost cross-border transactions between any pair of currencies or assets.

Title: Wall Street caught between a rock and a hard place as tensions between US and China rise

CSGR Research Fellow, University of Warwick Johannes Petry receives funding from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the German Research Foundation (DFG). University of Warwick provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK. View all partners The trade war between China and the US has spiralled into unchartered territory. On April 10, the Trump administration imposed a tariff of 125% on all Chinese imports. China called the actions unfair and responded with similar measures. Within the broader debate around unravelling economic ties between the US and China, where economic interdependence has increasingly been viewed as a threat to US national security, this escalation raises questions about whether global finance is also reducing its presence in China. After all, the risks of financial connectivity with China have been discussed prominently by US policymakers in recent years. And many financial analysts have spent much of the past year discussing whether China has become “uninvestable” due to rising geopolitical tensions. However, as I show in a recently published study, most global financial firms have continued to expand their presence in Chinese markets over the last decade, even as tensions have intensified. Crucially, they have done so on China’s terms, operating within a system that prioritises government oversight and policy goals over liberal market norms. This pragmatic accommodation is quietly reshaping the global financial order. China’s capital markets, which have historically been sealed off from the rest of the world, have been opening up in recent decades. This has prompted global financial firms to expand their footprint in China. Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have taken full ownership of local joint ventures. And asset managers like BlackRock or Invesco have established fund management operations on the Chinese mainland. Yet China has not liberalised in the way many in the west expected. Rather than conforming to global norms of open, lightly regulated markets, China’s financial system remains largely guided by the state. Markets there operate within a framework shaped by the policy priorities of the central government, capital controls remain in place, and foreign firms are expected to play by a different set of rules than they would in New York or London. Foreign investors have been allowed to buy into mainland markets, but through infrastructure that limits capital outflows and preserves regulatory oversight. Rather than adapting China to the global financial order, Wall Street has accommodated China’s distinct model. The motivation behind this is clear: China is simply too big to ignore. Take China’s pension system as an example. Whereas pension assets in the US amount to 136.2% of GDP in 2019, in China these only amounted to 1.6%. The growth potential in this market is enormous, representing a trillion-dollar opportunity for global firms. Consequently, index providers such as MSCI, FTSE Russell, and S&P Dow Jones – key gatekeepers of global investment – have included Chinese stocks and bonds in major benchmark indices. These decisions, taken between 2017 and 2020, effectively declared Chinese markets “investment grade” for institutional investors around the world. This has helped legitimise China’s market model within the architecture of global finance. In recent years, Washington has sought to curtail US financial exposure to China through a growing set of measures. These include investment restrictions, entity blacklists, and forced delisting for Chinese firms on US stock exchanges. Such actions signal a broader effort to use finance as a tool of strategic leverage. The moves have had some effect. Some US institutional investors and pension funds have declared China “uninvestable”, and are reducing their exposure. American investments in China have roughly halved since their US$1.4 trillion (£1.1 trillion) peak in 2020. But attributing this solely to geopolitical pressure overlooks another key factor: China’s underwhelming market performance. A protracted property crisis, a government crackdown on tech companies, and a weak post-pandemic economic recovery have made Chinese markets less attractive to investors in purely financial terms. More strategically oriented investors from Asia, Europe and the Middle East have invested more into Chinese markets, filling gaps left by US investors. Sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East, especially, have engaged in more long-term investments as part of broader efforts to strengthen economic cooperation with China. And at the same time, many western financial firms have doubled down on their presence in China, expanding their onshore footprint. Since 2020, institutions like JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and BlackRock have opened new offices, increased their staff, acquired new licences and bought out their joint venture partners to operate independently as investment banks, asset managers or futures brokers. It has become more difficult to invest foreign capital in China. But western financial firms are positioning themselves to tap into China’s huge domestic capital pools and capture its long-term growth opportunities – even as they tread carefully around geopolitical sensitivities. It is too early to predict the long-term effects of the current geopolitical tensions. But Wall Street is trying to placate both sides. On the one hand, it is adapting to capital markets with Chinese characteristics. And on the other, it is trying not to antagonise an increasingly interventionist America. However, while holding its breath amid further escalation and having scaled back some of its activities, Wall Street has not left China. It is instead learning how to work within the constraints of a system shaped by a different set of priorities. This does not necessarily signal a new global consensus. But it does suggest that the liberal financial order, once defined by Anglo-American norms, is becoming more pluralistic. China’s rise is showing that alternative models – where the state retains a strong hand in markets – can coexist with, and even shape, global finance. As tensions between the US and China continue to rise, financial firms are learning to navigate a world in which existing relationships between states and markets are being reconfigured. This process may well define the future of global finance. Write an article and join a growing community of more than 202,100 academics and researchers from 5,173 institutions.

Title: Why XRP Could Beat Dogecoin, Solana In ETF Race And Trigger A Price Surge

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP remains one of the most popular coins in the market, with a cult-like community that has supported it for years. With the bullish sentiment surrounding it, the altcoin has performed quite well and continues to inspire support. The most recent developments for XRP have been the ETF filings that suggest it might be the next altcoin to get an SEC nod after Ethereum. The number of filings also puts it well ahead of investor favorites such as Solana and Dogecoin in the running for the next ETF approval. XRP ETF filings have been coming out of the market over the past year, especially with the approvals of Ethereum Spot ETFs. These ETFs are expected to give institutional investors an official vehicle to get proper exposure to the market. As Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have been done and dusted, issuers have looked to other large cap altcoins to bring into the market. The next favorites on the list have been XRP, in addition to heavy hitters such as Solana, Dogecoin, and Litecoin. However, in the race, XRP has clearly differentiated itself in terms of interest, boasting twice as many filings as any other altcoin. According to data from Kaito Research, there are currently 10 XRP ETF filings pending approval or rejection from the SEC. In contrast, there are five Solana ETF filings, 3 Litecoin filing, and 3 Dogecoin filings. This shows clearly that interest in XRP as the next altcoin to gain ETF approval is the highest. Additionally, the SEC has acknowledged the XRP ETF filings from industry leaders such as Grayscale. There are also filings from ProShares, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, 21Shares, among others. However, BlackRock has not made a move to file for an XRP ETF despite leading the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF campaigns. Nevertheless, the filings for XRP ETFs remain a big deal for the altcoinm and their approval could trigger another wave of price hikes. For many, the major hindrance to an SEC approval of an XRP ETF was the ongoing battle between the crypto firm and the regulator, which began in 2020. However, in March 2025, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the case was officially over. With this development, expectations that the regulator will look favorably upon an XRP ETF are high. If the ETFs are approved, even with a fraction of the Bitcoin ETF volumes, the XRP price is expected to explode in response, with some analysts predicting that the altcoin’s price could rise to the double-digits.

InfoQ Homepage Presentations LLM and Generative AI for Sensitive Data - Navigating Security, Responsibility, and Pitfalls in Highly Regulated Industries Stefania Chaplin and Azhir Mahmood explain how to navigate the complexities of AI in highly regulated industries. They discuss MLOps pipelines, data security, evolving legislation (GDPR, EU AI Act), and the critical frameworks for responsible, secure, and explainable AI. Learn practical prevention techniques, XAI methods, and future trends in AI for cybersecurity and beyond. Stefania Chaplin is Founder & CEO @DevStefOps, Previously Solutions Architect @GitLab, AWS Certified Security - Speciality. Azhir Mahmood is Research Scientist @PhysicsX. Software is changing the world. QCon London empowers software development by facilitating the spread of knowledge and innovation in the developer community. A practitioner-driven conference, QCon is designed for technical team leads, architects, engineering directors, and project managers who influence innovation in their teams. Chaplin: Who here is responsible for AI initiatives within their organization? That might be a decision maker, influence, involved somehow? Who is already doing stuff? Has it involved executing, implementing, looking good. Who's a little bit earlier? Maybe you still have some loopholes, you're still designing, discovery, thinking about. We'll try and tailor the talk accordingly. I am Stefania Chaplin. I am a Solutions Architect at GitLab, where I work with enterprise organizations, predominantly in security, DevSecOps, but also in MLOps as well. Mahmood: I'm Azhir Mahmood. I'm an AI Research Scientist at PhysicsX. Prior to that, I was a doctoral candidate at UCL developing cutting edge machine learning models. Prior to that, I was in the heavily regulated industry developing my own AI startup. Chaplin: If you want to follow along with what we get up to, our website is latestgenai.com, where we publish a newsletter with the latest and greatest of everything happening, always from a secure, responsible, ethical, explainable, transparent perspective. Mahmood: GenAI is revolutionizing the world. It's doing everything, from hurricane prediction, where NVIDIA were able to forecast Hurricane Lee a week in advance. The team at Isomorphic Labs were able to use AI to predict protein structures. Actually recently, the first ever AI designed drug was developed by the Hong Kong startup, Insilico. It's currently going through FDA trials. At PhysicsX, we use AI for industrial design and optimization, really accelerating the speed at which we can invent new things, but understanding how AI is really transforming the world of engineering and science. How is it changing the world of business? Allen & Overy, they introduced ChatGPT 4 to 3000 of their lawyers. Since then, with Microsoft, they developed contract matrix and are using it for drafting, reviewing, and analyzing legal documents. They've now launched it to their clients. At McKinsey, Lilli is able to condense all of McKinsey's knowledge, about 100,000 documents, and allow it to be called within mere moments. That's really reduced the amount of time associates are spending preparing for client meetings by about 20%. It's really unlocking a whole new area of creativity for them. Bain & Company, within their recent M&A report, they found about 50% of M&A companies are leveraging AI, especially within the early stages. They're doing everything from sourcing, screening, and due diligence. Now, having seen how AI can really revolutionize your business? Chaplin: What are highly regulated industries and types of sensitive data? These are industries that have government regulations, compliance. They have standards and laws, and these are in place for consumer protection, public safety, fair competition, and also environmental conservation. Some examples of the industries. Who here is in finance? Medical or pharmaceutical? Defense, government, and utilities? Anything I didn't say, anyone missing? I think I've got everyone covered. In terms of types of sensitive data, and the important thing when it comes to machine learning and AI, you are only as good as your data, so if you have bad data, how are you going to train your models? Especially when it comes to sensitive data, there are many types, and you're going to have to treat them differently. For example, maybe you need to start obfuscating or blanking out credit card details. You need to think about your data storage, how you're going to store it. Also, types, so things like PII, name, email, mobile, biometrics, religion, government, ideologies, sexual orientation. There's a lot of different types of PII out there. From an organizational perspective for business, a lot of companies, especially larger ones, highly regulated, are listed. Any information that could influence the stock price will be counted as sensitive data, because if that is leaked or used nefariously, it will have issues. Within health, hopefully you will have come across the HIPAA regulation, which is one of the stricter ones out there in terms of medical records and what to do. Also, high risk. I work with a lot of defense organizations in my experience at GitLab, and it's very much, we have a low-risk data, medium, classified. We have our diodes for getting the data around. If you're going to be using sensitive data as part of your machine learning models, you really need to pay attention to making sure it's safe, secure, and robust. The legislation landscape, and this has been evolving over the last five, six years. I'm starting off with GDPR. GDPR, if you were working in a customer facing role, it was everything everyone could talk about around 2016, 2017. What are we going to do, personal data? How are we storing it? Is it transferring to our U.S. headquarters? It was one of the first legislations that focused on data. Like I said, good data, good models, good AI. In 2021 we had the AU AI Act proposal. If you're watching this space, you may have noticed this just got passed into law 2024. This was very much around different risk classifications, so low risk, critical risk. It's the first time we're really talking about transparency in legislation. 2023, we had a few things happening. The first one was in D.C. We had the Stop Discrimination Algorithmic Act. Which then evolved to become Algorithmic Accountability Act, which was federal, so across the whole U.S., because what usually starts in D.C. spreads across the U.S, and the world. With this one, it was very much, we need to understand what AI we're using, and what are the implications, and what is happening? You see less of the, "It's a black box. You just put in someone's name, and it tells you if it's alone." No, we really need the transparency and accountability. UK, they've taken a bit of a different approach, where it's very much about the principles. For example, transparency, explainability, responsibility. We'll be talking about these a bit later. Having fairness, having a safe, secure model. It was very much more focused for innovation and how we use AI. The final one, United Nations, so this one's been very interesting. This one was talking about human rights. It was saying, we need to make sure, for one, cease using any AI which infringes on human rights. Also, quotes from the session included, we need to govern AI, not let AI govern us. If you see the way the legislation has evolved from just personal data, transparency, explainability, it's now become a global human rights issue. What you can see, here we have the map of the world and the vast majority of North and South America, Europe, Asia-Pac, there are legislations either being talked about, being passed. You probably are from one of these countries. It's also worth noting, where does your company do business? Because a bit like GDPR wasn't in America, but if you're an American business doing business with EU, you're affected. It's good to keep on top of what the latest and greatest are. I mentioned our newsletter at the beginning. How to AI? What is MLOps? If I was going to ask you, what is an MLOps pipeline? How do you do AI? Who could give me a good answer? I have a little flow, a little bit like a Monopoly board, because you just keep going around. Starting off in the top left and walking around, this is where it's the data. For example, what is your data source? Is there sensitive data? How are you ingesting that data? Like, we want to look at our financial records, our sales records for this product, or we want to predict customer churn, so we're going to look at our customer records. That's great. How are you ingesting or storing that data? Especially with sensitive data, you really need to think securely how you do this. What's your data? It's ready, validate, clean it. What are you going to do if there's null data? What are you going to do if your data's been manually entered and there are mistakes? How are you going to standardize and curate it? This is majority the data engineer. What this is meant to show, this flow, is that you have a lot of different people a bit like DevSecOps, really, who are overlapping and getting this done. Now the data is done, then we get our data scientist and ML engineer, so we think about our features. What are we looking at for features, for our ML? Then we have our model. This comes back, should be the final thing on this is our business user, what problems are we solving? Is it regression? Is it classification? Is it anomaly detection? Random Cut Forest is great for that. Once you have your model, train it, validate, evaluate. Ok, we have it ready. We've got our data. We've got our machine learning. Now let's do it at scale, so containerize, deploy, make it servable to applications. Then all starts again, because once you've got it working once, great, time to keep updating, keep retraining your models. You can see there are a couple of different users involved in this. Really, when I think of MLOps, you have data, which I've spoken about quite a bit. You have your machine learning, something Azhir is very good at. If you only focus on those two, you get back into the problem of, it worked on my machine, which is something that a lot of people have heard from a long time ago in the DevOps world. This is why you need to bring along the best practices from software engineering. Having pipelines, pipelines that can standardize, they can automate, they can drive efficiency. You can add security scanning, pipelines as codes, so that you can do your continuous integration and continuous deployment, so CD4ML. It's really this overlap, because if you have one data source, one model and one machine, ok great, you're doing AI. This is very much about how you do enterprise at scale, making sure that is accessible. What happens when things go wrong? These are mainly news stories from the last six months, and they cover a few things, so bias, hallucination, and going rogue. We had DPD, January 18th, and a lot of organizations are using a chatbot as part of customer service. Unfortunately for DPD, their chatbot started swearing at the customer and then telling the customer how terrible DPD is as a company. Not ideal, not the type of behavior you're trying to generate. Bias is a really important area, especially maybe 10 years ago. I got one of my favorite birthday presents I received at the time, a book, "Weapons of Math Destruction." This is very much talking about the black box. It's by Cathy O'Neil. It's great and it's ok. How do we stop bias, if it's trained on specific datasets? For example, with image detection, UK passport office exhibited bias based on the color of people's skin. Hallucinations, I say, a more recent problem. This is a real problem for a few reasons. A few weeks ago, you had AI hallucinating software dependencies. I'm a developer, and I'm like, yes, PyTorture, that sounds legit. Let me just add that. If I take my developer hat off, I put my hacker hat on, ChatGPT is telling me about a component that doesn't exist, I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to create that component, and I'm going to put malware in it. Then everyone who uses ChatGPT for development and uses PyTorture, they will be infected. It's not just dependencies, we can see there was hallucinating a fake embezzlement claim. What was interesting about this, this was the first case of AI being sued for libel. When I speak to organizations who are still earlier in the journey, this is where the lawyers come in and think, what if the AI does something that is suable, or injures someone? This is where the whole ethical and AI headspace comes in. In terms of security, top one, plugins. Plugins are great, but you need to make sure you're doing access control. I'll be talking about this a bit later. Because one of the critical ChatGPT plugins exposed sensitive data, and it was to do with the OAuth mechanism. Who remembers Log4j from a few years ago? Log4j happened just before Christmas, and then, I think this was maybe two years later, PyTorch on Christmas Day, between Christmas Day and the 30th of December, so when not many people are around, there was a vulnerable version of PyTorch. This collected system information, including files such as /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts. Supply chain, this isn't a machine learning specific vulnerability. This is something that affects all, and what you'll see in the talk is it's a lot about the basics. Finally, prompt injection. This is ML specific. What happened to Google Gemini is it enabled direct content manipulation, and it meant that you could start creating fictional accounts, and hackers could see only the prompts that only the developers could see. Mahmood: Now that you know essentially all the problems that can go wrong with machine learning models and generative AI, how do you avoid that? Fundamentally, you want to develop a responsible framework. Responsible AI is really about the governance and the set of principles your company develops when trying to develop machine learning models. There's a few commonalities. A lot of people focus on human-centric design, fairness and bias, explainability and transparency. Ultimately, you should assure that your responsible AI set of principles align with your company values. What are some responsible AI principles out there? Over here, we're spanning across Google and Accenture, and you'll recognize a few commonalities. Say, for example, there is a focus on fairness. Fundamentally, you don't want your machine learning model to be treating people differently. There's a focus on robustness. You want to ensure that the model is constantly working and the architectures and pipelines are functional. Transparency, it should be the case that you should be able to challenge the machine learning model. Every company, from Google and Accenture, seem to have overlaps here. Fundamentally, what you want to avoid is you want to avoid having a situation where you're developing Terminator, because that doesn't really align with human values and generally isn't a good idea. Assuming you want Earth to continue being here. What are some practical implementations you can use? Be human centric. Ultimately, machine learning, AI, they're all technologies, and really the importance of it is how actual users experience that technology. It's not useful if you develop a large language model, and essentially nobody knows how to communicate or interact with it, or it's spewing swears at people. You want to continuously test. I recognize that the world of AI feels very new, but ultimately, it's still software, you need to test every component. You need to test your infrastructure. You need to test pipelines. You need to test continuously during deployment. Just because a model may work doesn't necessarily mean the way it interacts with the rest of the system will get you the result you want. There's multiple components here. Also, it's important to recognize the limitations. Fundamentally, AI is all about the architecture as well as the data. Analyze your data. Identify biases of your model and your data. Make sure you're able to communicate those biases and communicate the limitations of your system to your consumers and pretty much everyone. Finally, identify metrics. To understand the performance of your model, you need to use multiple metrics, and they give you a better idea of performance. You need to understand the tradeoffs, and thus you're able to really leverage machine learning to its full capacity. To summarize, develop a set of responsible AI principles that align with your company values, and consider the broader impact within society. Don't build something like Terminator. Be human centric. Engage with the broader AI community. Ensure you're thinking about how people are interacting with these architectures. Rigorously test and monitor every component of your system. Understand the data, the pipelines, how it all integrates into a great, harmonious system. Chaplin: Is anyone from security, or has worked in security? This might be music to your ears, because we're going to cover this, and it's going to cover a lot of the basic principles that are applied across the IT organization. Secure AI, secure and compliant development, deployment, and use of AI. First, I'm going to talk a little bit about attack vectors, popular vulnerabilities, some prevention techniques, and summarize. You can see, this is my simplified architecture where we have a hacker, we've got the model data, and we've got some hacks going on. Who's heard of OWASP before? OWASP do a lot of things. Something they're very famous for is the Top 10 Vulnerabilities. It started off with web, they do mobile, infrastructure as code. They do LLMs as well. This I think was released '22, or '23. What you'll notice with the top 10, some are very LLM specific, for example, prompt injections, training data poisoning. Some are more generic. In terms of denial of service, that could happen to your models, it can happen to your servers, or your laptop. Supply chain vulnerabilities, so what I mentioned earlier with PyTorch. If I have a look at those, and you have those top 10. We have our users who are actually on the outside. We have different services. We have our data, plugins, extensions, more services. What you'll notice is there are multiple different attack vectors and multiple places these vulnerabilities can happen. For example, sensitive information disclosure pops up in many times, especially around the data area. We have excessive agency popping up again. In security, you are as strong as your weakest link. You need to make sure every link, every process between these services, users, and data, is as secure as possible, because otherwise you can see, you leave yourself open to a lot of vulnerabilities. In terms of prevention techniques, so with security, there are a lot of, I call them security basics. For example, access control. Who can do what and how? How are you doing your privileges amongst your users? How are you deciding who can access what data, or who can change the model? Also, you've set that up, but what happens if something goes wrong? Monitoring is very important. It actually moved up in the OWASP Top 10. It moved from, I think, number nine to number six, because if you're not doing logging and monitoring, if/when something goes wrong, how are you going to know? It's very important, whether it's for denial of service, for supply chain, for someone getting in your system, to just have logging and monitoring in place. For data specific, you need to think about validation, so sanitization, integrity. A rule that I do, I worked in security training for a few years, and if everyone just checked that input, are you who you say you are? I know that usually training data comes from here, but are we just verifying that that is who it says it is? That would solve a lot of the different vulnerabilities. Even stuff like upgrading your components, having a suitable patch strategy in place. This is what I meant when I said it's your security basics, access control, monitoring, patching. If you want to look at a good example of someone who's got a really good framework, check out Google's SAIF, Secure AI Framework. You can go online, find it. They've got some really useful educational material, because it's talking about all these concepts. We're talking about the security foundations, detection and response, defenses, controls, looking at risk and context within business processes. To summarize, adopt security best practices for your AI and MLOps process. If you're doing something for your DevSecOps or for your InfoSec, you can probably apply those principles to your MLOps and AI initiatives. I've mentioned access control, validation, supply chain verification. Number two, security almost manifesto, you are as strong as your weakest link, so make sure all your links are secure. Finally, check out OWASP and Google SAIF when designing and implementing your AI processes. You can also sign up our newsletter, and we'll have more information. Mahmood: What is explainability? Fundamentally, explainability is a set of tools that help you interpret and understand the decisions your AI model makes. That's an overview. Why should you use explainable methods? Number one, transparency. Fundamentally, you should be able to challenge the judgment that your machine learning model is making. Then, trust. It's great if your machine learning model is a black box, but ultimately, nobody is really going to trust a black box. You want to be able to bridge that barrier. It improves performance, because if you can understand your system, then you can identify components that are weak, and then, as a result, address them. You also are able to minimize risk. By using an XAI framework, it's the shorthand for Explainable AI, you're able to also comply with most regulatory and compliance frameworks. That's a broad overview of its importance. We're not going to go in too much detail, but here are a few. This is a broad landscape of what the XAI field of research looks like. Fundamentally, there are model agnostic approaches which treat your machine learning model as a black box and then allow you to interpret that black box. You have your large language model. It's not initially interpretable. You use a few techniques and you can better understand which components are working and how they're working, at least. Then there's model specific approaches. These are tailor-made approaches specific to your architecture. For example, with a model agnostic approach, you could have any architecture. Transformers, those are generally what large language models are. Multiple MLPs, those are quite common deep learning architectures. Then with model specific approaches, it's specifically tailored to your machine learning architecture or even your domain. Then, you also have both global analysis, so look at your whole model and attempt to understand it in its completion, and local analysis, which really identify maybe how individual predictions function. Within the model agnostic approach, there's a common technique, it's called SHAP. SHAP uses game theory and ultimately helps identify the most important features. You also have LIME. LIME takes in data and then fundamentally looks at how each prediction aligns. It's really great at identifying for single data points. Then there's the broader, holistic approach developed by Stanford University, it's called HELM. It's actually called Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Models. They look at the whole architecture and have a number of metrics that you can leverage. Then there's BertViz. BertViz helps you identify the attention mechanism within your model. This is like a whistle-stop tour of explainable AI. I imagine what you're probably more interested is how organizations are using explainable AI. In the case of BlackRock, initially they had a black box. The performance of the black box was great. It's actually pretty superb. What happened was the quants couldn't explain the decision-making processes to stakeholders or customers, and as a result, that black box model was scrapped. It was then replaced with an XAI process, and that way the decision-making process could be understood. At J.P. Morgan, they've heavily invested in XAI. Actually, they have a whole AI institute dedicated to research, which they then integrate. At PhysicsX, we actually leverage domain knowledge. I, for example, may develop an architecture, I get a few results. Then what will happen is I then communicate with the civil engineer, the mechanical engineer, really understand, does my prediction make sense? Then I leverage that expert judgment to improve my model and understand its failure points. IBM also leverage things called counterfactuals. Say, for example, they might ask a large language model, I have black hair, and it'll provide some result. The counterfactual of I have black hair is I have red hair or I do not have black hair. That helps you better interpret your model where the data is missing. For example, PayPal and both Siemens have great white papers that really go into details about this whole field. To quickly summarize, you can use expert judgments and domain knowledge to better interpret and understand the performance of your architecture. It's a good idea to stay up to date with the latest in research within the field. It's an incredibly fast-moving field. Make use of model agnostic approaches and model specific approaches. Think about your model in terms of globally, how does the whole architecture work, as well as locally, how does it perform for each individual data point? There's actually a really great paper by Imperial, called, "Explainability for Large Language Models," which I imagine many of you might find interesting, and that identifies approaches specific for that domain. Also, you can leverage open-source tools as well as classical techniques. For the case of large language models, there's BertViz, HELM, LIT, and Phoenix. These are all open-source tools. You can literally go out, download today, and get a better understanding of performance of your model, as well as you can use more classical statistical techniques to understand the input data, the output data and really how things are performing. Chaplin: We've spoken a little bit about how GenAI is revolutionizing the world, highly regulated industries, sensitive data, regulation, when AI goes wrong. We've given you a responsible AI framework that covers responsibility, security, and explainability as well. Let's talk a little bit about the future of AI. We're going to take it from two lenses, my view, and then Azhir's. I come from a cybersecurity background. Maybe I'm biased. How AI can strengthen cybersecurity in the future. Michael Friedrich was talking about AI automated vulnerability resolution. As a developer, vulnerability in my pipeline reflected cross-site scripting. What does that mean? What AI will do, one, it will explain the vulnerability. "That's what it is. This is what the issue is." Even better, we have automated resolution. Using GitLab, and there are other tools out there, we will generate a merge request with the remediation. As a developer, my workflow, it's like, I've got a problem. This is what that means. This is the fix. It's all been done for me. I even have an issue created, and all I need to do is manually just approve. The reason we have that is because if you have a change, say you're updating a component from version 2.1 to version 9.1, you might just want to check that with your code, because it's probably going to introduce breaking changes. That's why we have the final manual step. That's from a developer perspective, that's security. From a more ops perspective, incidence response and recovery. AI is very good at noticing anomalies, and PagerDuty are doing a good job at this, because they can identify something, "Something unexpected is happening. Let's react quickly." Maybe we block it. Maybe we're going to alert someone, because the faster you react the slower the attack vector is. An example, if anyone remembers the Equifax hack from a few years ago, it was a Struts 2 component, and it took them four months to notice that they had been hacked. You can imagine the damage. It was actually 150 million personal records, which is over double the UK, most of America. This is before GDPR. Otherwise, the fine would have been huge. They lost a third of market cap. This was to do with the attack vector. Finally, NVIDIA, so they are using GenAI as part of their phishing simulation. Using GenAI, you can generate these sandbox cybersecurity trainings, so help to get all of your users as secure as possible. I'm sure everyone's come across social engineering. My brother-in-law is an accountant, and his whole team are terrified of opening the wrong link and accidentally setting the company on fire. GenAI can really help to speed up these phishing and cybersecurity initiatives. Mahmood: More broadly, what does the future of AI actually look like? What we're likely to see is increasing prevalence of large foundation models. These are models trained on immense datasets. They may be then used for numerous domains. They may be multimoded or distributed, but what they'll be used for is everything from drug development, industrial design. They'll touch every component of our lives. As they integrate within our lives, we expect AI to become increasingly regulated, especially as they begin to be integrated within health techs, finance, all these highly regulated domains. When designing and implementing AI models, think responsibly. Make sure to use a responsible, secure, and explainable framework. Chaplin: Keep an eye on the legislation and regulations to stay compliant, not only of the country you are based in, but also to your customers. Mahmood: AI is more than just tech. It's all about people. It's how these architectures and models interact with the broader society, how they interact with all of us. Think more holistically. Chaplin: If you are interested in finding out more, we work with organizations doing MLOps, doing AI design, doing a lot of things, so check out our website. Participant 1: You're talking about HELM as an explainability framework, but to my knowledge, it's just an evaluation method with benchmarks on a leaderboard. Can you elaborate a bit on that? Mahmood: Fundamentally, one way you can think about explainability is really understanding multiple benchmarks. Say, for example, with HELM, I have to read through the paper to make sure I fully interpret everything. If you're able to understand how maybe changes in your performance, say, for example, you pretrain, you use a different dataset, and then you evaluate it, it gives you more interpretation to your model. That's a way you can holistically interpret. That's one way you could leverage HELM. Participant 1: That doesn't give you any explainability for highly regulated environments, I think. You compared it with SHAP and LIME, and there you get an explanation of your model and your inference. Mahmood: Within explainable AI, there's multiple ways you can think about explainability. There is the framework of interpretability where interpretability is fundamentally understanding each component. I would probably argue, yes, LIME provides you with some degree of interpretability, but explainability is much more of a sliding scale. You have where you might have a white box model, where you understand every component, where you might understand the components of your intention mechanism. While you can also use more holistic metrics to maybe put up your datasets and understand that. Those could be applied to less regulated domains, but still relatively regulated domains. You would, of course, use HELM with other explainable frameworks. You shouldn't be relying on a single framework. You should be leveraging a wide approach of tools. HELM is one metric, and you can leverage numerous other metrics. Participant 1: Shouldn't you promote more the white box models, the interpretable ones, above the explainability of black box models, because LIME, SHAP are estimations of the inference. With the interpretable model, you know how they reason and what they do. I think in a highly regulated environment, it's better to use white box models than starting with black box models and trying to open them. Mahmood: The idea is leveraging white box models over black box models, and attempting to interpret black box models. To some degree, I agree. We could leverage white box models increasingly within regulated domains, but what you end up finding is we sacrifice a great deal of performance by leveraging a white box model. It's not necessarily easy to integrate a white box model into a large language model, that's still an area of research. You do lose some degree of performance. Then, within the black box models, yes we have great degrees of performance. Fundamentally, say, for example, in medical vision, it makes more sense to use a CNN, because using a CNN, you'd be able to detect cancer more readily. Using a white box model, yes, it's interpretable, but it might be the case it's more likely to make mistakes. As a result, what you'd use then is a domain expert with that black box model. I would probably say it fundamentally depends. It depends on how regulated your industry is. How much performance do you need, again, fundamentally in your domain? There's a whole host of tools out there.

Title: ESG is dead. Long live ESG storytelling.

Time Published: 2025-04-17T10:00:09Z

What ESG needs is better branding. What ESG needs is better branding. Marianne O’Connor is CEO of Sterling Communications. Remember when every tech company couldn’t shut up about ESG? Environmental, social, governance — three magic words that made press releases sound responsible, forward-thinking, and vaguely European. Investors loved it, the media ate it up, and for a while, it seemed like companies that weren’t jumping on the ESG train were about to get left behind. Fast forward to 2025. The GOP has run the table. Elon Musk and a new wave of Silicon Valley VCs are louder than ever about their anti-woke, anti-ESG crusade. Wall Street pretends it never really cared about ESG in the first place. BlackRock’s Larry Fink, who practically invented corporate ESG hype, now avoids the term like it’s radioactive. But before we have a wake for woke, consider that maybe what ESG initiatives need to stay alive is better branding. Here’s how companies that care can gain traction on some very slippery slopes. Companies aren’t suddenly abandoning efficiency, risk management and sustainable growth. What they may consider doing is swapping out language political operatives have turned toxic into something more market friendly. Nobody in a Fortune 500 boardroom these days wants to be accused of being “woke,” but they do want to cut costs, optimize supply chains and attract capital. ESG storytelling needs to evolve into pragmatic business storytelling. Take cleantech. Instead of hyping “carbon neutrality,” smart companies should talk about “energy resilience” and “reducing dependence on foreign oil.” Not because they care about ideological battles, but because these things sell — especially in a political climate where Red State America loves energy independence but hates climate activism. Even the most conservative friendly fund managers aren’t throwing all ESG considerations in the trash. They still care about sustainability — when it affects risk. They still care about governance — when it protects shareholder value. They just don’t want it labeled ESG anymore. BlackRock, Vanguard and Goldman Sachs will continue to factor in environmental risks and supply chain ethics, because they always look at risk factors that matter. But their annual reports will probably use terms like “long-term resilience” or “strategic risk mitigation” instead of ESG. Same thing, new brand. One of the biggest mistakes of the ESG boom was letting it get tangled up in progressive politics. When companies positioned sustainability or DEI as “moral imperatives,” they made themselves easy targets. In 2025, it would behoove them to focus on “economic imperatives” instead. For healthtech, that means saying “AI-driven patient care lowers costs and expands access to rural hospitals” instead of “AI improves health equity.” For cleantech, it’s about “job growth in advanced manufacturing” instead of “the fight against climate change.” B2B tech? Talk about compliance and operational efficiency. Big enterprises still want vendors who won’t get them sued or regulated to death. Even two years ago, slapping ESG buzzwords on a press release might have been enough to earn some goodwill. Now? If your ESG messaging doesn’t have a direct business case behind it, it’s just begging for backlash. A lesson from Disney and Bud Light: Consumers can smell corporate BS a mile away. Performative virtue signaling is out (or, at least it should be). If your sustainability or governance initiatives don’t tie back to measurable, real-world business outcomes, don’t bother mentioning them. Of course, this is mostly an American political problem. Europe? Still ESG-obsessed. Asia and Latin America? Still prioritizing sustainability and social responsibility. If your business has a global footprint, you can’t afford to ignore ESG. You just have to be smart about where and how you promote it. A Silicon Valley B2B technology company that sells AI solutions to both U.S. and EU markets can position its tech as “cost-effective automation” in the U.S. and “ethically responsible AI” in Europe. Same solution, different value proposition pitch. ESG storytelling today is all about understanding your audience’s hot buttons. The bottom line The term ESG may wither on the vine, but its core was always about making businesses more resilient, efficient, and attractive to investors. That isn’t going anywhere. The trick in 2025? Drop the politics. Keep the business case. ESG isn’t a moral stance anymore. It’s just good business. Topics: ESG Topics: ESG These are good comments Marrianne Complete, consistent and objective disclosure along with verifiable metrics provide the story stakeholders want. ESG is simply a way to organize information. The real overall topic is sustainability- how organizations create and preserve longer term value and success beyond quarter to quarter results. Lower costs, higher revenues, improved customer and employe retention, new procurement methods and substitute materials, lower resource consumption, reuse and recycling impacts are all outcomes that can be achieved. All of these outcomes generally result in higher valuation of an organization. Bob Hirth Former SASB Standards Board member Some CEOs are running. Others hiding. A few are standing firm. But the world needs leaders who move forward. Companies cannot pretend they don’t have an impact beyond their NAICS code.

Title: GORDON CHANG: Trump tariffing China at the worst possible time for Xi Jinping

Time Published: 2025-04-17T09:00:03Z
Full Content:
Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang discusses President Donald Trump’s tariff strategy and the threat of Chinese hackers to U.S. national security on ‘Fox News Live.’ "There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war," wrote Xi Jinping this week. If he’s talking about China, he’s absolutely right. Across the board, the Chinese will suffer. In America, the story will be different. When the dust settles on President Donald Trump’s tariffs, there will be 340.1 million people much better off. For more than four decades, China’s regime has been implementing predatory and criminal trade practices. For various reasons, the U.S. and other countries have let matters slide. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping Trump in his first term, in 2018, fired a warning shot with his 25% tariffs. Unfortunately, the Chinese regime did not take the hint. This month he raised the general tariff rate on China’s goods to 145%. 10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER Trump’s trade actions could not have come at a worse time for Xi. As an initial matter, his economy is stumbling. It cannot be growing at the 5.4% pace reported Wednesday for the first quarter of this year. Price data for March – the Consumer Price Index was negative for the second-straight month and the Producer Price Index was negative for the 30th-straight month – indicates the country has entered a deflationary spiral. That phenomena suggests the economy is now contracting and will do so for some time. And it’s going to get worse. Xi Jinping, despite what his technocrats say, does not want consumption to form the foundation of the Chinese economy. In fact, consumption’s share of gross domestic product – an abnormally low 38% last year – is now falling. In these circumstances, Xi’s only way to rescue an increasingly grim situation is to export more. Yet Trump’s elevated tariffs close off the U.S. market to most Chinese goods. The U.S. accounts for more than a third of global consumer spending. TRUMP’S TARIFF WAR WITH BEIJING IS PART OF A MULTI-PRONG STRATEGY TO SECURE AMERICA FROM A MUCH BROADER THREAT Worse for Xi Jinping, Trump’s tariffs are helping end the fast globalization that has marked the post-Cold War period. "Due to many reasons, the world has been deglobalizing for years," trade expert Alan Tonelson told Fox News. "Now, the Trump Liberation Day tariffs are greatly speeding up the process, and further threatening the well-being of the People’s Republic of China and other export-led economies." As Tonelson, who blogs on trade at RealityChek suggests, the world is de-integrating. "The Russian invasion of Ukraine has put an end to the globalization we have experienced over the last three decades," wrote Larry Fink in his March 24, 2022, letter to BlackRock shareholders. The world’s largest asset manager – BlackRock has $11.6 trillion under management – suggested the Ukraine war killed globalization because globalization had already been weakened by the COVID pandemic, which had lessened connectivity among nations, among companies and among people. In this deglobalizing world, other countries will not allow China to flood their markets with goods the Chinese would have otherwise sold to America. Those markets are not large enough to absorb those goods and, in any event, they will not permit China to decimate their local industries. China will be hurt. Even now, export factories in southern China, with nothing in their order books, are closing. Workers have begun to return to hometowns, many to subsist on farms. WHY US MUST ASSERT INDUSTRIAL DOMINANCE IN LIGHT OF CHINA-EUROPE TIES The downturn in the export sector is occurring while the country is essentially having its 2008. In 2008, Hu Jintao, Xi’s predecessor, decided to avoid a downturn by embarking on what was then the biggest stimulus program in history. In the process, China took on an enormous amount of debt. Today, China’s total-country-debt-to-GDP ratio could be as high as an unsustainable 375%. As a result, there have been for four years a series of high-profile debt defaults, especially in the property sector. Prices of flats in China have tumbled, a social stability issue: Approximately 70% of household wealth is in property. And if all of this were not bad enough, Trump has picked this moment to begin challenging China’s mighty export sector with tariffs. The obvious course of action for Xi Jinping would be to pick up the phone to call 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He has, however, made it clear that he won’t be doing that. "China wants to make a deal," Trump said last Wednesday. "They just don’t know how quite to go about it." CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION No Xi Jinping doesn’t. And it’s not hard to figure out why something so easy is in fact so hard. Xi has configured the Chinese political system so that only the most hostile answers are considered acceptable. As a result, he cannot now back down or make concessions for fear that will lead to a challenge to his leadership. There are already signs of discontent with his rule, especially in the top ranks of the military. Xi remains intransigent. "China does not flinch from any unjust suppression," he proclaimed during his meeting with visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on April 11. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So Xi has boxed himself in. For him, there are no good outcomes. If he does not compromise, the Chinese economy will fail. If he compromises, he will fail. For China’s willful leader, the choice is easy: He will not initiate talks with Trump. China, as a consequence, will bear the consequences. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY GORDON CHANG Gordon G.

Title: Bitcoin historically the best performing asset 60 days after major global crisis

Bitcoin's crisis-era returns dwarf gold and S&P 500 since 2020. Bitcoin has delivered the strongest 60-day returns following major global disruptions since 2020, outperforming both equities and gold across several high-volatility periods. The top digital asset posted an average 37% two‑month return across events since 2020, versus 3.5% for the equity gauge and 6.2% for gold. BlackRock data shared by Bitcoin analyst and Marathon Digital advisor Sam Callahan breaks down the performance of the S&P500, gold, and Bitcoin after historical global crises. During the 60 days following the U.S.–Iran escalation in January 2020, Bitcoin rose 20%, while the S&P 500 fell 7% and gold gained 6%. In the same timeframe after the COVID-19 outbreak was declared in March 2020, Bitcoin climbed 21%, reversing a steep initial 25% drop over the first 10 days. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and gold recorded 2% and 3% gains, respectively. Following the U.S. election challenges in November 2020, Bitcoin surged 131% in 60 days. This compared to a 12% rise in the S&P 500 and a 1% decline in gold. The period included heightened uncertainty around the electoral process and stimulus negotiations. After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Bitcoin returned 15% over 60 days. Gold outperformed equities, gaining 9% versus the S&P 500’s 3% uptick. Bitcoin initially fell 6% in the first 10 days before recovering. The March 2023 U.S. regional banking crisis also saw a sharp move in Bitcoin, which gained 32% in 60 days. Gold rose 11%, while the S&P 500 climbed 4%. This period included liquidity concerns and institutional fallout. In contrast, Bitcoin’s response to Japan’s Yen carry trade unwinding in August 2024 was muted, rising just 3% in 60 days. Gold gained 9%, and the S&P 500 added 7%. Thus, data shows Bitcoin repeatedly recovering faster and outperforming other assets across major market dislocations, particularly within a two-month window. The 60‑day mark for tariffs announced on “Liberation Day” arrives Jun. 1; Bitcoin is flat over the first 15 days, with the S&P 500 down 5.72% and gold up 6.8%. After 60 days, Bitcoin has only underperformed gold once in 2024 during the Yen carry trade unwinding.

Title: ‘Ulster will be a huge test’: Leinster’s Tommy O’Brien on Saturday’s URC match and his international hopes

Time Published: 2025-04-17T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
Conversations with Leinster’s Tommy O’Brien invariably alight on a former life as a schools 110-metre hurdles champion in Leinster and runner-up at national level. He also ran the 400-metre hurdles, highlighting how he possessed the fast-twitch fibres of a sprinter but also the stamina and endurance for the one-lap event. It’s not his doing. Invariably he’s redirected from rugby to athletics. Sitting in UCD, the topic arose again, but this time with a twist. O’Brien was asked about Sarah Healy, the 3,000-metre European Indoor gold medal winner with whom he ran alongside for a time at Blackrock Athletic Club, Co Dublin. “[Sarah is a] couple of years younger, the same age group as my sister. She was always incredible. I don’t think she lost an All-Ireland cross-country race from the age of 12 up. We always knew she was special, and she had an unbelievable work ethic. She had been running great times earlier in the year and now she has that European gold, which is incredible,” he said. “She has gone on to do fantastic things. When I got older there weren’t too many in my age group, so I moved over to DSD [Dundrum South Dublin AC] for my last few years of school. A lot of it would have been through school. My dad [Michael] would have coached in Blackrock AC.” O’Brien’s first love was rugby, a sport at which he excelled first as a centre in Blackrock College, then as captain of the Ireland under-20s, where he also played on the wing. The 26-year-old has been unlucky with injuries and it’s hardly a stretch to suggest that without one or two that were particularly ill-timed he’d have a couple of Ireland caps. He’s highly regarded by the national coaching team and would have travelled on the most recent Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa but for injury. Compensation of sorts came when Ireland interim head coach Simon Easterby called him into the training panel during the recent Six Nations. “Any rugby player growing up always dreams of playing for Ireland, so that’s definitely an ambition of mine. I would have set that out at the start of the year,” O’Brien said. “I would have been frustrated at missing that Emerging Ireland tour at the start of the year because of injury, [but] managed to play a few games recently and got called into camp, got my first taste of it during the Six Nations. I would love to play in the summer [when Ireland play Tests against Georgia and Portugal], but the way you do that is playing and impressing for Leinster.” So, what did he learn in his brief time with Ireland? “It was very interesting in the speed and the amount of detail, but there were a lot of familiar faces that I would know from here [at Leinster],” he said. “It wasn’t a daunting step up at all, but it was definitely great to get an insight, especially as it was France week, a massive week in there. It was great to see the intensity and the detail.” O’Brien’s performances since returning to Leinster colours in February have been top notch, characterised by some thunderous tackling as Sharks player Makazole Mapimpi and Harri Millard of Cardiff will attest, and the value he adds on the ball, including a try in the province’s Champions Cup quarter-final victory over the Glasgow Warriors. Competition is fierce, and O’Brien knows that Saturday’s URC clash with Ulster at the Aviva Stadium, Dublin, is another opportunity to put a down payment on a place in a European semi-final against the Northampton Saints next month. “It is great that they are picking guys based on form. People like Max [Deegan] have gone really well in the last few weeks and he got his chance there [against Glasgow] and I played a few games and got rewarded with playing last weekend as well,” O’Brien said. “Ulster is going to be a huge test. In an Interpro people are always up for that. It’s about putting your hand up. I feel like they [Ulster] have turned a corner in the last few weeks when they had a great comeback win against the Stormers. “They went very well against Bordeaux, scored some great tries and they have a good few guys who have just come back from injury, especially in the backline. Their backs are humming again. They look like they are enjoying their rugby again and it will be a big test.” John O'Sullivan is an Irish Times sports writer Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Sea Shanty review: Quietly rewriting the rules of seafood in south Dublin

Some 20 years ago, I went to Barcelona for the first time. It was peak Celtic Tiger – and if you cared remotely about food, it was the place to be. The city was mid-revolution: foams, spheres, deconstructions – but also the old guard, holding firm. Chief among them: Quimet i Quimet, a tapas bar in El Poble Sec, where suited businessmen crushed in shoulder to shoulder for vermouth and conservas – tins of zamburiñas and navajas, the canned seafood delicacies beloved by the Spanish, stacked like library books behind the bar. I think of that room as I flick through the “tinned fish” section of the menu at Sea Shanty. There are snails, mussels, sardines, octopus and pâtés, served straight in the tin with focaccia, gildas, olives and crisps. On the broader menu there are no starters, mains or desserts in the traditional sense – just a tight run of small plates, raw and cooked oysters and a short dessert list. It’s built for grazing, sharing, and drinking alongside, rather than trudging through a three-act structure. Sea Shanty, run by Sebastian Sainz from Uruguay and Elena Segura from Seville (the pair met while working at Las Tapas de Lola on Wexford Street), is tucked discreetly upstairs over Conway’s Bar in Blackrock. It is signposted with the sort of understatement that feels deliberate. The floorboards are dark wood, tables are simple, chairs vary in height and a long communal table with high stools anchors one end of the rather large room. The lights – strung casually across the ceiling, festival-style – feel somewhat out of place. We start with anchovies (€10). They arrive delicately arrayed on a plate with semi-dried tomatoes and a hint of ponzu, that citrus-soy sharpness that makes your molars tingle. The anchovies are salty but not aggressive, and the tomatoes add a soft, jammy sweetness that threads it all together. We follow with a tin of conservas – spicy sardines (€14.50) – which are a little let down by indifferent olives and focaccia. Then there are the oysters. Seven types, sourced directly from each producer with the kind of nerdy geographical precision usually reserved for terroir-obsessed winemakers – Woodstown Bay, Cooley, Killough Bay, Rossmore natives, DK Connemara, Achill and Cromane oysters – each bringing a different level of salinity. You can go purist – raw, briny, glistening – as we do, with a delicious Rossmore native (€3.70). Or you can opt for the lightly cooked versions. The green curry and spinach oyster (€4.50) tastes like a bowl of Thai curry gently caressing your mouth. There’s also a tempura oyster with wasabi mayo and asparagus (€4.50) in a gloriously light batter. Next, octopus (€14) – a single tentacle, grilled and placed on a slick of deep red muhammara. There’s pomegranate seed, mint, maybe even a whisper of walnut. It’s tender – genuinely tender – which is so often not the case. There’s a channelled wrack bhaji (€11), seaweed encased in crunchy batter served with a sauce that nods towards takeaway curry but with more refinement, bringing a minty, nigella-seeded note. From there the menu gets bolder. A calamari taco (€13) – long strips of squid, crispy-edged and salted – comes topped with a tomato salsa, red cabbage slaw and flecks of coriander and mint. It’s a messy mélange of sweetness, acidity and crunch. To drink? This is a low-intervention wine list built by people who care – short, sharp and quietly adventurous – more about interest and texture than labels. Almost everything is available by the glass, which means you can actually match food to wine without committing to a bottle. A Bodegas Barón Xixarito Manzanilla Pasada en Rama (€11.50), aged 10 years and bottled unfiltered from the cask, works brilliantly with the anchovies. A Veltlínske zelené (€10), a Slovak riff on Grüner Veltliner, is bright and mineral. And Claus Preisinger’s Kalkstein Blaufränkisch (€11.50) is light, low-alcohol and fruit-driven – elegant but not fragile. Dessert is mango with mascarpone and saffron syrup (€5.50). It arrives as a sort of whipped-sorbet hybrid – not quite mousse, not quite purée – layered with cream, mint and a drizzle of saffron that’s tastefully restrained. You can eat modestly at Sea Shanty – a glass of wine, a couple of oysters and a few plates – which is perfect for a catch-up with a pal. Or settle in, as we do, for a longer spell, chatting with Segura about the wines and working your way across the menu. Either way, it’s pleasurably satisfying – and likely to be even more so once they secure a permanent home. Dinner for two with three glasses of wine was €113.70. The verdict: Perfect for grazing, sharing and drinking alongside. Food provenance: Oysters direct from producers, Mungo Seaweed and Glenmar fish. Vegetarian options: Channelled wrack bhaji, fried cassava and mojo picon, and kurze curry ramen. Wheelchair access: No accessible room or toilet. Music: Dire Straits and music from Conway’s bar downstairs.

Title: Hertz shares surge 50% after Bill Ackman's Pershing Square discloses a stake

Share prices of Hertz surged 56% after billionaire investor Bill Ackman's firm disclosed a stake in the car rental company. Pershing Square Capital Management said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it had acquired 12.7 million shares valued at $46.5 million. Pershing Square owns 4.1% of Hertz, making it the third-largest investor after Knighthead Capital Management and BlackRock, according to LSEG data. CNBC reported on Wednesday that Pershing Square's purchase — which includes shares and swaps — took its Hertz holdings to about 19.8% Hertz shares closed 56.4% higher at $5.71 apiece on Wednesday and were up 33.8% in after-hours trade. The stock was little changed this year before Pershing Square's disclosure. Even though Hertz's gains on Wednesday were massive, the car rental company's stock isn't a stranger to such eye-watering jumps. In summer 2020, Hertz's shares surged over 800% in weeks after filing for pandemic-induced Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection — making it the original meme stock. It exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2021 and started investing heavily in electric vehicles, including a plan to buy 100,000 Teslas. However, the company started backtracking on its EV plan due to the cost of maintenance and repairs for the cars. Used EV prices have also been falling sharply. Hertz was selling a significant number of its EVs by 2024 and was even asking customers if they wanted to buy the vehicles. The failed bet on EVs showed up in earnings. Vehicle depreciation cost Hertz a $1 billion non-cash impairment charge in the third quarter. Pershing Square did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment sent outside regular business hours. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

Title: Archer and United plan NYC air taxi service for airport trips

The company promises 5-15 minute trips between Manhattan and all the major airports. The company promises 5-15 minute trips between Manhattan and all the major airports. by Andrew J. Hawkins Archer says it will launch an air taxi service in New York City with United Airlines, which will include routes between Manhattan and major airports like JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark. The aviation company aims to replace hourlong taxi rides along congested roads with breezy flights lasting between 5-15 minutes. Archer and United would utilize preexisting helipads at East 34th Street, West 30th Street, and Lower Manhattan to launch its all-electric Midnight aircraft, which has space for four passengers and a pilot. Passengers would be able to travel from the helipads to all three major airports, as well as three smaller, regional hubs at Westchester County Airport, Teterboro Airport, and Republic Airport. Passengers would book air taxi trips as an “add on” to their existing flights — though the price is still to be determined. A one-way ride from Manhattan to JFK Airport on one of Blade’s helicopters typically cost around $265 per seat. The companies won’t say when they intend on launching an NYC air taxi service, but Archer has said its aircraft will make their commercial debut in Los Angeles for the 2028 Olympics. Before it can launch, Archer needs to obtain type certification for its Midnight air taxi, which means the aircraft meets all the FAA’s design and safety standards. The company has previously received Parts 135 and 145 certification for on-demand services and specialized repair. Midnight has a range of up to 100 miles (nearly 160km) at speeds of up to 150mph (241 km/h), on pure battery power. Using tilt rotors, Midnight is designed to take off and land vertically like a helicopter and then transition into forward flight like a plane. Archer came out of stealth in spring 2020 after having poached key talent from Wisk and Airbus’ Vahana project. The company has a $1 billion order from United Airlines for its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, a $500 million deal with a Japan Airlines’ joint venture, and a deal to mass-produce with automaker Stellantis. The company also recently closed on several funding rounds giving it about $1 billion in liquidity. The company is also moving more into the defense space, with plans to next-gen military aircraft for Anduril Industries. This funding round included investments from Blackrock, Willington, and leading institutional developers, Archer says. Air taxis, sometimes misidentified by the mainstream media as “flying cars,” are essentially helicopters without the noisy, polluting gas motors (though they certainly have their own unique noise profile). In addition to Archer, companies like Joby Aviation, Volocopter, and Beta Technologies have claimed they are on the cusp of launching services that will eventually scale up nationwide. But others have floundered; German company Lilium recently said that two of its subsidiaries were insolvent and could cease operations.

Title: Here’s One Crypto Sector Quietly Going Parabolic Despite ‘Frustrating’ Bear Market, According to Bitwise

Crypto giant Bitwise says that parts of the digital asset ecosystem are experiencing “raging bull markets” despite underwhelming sentiment in the asset class at large. In a new Q1 report, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan says that “frustrating” would be the best word to describe the first quarter of 2025, but that it was still “historically positive.” Hougan notes that on top of surging stablecoin adoption and Bitcoin futures trading volume, the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) went parabolic in Q1. “What caught my eye is that, despite the pullback in prices, parts of the crypto market are experiencing raging bull markets. For instance: Stablecoins AUM (assets under management) surged to an all-time high of over $218 billion, up 13.50% quarter-over-quarter. Transaction volume also surged 30.14%. Tokenized real-world assets went parabolic in Q1, growing 37.07% quarter-over-quarter to a new all-time high. Regulated bitcoin futures trading volume and open interest also hit all-time highs, suggesting institutional interest in crypto as a macro trading asset is growing. As we move into Q2, I would expect these and related areas to lead the market higher.” Bitwise’s data shows an explosive uptrend for RWAs over the last several years, one that has accelerated in 2025 so far, largely driven by the tokenization of private credit and US Treasuries. According to Bitwise, Ondo Finance (ONDO) rivals BlackRock for the tokenization of US Treasuries, and eclipses other traditional finance (TradFi) firms like Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. Bitwise also says that after years of tightening, central banks across the globe are signalling a pivot towards looser monetary conditions and an expansion of M2 money supply, which, historically, has been “been favorable for risk assets, particularly for digital assets.” Read the full report here.
