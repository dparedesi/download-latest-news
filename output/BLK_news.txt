The erosion of the domestic manufacturing base and the corresponding ascent of real estate as the primary generator of wealth represents a fundamental, structural shift from a productive economy to a rentier economy. This transformation marks a change not merely in what America makes, but in how value is conceived and extracted, creating deep social and political consequences that dwarf the cyclical nature of previous economic downturns. This shift is characterized by the replacement of the wealth-generating factory floor with the wealth-extracting property deed. Historically, the American promise was rooted in productive capitalism, where value was created through labor, skill, and the transformation of raw materials into finished goods. The factory provided stable, high-wage jobs that translated directly into middle-class stability and accessible homeownership. The economic engine was powered by reinvesting profits into innovation and expansion, generating tangible wealth. The city was a center of making things. However, as globalization accelerated and industrial policy waned, manufacturing retreated, leaving vast economic and social vacuums. Into this vacuum stepped the Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate (FIRE) sector. The focus shifted from generating profits through production (e.g., selling a car) to generating rents through asset ownership and control (e.g., collecting rent on a portfolio of homes, fees on financial transactions). The critical distinction is that rentier activity extracts existing value without necessarily creating new, productive wealth. Real estate, in particular, became the new economic darling. This was structurally amplified by the complicity of the Democrat and Republican parties and the IRS in ignoring necessary tax code revisions. The unrevised code did not just offer deductions; it created a systemic incentive where the government effectively subsidizes asset ownership. The core loophole is the ability to claim depreciation as a deduction, generating “paper losses” that shield real income from taxation, even as the property itself appreciates in market value. This mechanism encourages wealth-seeking capital to utilize real estate as a shelter from high tax penalties, inflating property values far beyond the reach of local wages. For savvy high-net-worth investors, this loophole is maximized through techniques like cost segregation and bonus depreciation. Cost segregation studies break the property’s value into separate components (like carpeting, appliances, and land improvements) that can be depreciated over short periods (5, 7, or 15 years), rather than the standard 27.5 years for the structure. This accelerated depreciation, often coupled with bonus depreciation rules, creates massive non-cash deductions in the early years of ownership. This results in taxable losses on paper that can offset other forms of income, such as salaries or business profits. In essence, the combination of tax deductions (interest, taxes, maintenance) and non-cash paper losses (depreciation) allows investors to finance the acquisition and holding costs of high-end homes largely through reduced federal tax obligations, making the U.S. government a silent financial co-signer for the rentier class. This ascendancy of rentier wealth is corrosive because it fundamentally severs the link between hard work and economic security. When a city’s health is measured not by its output but by its rising property values, it inevitably privileges the owner and the investor over the producer and the laborer. It creates a state of economic dependence—the non-asset-holding majority must pay rents (housing, fees, interest) to the asset-holding minority. The political landscape becomes dominated by lobbying efforts aimed at protecting asset values and extracting rents (rent-seeking), further distorting governance away from policies focused on productive economic growth. In conclusion, the movement from manufacturing dominance to real estate reliance is far more significant than a simple sectoral transition; it is an ideological pivot from value creation to value extraction—consider the role BlackRock and Vanguard have played in this trend. This shift was tragically facilitated by policy inaction, as the failure to revise the tax code regarding depreciation, cost segregation, and paper losses created the critical loophole that funneled wealth into asset speculation. The resulting structural change—the severe reliance on asset ownership over productive labor—has not only cemented deep inequality but has directly contributed to the social crises we suffer today, most visibly in the proliferation of homelessness and drug epidemics across the nation. This defines the new landscape of wealth and power, suggesting a future where economic gains flow primarily to those who control the ground, not those who build upon it. Image generated by ChatGPT.

Title: Crypto Adoption Grows Among Hedge Funds: New Survey Shows 55% Participation In 2025

Throughout the year, President Donald Trump’s crypto policies have spurred a notable increase in the adoption of digital assets through various channels, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and crypto-focused treasuries. As a result, a recent survey conducted by the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) and PwC revealed that the percentage of traditional hedge funds holding cryptocurrencies has climbed to 55%, up from 47% in 2024. Despite the ongoing volatility in crypto markets, 47% of institutional investors surveyed expressed that the current regulatory environment, shaped by Trump’s appointments of crypto-friendly agency heads and the implementation of the GENIUS Act has encouraged them to increase their allocations to digital assets. James Delaney, managing director of asset management regulation at AIMA, commented on the findings, stating: For most of these funds, regulatory uncertainty has been a major barrier. This year, those barriers are starting to be removed. This year’s report may mark a turning point in overcoming these challenges. However, regulatory clarity isn’t the sole factor driving institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. The fear of missing out (FOMO) on substantial market gains is also a compelling motivator. The survey highlighted that alongside traditional hedge funds, specialized fund managers with at least 50% of their assets in crypto have emerged, with several new funds launched this year. Among the crypto-focused funds, Bitcoin (BTC) remains the most commonly held asset, closely followed by Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Notably, Solana saw a surge in popularity this year, with 73% of the funds now holding it, a marked increase from 45% in 2024. On average, hedge funds have allocated about 7% of their assets to crypto, up from 6% the previous year, although over half of the respondents commit less than 2%. Encouragingly, 71% of those surveyed indicated plans to increase their crypto exposure within the next twelve months. Major firms are also showing interest in this space. Brevan Howard Asset Management has reportedly appointed a former executive from Peter Thiel’s family office to lead a crypto-focused investment division. Additionally, asset managers like Steven Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Elliott Investment Management have disclosed holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked ETFs. According to the AIMA survey, the proportion of respondents using ETFs has risen to 33%, compared to 25% the previous year. The survey indicated that the most popular access method to the digital asset market among managers is through derivatives, with 67% of respondents utilizing them, an increase from 58% in 2024. Spot trading has also grown, rising to 40% from 25%. Moreover, some asset managers are exploring the tokenization of their funds, similar to initiatives by firms like BlackRock. Over half of the survey participants expressed interest in this approach. Lastly, the survey found that 43% of traditional hedge funds investing in crypto plan to enhance or initiate their engagement with DeFi over the next three years, with nearly a third believing that DeFi could disrupt their business models.

Title: BlackRock Exec Drops Trillion-Dollar Revelation At Ripple Swell, But Is XRP Ready?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ripple’s Swell 2025 conference in New York has quickly become one of the most talked-about events in the crypto and finance world. Among the highlights was a statement from Maxwell Stein, a member of BlackRock’s digital assets team, that sent the audience into applause and resonated with enthusiasts on social media. He revealed that the global financial market is now ready for large-scale blockchain adoption, and the infrastructure being built by companies like Ripple could soon facilitate the movement of trillions of dollars on-chain. During his session, Stein highlighted the transformation underway in global finance, noting that traditional securities are still held in legacy systems but that this separation between traditional and tokenized assets is gradually disappearing. He explained that in the short term, proving utility is the most important thing to gaining broader adoption and that there are currently two types of users driving this shift: those already in the crypto space and a second wave of early institutional adopters. Stein emphasized the need for continued market momentum to demonstrate the practical usefulness of blockchain solutions and attract larger financial players. “We need that market momentum in order to prove the utility, to actually get the larger players to eventually come in,” he said. As noted by an XRP advocate with the name Diana on the social media platform X, Stein credited Ripple and other early builders for proving that blockchain works. Not as a concept, but as real financial infrastructure. The idea that trillions in capital could eventually move through blockchain rails represents a fundamental change in how the world’s financial systems might operate. The idea sounded like a myth back when the crypto industry was first created. What once seemed like a distant fantasy in crypto’s early days has begun to take shape as reality, and big names like traditional finance are now moving into the crypto industry every day. Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman also shared her perspective at the event, focusing on the need for regulatory clarity to encourage broader institutional participation in the digital asset space. She explained that major institutions want to engage but require clearly defined rules that prioritize investor protection and establish stable frameworks. According to her, once such clarity is achieved, these institutions can confidently enter the market knowing that they are operating under secure and transparent guidelines. Friedman added that significant progress is already happening within traditional finance, as many banks are experimenting with tokenized bonds, fixed income instruments, and the creation of stablecoins. This growing involvement is evidence that institutions are not waiting for innovation to reach them. They are actively finding ways to participate in the digital asset ecosystem while awaiting the full regulatory go-ahead. “But I think to get them really engaged in the market, there has to be regulatory clarity,” Friedman said.

Title: Australia risks ‘missed opportunity’ by shirking tokenisation: top regulator

Time Published: 2025-11-07T01:07:14Z

The head of Australia’s market regulator, Joe Longo, is looking to embrace tokenization in Australia’s capital markets, fearing the country will fall behind if it doesn’t act. Australia’s capital markets risk being outpaced by other countries unless it embraces new technology such as tokenization, says the country’s head market regulator. “As other countries adapt and innovate, there’s a real risk Australia could become the ‘land of missed opportunity’ or be passive recipients of developments overseas,” Australian Securities and Investments Commission Chair Joe Longo told the National Press Club on Wednesday. Over $35.8 billion worth of real-world assets are currently tokenized onchain, which Boston Consulting Group estimated could rise to $16 trillion by 2030, while McKinsey & Co predicted a more conservative $2 trillion over the same time frame. Market regulators in the US have also floated the idea of 24/7 trading, which “may be more viable in some asset classes than others,” leading finance leaders such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to push for the tokenization of everything from stocks and bonds to money market funds as a solution. Longo said Australia was an early adoptor of electronic trading systems with the Australian Securities Exchange’s securities settlement system, the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System, or CHESS. He noted that the first tokenized bond was issued in Sydney in 2018. “Now, other countries are outpacing us,” he said. “Distributed ledger technology that facilitates asset tokenisation could fundamentally transform our capital markets, in the same way as the introduction of CHESS once did.” Longo said he met with US Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins last month, who made him realize that Australia is in a battle with others to court as much capital as possible to “seize a larger slice” of the rapidly emerging tokenization market. Longo said the regulator is looking to “do more to support innovation from the ground up” and will relaunch its Innovation Hub to support innovation by helping startup fintech firms navigate regulations. Related: Regulators must protect the architecture of freedom It comes about a week after ASIC released its updated guidance on how digital asset innovation should be balanced with investor protection. Longo expects tokenization to accelerate faster than anticipated, having cited discussions with JPMorgan staff who told him that they plan to tokenize their money market funds within the next two years. Four of JPMorgan’s largest money market funds hold a combined $730 billion worth of assets. Tokenizing these asset classes will also enable a broader range of traders to access markets that have traditionally been limited to institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, Longo noted.

Title: BlackRock eyes Australia as next Bitcoin ETF frontier – Details inside!

Why is the world’s biggest asset manager taking its Bitcoin ETF all the way to Australia? BlackRock is launching the iShares Bitcoin ETF on Australia’s ASX by mid-November 2025. It includes both a Bitcoin ETF and a global bond ETF, showcasing a diversified investment strategy. BlackRock is once again making headlines in the crypto space. This time, the firm is set to expand its digital asset footprint by launching the iShares Bitcoin ETF on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) by mid-November 2025. With this move, Australia emerges as the next key frontier in BlackRock’s global crypto strategy, and one of the fastest-growing Bitcoin ETF markets outside the United States. That said, the upcoming ETF, which carries a 0.39% management fee, will mirror the U.S.-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust. This move would allow Australian investors to gain regulated exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding or managing the digital asset. BlackRock emphasized that its upcoming ETF is designed to provide investors with a cost-efficient and seamless way to access the cryptocurrency market. Importantly, it allows participation through traditional financial channels without the need to directly hold or manage Bitcoin. Furthermore, by entering Australia’s competitive Bitcoin ETF space, BlackRock joins established issuers such as Global X 21Shares (EBTC), VanEck (VBTC), Monochrome (IBTC), and DigitalX (BTXX). This strategic move is expected to enhance institutional participation and improve liquidity across the region’s growing crypto sector. For more perspective, BlackRock’s expansion in Australia extends beyond Bitcoin. This is because the firm will also launch the iShares Core Global Aggregate Bond (AUD Hedged) ETF (AGGG) in early November. This will offer a diversified exposure to investment-grade global bonds at a low 0.18% annual fee. All this highlights how, with time and tide, the institutional demand for Bitcoin is accelerating. Needless to say, for BlackRock, ETFs remain a major growth driver as its iShares division saw U.S.$153 billion in inflows last quarter, fueling total net inflows of US$205 billion. The firm also posted a 25% rise in revenue and 23% growth in operating income year-on-year, reflecting strong diversification and investor trust. In fact, despite current short-term outflows, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) remains strong, with a NAV of $59.04 and a 6.91% year-to-date return. Meanwhile, iShares ETFs have surpassed $50 billion in assets under management (AUM). Additionally, BlackRock’s (BLK) shares are also up 5.52% this year, trading at $1,073.57 and carrying a Zacks Rank 3 rating. All this shows that BlackRock’s IBIT has firmly cemented its dominance, driving both ETF inflows and options market sentiment.

Title: Crypto Crash Recovery: XRP Price Surges on Strong Fundamentals, Outshining Bitcoin and Ethereum

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Following a stormy week that erased over $1 trillion in crypto market capitalization, signs of recovery are emerging, with the XRP price leading the way. While Bitcoin struggled to hold the $104,000 mark and Ethereum remained under pressure near $3,400, the XRP price rallied nearly 5% to trade around $2.31, outpacing both majors. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Slashes Bitcoin EOY Price Target To $120,000 Analysts attribute this strength to robust fundamentals, including Ripple’s strategic partnership with Mastercard and renewed institutional interest following a $500 million investment round. The Mastercard collaboration marks one of the first instances of a U.S.-regulated bank testing real credit card transactions on a public blockchain through Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. The move underscores the growing shift from speculative crypto use cases to enterprise-grade payment infrastructure. Momentum also intensified after BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets, Maxwell Stein, hinted at Ripple’s Swell conference that “trillions are definitely coming on-chain.” The comment reignited speculation around a potential BlackRock XRP ETF, a development that could reshape institutional exposure to the asset. Analysts note that such a product would provide regulatory recognition and attract billions in inflows, potentially revving the long-term value growth of the XRP price. The buzz comes as Ripple’s valuation climbs to $40 billion following its latest funding round, led by Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities. Major firms, such as Pantera Capital and Galaxy Digital, also joined, backing institutional confidence in Ripple’s blockchain-based payment systems. Observers say that this backing, blended with the growing utility of the network, positions XRP as a frontrunner for the next institutional adoption wave. Despite the broader market’s volatility, on-chain data reveals growing conviction among XRP holders. Glassnode reported that more than 1.4 billion XRP tokens have been withdrawn from exchanges since September, the fastest accumulation pace since 2022. Similarly, network activity surged, with over 21,000 new wallets created within 48 hours, marking the highest growth since January. This combination of reduced exchange supply, rising wallet creation, and expanding institutional partnerships paints a bullish picture for XRP’s medium-term trajectory. If the asset maintains support above $2.30, analysts expect a possible move toward the $2.60–$3.00 range. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash To $87,000 If This Happens As Bitcoin and Ethereum consolidate, XRP’s growing real-world utility and corporate adoption suggest that the XRP price recovery may not just be a relief bounce, but the start of a new leadership phase in the next crypto cycle.

In a world increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence, successful individuals will have to be armed with the tools needed in specific sectors. “When you graduate, whether it’s high school, or community college, or college, you need the skills to get the job,” Dimon said in a recent interview with CNN. “It’s not enough anymore to say, ‘I can work hard.’ In the old days, you could be in 10th grade, go get a factory [job] in Detroit, and eventually you could afford a family, a home, a car, and that may not be true anymore.” Dimon’s words will resonate with many. Even in the past few years, buying a home has become increasingly unaffordable for first-time buyers. Per data from the National Association of Realtors, in 2022 its housing affordability index stood at 108, with a value of 100 representing a family with the median income having exactly enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. By 2025, this had dropped to 97.4, meaning the average American family trying to buy their first home doesn’t have the income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. Likewise, childcare costs have skyrocketed compared with a few decades ago. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis charting tuition, school fees, and childcare across an average of U.S. cities has increased from an index of 100 in 1983 to 897 by September 2025. In the face of an increased cost of living, younger workers now graduating and entering the workforce are more concerned than their older counterparts about the threat of artificial intelligence. Nearly one in five Gen Z workers reported being deeply worried that artificial intelligence will put them out of work within the next two years, according to a recent survey from Deutsche Bank Research. But their older peers are notably less alarmed: While nearly a quarter of young adults ages 18 to 34 gave high scores of concern on a 0 to 10 scale, only about one in 10 baby boomers and Gen Xers (ages 55 and above) expressed comparable anxiety. Dimon said that AI and coding are areas where “we know we need the skills,” adding that speedy industry training courses also present paths to secure employment: “And it works, those things work. We just have to get people to invest in them.” Many of the nation’s fastest-growing job markets are in highly specialized sectors—some of which require no degree but do require technical training. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projections for job growth in 2023–33, released last year, wind turbine service technicians came in first with a growth rate of 60% and median annual pay of just under $62,000. No degree is required. Second was solar photovoltaic installers with a growth rate of 48% and annual pay of a little under $49,000—again, no degree required. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has also urged job market entrants to explore skills-focused roles adjacent to the immediate technology sector. While the billions being invested into AI have pushed up valuations courtesy of promised efficiencies and streamlining, Huang points out that it will also have real-world impacts when it comes to building data centers and the wider infrastructure needed to support the shift. “If you’re an electrician, you’re a plumber, a carpenter—we’re going to need hundreds of thousands of them to build all of these factories,” Huang told Channel 4 News in the U.K. in September. “The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom. You’re going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.” Huang isn’t alone. Earlier this year BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told an energy conference he has warned the White House about the shortage of workers needed to support the rollout: “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers. We just don’t have enough.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: PayPal Co-founder Peter Thiel Says Bitcoin Upside Is Limited Following BlackRock And Government Interest

PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has issued a grim forecast for Bitcoin, predicting a volatile and bumpy ride for the leading cryptocurrency. Thiel noted that Bitcoin’s upside is limited, given the heavy institutional and government interest, underscored by the introduction of ETFs and strategic reserves. Amid the flurry of predictions for Bitcoin’s end-of-year price, PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has dampened investors’ enthusiasm with a grim forecast. Thiel warned that Bitcoin does not have much upside left in terms of pricing after its last bull run, citing institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency. Thiel shared his thoughts at a session at the Aspen Ideas Festival, urging investors to brace for a rocky patch with the leading cryptocurrency. The PayPal co-founder added that while a BTC rally is on the horizon, investors may not see the parabolic returns from the last bull run. “I’m not sure it’s going to go up dramatically from here,” said Thiel. “We got the ETF edition, and I don’t know who buys it quickly from here.” Despite not forecasting sizable returns, Thiel forecasted a volatile run for BTC, marked by steep corrections and price surges. During his sit-down at the Aspen Ideas Festival, the billionaire hinged his argument on the influx of institutional players via ETFs, name-checking Larry Fink’s BlackRock. Thiel highlighted an ideological shift in Bitcoin from its cypherpunk ideals, marked by privacy, decentralization, and stiff resistance to government control. However, a flurry of Bitcoin treasury companies, institutional asset managers, and governments launching strategic reserves with the asset have forced Thiel to lower his price target. The PayPal co-founder revealed that he still holds a small portion of BTC in his portfolio, reiterating his regrets for underinvesting in the asset. While Peter Schiff has issued a bleak forecast for BTC, several experts are bucking the trend with bullish projections. Strategy founder Michael Saylor is eyeing an end-of-year BTC price of $150,000 while making a strong case for a $1 million valuation before the end of the decade. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has also predicted a BTC price of $1 million, but did not disclose a timeline for the asset to reach seven figures. Meanwhile, Bitmex co-founder Arthur Hayes noted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is dead, noting that the sharp declines and parabolic rallies will be few and far between.

Title: Conway had 'head eaten off' by Schmidt over Munster move

Andrew Conway (r) signed for Munster in 2013 despite Joe Schmidt's attempts to keep him at Leinster Former Ireland and Munster back Andrew Conway had "hard conversations" with Joe Schmidt when making the switch from Leinster to Munster. The 34-year-old, whose career ended in 2023 because of a knee injury, had made 42 appearances for his home province at the time when offered a contract with fierce rivals Munster. Although he had been invited to the Munster Academy as a teenager when leaving Dublin's Blackrock College, Conway at that stage opted to stay at home. However, speaking to The Ireland Rugby Social podcast, he felt eventually making the switch to Thomond Park in 2013 was the "best decision" he made in his career despite how his then provincial coach Schmidt heard the news. "I trust my intuition and just felt it was the right thing to do, even though it was the hard thing to do," he said. "I signed the contract on the Thursday and Joe had rang me an hour after I had signed it, saying 'don't sign anything but come in and talk to me on Saturday'. I didn't have the forethought to say I'd signed so just said 'yeah, grand'. "On Friday, I went over to London to a football match with a couple of mates and came back the worse for wear on the Saturday. My agent had rang and said Gerry Thornley (of The Irish Times) knew about me signing and it was going into the paper, so Joe would have known. "I went in and got the head eaten off me, but a few hours later I find out why he was so annoyed - Johnny Sexton had signed for Racing and it was coming out, so my thing was small fish." This video can not be played Andrew Conway - the Dub who became a Munster Legend In the podcast, Conway talks about his 10 years at Munster where he made 150 appearances for his adopted province. Knee injuries would hamper his Ireland career as he missed out on two Grand Slams, a winning tour to New Zealand and the 2023 World Cup, something he described as "horrific", but Conway takes a philosophical view of his career. "I'd love a few more medals and caps, but have a mentality where I don't think about what I didn't achieve or don't have. "I'm more focused on the positives. Maybe it's a bit idealistic, but it's the truth."

Title: 'Congrats!' Billionaire ridiculed for pandering to Mamdani — after $1.7M attack campaign
URL: https://www.rawstory.com/congrats-billionaire-ridiculed-for-pandering-to-mamdani-after-1-7m-campaign/
Time Published: 2025-11-06T15:09:22Z
Full Content:
After his resounding election victory on Tuesday night, New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s most prominent billionaire antagonist immediately pivoted to kiss the ring of the man he has spent the last more than half-year portraying as an existential threat to the city and the country. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman poured over $1.75 million into the mayor’s race with a laser focus on stopping Mamdani, whom he often ambushed with several-thousand-word screeds on his X account, which boasts nearly 2 million followers. He accused Mamdani—a staunch critic of Israel—of “amplifying hate” against Jewish New Yorkers, while suggesting that his followers (which happened to include many Jewish New Yorkers) were “terror supporters.” Meanwhile, the billionaire suggested that the democratic socialist Mamdani’s “affordability” centered agenda, which includes increasing taxes on corporations and the city’s wealthiest residents to fund universal childcare, free buses, and a rent freeze for stabilized units, would make the city “much more dangerous and economically unviable,” in part by causing an exodus of billionaires like himself. In turn, Mamdani often invoked Ackman’s name on the campaign trail, using him as the poster boy for the cossetted New York elite that was almost uniformly arrayed against his candidacy. In one exchange, Mamdani joked that Ackman was “spending more money against me than I would even tax him.” After Mamdani’s convincing victory Tuesday night, fueled in large part by his dominant performance among the city’s working-class voters, Ackman surprisingly did not respond with “the longest tweet in the history of tweets” to lament the result as some predicted. Instead, he came to the mayor-elect hat in hand. “Congrats on the win,” he told Mamdani on X. “Now you have a big responsibility. If I can help NYC, just let me know what I can do.” Many were quick to point out Ackman’s near-immediate 180-degree turn from prophecizing doom to offering his help to the incoming mayor. “This guy went from acting like Mamdani was going to import ISIS to extending a friendly handshake… in like six hours,” noted one social media user. But Mamdani graciously accepted the billionaire’s congratulations when asked about them on Wednesday’s “Good Morning America.” “I appreciated his words,” Mamdani said. “I think what I find is that there is a needed commitment from leaders of the city to speak and work with anyone who is committed to lowering the cost of living in the city—and that’s something that I will fulfill.” As Bloomberg and Forbes noted, Ackman was just one of many on Wall Street and from the broader finance world who came to kiss the ring. Ralph Schlosstein, a co-founder of the investment fund BlackRock, Inc., pledged to work with Mamdani despite their different politics: “I do care deeply about the city, and I’m not going anywhere, whoever the mayor is. I’m going to do whatever I can to help him be successful,” he said. Another former BlackRock executive, Mark Kronfeld, said: “Is it a dystopian, post-apocalyptic environment because Mamdani has won? No.” Crypto billionaire Mike Novogratz even credited Mamdani with “tapping into a message that’s real: that we’ve got a tale of two cities in the Dickensian sense,” and asked if the incoming mayor could “address the affordability issue in creative ways without driving business out.” But while Mamdani has left the door open to business, he has made it clear that he will not allow them to commandeer his work at City Hall. After his victory, he called on his base of largely small-dollar donors to resume their financial support for him in order to fund “a transition that can meet the moment of preparing for January 1.” He announced that this historic all-female transition team will include at least one renowned titan of economic populism, the trust-busting former Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, as well as other progressive city administrators with backgrounds in expanding the social safety net and public housing. “I’m excited for the fact that it will be funded by the very people who brought us to this point,” Mamdani said, “the working people who have been lost behind by the politics of the city.” ALSO READ: Pentagon Marine tied to '6 bullets to head' threat against Pete Hegseth won't face probe Copyright © 2025 Raw Story Media, Inc.

Title: Crypto Pundit Predicts Major Move For XRP This Week, Here’s What

Time Published: 2025-11-06T13:00:32Z

Zach Rector, a well-known figure in the XRP community, has predicted that the altcoin will see a major surge in attention this week. His statement arrives at a time when Ripple and its ecosystem are at the center of market discussions following a series of impactful announcements, including new partnerships and product unveilings during the Ripple Swell 2025 conference in New York. Many traders and analysts are seeing the current week as significant for XRP, and the cryptocurrency could be on the brink of new momentum in both market performance and institutional adoption. Zach Rector is one of the most followed voices in the XRP community, and his comments often hint at broader market narratives rather than mere price speculation. Taking to the social media platform X, Rector noted in a tweet that XRP is going to go viral this week. Although he didn’t say much, his “going viral” statement can be interpreted as a signal that significant activity or announcements could push XRP into mainstream attention in the coming days. This comes as Ripple is positioning itself at the forefront of digital finance innovation, expanding its ecosystem beyond payments to include tokenization, stablecoins, and on-chain lending. The latest move in this vision is the recent confirmation by Ripple of its acquisition of Palisade, a wallet-as-a-service infrastructure provider, to bolster institutional custody solutions. This is an indication that the company is preparing for large-scale adoption across financial sectors. Rector’s comment arrived amidst the ongoing Ripple Swell 2025 conference that gathered hundreds of global institutions, government officials, and blockchain developers. Proposed attendees are from big names including BlackRock, Nasdaq, and the White House Office of Digital Assets. The event has already delivered headline-grabbing updates, including the introduction of an XRP Ledger-based lending protocol aimed at expanding enterprise-level decentralized finance. Ripple President Monica Long described the rollout as a key evolution in how businesses can access liquidity through blockchain technology. The company also announced a new partnership with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini to introduce RLUSD settlement on the XRP Ledger for fiat credit card payments. Rector’s post may ultimately prove prophetic. XRP is currently trading around $2.30 after a recent price crash at the beginning of this week. Recent 24 hours momentum, however, has seen rising buy-side transaction volumes consistent with renewed market interest. Ripple’s also recently completed a $500 million funding round led by Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities. This milestone adds to confidence that the company’s infrastructure is robust enough to support the next phase of growth. Several key factors are beginning to align, including talks of a potential XRP ETF in the US, and this period could be a turning point for Ripple and the price of XRP. At the time of writing, the altcoi is trading at $2.33, up by 3.8% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin has now reached a $1 billion market cap.

Title: Bolton ready to kick on after taste of Chicago

Michael Glennon RTÉ Sport Journalist Shayne Bolton hopes he can put into action some of the tips he picked up hanging out with the seniors when Ireland XV take on Spain tomorrow. The Connacht winger, who was capped against Portugal during the summer when most of the frontliners were away on British and Irish Lions duty, was added as a "cover" player for the trip to Chicago for Ireland v New Zealand. "The coach has been giving me a few work-ons in my game," the 25-year-old said of Andy Farrell ahead of the 4pm Irish time kick-off against Spain in Leganes. "I got loads of information [on the US trip], just seeing how the boys look at the game, especially the back threes, how they look at the game, what they're looking at, and how we can take opportunities in the game, looking for where we can attack in the game. "I think it was a really big two weeks for me, just being in the camp with them and seeing how the preparations go before a big Test week and just getting that feeling and the buzz around the place. "I feel way more comfortable over the last couple of weeks. I know almost everyone now. [I was] very nervous the first time I came in, just trying to be quiet and kind of sneak under the radar. "But now I'm bringing out my personality a bit more and feeling way more comfortable." Asked what he believes he needs to do to push on, the 6ft 2in back (above) said: "I think the preparation is almost more important than the game itself. "Obviously, we've lots of new detail or moves and stuff in the week before the game. "So usually with the provinces, all your calls are kind of the same consistently throughout the year, whereas we just have a week now to get that detail, all the moves sorted, how you execute that on the pitch. "I think we have two training sessions before the game. Stewart to skipper experienced Ireland XV "So they want to see how fast you can learn your detail, and how good you can execute that out on the pitch." Bolton was born in South Africa and had spells with the Blue Bulls and Cheetahs early in his career. After finding his progress stalled, he moved to Connacht in the summer of 2021. He qualifies for Ireland via his Dublin-born grandmother, Noirín Stapleton, who hails from Blackrock. He explained: "I grew up in South Africa, in Pretoria. I was born there. In school I played for the Blue Bulls, and after school I went to the Cheetahs academy in Bloemfontein, and then when I was 21 I got the contract offer from Connacht. "I only had a two-year contract out of school at the Cheetahs. "They didn't offer me a contract extension. So for my third year, I was basically just playing college rugby and I wasn't getting many opportunities there, so I decided to take a chance and come into Ireland and it's paid off. "[My grandmother] lived close to my home in Pretoria. I've known her all my life. "She's still with us. I see her every time I go back to South Africa to visit my family. [She’s] very proud of me, sending me messages every game-week. "[I've] no regrets. It's worked out as I hoped and more. I never thought I'd be in this environment so very thankful." isten to the RTÉ Rugby podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.

While other countries rapidly embrace blockchain-based market infrastructure, Australian institutions remain "too comfortable with the status quo,” Australian Securities and Investments Commission Chair Joe Longo said, while speaking at the National Press Club on Tuesday. Longo said that tokenization changes the “exclusivity” once limited to institutional players and high-net-worth investors, by allowing assets like private equity and fixed income to be “broken into smaller, more affordable units, and traded quickly and securely on a global scale.” "Australia faces a choice—to innovate or stagnate," Longo said. "Once, Australia was one of the early adopters of innovation in markets... Now, other countries are outpacing us." Speaking to Decrypt, Steve Vallas, CEO of Blockchain APAC, said Longo’s remarks “send a strong signal to traditional finance” to embrace tokenization, calling it a wake-up call for Australia and “the clearest message yet from our chief market regulator.” Vallas, who said he was in Washington “in rooms that included Mr Longo,” said seeing “the pace of change in these larger and faster markets” made the urgency clear, adding it was a reminder that “the world is moving and adapting and we need to do the same.” The ASIC chair noted that banking giant J.P. Morgan told him their money market funds will be entirely tokenized within the next two years, meaning "their investors will keep earning while value is moving instantly," compared to current technology where transactions take days to settle. Distributed ledger technology allows new players to “offer financial market services and challenge the status quo,” he added. Longo’s concerns come as industry leaders in the U.S, including former TD Ameritrade chair Joe Moglia, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, predict a global shift toward tokenization, while EU markets chief Natasha Cazenave has cautioned that the transformation must be matched with strong investor safeguards. The ASIC chair said he met with U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, where it became clear to him that Australia is vying for the same global capital as its peers, with only a short window to “seize a larger slice of this opportunity, and if the nation remains passive, it risks becoming “the land of missed opportunity.” The agency’s recent tokenization survey reportedly revealed troubling disengagement from the financial sector as around half of market participants declined to take part or even meet with regulators, with only one-third providing detailed feedback, according to Longo. Vallas argued that capital models aren’t the main barrier, noting that, “conviction comes first, capital treatment second,” and saying Longo’s signal helps boards move from hesitation to action rather than using regulation as an excuse to wait. Longo, who has previously called crypto “highly speculative” and Bitcoin’s rise “a classic case of the bigger fool theory,” said ASIC’s new digital-asset guidance is meant to give industry “regulatory certainty to innovate with confidence.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Federal Reserve allegedly pumped $29.4B into US banking system. That's not the actual total
URL: https://www.snopes.com//fact-check/federal-reserve-injecting-money-banking-system/
Time Published: 2025-11-06T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
About this rating The Federal Reserve actually injected banks with more than $50 billion in repo agreements on Oct. 31, 2025, which social media users correctly identified as an anomaly compared with the last five years. However, the Federal Reserve also sold about the same amount in reverse repo agreements that same day, meaning it also took about $50 billion from banks at the same time. These agreements are essentially overnight loans, and therefore get paid back with interest the following business day. In November 2025, some people on social media began posting screenshots of a chart from the Federal Reserve that they claimed was cause for alarm. The Fed, the posts claimed, pumped $29.4 billion into the U.S. banking system overnight on Oct. 31, 2025, a level the posts claimed surpassed the peak of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s. One X post (archived), which used a screenshot of the chart as evidence, was viewed millions of times in the next couple of days. Similar posts were widely seen and shared on Facebook (archived), Reddit (archived) and Threads (archived). While it is true that the Federal Reserve injected at least $29 billion into the U.S. banking system overnight on Oct. 31, that wasn't the total amount. The actual amount injected was $50 billion, through short-term transactions called repo agreements that are paid back the following business day. The same day, the Fed also took $50 billion out of the banking system in reverse transactions. For this reason, we've rated this claim a mixture of true and false information. The kinds of transactions highlighted in the posts are called repo agreements. As the Federal Reserve Bank of New York describes it, an overnight repo transaction is when the Fed purchases securities from another party with an agreement to resell those securities the next business day. Each repo transaction is economically similar to a loan collateralized by securities, according to the Fed. A reverse repo transaction does the opposite — the other party purchases securities from the Federal Reserve and the Fed buys those securities back the next business day. Repo agreements also can be made between private banks without the Fed's participation or assets and with different lengths of time before repayment. Because the Federal Reserve gives money to the bank when it buys its security in a repo agreement, it essentially infuses the bank with cash until the following business day, when the Fed sells back the security. When the Fed sells a security to the bank in a reverse repo agreement, it's taking cash from the bank for that business day in exchange for the interest the Fed pays the bank when it buys back the security. Therefore the Federal Reserve can use repo operations to ensure the smooth functioning of short-term funding markets by temporarily increasing available cash in the U.S. banking system through repo agreements or temporarily reducing cash in the system through reverse repo agreements, according to BlackRock Cash Management. The chart screenshotted in many of the posts was the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' graph of Treasury securities purchased by the Federal Reserve in overnight repo agreements. If you hover over Oct. 31, 2025, on that graph, you can see that the Federal Reserve purchased $29.4 billion of these securities in overnight repo agreements that day. That number stands out as far higher than any other over the past five years, which is the timeframe the graph defaults to. If you expand it to 10 years, however, you'll see that the Federal Reserve made far more purchases of Treasury securities in overnight repo agreements in 2019, when a technical glitch disrupted the private repo market and spurred the Federal Reserve into action, and in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic again upset the short-term funding market. But Treasury securities aren't the only securities the Federal Reserve buys and sells on the repo market. Its page for recent repo operations shows that the Fed also deals in agency securities and mortgage-backed securities. Between its two daily operations and three different securities, the Federal Reserve actually gave the banking system a temporary injection of $50.35 billion on Oct. 31. The Federal Reserve isn't just participating in the overnight repo market every day; it's also conducting overnight reverse repo operations each day. On Oct. 31, the Federal Reserve sold $51.80 billion in its operations that day. Therefore, between its repo agreements and reverse repo agreements, the Federal Reserve actually took $1.45 billion out of the short-term market that day. The data available from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis show that total securities purchased by the Fed through overnight repo agreements follow the same trends as Treasury security purchases: The operation was the biggest since 2020, but smaller than operations from 2019 and 2020. When traced back to 2000, this operation was larger than any other overnight repo operation outside of 2019 and 2020. Its reverse repo operation on Oct. 31 — which, again, took more money out of the system than that day's repo operation put into the system — was actually small compared to most of the reverse repo operations from the past five years. During a period between 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve regularly bought more than $2 trillion in securities through overnight reverse repo agreements, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. Prior to 2021, that $51.80 billion was significant for a reverse repo operation. Although the Federal Reserve regularly passed that number in operations between 2013 and 2020, it wasn't until 2021 that these operations started to balloon into the trillions. In 2021, following the scares in 2019 and 2020, the Federal Reserve became more active in the short-term funding market. That year, it established the Standing Repurchase Agreement (repo) Facility to serve as a backstop in money markets and support smooth market functioning. It has seen little use since its creation — something Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, expressed disappointment over on Oct. 31, the same day as the major jump in repo agreements — making the $50.35 billion in repo agreements on Oct. 31 a record since the Fed established it. Meanwhile, in 2022 the Federal Reserve's balance sheet peaked at nearly $9 trillion in assets and the interest rates it paid on reverse repos became higher than the yields on the securities it held, according to a Congressional Research Service report. By letting its securities mature and roll off the balance sheet and these reverse repos, the Federal Reserve has gradually reduced its balance sheet to about $6.6 trillion in assets. In Logan's Oct. 31 speech at a banking conference, she said the Federal Reserve will stop trying to reduce its assets as of Dec. 1. The Federal Reserve injecting money into short-term markets through repo agreements isn't necessarily a sign of looming crisis. In fact, Logan encouraged banks to use the Standing Repurchase Agreement Facility and thus take these cash infusions through repo agreements more often.

Title: Welcome to tokenization, where everything under the sun (and the sun) has its digital price

Tech by Blaze Media Our elites' latest scheme is to put anything that exists up for sale. In a recent appearance with Glenn Beck, Whitney Webb lays out her case that the Great Reset did not end with the election of Donald Trump. Elites, ever given to schemes involving central control, reallocation, and number-go-up, are planning to tokenize everything they possibly can, including natural resources. Webb draws a connective line between BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the World Economic Forum (not exactly a freedom-oriented outfit), digital ID, and this process of so-called tokenization. This term is new to many people. Essentially, tokenization refers to the process of placing a metric, a mark, an identifying code on an object. The identifying marker is then pumped into an aggregating and analytical machine. There is, no doubt, some obscurantism in the tech community, intentional or otherwise, as well as some heavy cognitive dissonance playing out for the rest of us as we watch the real, actual economy withering at our feet. How does giving (or selling) rights to natural resources like water help you and your neighbors pay bills, raise families, live in some semblance of accord with God? The coming system is intended to solve for the management of not just anything but everything. Neither Larry Fink nor the WEF are working on our behalf by digitizing water. Then what are they up to? Dropping in recently on CNBC, Fink said, “I do believe we’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets, from real estate to equities to bonds, across the board.” Through the implementation of natural resource assets, the plan is to mark, meter, and digitize water, trees, air, and animals of every sort, then pin their existence, in the digital tokens' monetized form, to the shared economy. That unlocks foreign investment and, one imagines, perpetuates some modified version of the ever-unstable and unsatisfactory financial enclosure of benefits and retirement that has, so far, kept enough U.S. citizens satiated to keep it rolling. Any and every AI is designed or able to adapt to the tokenization process. It needs be automatic and fast enough to keep up-to-the-minute record of millions or billions of transactions, sales, shorts, liquidations, and so forth. Rather than a system of streams or channels, the need is for computing to move like water itself. For Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hoping to participate in the tokenization bonanza, that means their encryption and storing of information (through so-called hashes and ledgers) needs to flow at the speed of the global digital economy. Indeed, we’ve seen for years that some lesser-known cryptocurrency companies, like Hashbar as one example, have been building their hash, as it were, to function within an AI-controlled global marketplace. These hash-products, not too dissimilar from Bitcoin in terms of their ledger-keeping properties, are meant, in a stupefying sense, to mark individual drops and tranches of liquid or digitally liquified assets. RELATED: Can anyone save America from European-style digital ID? Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images It's hard to visualize such unnatural and invisible arrangements, so here's a real-world example: Say you have 10,000 board feet of Douglas fir trees on a lot in Washington state. If the Fink version of tokenization goes forward, you’ll be able to “digitize” those useful board feet of wood and sell portions, as opposed to the whole lot. Now picture that process for, well, anything you can imagine and much that you can't. In simple terms, the likely outcome of all of this BlackRock-WEF-AI machination is immediate dissociation between the human and the trees, the fir needles, the smell of the soil. All of that, given enough backroom dealing, political sloth, and diabolical Wall Street ingenuity, will be erased. Are we talking about selling public lands? Theoretically, yes. Although major legal, regulatory, and political hurdles remain, the principle of leaving at least some portions of the created world exempt from actionable financial valuation is already eroding away. The accelerating logic of digital terraforming has no conceptual limit. Granting the premise that tokenization is good, not only should private property be tokenized, but all water, all minerals, and every possible other item with unexploited value rooted in human experience. The coming AI, digital ID, hash-rated system is intended to solve for the management of not just anything but everything. The disturbing undercurrent of plans, outcomes, and inertia around this improbable intersection of technologies gets more disturbing when you accept that it is, in fact, a long-term plan nearly realized. In her chat with Beck, Webb outlines another piece of the puzzle, termed “natural asset corporations.” This is pitched to the mainstream as a way to invest in conservation, ensure biodiversity, and so forth. But if we recall the century-long technocratic play, the current AI inertia, and the bipartisan support for anything to keep the fiat economy limping along, it’s easy to see how those natural assets under ownership might be subject to changes in any legal stipulation barring sales to other corporate or government entities. Those interlocking directorships have a knack for change. We haven’t even mentioned energy, but we must, because this scheme ultimately needs to take into account the sun itself! Who owns the sun? Well, BlackRock, of course. Or some quasi-tech giant/WEF version of BlackRock. Actually, no one owns the sun but God, and we have to remember this fact. By way of the wholly God-given system, we see that the sun feeds the grass, grass feeds the animals, we eat the animals. The technical details on the capture of energy are intense, involving data centers to run the AI, political control to rubber-stamp the terraforming for the electrical inputs, and, at some near point, the encrypting of energetic inputs into a digital (hashing) ledger to be monitored, metered, and controlled. You can probably see here how necessary the personal digital ID is to the entire panopticon. But if not, consider it unlikely that your or my interests are going to be taken into consideration by third-country customer service agents employed by the electrical company to manage our dissatisfaction in the event that a neighborhood brown-out is required while grid power is shunted over to the local data center.

Title: HYPE Price Bounces Back After $44M Whale Loss, Binance and Coinbase Support Boost

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The HYPE price has rebounded sharply, recovering from recent volatility that saw a $44 million whale liquidation earlier this week, which rattled traders. After plunging to around $36, the HYPE price surged over 7% in the past 24 hours, now trading around $40 as bullish sentiment returns. The rally follows its landmark listings on Binance and Coinbase, a move that has sparked renewed confidence in the fast-rising DeFi Layer 1 network. According to on-chain data from Coinglass, funding rates have flipped positive while whale accumulation has increased. Analysts suggest the next HYPE price target could be the $51.15 resistance level if buying pressure continues, with RSI levels slowly trending toward neutrality after oversold readings. The comeback supports Hyperliquid’s resilience despite high-leverage trading risks exposed by the whale’s massive loss. The simultaneous listings of HYPE on Binance and Coinbase have been pivotal for the recovery. Both exchanges introduced major trading pairs like HYPE/USDT and HYPE/BTC, dramatically improving global liquidity and accessibility. This dual-listing marks Hyperliquid’s official transition from a niche derivatives protocol into a mainstream DeFi contender, attracting both institutional and retail traders. Institutional interest has also accelerated following reports that BlackRock and Fidelity are exploring integrations of Hyperliquid’s oracle feeds into upcoming ETF products. Although no official confirmation has been issued, analysts view this as strong validation of Hyperliquid’s underlying technology, which is known for its sub-millisecond transaction speeds and hybrid consensus that combines proof-of-stake with zero-knowledge proofs. Technically, the HYPE price structure is showing early signs of recovery after testing key support around the 200-day EMA, near $38. If momentum holds, analysts expect a push toward $51.15, where the next major resistance sits. Meanwhile, daily active addresses have doubled in the past week, and Hyperliquid’s total value locked (TVL) has climbed over 150% since late October, evidence of sustained ecosystem growth. With funding rates turning positive and exchange inflows rising, traders anticipate that HYPE may regain its prior highs sooner than expected. While the whale’s $44 million loss remains a cautionary tale of leverage gone wrong, the market’s swift rebound suggests confidence in a further HYPE price surge.

Title: Letters to the Editor, November 6th: On housing, Ivan Yates, divisive politics, and wearing the poppy

Sir, – The report published by the Department of Finance on the housing crisis estimates it will continue for 15 years (“Ireland’s housing crisis to last another 15 years, Department of Finance predicts”, Business, November 4th). This report is not an economic diagnosis. It is an electoral death certificate. My children are still in secondary school but if they read this report they should probably prepare to emigrate. I voted for this Government and I would vote for it again – it is full of talented people with a genuine passion for the welfare of this country. But it is throwing its hands up and acting at times like a bystander on the issue of housing. No prosperous developed country has had a 30-year housing “crisis” and the word is as weary as the apologies and the excuses. No one is saying the solutions are easy but 60 years ago Seán Lemass and Ken Whitaker faced far greater challenges and rose to the occasion with energy. I’m no economist but it seems the only way out of a supply-side housing crisis in a small open economy is to incentivise builders and developers to come into the Irish market from all directions as a matter of urgency. That means more generous tax breaks and plenty of them. The left will carp about the Galway tent but if the Department of Finance is correct in its projections we’re not even at the races. – Yours, etc, MICHAEL DEASY, Bandon, Co Cork. Sir, – The front page of The Irish Times reports the Department of Finance predicts the housing crisis in Ireland is likely to persist for at least another 15 years. Less a crisis so, and more an acknowledgment of the impotence of Government to address this country’s most pressing need. – Yours, etc, TOMAS MCBRIDE, Letterkenny, Donegal. Sir, – I write in relation to the controversy surrounding my former Newstalk colleague, Ivan Yates. As the person who hired him as breakfast presenter in 2010, I have a long-standing appreciation for his qualities as a broadcaster. It is being suggested that his work coaching Fianna Fáil politicians has compromised his ability to comment on politics. I would argue that this conflates two distinct roles. In my judgment, based on years of observing him, Ivan is more than capable of providing professional, paid coaching to a politician while simultaneously representing his own robust and well-known views on air about that same politician or their party. His personal political stance on many issues have never been a secret; it is the bedrock of his pugnacious broadcasting style. This is not to dismiss the core of the issue. The appearance of bias is real, and declaring this coaching arrangement would have been the correct and transparent course of action. He made a serious error in judgment on this point. However, the greater loss would be to our public discourse if we were to exclude a voice like his. He is a premier league polemicist. He provokes, challenges and irritates in equal measure, but he always engages. He forces listeners to think, often by stating his case in the most uncompromising terms. In an era of increasingly sanitised media, this quality is rare and valuable. The wrong he did by not declaring a conflict was a serious one. However, the loss of his insightful, if sometimes infuriating, commentary from the national conversation would be a far more significant deprivation. We should encourage transparency and declaration, not the silencing of challenging voices. The former corrects the mistake; the latter punishes the audience. – Yours, etc, FRANK CRONIN, Sandycove, Co Dublin. Sir, – Like your correspondent Mark Paul, I never wore a poppy here in the UK, and was questioned a lot as to why (“British media sees red over Irish poppy refuseniks”, UK, November 4th). It was on a visit home that I noticed a Princess Mary tin on the family hall table. These were given to soldiers in the first World War, and contained tobacco or chocolate. I then realised that a member of my family took part in that war. I checked online and discovered there is a green poppy lapel pin to commemorate Irish men who fought in that war. At this time of year, if I’m invited to a formal event here in the UK, I might wear that pin. The tables are turned as I’m asked what it stands for, and it is then that people realise Irish men also fought in the trenches. – Yours, etc, JOHN BERGIN, Oxton, Wirral, UK. Sir, – On the matter of the British media’s (now annual) reaction to some Irish footballer’s choice not to wear the poppy, the outrage in some media outlets is indeed tired and predictable. Your correspondent Mark Paul’s piece noted as such. However, I would also note that Irish media’s (now annual) reaction to the reaction is equally tired and predictable. (Paul’s piece being this year’s iteration for The Irish Times.) Every year the Brits are outraged by the lack of poppies, and the Irish are outraged by the outrage. Perhaps we could all just not? – Yours, etc, EVAN BYRNE, London, UK. Sir, – Ireland ranks high in the global wealth of nations, according to the OECD, but like many of these wealthy nations, it also ranks high in inequality. Recent data shows wealthy nations are responsible for more than 80 per cent of global emissions against less than 1 per cent of emissions attributed to the poorest nations. Yet it is these poorest of nations that increasingly bear the brunt of the impact of climate change. In these regions the severe impacts of climate change, such as drought, extreme weather events, and soil erosion, have led to conflict, famine and the breakdown of social cohesion. This will continue to be a key driver of mass migration unless there is a global pivot in economic orthodoxy. The recent comments by Simon Harris and other politicians on immigration, mirror those of centre right and right-wing politicians in many western nations, and smack of entitlement. They do nothing to reflect the impact of their policies in driving wealth inequality in their own nations and the erosion of social infrastructure necessary to provide a robust safety net for their own citizens, and also to deal with the inward migration from poorer regions of the world. It is understandable there is frustration and anger in neglected parts of this country while the Government pushes a policy of corporate welfare. These areas also appear to be taking a disproportionate load of caring for asylum seekers when compared with more affluent areas, and this adds to frustration. The blaming of immigrants is an easy yet cynical tool of political deflection from the fact that successive centre-right governments have failed in to provide adequate housing, health and public transport for a huge cohort of workers and communities in this country. That our politicians don’t have the integrity to accept that their acquiescence to market driven economics is a significant factor in driving this social inequality smacks of arrogance and ignorance. With Cop30 kicking off in Brazil we are reminded that this economic model is failing globally to address the existential threat to humanity. Climate change will continue to drive global migration and unless there is a pivot to an economic model that pushes sustainability with a greater social dividend, we risk the ongoing breakdown of social cohesion through the rise of divisive politics. – Yours, etc, BARRY WALSH, Blackrock, Cork. Sir, – I was disgusted when I heard on Monday that DJ Carey had been sentenced to only 5½ years in prison for his “reprehensible fraud” in the words of Judge Martin Nolan, who sentenced him. Fraud is fraud but to do it in the manner that DJ Carey carried it out by pretending he had cancer to dupe money out of friends and acquaintances is the lowest of the low. I am receiving treatment for prostate cancer so this deception has an extra resonance for me. He took advantage of people’s good nature for his own selfish motives. – Yours, etc, TOMMY RODDY, Ballybane, Co Galway. Sir, – Before the general election of late November 2024, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael changed tack and announced they backed the Occupied Territories Bill, which they had obstructed for years. Opinion polls have consistently shown impressive support for the Bill. However, it is almost 12 months since that election and the Occupied Territories Bill is still not enacted. Moreover, there is no obvious sense of urgency around it. In the context of developments regarding the West Bank – with Israeli parliamentarians advocating full annexation and illegal settlements expanding – this is a sanction that should have been implemented promptly. Is the Government serious about this measure? If so, when will it happen? – Yours, etc, FINTAN LANE, Lucan, Co Dublin. Sir, – Ireland’s focus on increasing housing supply risks overlooking an equally critical priority – long-term energy security. In a volatile Europe, our dependence on imported fuels leaves the country acutely vulnerable. A disruption in supply would quickly expose how fragile that dependence is; new homes are of little use without reliable power to heat or light them. To safeguard our future, we should accelerate investment in large-scale renewable generation and in additional pumped-storage hydroelectric plants, such as Turlough Hill, to store surplus wind energy. Ireland has both the natural resources and the engineering capability to achieve near energy self-sufficiency, yet progress remains slow and piecemeal. Energy underpins every aspect of modern life. Without a secure and sustainable supply, economic growth and social stability alike are at risk. – Yours, etc, KEVIN GIBBONS, Leixlip, Co Kildare. Sir, – I wonder if anyone, during all the hubbub of the presidential election over the past few weeks, spared a thought for the many children who missed a day of their education as their school was used as a polling station. As a retired primary schoolteacher, I always felt my profession was diminished by the closing of my school for this reason. What other profession would allow their place of work to be shut down for use as a polling station? Apart from missing a school day, many children in DEIS schools also missed out on breakfast and a hot lunch. Why can’t we have elections on Saturdays or Sundays, like the majority of EU member states? – Yours, etc, EVA O’CARROLL, Dublin 14. Sir, – The various political parties that supported Catherine Connolly’s campaign for the presidency can claim their share of the credit for its success. Sinn Féin, as the largest party, may even claim their support turned out to be the game-changer promised by their leader Mary Lou McDonald. It has to be said, however, that the unique selling point in this election was Ms Connolly herself. Many of the 15,000 volunteers who flocked to the Galway woman’s campaign, like myself, were not members of any political party. We were ordinary members of the public attracted by the values the candidate stood for. One unique aspect of the campaign was Ms Connolly’s insistence on giving parity to both Irish and English in all her election literature. This was never done by any political party or individual in the history of the State. Indeed the prominence given to Irish, and its resonance with young people, appears to have taken many commentators by surprise. The various political parties can claim whatever credit they like but the key to this successful campaign was Ms Connolly herself. You might be able to buy support from professional media advisers but you can’t buy the support of volunteers, who were attracted to the authenticity they saw in Ms Connolly. She went from rank outsider in July to being the pident elected with the greatest number and percentage of votes in the history of the State. Comhghairdeas léi. – Yours, etc, JOHN GLENNON, Hollywood, Co Wicklow. Sir, – When I was a child my dad would drive our family of five, packed into a Ford car, to a hotel in Bettystown, Co Meath, for a week’s holiday. Every evening the waiter would ask if we would like either chicken and ham (cold), salmon (cold) or a fry! Simple times, simple fare! – Yours, etc, LAURA O’MARA, Stillorgan, Co Dublin. Sir, – With regard to Irish being spoken in the Áras, I recently overheard two francophone kids on the bus in Brussels repeating Irish phrases from Duolingo. When asked why they were learning Irish, they replied: “We need a secret language so our teachers don’t understand us!” If Irish is alive in the polyglot heart of Europe, why not in the heart of Dublin? – Yours, etc, COLM CARROLL, Bruxelles, Belgium. Sir, – It sounds like the despairing guard in Rearcross, Co Tipperary writing of his woe in Beckettian style could have done with the presence of a colleague to ease his loneliness (“‘This is a godforsaken place’: A despairing letter from a garda stationed in Tipperary in 1940”, An Irishman’s Diary, November 4th). He was, in a sense, waiting for garda. – Yours, etc, BRIAN AHERN, Clonsilla, Dublin 15. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Carl Icahn’s net worth plummets by billions — nearly 75% — after battle with short seller
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/11/05/business/carl-icahns-net-worth-plummets-by-billions-after-battle-with-short-seller/
Time Published: 2025-11-05T20:31:23Z
Full Content:
Carl Icahn’s fortune has plummeted from a recent peak of about $17.5 billion to roughly $4.8 billion — the biggest drop of his storied career — after a bruising battle with short-seller Hindenburg Research, according to Forbes. The nearly 75% drop in Icahn’s net worth from 2023 to this year came as Hindenburg accused his firm of inflated valuations and unsustainable dividends — allegations Icahn strongly rejected. The 89-year-old activist investor — once considered one of Wall Street’s fiercest corporate raiders — insisted in a recent series of interviews with The Wall Street Journal that he’s still a fighter. He also reportedly enjoys betting on NFL games every week, winning about $80,000 through bets on the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. Friends of Icahn told The Journal that he spends more time reading and reviewing investments than socializing, though he remains on civil terms with his estranged wife, Gail. His health, while fragile after recent surgeries, has reportedly stabilized. Recent years have seen Ichan battle a series of challenges including an operation on his ankle that left him unable to walk comfortably for months and forced him to give up daily tennis. Soon after, he was treated for an enlarged spleen, with medication initially causing fatigue and shortness of breath — though he says he never missed a day of work because of the procedure. “I keep going,” he recently told The Journal. “I enjoy the game.” But the game has changed. Icahn Enterprises — once a symbol of his ruthless success — has lost about 80% of its market value since the May 2023 short-selling attack by Hindenburg Research. The short seller likened Icahn’s business model to a “Ponzi-like” structure. Icahn dismissed the allegations as lies, but the fallout erased billions from his fortune and sent his company’s stock to its lowest level in decades. The decline was amplified by Icahn’s own use of leverage. He pledged more than half his holdings in Icahn Enterprises as collateral for personal margin loans. When the stock price collapsed, lenders forced him to renegotiate to avoid a margin call. Icahn fought back in familiar fashion, denouncing short sellers and defending his accounting practices. “They took part of my army away, like Alexander the Great,” Icahn told The Journal when asked about the fallout of the Hindenburg attack. “He has to change his battle plans, but it’s not that bad,” he added. Inside Icahn Enterprises, succession planning has grown uncertain, according to The Journal. The founder’s son Brett Icahn rejoined the firm in 2020 under a seven-year contract, but recent bets have stumbled. A major position in Bausch Health lost more than $700 million, and key lieutenants have departed. One, Steven Miller, left after clashing with Brett Icahn; another, Andrew Teno, is now chief executive and considered the most likely operational successor. Carl Icahn himself still lives and works in near isolation at his waterfront home on Miami’s Indian Creek Island, known as “Billionaire Bunker,” The Journal reported. Icahn insisted to the publication that the tide is turning. He pointed to a rebound in third-quarter earnings — among the company’s best ever — and says new investments in EchoStar and Monro, an auto-service chain, signal fresh momentum. Icahn Enterprises reported $287 million in net income last quarter — up sharply from a year earlier — buoyed by gains in CVR Energy, the refiner it controls. Stay up on the very latest with Evening Update. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Yet Icahn’s focus has shifted beyond balance sheets. He has launched a campaign against what he calls the “cartel” of BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, arguing that their dominance of index-fund voting power has neutered shareholder activism. He’s drafting a white paper urging Congress and President Trump to restrict their influence, convinced that activists like himself are vital to corporate accountability, The Journal reported. He says his greatest investment remains the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, which he endowed with $200 million in 2012. He also funds animal charities and still believes his activism makes capitalism stronger. Still, Icahn admitted to being too proud in the past. “It was hubris,” he told Puck News last year. “I thought I could figure out what the market was going to do. That’s the dumbest thing you can do.” Advertisement

Title: Bitcoin ETF Fever Spreads: BlackRock Targets Australian Market Next

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. BlackRock will list an iShares Bitcoin ETF on the Australian Securities Exchange in mid-November 2025, according to public filings and market reports. The product will be a local wrapper around BlackRock’s US iShares Bitcoin Trust — a vehicle that launched in January 2024 and now manages about $85 billion. Based on reports, the new ASX ticker will charge a management fee of 0.39% per year. The move aims to give Australian investors an easier way to gain exposure to bitcoin through a familiar exchange-listed product. Reports have disclosed that investors who buy the ASX ETF will not hold bitcoin in a private wallet; they will have exposure through the ETF’s structure. That means price swings in bitcoin still apply. It also means custody and technical handling are managed by the fund rather than each investor. The fee of 0.39% is competitive when compared with many retail crypto services, but traders and long-term holders will want to check how closely the ETF tracks bitcoin’s price and what trading spreads look like on the ASX. According to filings, the ASX listing will use the US trust as the underlying asset, which raises questions about cross-market flows and the mechanics of how units are created and cancelled. Liquidity on the local exchange, and how market makers support the product, will shape how cheaply investors can enter and exit positions. BlackRock’s entry could prompt other asset managers to list similar products in Australia. Based on reports, the launch follows a wave of spot bitcoin ETF approvals and listings in other markets since early 2024. For retail investors who avoided direct crypto custody, an ETF on the ASX removes some of the operational hurdles. But it does not remove market risk: bitcoin’s price can move sharply. Regulators in Australia have already been refining rules around crypto products, and the presence of a major global manager will put those rules under closer scrutiny. Smaller providers offering bitcoin exposure through different structures may face tougher competition on fees and access. Reports have also highlighted potential downsides: an ETF wrapper can add a layer of cost and complexity, and investors may misunderstand the difference between owning the underlying asset and owning ETF units. Custody arrangements, insurance, and how the trust sources and stores bitcoin are items that advisers and sophisticated buyers will examine. According to market watchers, the timing — mid-November 2025 — matters. Investor appetite, bitcoin’s price action and broader market sentiment around that time will affect how much money flows into the new ETF. For many Australians, this will be a new, regulated route into bitcoin exposure. For the market, it is another step toward mainstream channels where big asset managers compete for crypto assets on familiar ground.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Foreign asset managers have often faced challenges in establishing distribution networks within India. Other international firms, such as BlackRock, Amundi, and Schroders, have also established partnerships with domestic firms to reach India’s retail investor base. Recently, BlackRock and its partner Jio Financial Services have launched mutual fund products in India, targeting significant growth over the coming seven years. Jefferies Financial Group is also preparing to enter the Indian market.

PHOTO: ST FILE Navene Elangovan Published Nov 05, 2025, 06:50 PM Updated Nov 05, 2025, 09:15 PM SINGAPORE – Local shares ended lower on Nov 5, on the back of a sharp sell-off overnight of tech and artificial intelligence (AI) stocks on Wall Street. Ms Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo, said that AI valuations are under scrutiny, with investors questioning whether their growth can justify their lofty valuations. She added that markets could be entering a phase of valuation correction, rather than further multiple expansion. Key indexes in the region also closed lower. South Korea’s Kospi fell 2.9 per cent and Japan’s Nikkei slipped 2.5 per cent. Australia’s ASX 200 declined 0.1 per cent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.1 per cent. In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) fell 0.1 per cent or 5.6 points to close at 4,417.12. Meanwhile, the iEdge Singapore Next 50 Index lost 1.2 per cent or 16.92 points to 1,443.28. Yangzijiang Shipbuilding was the biggest decliner on the STI, falling 2.9 per cent or 10 cents to $3.33 after BlackRock sold 37.8 million shares. Local telco Singtel was the top blue-chip gainer, rising 0.7 per cent or three cents to $4.27. The three local banks ended mixed. OCBC Bank was up 0.2 per cent or three cents at $17.06, but UOB fell 0.1 per cent or five cents to $34.87. DBS Bank ended flat at $53.50. CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust remained the most actively traded counter on the STI by volume, with 50.2 million units worth $115.6 million traded. The counter fell 0.9 per cent or two cents to $2.31. Across the broader market, decliners outnumbered advancers 326 to 236, after 1.5 billion securities worth $2.1 billion changed hands. Ms Chanana from Saxo said that several scenarios could play out, depending on market conditions. For instance, if there are no major macroeconomic shocks, and the US Federal Reserve continues to hint at easing its monetary policy, the market could pull back modestly. However, rising yields or slowdown in AI spending could lead to a deeper decline in markets. “Investors may wish to balance opportunities with caution, recognising both potential upside and downside risks,” she said.

Title: Carbon Offsetting is Not Going to Save the Planet

There is not enough planet Earth to first turn it inside out and then turn it outside in again. Available resources do not allow for removal of the total aggregate of CO2 from the fossil fuels in stock. Instead, removal should, for all the reasons we examined in the appendix of caveats, be conceived as a restricted practice, hemmed in on all sides by limitations—of energy, of land, of subsurface storage sites, of everything needed to get underway—more in the nature of advanced surgery than basic hygiene. A question then arises: what are we going to use it for? To what end should the precious removal capacity be deployed? If negative emissions technologies can indeed attain consequential scale, should they be pressed into the service of life extension for fossil capital? Although they may serve that purpose already, even before they have entered the material world, the imminent risk is that, upon actual entry, they will be corralled into business-as-usual, as in DAC plants for enhanced oil recovery. Removal will then be negated into its opposite. This would be in accordance with the universal law of capital devouring everything potentially good and excreting it as something actually bad. Here the most egregious instance might be the use of removal to re-animate fossil fuel companies in general and enhanced oil recovery in particular, but there is something broader at work, which we might call late value form. In the overshoot conjuncture, capital seeks to press negative emissions technologies into the production of exchange-value. Against it stands any interest in deploying them for the use-value of reversal. Here, then, is a second axis of contestation around negative emissions technologies: intersecting with late technopower is late value form. A concrete example would be communities protesting against projects for enhanced oil recovery. In Texas, Elida Castillo, a Latino environmental justice activist and community organizer, voiced dismay over the arrival of a DAC plant in her neighborhood: she and other residents were “worried about the dangers of storing CO2 where they live, the risk of new pipelines being built, and whether DAC is a good use of money in the first place. And there’s reason for distrust. After all, the DAC plant belongs to Occidental”: “ “You’re pretty much entrusting the bank robbers to guard the safe,” Castillo said.” Popular opposition focused on those projects both endangering their resources and enriching the very companies that fan the flames of heating. But the state apparatus was of a different mind. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm praised Oxy for “exactly the kind of bold thinking we need more of.” Her own thinking and that of Hollub—the secretary, the CEO— were in convergence. Months after the former took up her position under Biden, she asserted that “traditional fossil energy is going to remain important, even as we work to reduce carbon emissions”; echoing Nordhaus, “we’re also putting our brain power at the Department of Energy and our financial resources to work” on “approaches like direct air capture.” (“We need to extend the life of oil production,” maintained Hollub, because it “makes the world a better place.”) For its boldness, Oxy was awarded one of two major government grants for developing a “DAC hub,” in Texan oil country (the other went to Climeworks and Heirloom). The cheque was for $500 million. The state also offered companies a tax credit, known as 45Q, for every ton of CO2 they grabbed hold of. For every ton, that is, they could apply for relief from tax payment, a form of indirect reward to (supposedly) green activities much favored by the American state. Under the first edition of Trump, companies would receive $50 per ton captured through DAC, even when it was utilized for enhanced oil recovery. Biden then raised this handout to $130. The “Office of Fossil Energy” under Granholm’s department was renamed the “Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management,” its mission redefined as “research, development, demonstration, and deployment to minimize the environmental and climate impacts of fossil fuel and industrial processes”—sewage as state ideology. This office celebrated an annual “Carbon Management Day,” as if to give the highest imprimatur to the ideas of a Lackner or a Keith. Support for late value form became a pillar of the climate politics of the Biden administration. Meanwhile, the US “produces more crude oil than any country, ever,” the same state apparatus proudly announced, the curve steadily rising under Biden, new records forecast—for oil and gas—in 2024 and 2025, no end in sight. With the various boons, his administration might have also created the condition for a boom in enhanced oil recovery, similar to the earlier one in fracking. Possibly of even greater moment, it locked the development of DAC technology into late value form. “These hubs are going to help us prove out the potential of this game-changing technology so that others can follow in their footsteps,” exulted Granholm; they would “position the United States as the location to demonstrate the commercial viability of direct-air capture,” concurred Hollub. The program, was explicitly conceived to help midwife DAC in the US and the rest of the world. If successful, this productive force— supposed to be restorative, in at least some visions—would grow up in symbiosis with primitive fossil capital. Client states of the hegemon, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, readied themselves to assist in the upbringing. Approaching 1.5°C could seem like a moment without precedent. But the world had ended up there by passing through an unbroken series of decisions not to cut emissions and to do something else instead; and this practice had become so habitual and systemic as to threaten to determine the next phase too. How would this nestling fare under the second Trump? In early 2025, no one could say with any certainty; consistency and predictability were not among the primary qualities of this president. Employees at the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management responsible for removal were laid off and payments to DAC hubs frozen—not necessarily because of any Trumpian antagonism towards these technologies as such, but because of the way he and Musk set their wrecking balls working on the state apparatus. This could hollow out support mechanisms. But Hollub, for one, was not losing any sleep over it. If DAC could provide the lubricant to keep the country’s oil wells productive a good while longer, then even the 2025 version of Trump should love it—indeed all the more so. It would help him get that liquid gold from under his feet. “President Trump knows the business case for this. I’ve had several conversations with him,” Hollub assured a group of slightly jittery investors. In fact, “I think the election of Donald Trump to become our next president is going to be very positive for our industry, especially for our direct air capture.” Perhaps it would do some good for BECCS too. Trump’s secretary of the interior was Doug Burgum, previously the governor of North Dakota. He was “obsessive about carbon capture” and “the technology’s chief evangelist” in that state. Burgum was a staunch advocate of the Midwest Carbon Express, the misunderstood CO2 pipeline. He thought it offered beguiling economic opportunities, not least because the substance it carried could bring new life to North Dakota’s aging fields of shale oil. Nothing could be more indicative of the nature and power of late value form than the prospect that even the most unashamedly denialist administration might jump onto its bandwagon. But late value form extended far beyond such cartoonishly ghoulish companies as Oxy and Exxon and Aramco. No less prominent was the later crop of digital enterprises with an enlightened mien: Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, Shopify. How did they inject removal into their veins? Through offsetting, of course. This practice had its own history, another tributary to the overshoot conjuncture that weighed heavily on its future course. Indeed, the currents and sheer force running through this stream might well sweep up the technologies launched in the 2020s, because it had already done so several times before. Approaching 1.5°C could seem like a moment without precedent. But the world had ended up there by passing through an unbroken series of decisions not to cut emissions and to do something else instead; and this practice had become so habitual and systemic as to threaten to determine the next phase too. A short story starring Microsoft By the early 2020s, the removal business was structured by the logic of offsetting through and through. In the Cambrian explosion of technologies, the startups taking them to the market competed for survival by selling credits. Fledgling entrepreneurs fell over each other to position themselves as the vendors of the newest, hottest, most effective, most trustworthy certificates of removed CO2. Insofar as these were purchased by consumers with an interest in glossing over an actual release of that gas, no net removal would happen: through the transaction, the –A would simply be matched with +A, in a zero-sum game that could not possibly power reversal. It would at best be running to stand still. This lapse into the default of offsetting was not the result of evil design, nor was it a cover-up of the sort pathological sex addicts might engage in. It was the result of a structural imperative, namely the commonplace market imperative: a producer of removal had to sell their product on the market or else go under. Buyers would, by definition, be the source of demand. Only one other scenario could be dimly made out in the distance: governments stepping in and funding removal out of collectively pooled resources, for its own sake. Until that day, the business would have to be mediated through the market and run the risk of descent into late value form. Consumers entering this marketplace could pick up the catalogue and browse: fancy some credits from Living Carbon and its genetically modified poplars? Or perhaps feces from Vaulted Deep, seaweed from Running Tide, rocky dust from Lithos, or the latest squishy white balls from Spiritus? Here the most enthusiastic customers often came not from primitive fossil capital but from fossil capital in general—companies not producing but consuming fossil fuels in the process of money-making and wishing, for whatever reason, to even them out with credits. One customer was in a league of its own: Microsoft. By the early 2020s, the market had been conceptually divided between “durable” removals—the high-end niche, the hard diamonds of the bazaar: CO2 supposedly stowed away permanently through DAC, BECCS, enhanced weathering, biochar—and those with a reputation for ephemerality, notably trees: the variety store. The market for durables appeared to be booming, from close to zero in 2020 to 134 companies peddling their goods in 2024. On the side of the buyers, as of that year, the market was Microsoft: it alone bagged almost two thirds of all credits sold. The proclivities of this company might have stemmed from its founder Bill Gates, long worried about the state of the world, an early benefactor of the startups—including Carbon Engineering— author of How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need; to sum up his CV, the late human face of capitalism. He personified all the usual characteristics of overshoot ideology: the transition is bound to be gradual, and it can only ever be incomplete. “There are no realistic paths to zero that involve abandoning these [fossil] fuels completely,” and so instead, the future we face is one in which “we will still be producing some emissions, but we’ll have some ways to remove the carbon they emit.” Under his spiritual leadership, Microsoft went on a shopping spree. One mega-purchase followed another. In May 2024, Microsoft publicized the single largest transaction on this market, until that point: a deal with Stockholm Exergi for the delivery of credits from its future BECCS plant. The tech giant would thereby “obtain legal title to those removals,” in its own words (ecocapitalist outlet GreenBiz filed the news under the category “Practical Magic”). This followed a mega-purchase from Danish energy company Ørsted, which also promised to operate a BECCS plant in the near future and have the CO2 shipped to the Northern Lights. Then came a deal with 1PointFive to buy credits from Stratos—the largest sale of DAC credits thus far. Unlike Oxy’s other plans for that plant, the CO2 removed under Microsoft’s patronage would be “securely stored through subsurface saline sequestration and will not be used to produce oil and gas.” Microsoft was a believer. “We believe that the time for responsibly scaling BECCS is here and look forward to the coming wave of project developments.” “DAC plays an important role in Microsoft’s carbon removal portfolio.” But Microsoft was a promiscuous shopper; it also bought credits from Lithos and, not as durable, forests in countries like India, Brazil, Peru. What for? In January 2020, on the crest of the wave of popular mobilizations for the climate, Microsoft made a sensational announcement: it would become “carbon negative” by 2030. After that date, it would remove more CO2 from the atmosphere than it emitted, to the point—scheduled for 2050—when there would no longer be any molecules attributable to it. All the company had emitted since Gates founded it in 1975 would be gone, the full footprint washed away. The communiqué earned a tremendous amount of positive press. Stories included lines such as the following. “The thing about Microsoft’s work that I love, love, love is the investment in climate equity and environmental justice. This has been missing from the corporate dialogue. More companies should take this kind of intersectional lens.” Microsoft claimed to have been “carbon neutral” since 2012, thanks to its spendthrift purchasing of offsets; now it would raise the bar and go flat-out negative. This was indeed something new under the bourgeois sun. Never before had a company—and not any company: one of the largest capitalist corporations on Earth; by some counts, the largest—pledged to undo the totality of the harm it had inflicted on the climate system. It would do so of its own volition, no government interference needed. It was about to set an example for the rest of humanity to follow—maybe all the way back to a pre-capitalist climate. About midway into the decade that would turn Microsoft negative, a bit of a hiccup was reported. By its own admission, the company’s emissions were 29 per cent higher four years into the decade than at its start—up nearly by a whopping third, that is. This was not quite the example for humanity, nor the route that led to negativity. Nothing indicated that the removal credits Microsoft was snapping up were enough to cancel out these emissions, let alone surmount them. At the very best, it was now operating within the fourth configuration of continue and ameliorate—at most the credits offset a fraction of the gush. One driver was all the energy and steel needed for the ever-growing data centers, courtesy, in part, of the AI boom. That boom looked like it would largely be powered by newly constructed gas plants. But the problem went beyond the fossil fuels Microsoft burned within its own process of producing profit, and indeed those consumed by individuals using its software. Few clients of this company were as weighty as the fossil fuel companies themselves. Microsoft was plainly not about to wash away its own or anyone else’s footprint. Indeed, emissions from the fossil fuels it helped bring to the surface were not even counted among those it wished to neutralize and remove. The overshoot conjuncture coincided with a major thrust towards digitalization, computerization, automation of oil and gas extraction: and Microsoft was the supplier second to none. In 2020, Barclays published a report lauding the advances of cloud services, AI, machine learning, remote sensing, edge computing and related technologies into the oil and gas fields of the world, speeding up discoveries, optimizing the location of wells, maximizing recovery rates, improving throughput in pipelines and so on and so forth: through the digital nostrils, yet another breath of life into primitive fossil capital. It would cut costs and increase production and, summum bonum, raise profits. “Big Tech has made a big push into the Oil & Gas sector,” noted Barclays, and “Microsoft has been the most aggressive, saying that Oil & Gas is the #1 growth market for its cloud services”; and true to form, “Microsoft has become the cloud server of choice for the industry.” A particularly rewarding product was the cloud computing platform Azure. Just as Microsoft prepared to go negative, it entered a series of highly durable deals with ExxonMobil, Chevron, Equinor, Halliburton, Schlumberger, Petrofac and other heavyweights for integrating Azure into their operations. Microsoft went to the Gulf, to an exhibition hosted by ADNOC, and gave its pavilion the theme “Empowering Oil & Gas with AI.” In the very week when the company made the “moonshot” announcement about going negative, it took center stage at an expo on a similar theme hosted by Aramco. Had it changed its mind? Two years after the announcement, Microsoft confirmed that it would continue to sell its commodities “for subsurface exploration and extraction of fossil fuels.” In 2023, the chief technical architect at its center in Houston posted a gushing accolade to the industry—always “at the forefront of innovation, constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible”—and now, thanks to his own company, once more “unlocking previously inaccessible reserves.” “With Azure, the future of oil and gas exploration and production is brighter than ever.” By this point, some employees were so disgusted by the hypocrisy that they quit their jobs. Microsoft was plainly not about to wash away its own or anyone else’s footprint. Indeed, emissions from the fossil fuels it helped bring to the surface were not even counted among those it wished to neutralize and remove. In the material world, this company reinforced the wall blocking every path to climate stabilization. By selling means of production to primitive fossil capital, Microsoft profited from the tendency of fixed capital to rise in extraction and built up more assets that must not be stranded: for every mega-purchase of Azure sunk into a field, the incentive grew to keep the oil gushing. No BECCS from Stockholm or DAC from Texas could come close to offsetting this propagation of business-as-usual. But Microsoft might indeed have set the standards for what other tech companies were expected to do, even if they lagged behind. Shopify stood behind the united Frontier. Like most others, it nominally stuck to the principle of first reducing emissions and then adding removal to go the extra mile. Like Microsoft, it was, in fact, rapidly increasing emissions, mainly by encouraging its employees to fly between offices. But Shopify claimed that its bag of removal credits offset all the emissions from delivering commodities on Black Friday. Google was another regular in the malls of removal. It was a heavy consumer of Indian biochar, Brazilian rock dust, bio-oil charms and DAC credits from a new startup called Holocene (time machine as trademark). But it too was riding an AI wave that caused its emissions to curve steeply, by almost 50 per cent since 2019—in the direction opposite, of course, from reduction. It was happily publishing greenwashing ads by oil and gas companies on its various platforms. Among its prominent cloud computing customers was Saudi Aramco. Alongside Google, there was JPMorgan, which invested in Frontier, and in Climeworks, and in forests; and, in every year after the Paris Agreement save one, it was the bank that poured the most money into fossil fuel projects. Even the emissions intensity of its investments was headed upwards. (“We are thinking about commercial value, it’s not for philanthropic purposes only that we buy carbon removal. From a reputation perspective, it brings value to our brand. Our customers expect us to do it,” explained the head of “carbon management” at JPMorgan.) Another proud backer of Frontier was number one consulting firm McKinsey; and it continued to work tightly with clients like ExxonMobil and Aramco and allied with Sultan Al Jaber to temper ambitions at COP28. The same BlackRock that lifted Stratos off the ground was perfectly clear about its intention not to stop investing in fossil fuels, now or in the future. Then there was Elon Musk, who, with his XPrize Carbon Removal, preened in more stardom and pioneership than most. His uncompromising commitment to removal was plastered in large, capital letters on the website of the Prize: “We want teams to build real systems that can make measurable impact at a gigaton level. Whatever it takes. Time is of the essence.” In an interview carried out around the time the Prize was announced, he professed his concern that “there is some risk of non-linear climate change” and it would be “not wise to take” that risk. But as part of his rightward drift, he also told a festival organized by the far-right Brothers of Italy that “climate change is exaggerated in the short term” and “we should not demonize oil and gas in the medium term.” In 2024, he shoveled a few hundred million dollars into denialist-in-chief Donald Trump’s second run for president. In a candid chat between the two billionaires—described as “the dumbest climate conversation of all time”—Musk shared with Trump his views on the climate crisis. Now time was no longer of the essence. “We don’t need to rush and we don’t need to like, you know, stop farmers from farming or, you know, prevent people from having steaks or basic stuff like that.” More concerned about peak oil than an overheating planet, Musk went on to explain that CO2 concentrations would only become a concern around 1,000 ppm, when “it actually simply gets uncomfortable to breathe” and “you start getting headaches and nausea.” The bromance continued inside the White House, where Musk and Trump together rolled back whatever little progress the Biden administration had made on climate and then rolled some more. Tangled and twined though it might seem, there was a thread running through this performance. For all his apparent schizophrenia, Musk embodied a key feature of overshoot ideology: there was no inherent contradiction between denying the depth of the climate problem and posing as the über-patron of innovations for removal. The two themes could play a perfect symphony. All one had to do would be to rethink what removals are for (or shake off any post-substitutionist illusions about it). As part of Musk’s rightward drift, he also a festival organized by the far-right Brothers of Italy that “climate change is exaggerated in the short term” and “we should not demonize oil and gas in the medium term.” The black hole of fossil fuels was not, in other words, only expanded by the likes of Oxy. Everything else was affected by its gravitational pull and drawn into the work of dilating it further—even the firms rumored to be at the farthest remove from the crudity, even negative emissions technologies and the market on which their credits circulated. The ecumenical engagement with removal merely confirmed the integration between primitive fossil capital and every other circuit of accumulation. Vicky Hollub and Bill Gates were bedfellows (as evidenced by their shared interest in Carbon Engineering). From their respective sides, they pulled removal into late value form—which, it is important to repeat, functioned through ideology as much as through processes of production. Gates did not get any directly enhanced oil, like Hollub. But he and Microsoft earned a first-class reputation. Everything is unavoidable In these days of net zero, there was an added rationale for removal: some emissions were “unavoidable.” Or, they were “residual” or “hard to abate”—however one chose to put it, impossible to do without. To get to zero, they would have to be effaced by negative emissions of the same magnitude. This line of reasoning had the formal seal of approval from the IPCC; indeed, it was one justification for removal in the IAMs. But what, really, was unavoidable? IPCC models typically left a rump of 20 per cent of current emissions in this category, after the rest had been mitigated—one fifth, that is, would have to remain in effect and balanced out by removal (over and above any return assignment). Countries were betting on roughly the same amount in the plans they submitted to the UN; but their assumptions and definitions and interpretations of “residual” were all over the place. The International Energy Agency turned out to be less resigned to the things that exist and capped this class of emissions at 5 per cent. Companies themselves worked with everything from 0 to 80 per cent; Microsoft’s hypothetical decarbonization pathway appeared to count on close to 50. The extent of the unavoidable seemed to be in the eye of the beholder. In a world overstocked with assets at risk of being stranded, the temptation to classify emissions as “unable to be prevented or stayed away from”—the meaning of “unavoidable,” according to the Cambridge Dictionary—seemed plain as a pikestaff. There was something arbitrary about the way this term and its synonyms were bandied about. Unless the category could be brought under control, the excess threatened to self-propagate. The more removals used for offsetting, the less available for reversal. Late value form becomes the underwriting of luxury. One solution was to reserve the category for a select few sectors: agriculture (think methane from cows or rice paddies), aviation, shipping, cement, petrochemicals—all difficult to disconnect from emissions, on the common view. (We discussed several of these in Overshoot.) However great the difficulties, they did not shrink with the common assumption that said sectors would continue to grow. This led to the slightly absurd belief that the cumbersome category of unavoidability was itself inexorably growing: not only could the world not help emitting a great deal, it also could not help doing it ever more. Many things were here naturalized at once. Take aviation, for instance. It was the prototypical member of the residual club: people want to fly; planes run on jet fuels; there are no substitutes at hand; hence these emissions must be accepted—their growth to boot—and treated by means of removal. But consider again Bill Gates. He was a very frequent flyer. He owned a private jet, a Bombardier BD-700 Global Express, complete with a salon of discreetly beige seats. In 2017, he took sixty flights and left a plume of more than 1,600 tons of CO2 in his wake. This gave Gates, from the use of his private jet alone, the same carbon footprint as a small town in Burundi. He did not think this was a problem, because Bill Gates was an avid investor in removal and devotedly offset his sins with credits. He bought them from Climeworks— indeed, he boasted of being its largest individual customer. On the generally accepted logic of unavoidability, Gates’s flying emissions would fall in this inviolable category. This one billionaire would thereby be entitled to a disproportionate share of—remember, by nature limited—removals, simply by virtue of his ability to pay handsomely for them. No impoverished peasant or worker in, say, Benin or Belgium could do such a thing: these folks did not fly very frequently, if at all; hence they produced no unavoidable emissions; hence negative emissions technologies need not be hitched to their lifestyle. If it were up to the market to allocate unavoidability and the removal conjugated to it, such technologies would by definition flow towards actors with money— aka the heaviest polluters. What removal society could afford would be set apart to compensate for the emissions from the Bill Gateses of this world, while “displacing needs from sectors with high public value but limited private ability to pay (for example, farming, remote hospitals)”—or, what rice farmer in Bangladesh can buy credits from Climeworks? Insofar as it is left to the invisible hand to arrange these matters, this scenario seems truly unavoidable. A billionaire has greater purchasing power than a Bangladeshi laborer and will be able to claim more removal capacity—so much capacity not used for subsistence or survival, including return from overshoot. The more removals used for offsetting, the less available for reversal. Late value form becomes the underwriting of luxury. _________________________________________ From The Long Heat: Climate Politics When It’s Too Late by Wim Carton and Andreas Malm.

Title: MARA Reaches Record-High Q3 Revenue as Bitcoin Hyper Becomes One of the Best Altcoins on the Market
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-miner-mara-revenue-bitcoin-hyper-best-altcoins/
Time Published: 2025-11-05T09:30:53Z
Full Content:
Quick Facts: Bitcoin mining company MARA has just announced record-high revenues for the past quarter, at $252.4M. This represents a 92% increase compared to 2024’s Q3, when the company bagged $131.6M. MARA owes this growth rate to its expanding Bitcoin mining system, which generated 98% more $BTC over a one-year span. The company mined 2,144 $BTC during this Q3 or almost 53,000 between 2024 and 2025. Fred Thiel, MARA’s CEO, explained this mass expansion in the context of adopting open-source AI tech to replace the standard GPUs: We are already seeing the alternatives to GPUs enter the market, and open source AI is making it far easier and much less expensive for companies to deploy advanced AI systems directly in their own private cloud environments. —Frederick Thiel, MARA Holdings Q3 Earnings Call As Salman Khan, MARA’s CFO, explains in the same announcement, the company’s hash rate grew by roughly 20%, while the daily cost per peta hash dropped 15% over the last year. This allowed MARA to almost double its performance in just 12 months. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 solution, Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER), could have an even bigger impact in 2026, promising faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions for a more scalable, performant network. As Fred Thiel himself noticed, Bitcoin has ‘entered its institutional phase’, with names like City Corp, BlackRock, and JP Morgan ‘integrating Bitcoin into traditional frameworks’. Then we have governments and public and private companies hoarding $BTC at an unprecedented rate. As Bitcoin Treasuries data shows, 353 entities hold over 4.05M $BTC and their accumulation rate went up 4.12% over the last 30 days. This ever-expanding ecosystem offers unlimited opportunities, and Thiel’s MARA is all for it. As the CEO explained, the company plans to expand on the marriage between Bitcoin and AI tech: Bitcoin mining monetizes underutilized energy and stabilizes grids, while AI inference transforms that same energy into intelligence and productivity. By bringing Bitcoin and AI together, we seek to maximize the value of every megawatt-hour we manage. —Fred Thiel, MARA Holdings Q3 Earnings Call To that end, MARA has already secured a partnership with MPLX with the goal of expanding its operations into West Texas. MPLX will offer ‘long-term access to low-cost natural gas at scale’, which will complement MARA’s computing infrastructure for higher throughput. The projected initial capacity is around 400 megawatts with the option to expand to up to 1.5 gigawatts across three planned sites. These developments position MARA as a leader in Bitcoin mining, which can only work in Bitcoin’s favor. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), on the other hand, also propels $BTC forward, promising to build a faster and cheaper Bitcoin network than ever before. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) promises a faster, more performant, and more cost-effective Bitcoin network, leveraging tools such as the SVM and the Canonical Bridge. The Canonical Bridge addresses Bitcoin’s most pressing issue: its performance limitations. As such, smaller transactions can sometimes experience confirmation times of hours, which explains the network’s unsuitability for most DeFi applications. The Canonical Bridge fixes this issue by minting the users’ bitcoins into the Hyper layer as soon as the Bitcoin Relay Program confirms the transaction details. The entire process lasts seconds, vastly improving Bitcoin’s confirmation times and removing the 7-TPS cap. Meanwhile, the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) enables the ultra-fast execution of smart contracts and DeFi apps. This will increase Bitcoin’s ranking on the list of the fastest blockchains today and make the network more feasible for institutional investors. The presale is at over $25.9M so far and growing at a steady pace, despite the October 10 meltdown, which sent the market into a downward spiral. The project’s resilience already ranks it among the best presales of 2025. This makes $HYPER one of the best altcoins to buy this coming Q4. If you want in on it, visit the presale page and snag your $HYPER today. This isn’t financial advice. Do your own research (DYOR) before investing.

Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning Investment in actions to counter the effects of global warming in the Republic is weak, which increases the risk that extreme weather events will test the State’s economic resilience, according to fresh analysis. A joint report published on Wednesday from the Central Bank of Ireland and the Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC), warns that focus “must also be applied to addressing the impacts of climate change that are already emerging by enabling investment in climate adaptation projects at both national and local levels”. Kevin O’Sullivan has the details Irish tourism, transport, and leisure businesses reported an eighth successive monthly decline in activity levels in October despite an easing of the cost inflation that has dogged the sector this year. AIB’s latest purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the wide-ranging services sector indicates what the bank described as “a marked pickup” in growth among services firms. Ian Curran reports. Leading European law firm Fieldfisher has acquired Cork-based legal practice Regan Wall for an undisclosed sum. The company said the deal would increase its Irish revenue by more than 20 per cent while doubling the size of its corporate practice. It will also give the firm a second Irish location, writes Eoin Burke-Kennedy. The loss to An Post of contracts to deliver parcels for online retailers ASOS and Sports Direct seems to have been one nail – if not the final one -in the coffin of Fastway Couriers which collapsed last week leaving staff, contract drivers and customers stranded. Regardless of whether or not this is the case, it has revived the issue over whether An Post is using its state owned and subsidised mail delivery network to undercut commercial courier companies when bidding for delivery contracts from big online retailers So you’re quitting your job?

Title: Revealed: How much RTÉ wants in sponsorship for David McCullagh’s radio show as it launches next week

Package is similar to what was charged when Claire Byrne anchored the show David McCullagh cuts a good-luck cake he received from newsroom colleagues. Photo: David McCullagh/Instagram Presenter David McCullagh takes over the mid-morning show on RTÉ Radio 1 next week RTÉ is seeking sponsorship of €350,000 for David McCullagh’s new mid-morning radio show. As proof of its confidence in the former Six One news anchor (57), it is believed to be the same figure charged for when Claire Byrne anchored the show. Similar to the deal with the show’s previous sponsors, the package is for six sponsor-credited “stings” lasting 10 seconds, airing daily. The deal, which offers 30 stings a week, includes cross-station promos across Radio 1’s schedule including Liveline under new host Kieran Cuddihy. The sponsorship deal is for one year and will start from January 2026. The RTÉ sales team said Today with David McCullagh will be the place for “sharp and accessible coverage of all the day’s main news stories, biggest talking points and engaging human-interest stories”. “David will guide listeners through the major news events of the day, offering in-depth analysis, live reports and thought-provoking conversations with key figures from politics, culture, business and beyond – all underpinned by his trademark curiosity and clarity,” it added. McCullagh signed off from Six One last Friday, ahead of starting his new mid-morning slot next Monday, November 10, airing from 9-11am. David McCullagh cuts a good-luck cake he received from newsroom colleagues. Photo: David McCullagh/Instagram Today's News in 90 Seconds - Wednesday, November 5 Posting pictures of his final day with the news team, a smiling McCullagh posed in front of a cake saying “Good luck”. He accompanied his Instagram post with Born to Run by his favourite artist Bruce Springsteen, who he said he has seen over 40 times so far. The presenter donned a white T-shirt for the occasion, bearing the logo: “I can do light”. This was taken as a light-hearted reference to his September interview with RTÉ’s Oliver Callan, shortly after his appointment was made. Asked by Callan if he was comfortable tackling the lighter items on the Today slot, he reckons he will be “comfortable enough”. “I am interested in history, I am interested in politics but I’m also interested in pets. I think they’re hugely important for families around the country. I am interested in eating, in going to the theatre and going to gigs,” he said. He also revealed that his new package will give him earnings of just under €240,000, meaning he will most likely feature on RTÉ’s annual “best paid” list. The historian and author, who has just published his latest book From Crown to Harp, joined RTÉ in 1993. A native of Blackrock, Dublin, he previously worked with the Evening Press. He spent 12 years as a political correspondent in Leinster House and five years fronting the Six One news. He was offered the new gig at the end of July and he said it didn’t take much time to accept it, describing it as “one of the best gigs in Irish media”. Signing off from the Today show last Friday, ahead of her new gig on Newstalk, Claire Byrne told listeners McCullagh is going to do “an exceptional job”. “David is one of Ireland’s finest journalists, and he’s a fierce nice fella to boot. I know he’s going to take great care of you all in the years ahead,” she said.

Title: Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin ‘bows head in shame’ after admitting to 50x scaling bottleneck

Well, it would seem that the network can’t catch a break! Modexp inefficiency and $135.7M ETF outflows mean Ethereum is getting hit from both sides. If demand doesn’t return fast, $3.3K-$3.35K will become a realistic downside target. Ethereum [ETH] is facing a double hit this week, and the timing could not be worse! Co-founder Vitalik Buterin admitted in an X post that the current modexp precompile is hurting ZK-proof efficiency. He added that it’s slowing down a feature that is meant to drive ETH’s next big scaling upgrade. Source: X At the same time, institutions are quietly walking out the door – ETH ETFs saw $135.7M in net outflows, with BlackRock alone unloading $81.7M. If both the tech layer and the capital layer turn against ETH in the same week, is the floor about to give way? According to Buterin, modexp can be “50x worse than average blocks” for ZK-EVM proving. This is confirmation that the inefficiency is now too big to ignore. In his own words, he even said he “bows his head in shame” for inventing it. Source: X The community response was simple – This is a waste of engineering time, and fixing modexp matters more than squeezing tiny efficiency gains elsewhere. As one user put it, “Makes sense. The opportunity cost of optimizing obscure opcodes is huge compared to improving core scalability layers.” This matters because if ZK-proving stays slow, ETH scaling stalls. And, that risk is suddenly front and center. Yesterday alone, ETH ETFs saw $135.7 million in outflows, with BlackRock dumping $81.7 million on its own. That’s institutional capital actively reducing exposure. Source: X And, the scale matters here – This is one of ETH’s sharpest single-day outflow clusters since launch. If big allocators continue to pull liquidity at this pace, Ethereum will struggle to find a floor. This turns the modexp debate into a capital flight problem. At press time, Ethereum’s price was trading near $3,480 after a heavy two-day sell-off candle cluster that erased most of last week’s bounce. The RSI suggested that momentum has been weak, but not yet fully oversold. The OBV continued to slide lower too. So, volume has been flowing out, not in. Source: TradingView Structurally, this means ETH has failed to defend its short-term support. Unless demand returns quickly, there’s a clear risk of a deeper fall (potentially toward the $3.3K-$3.35K pocket), before any real upside attempt could form.
