Title: XRP Clears Resistance Channel With Traders Eyeing $2.33-$2.40 Zone

XRP extended its recovery with a clean push through $2.197 resistance, signaling renewed bullish momentum as institutional accumulation reappeared at key levels. XRP traded between $2.19 and $2.20 for most of the session before a brief liquidity sweep drove price to $2.15 during the largest volume event of the day. Buyers immediately absorbed the move, pushing the token back above $2.17 and maintaining higher lows on every subsequent retest. The breakout through $2.197 triggered a clean move to $2.206, supported by hourly volume rising from 450K to 553K. Price stabilized above $2.204 into the close while $2.22 emerged as the next resistance level to clear. Intraday momentum remained constructive, though upside continuation now depends on maintaining structure above $2.204 and avoiding deeper tests of $2.17. • The $2.204 micro-support is now the immediate pivot — holding above it keeps the breakout active• A break above $2.22 opens direct continuation toward the $2.33–$2.40 resistance band• Rejection at $2.22 combined with rising funding rates increases the risk of a leverage flush• Losing $2.17 would shift focus back to the broader $2.00 psychological level• Volume confirmation remains key — sustained prints above 600K/hour would support another expansion leg More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You XRP at Risk of $2.05 Retest, Analysts Warn, as Bitcoin Gives Back Weekly Gains Spot XRP ETFs have now attracted nearly $850 million in inflows since launching in mid-November — one of the strongest altcoin ETF starts on record — suggesting long-horizon capital continues to accumulate exposure.

Speaking at the New York Times DealBook Summit with host and journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin, Armstrong said recent moves on stablecoin and market-structure legislation signalled a shift in the policy landscape. “2025 is actually the year that crypto regulation went from kind of gray market to well-lit establishment,” he said. “The Genius Act passed, the House passed a market-structure bill in a bipartisan way that’s now moving on to the Senate, and I think that’s going to be the first one where the Senate passes it as well.” Armstrong criticized federal policy under the previous Biden Administration, saying it “unlawfully tried to kill this industry, which pushed a lot of activity offshore and hurt consumers.” “That’s why we’ve supported groups like Fairshake,” he said, referring to the crypto-focused SuperPAC. “Because 52 million Americans who have used crypto want to see clear rules on the books. All of our political spending is transparent.” During the 2024 U.S. election season, Fairshake raised over $78 million to support pro-crypto candidates, with eyes on the 2026 mid-term elections. When asked how he viewed past criticisms of Bitcoin by Warren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger, who had called it “nothing,” “rat poison,” likened it to a “venereal disease,” and predicted it would go to zero. Armstrong said there was “no chance” of that happening at this point." “For Charlie and Warren, they grew up in an era of American preeminence, where the dollar was everything, and you didn’t question it,” he said. “Bitcoin is this new digital gold, and people go to it in times of uncertainty. So it's tough for them to contemplate a world that is more decentralized and running on the internet.” During the interview, Fink spoke about how conversations with clients influenced his change of heart and the way he now approaches Bitcoin after calling it “an index for money laundering in the past. “I see a big, large use case for Bitcoin, and I still do today,” he said. “In my role, I see thousands of clients a year. I meet with governmental leaders, and we have conversations that evolve my thinking. This is a very public example of a big shift in my opinion.” Fink went on to say that while he sees a strong case for Bitcoin, he still sees it as “an asset of fear” in times of uncertainty. “You own Bitcoin because you're frightened of your physical and financial security,” he said. “The long-term reason you own it is the debasement of financial assets because of deficits.” During the panel, the question of stablecoins and bank anxiety over losing deposits to tokenized systems was raised, but Armstrong pushed back. “In that case, I think that's just the banks trying to protect their profit margin,” he said. “They should have to pay rewards and higher rates to their own customers, and they're trying to put their thumb on the scale of regulatory capture to prevent crypto from doing that.” Armstrong, instead, predicted that banks would soon start embracing stablecoins. “We're already seeing this,” he said. “My guess is that in a year or two, they'll come back and say they want to pay interest and yield on stablecoins in their own companies. “It goes back to the Innovator's Dilemma,” he said. “The best banks are leaning into this as an opportunity, and the ones fighting it are going to get left behind.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Asia Morning Briefing: Polymarket Bettors Still Expect Big Strategy Buys Even as Saylor Prepares for a Weak Market
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/04/asia-morning-briefing-prediction-markets-still-expect-big-strategy-buys-even-as-saylor-prepares-for-a-weak-market

Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.A new CryptoQuant report suggests that Strategy is quietly preparing for a multi-month BTC downturn. This thesis is colliding with prediction markets bets that still believe the company will behave as if it were 2021. CryptoQuant highlights in its most recent weekly report that Michael Saylor's bitcoin treasury company is undergoing a structural pivot from aggressive BTC accumulation to balance-sheet protection, highlighted by a separate USD reserve and language acknowledging the option to hedge or even sell in stressed conditions. Despite that shift, Polymarket odds for a bitcoin sale remain marginal for the first quarter of the year, while expectations for routine small buys stay elevated. Additionally, Polymarket traders still see routine MSTR purchases as a high-probability event, even as the scale of those buys shrinks. The market assigns only a 40%–45% chance of a buy above 1,000 BTC, and the CryptoQuant report suggests these cosmetic top-ups are becoming the norm. With monthly accumulation down more than 90% from last year, traders expect small buys that preserve branding without affecting supply or regional liquidity. Strategy’s average purchase size has fallen from 15,133 BTC in 2024 to 5,330 BTC this year, and with DAT inflows at their weakest since mid-June, bitcoin treasury firms are no longer absorbing meaningful supply in the current market. Taken together, slower treasury buying, weaker DAT inflows, and a more defensive MSTR suggest a different supply landscape ahead for crypto in 2026. Whether BTC can resume its upward trend will hinge on new sources of demand stepping in to replace the corporate accumulation that defined the last cycle. BTC: Bitcoin recovered from its morning drop to $91,800 and steadied near $93,000, but its two-day 10% rally is stalling below resistance at the 2025 yearly open around $93,400. ETH: Ether climbed back above $3,100 and reached a two-week high near $3,200 after a 3.5% gain on the day. Gold: Gold slipped slightly to just above $4,200 as traders stayed cautious ahead of key U.S. inflation data, although renewed Ukraine tensions and a softer dollar outlook could set the stage for a rebound. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific stocks traded mixed Thursday, though Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Topix rose about 1.3% after upbeat U.S. jobs data lifted Wall Street and strengthened hopes for a Fed rate cut next week.

Title: Vanguard’s Policy Reversal Triggers Sharp Bitcoin Rally as $11T Giant Enters Crypto
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/vanguards-policy-reversal-triggers-bitcoin-rally/
Time Published: 2025-12-04T00:00:20Z
Full Content:
A new CryptoQuant report from XWIN Research Japan reveals that the sharp +6% Bitcoin rally on December 2–3, 2025 was triggered by a seismic shift in traditional finance: Vanguard’s unexpected policy reversal. The $11 trillion asset manager—long known for its conservative stance—opened its platform to spot ETFs for BTC, ETH, XRP, and SOL, instantly giving more than 50 million investors access to crypto products. The move marks one of the most significant steps toward mainstream adoption in the industry’s history. The catalyst behind this reversal was the appointment of Salim Ramji, Vanguard’s new CEO and a former BlackRock executive who played a key role in launching the IBIT ETF. His leadership signaled a dramatic change in direction, and the market responded immediately. Once US markets opened, Bitcoin surged 6% in a single move, while IBIT surpassed $1 billion in trading volume within the first 30 minutes. Massive inflows from retail and retirement accounts followed, with Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas noting that “a large wave of Vanguard clients may have moved all at once.” XWIN Research Japan notes that, despite the recent surge, the Coinbase Premium Index remains in negative territory, showing that US prices still sit slightly below global averages. Even so, the report highlights a clear improvement in US spot buying pressure, signaling that demand is slowly returning. If the premium rises back to zero or positive territory, the market may begin to price in what XWIN calls the “next wave” — a phase that could propel Bitcoin toward the $100K range as institutional flows strengthen. This shift is happening just as Vanguard makes its historic entrance into the crypto market. XWIN emphasizes that this is not a short-term catalyst. Vanguard manages $11 trillion, and even a tiny allocation — just 0.5% of assets flowing into crypto ETFs — would represent $55 billion in new capital. That figure alone exceeds the entire first-year inflow from the 2024 spot Bitcoin ETF cycle. With the “final giant” of traditional finance now participating, the long-term structure of Bitcoin demand is changing. Vanguard’s move signals the beginning of a genuine institutional adoption phase, where inflows can scale far beyond anything seen in previous cycles, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s upper price boundaries. Bitcoin’s weekly chart shows a strong rebound from the $84,000–$86,000 support zone, an area that aligns closely with the 100-week SMA. This level acted as a critical pivot during previous corrections, and once again buyers stepped in aggressively, forming a clear bullish reaction. The long lower wick from last week’s candle confirms strong demand, with BTC now trading back above $93,000. However, despite the rebound, the broader structure remains cautious. Bitcoin still trades below the 50-week SMA, which has begun to flatten near the $102,000–$103,000 region. This moving average now acts as a major resistance level and the next key test for bulls. A weekly close above it would mark a meaningful shift in momentum and signal that BTC may be ready to resume its broader uptrend. If BTC continues to hold above the 100-week SMA and pushes toward the 50-week SMA, the market could enter a consolidation phase that sets the stage for a stronger upside move. Failure to reclaim $102K, however, risks renewed selling pressure and a potential retest of the $86K region.

The firm says that mega forces, or major structural changes that affect investments now and in the future, are changing the global economy. The most dominant mega force is AI, according to its 2026 outlook report. “With a few mega forces driving markets, it is hard to avoid making a big call on their direction – and as such, there is no neutral stance, not even exposure to broad indexes,” BlackRock’s report reads. “We remain pro-risk and see the AI theme still the main driver of U.S. equities. Yet this environment is ripe for active investing – picking winners and losers from among the builders now and later as AI gains start to spread, in our view.” The firm’s report also highlights the role of stablecoins in the “future of finance,” a mega force it says characterizes the changes in “how households and companies use cash, borrow, transact and seek returns.” That definition has now expanded to include crypto and stablecoins, a representative for the firm told Decrypt. “Stablecoins are no longer niche–they’re becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity,” BlackRock’s Global Head of Market Development Samara Cohen said. The firm also sees the potential for stablecoins to grow beyond banking, indicating a potential role in cross-border payments and as alternatives to local currencies in emerging markets. The total stablecoin market cap has grown by more than $100 billion since this time last year, according to data from DefiLlama, with more than $307 billion in stablecoins—led by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, now circulating. Despite their rapid growth, predictors on Myriad’s prediction market think it’s unlikely that the total market cap will spike to $360 billion by February. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a unit of Dastan, the parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.) In addition to stablecoin growth, the firm pointed to the fragmentation of AI and defense, growing energy constraints for the AI build, and a new uneven phase for private credit as underlying themes impacting broader mega forces. Over the next six to 12 months, it remains committed to AI thanks to good earnings figures and healthy balance sheets, signaling AI favor as one of its “big calls” moving forward. “We stay overweight U.S. stocks on the broadening AI theme, with risk appetite supported by Fed rate cuts,” the firm wrote.

Title: Trump’s Ballroom Donors Blow Off Senator’s Questions About How Much They Gave

This year, the holidays don’t feel celebratory for many Americans who’ve been negatively affected by the Trump administration’s decisions. We’re here to make sure those people do not go unheard. Help us hold the administration accountable. Already a member? Log in to hide these messages. Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost WASHINGTON – When President Donald Trump released a list of private donors paying for the construction of his 90,000-square-foot, $300 million White House ballroom — and the demolition of the East Wing — he left lots of questions unanswered. How much money did these billionaires and corporate CEOs give? Who approached them about donating in the first place? Are they expecting something in return? Are they actively lobbying the White House for other perks for their businesses or themselves? Was this even a complete list of all the donors behind the ballroom project? (It was not.) Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), the top Democrat on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, posed these questions to more than 30 of the known donors financing Trump’s ballroom project, in a series of letters that went out in late October. He gave them until early November to respond. The donors’ response letters, obtained by HuffPost, are remarkably evasive. The 21 responses ― two came from contractors on the project, the rest from companies that donated ― almost universally do not answer Blumenthal’s questions, instead boasting about their philanthropy and love of America. Blumenthal posed very specific questions, like, “What amount did you contribute to the White House Ballroom project?” and “Please list all White House personnel or other representatives or associates of the Trump Administration or Trump family with whom you have spoken about the donation.” Some of the responses were laughable. Apple, Amazon and Meta, who are among the Big Tech companies financing Trump’s project, said their support for the ballroom is simply another example of them donating money to a good cause. None actually said how much money they gave, or who they worked with in Trump’s orbit to make the donations happen. Meta unironically suggested it is financing the ballroom project because it cares about preserving the White House grounds — as Trump just razed the entire East Wing to make way for his project. (HuffPost obtained copies of the letters on the condition to not directly quote them.) Other donors, like cryptocurrency companies Coinbase and Ripple and major government contractor Booz Allen, similarly claimed their donations are motivated by civic pride and a commitment to protecting the White House. Booz Allen in particular hailed the White House as a symbol of American democracy and said it is proud to help support the building, part of which, again, Trump just completely demolished. The only company that divulged its donation in its letter was Google, and it only did so because it’s already been reported that it’s donating $22 million as part of a settlement the company reached with Trump after he was banned from YouTube, owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet, after he incited the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Most of these donors insisted they are following all laws and aren’t giving money to the ballroom project in exchange for other perks from Trump. Some companies, including Comcast and BlackRock, claimed they blindly donated money to the Trust for the National Mall, the nonprofit partner to the National Park Service that accepts private money for repairs and upgrades to national monuments and grounds, and had no say in their funds going specifically toward Trump’s ballroom. Others, like Nvidia and the Betty Wold Johnson Foundation, confirmed they donated to the trust specifically to aid Trump’s project. One company that won’t be kicking in money for the White House ballroom is JPMorgan Chase. Its CEO, Jamie Dimon, said last month on CNN that the company has a lot of government contracts within and outside of the U.S., and it has to be careful about how its arrangements are perceived and how a future Justice Department may deal with them. “We’re quite conscious of risks we bear by doing anything that looks like, you know, buying favors or anything like that,” Dimon said. Trump’s ballroom project is unpopular with the public. An ABC News/Washington Post survey from late October found just 28% of Americans backed the ballroom’s construction, with 56% opposed.

Title: Coinbase CEO Reveals Collaborations With Leading Banks On Stablecoin And Crypto Trading Initiatives

Leading banking institutions in traditional finance (TradFi) are reportedly partnering with US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) to explore pilots related to stablecoins, custody solutions, and trading options. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced this during his appearance at the New York Times Dealbook Summit on Wednesday, as reported by Bloomberg. Armstrong emphasized that leading financial institutions recognize this as an opportunity for growth. “The best banks are leaning into this as an opportunity,” he stated, although he refrained from naming any specific banks involved in these initiatives. During his speech, the executive also voiced his concerns about institutions that resist participating in the digital asset ecosystem. He asserted that those who oppose it will be left behind. This sentiment aligns with remarks Armstrong made six months ago, where he predicted that eventually, every major bank would integrate cryptocurrency into their operations. He views this technology as a means to modernize the financial system, stating, “We can power a variety of things for them.” He noted that some banks are looking for custodial solutions, while others are interested in developing their own stablecoins. Adding weight to this discussion, Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset manager and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer BlackRock, participated in the event alongside Armstrong. Fink, who previously voiced skepticism about cryptocurrencies, described Bitcoin (BTC) as a safe haven asset despite the cryptocurrency’s crash toward $83,000 on Monday. “You own Bitcoin because you’re frightened of your physical security. You own it because you’re frightened of your financial security,” he remarked. On the financial side, Coinbase’s stock performance reflects the positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market amid recovering prices. Trading under the ticker COIN on the Nasdaq, Coinbase’s shares closed Wednesday at nearly $277, marking a 5% increase. This uplift coincides with broader gains in the cryptocurrency sector, notably led by the recent price performance of Ethereum (ETH), followed by Bitcoin, XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), and other notable tokens such as Solana (SOL), all of which have shown significant recoveries this week after a challenging month.

Title: BlackRock’s Fink calls Bitcoin an ‘asset of fear’, softens crypto stance

Larry Fink spoke alongside Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, describing how BlackRock's stance on crypto had evolved over the previous eight years. Larry Fink, chair and CEO of asset management company BlackRock, explained his “big shift” from associating cryptocurrencies with illicit activities to having the largest spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Speaking at The New York Times’ DealBook Summit on Wednesday, Fink addressed questions related to his views on crypto and Bitcoin (BTC) from journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin. The BlackRock CEO said his move from associating crypto primarily with money laundering to having exposure to billions of dollars in BTC was “a very glaring public example of a big shift in [his] opinions.” “My thought process always evolves,” said Fink. The CEO, who took the stage with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, was not entirely bullish on Bitcoin for the duration of the panel. Fink described Bitcoin as “an asset of fear,” noting that the price of the cryptocurrency had dropped amid news of a US-China trade deal and a potential end to the war in Ukraine. He added: Fink’s comments stand in stark contrast to those he made in October 2017, before Bitcoin’s well-known bull run that drove the price of the cryptocurrency to then all-time highs. At the time, the CEO said the cryptocurrency “shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world.” Related: SEC sends warning letters to ETF issuers targeting untamed leverage In the eight years since that message, BlackRock was granted regulatory approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch one of the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January 2024. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, under the ticker symbol IBIT, reached a peak value of about $70 billion. Cointelegraph reported last month that IBIT experienced more than $2.3 billion in net outflows across November, including withdrawals of about $463 million on Nov. 14 and $523 million on Nov. 18. However, BlackRock’s business development director, Cristiano Castro, said at the time that the asset manager was confident in ETFs as “liquid and powerful instruments.” Among the largest spot Bitcoin ETFs in the market are offerings from Grayscale, Bitwise, Fidelity, ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, and VanEck.

Title: Crypto bounces but weak US macro data, AI uncertainty threaten the recovery

Cryptocurrencies show strength despite investors’ concerns about the AI industry and weak US labor and consumer data. Would an acceleration of money printing boost Bitcoin? Key takeaways: Low BTC and ETH leverage appetite contrasts with strong stock markets, highlighting fragile sentiment despite improving liquidity expectations. While economic uncertainty persists, anticipated monetary easing reduces downside risk for cryptocurrencies, favoring a potential bullish momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) gained momentum on Wednesday, rising to their highest levels in two weeks as investors await a more expansionist monetary policy. Weak economic indicators boosted expectations of fresh stimulus measures, increasing demand for scarce assets. The S&P 500 index and gold also reacted positively as investors anticipated higher liquidity entering the markets. Still, with the cryptocurrency market capitalization sitting 29% below its all-time high of $4 trillion, Bitcoin and Ether traders remain alert to the possibility of a correction driven by broader economic uncertainty. Demand for scarce assets strengthened on Wednesday, shown by the jump in US five-year Treasury prices and gold approaching $4,240, up 3% in two weeks. Bitcoin held near $93,000, unchanged from two weeks earlier. Ether, however, remains 37% below its all-time high of $4,956, prompting traders to reassess the outlook for the altcoin market. The US labor market showed signs of slowing in November as private companies cut 32,000 jobs, with small businesses facing the toughest conditions. The ADP payroll report noted that workers saw a 0.1% pay decline from October, which reduced inflation concerns. Traders now await the Fed’s interest rate decision on Dec. 10, expecting clearer guidance on policy direction. Fed policymakers have signaled diverging views, partly due to the lack of official US government data during the government funding shutdown that ended on Nov. 12. Some argue rate cuts are needed to prevent deeper labor market weakness, while others warn additional reductions could aggravate inflation, which remains well above the Fed’s 2% target. Growing dependence on artificial intelligence investments by some of the world’s largest companies adds another layer of uncertainty. Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, reportedly said: “There is so much talk about the potential of the bubble… people are conscious of the risk.” According to Yahoo Finance, BlackRock also highlighted the physical limitations of large-scale AI data center expansion. The US department store operator Macy’s said Wednesday that its outlook reflects ongoing pressure from cautious consumer spending and higher tariffs, which are expected to weigh on results in the final months of 2025. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tony Spring said Macy’s has been forced to make “selective” price increases across most categories. Demand for bullish leverage positions on Bitcoin and Ether remains unusually low. Under neutral conditions, the annualized funding rate on perpetual contracts should fall 6% to 12% to cover the cost of capital. This lack of conviction is notable given that the US Russell 2000 Small Cap Index sits just 2.3% below its all-time high. Related: Ethereum treasury trade unwinds 80% as handful of whales dominate buys The stock market is expected to benefit directly from expansionist monetary policies through lower capital costs and government incentives tied to AI and nuclear energy infrastructure. Without a shift in sentiment, cryptocurrencies may continue to lag as job market conditions weaken and uncertainty builds. Despite the soft labor and consumer data, cryptocurrencies are not at imminent risk of collapse. The expected liquidity boost should help ease economic pressure and sustain appetite for scarce assets. As long as monetary conditions continue to loosen, Bitcoin and Ether are more likely to recover modest ground than face a sharp reversal.

Title: Major banks running stablecoin, crypto-trading pilots with Coinbase, Armstrong says

At the DealBook Summit, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink acknowledged Bitcoin’s utility, as Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong said the exchange was running pilots with major US banks. Major US banks are running early pilots involving stablecoins, crypto custody and digital-asset trading in partnership with Coinbase, CEO Brian Armstrong said onstage at The New York Times DealBook Summit.According to Bloomberg, Armstrong didn’t identify specific institutions but warned that banks slow to adopt crypto “are going to get left behind.” His remarks were made during a joint appearance with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on a panel at the event. Although Armstrong and Fink haven’t always aligned on crypto, the two struck a notably similar tone on Bitcoin. Armstrong dismissed the idea that Bitcoin could ever fall to zero, while Fink said he now sees a significant “use case” for the asset, though he did caution that Bitcoin is “still heavily influenced by leveraged players.” BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), launched in January 2024, is now the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with a market cap of over $72 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. BlackRock also issues the largest tokenized US Treasury product by market cap, currently managing around $2.3 billion in assets, according to data from RWA.xyz. Related: Identity checks to power AI stablecoin payments added to Coinbase-incubated x402 Despite Brian Armstrong’s comments that Coinbase and some major banks are collaborating, the relationship has become more adversarial in recent months. In August, the Banking Policy Institute, a lobbying group chaired by JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, warned Congress that stablecoins could undermine the banking sector’s credit model. The group urged lawmakers to tighten the GENIUS Act, arguing that a capital shift from fiat deposits into stablecoins could increase lending costs and reduce credit available to businesses. Traditional banks are primarily concerned about what they perceive as a “loophole” in the US GENIUS Act, which bans stablecoin issuers from offering yield, but allows third parties, such as Coinbase, to do so. In September, Armstrong told Fox Business that Coinbase aims to replace traditional banks by becoming a “super app,” offering everything from credit cards to payments and rewards. He also called the traditional banking system outdated, pointing to the “three percent” fees charged every time people use a credit card. Banks have also pushed back directly against Coinbase. In November, the Independent Community Bankers of America urged the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to reject the exchange’s application for a national trust charter, arguing that Coinbase’s crypto-custody model is untested.

Share this article BlackRock CEO Larry Fink identified rising US national debt as a potential driver for broader crypto adoption today, suggesting digital assets could serve as alternatives if fiscal concerns undermine dollar dominance. Fink, who oversees BlackRock’s investment strategies, highlighted how uncontrolled US deficits could position Bitcoin and other digital assets as viable options beyond traditional dollar-based holdings. BlackRock has expressed concerns that increasing US national debt could impact conventional assets such as US Treasuries, while pointing to growing institutional interest in crypto assets as an alternative investment class. The firm has also emphasized tokenization as an emerging technology with potential to reshape the financial system’s infrastructure in coming years. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Bank of America predicts an ‘air pocket,’ not an AI bubble, fueled by mountains of debt piling up from the data center rush
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/03/is-ai-a-bubble-bofa-says-air-pocket-in-2026-data-center-debt/

Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture. It’s not the year 2000, and there is not an impending tech bubble, but that doesn’t mean investors shouldn’t be bracing for turbulence, Bank of America Global Research says. Savita Subramanian, BofA head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, has been arguing that compared with the dotcom era, today’s AI boom has supported earnings growth and smaller IPOs, and “speculation in unprofitable stocks is less extreme.” However, she warned, aggressive capital expenditures from hyperscalers are increasingly relying on debt, presenting danger for investors still eagerly awaiting returns. “Is this 2000? Are we in a bubble? No,” Subramanian said during BofA’s outlook call on Tuesday. “Will AI continue unfettered in leadership? Also, no.” Subramanian unpacked her thoughts in a recent note on the future of AI, which she sees as somewhere between fully reliable and an all-out bubble burst, where capital spending is still greater than revenue growth. “On AI, in our view, investors should get ready for an air pocket,” Subramanian wrote. “Monetization is to be determined, and power is the bottleneck and will take a while to build out. So for now, investors are buying the dream.” BofA took a more bearish stance on its stock market outlook for 2026 as a result of these air pocket concerns, forecasting just a 4% upside for the S&P 500 from where it currently sits. It breaks from the more bullish takes of analysts, including Deutsche Bank’s bet on a 17% jump at the end of next year and market veteran Ed Yardeni’s prediction of the S&P growing another 10% from this year to next. Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, mirrored Subramanian’s stance on the AI boom, saying at a media roundtable on Tuesday that there’s enough skepticism from investors and markets that there shouldn’t be too much concern of a bubble. “We don’t think the bubble framing is that useful at this stage for investors,” Boivin said. “There is so much talk about the potential of the bubble … People are conscious of the risk. It’s when there’s no discussion of that that we should be more worried.” The good news about today’s AI boom, Subramanian said, is that there appears to already be a series of checks and balances in place to curb AI hype. That includes recommended stock allocations: While the concentration of the S&P 500 has tightened, with the top 10 companies in the index accounting for 40% of its market capitalization, Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok has pushed for greater diversification. “One should have some exposure to the S&P 500 and should certainly also have some exposure to AI,” Slok told Fortune in July. “But it’s very clear that [owing to] the market’s extreme focus and concentration on this story, this is the time to have a conversation around, ‘What are the things I should be doing with my money?’” In addition to smaller IPOs and less extreme speculation in unprofitable stocks, Subramanian said, markets have some healthy skepticism about Big Tech’s capex spending. Meta’s October earnings report sparked a selloff that dropped shares by 9%, following CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitting the company raised guidance for capital expenditures by $2 billion. The continued capex push is also what has made analysts jittery about an AI air pocket. According to Bank of America, investors are right to be concerned with hyperscalers’ rising capex spending, particularly on data centers, which surged 53% year over year to $134 billion in just the first quarter of this year, Dell’Oro Group found. Google became the latest tech giant to expand its data center footprint last month, pledging $40 billion to growing its AI compute infrastructure in Texas. However, “capex funded by operating cash flow is running out,” Subramanian noted, with hyperscalers increasingly funding operations through debt. She noted the supply of AI infrastructure has increased by more than 1,000% from 2024 to 2025. Indeed, BofA analyst Yuri Seliger wrote in a research note last month that the five hyperscalers—Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle—issued $121 billion in debt this year alone, a whopping four times the average debt the companies issued annually in the past five years. Seliger added that he expected an additional $100 million in debt raised in 2026. By IBM CEO Arvind Krishna’s back-of-the-napkin math, these hyperscalers’ big bets on growing AI supply won’t be worth it, as they will be unable to turn a profit from the steep investment in data centers. They will be made vulnerable by AI’s rapidly advancing technology, which would render today’s infrastructure obsolete. “It’s my view that there’s no way you’re going to get a return on that, because $8 trillion of capex means you need roughly $800 billion of profit just to pay for the interest,” Krishna said on a Monday episode of the Decoder podcast. “You’ve got to use it all in five years because at that point, you’ve got to throw it away and refill it.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Coinbase Partnering With Major U.S. Banks on Stablecoin and Crypto Pilots

Coinbase (COIN) is partnering with some of the largest banks in the U.S. on pilot programs involving stablecoins, crypto custody and trading, CEO Brian Armstrong said Wednesday at the New York Times DealBook Summit. “The best banks are leaning into this as an opportunity,” Armstrong said during a discussion alongside BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. He did not name specific banks. “The ones who are fighting it are going to get left behind.” The announcement suggests a quiet but growing embrace of crypto infrastructure by mainstream financial institutions, even as the broader market remains under tight regulatory scrutiny. Stablecoins — digital tokens backed by cash or cash-like assets — have become a central focus for banks exploring tokenized finance. Coinbase believes the stablecoin market will balloon to a $1.2 trillion market by 2028 as it sees potential for thousands of growth paths for the sector. Many U.S. banks are already deep into innovating using stablecoins. Citi, which has previously announced plans to collaborate with Coinbase on stablecoin payment solutions, projects the industry to reach $4 trillion by 2030 in a bull case. The joint appearance also covered broader themes. Fink, who once dismissed bitcoin BTC$92,081.34, now sees it as a hedge in uncertain times. “You own bitcoin because you’re frightened of your physical security, uou own it because you’re frightened of your financial security,” he said. For Fink, bitcoin is less about speculation and more about long-term protection from currency debasement and ballooning debt. While bitcoin has seen a steep drawdown over the past few months, Fink said he continues to sees a "big, large use case." Armstrong echoed that view, saying that there's "no chance" that the asset will go to zero. Armstrong also pressed for clearer rules from Washington. He said he hopes the U.S. Senate will soon vote on a bill known as the CLARITY Act, which would establish legal definitions and responsibilities for crypto exchanges, token issuers and other players in the digital asset space. UPDATE (Dec 3, 20:07 UTC): Adds additional comments from Armstrong and Fink and a paragraph about the stablecoin market.

Share this article BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said at a press conference during the DealBook Summit that he has reversed his earlier skepticism about Bitcoin and now considers his previous views to have been wrong. He described the shift as a major change in his thinking about Bitcoin and crypto. As he put it, “I have very strong views but that does not mean I am not open. My thought process is always evolving and this is a clear public example of a major shift in my opinions.” The shift marks a significant evolution for the world’s largest asset manager, which oversees investment products including exchange-traded funds focused on traditional and digital assets. Fink has compared Bitcoin to gold for its potential in providing uncorrelated returns in investment portfolios. BlackRock’s embrace of digital assets extends beyond rhetoric. The firm manages the iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, an exchange-traded fund that provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin’s spot price through a regulated vehicle.

Title: Bitcoin’s biggest booster Michael Saylor fights to stave off an $8 billion collapse and being the first major crypto domino to fall

Billionaire Michael Saylor has been in tight spots before but nothing like this. The share price of Saylor’s firm, Strategy, which owns over 3% of the world’s Bitcoin, is down dramatically. Worse, the company faces twin headwinds in the form of a bearish crypto market and an impending rule change that will likely trigger a mass selloff of its stock. On Monday, the company announced a $1.2 billion reserve fund to meet impending interest and dividend obligations, but that did little to prop up its shares. All of this fueled fresh attacks from Saylor’s critics who say Strategy’s unusual business model, which revolves around selling stock to buy Bitcoin, is unsustainable or even a Ponzi scheme. Saylor has ridden out storms in the past. That includes an accounting scandal in 2000 that almost sank one of his previous companies and saw him lose $6 billion of his personal fortune in a day. Saylor’s defenders, meanwhile, dismiss critics as knee-jerk Bitcoin detractors who don’t understand the currency or the corporate finance techniques underlying Strategy’s operations. Saylor may escape from this bind, as he has in the past, but this time the stakes are higher. In recent years, Strategy’s purchases have helped fuel crypto’s record rise, and turned Saylor into Bitcoin’s leading evangelist. This means any move by Strategy to dump part of its holdings—something its CEO hinted last week could happen—would not only depress prices, but could spark a crisis of confidence and a broader selloff. Meanwhile, a further plunge in Strategy’s share price could not only threaten its future viability, but spur the collapse of dozens of other firms that have copied its business model. The coming months are likely to demonstrate once and for all whether Saylor is a pioneer in crypto finance, as his backers claim, or just another high-stakes gambler whose luck has run out. The crypto industry likes to hail October as “Uptober,” but this year failed to deliver the customary double-digit price boost. Instead, the month brought one of the biggest wipeouts in the industry’s history, and for Strategy, the month brought an extra helping of bad news when, on Oct. 10, financial giant MSCI proposed a new rule that would exclude it from a series of popular indexes. This delisting process, which looks set to go into effect in February, would oblige fund managers around the world to shed their holdings of Strategy, and other firms whose assets consist of 50% or more of crypto. In November, JPMorgan warned the rule change could see funds dump $2.3 billion worth of Strategy shares, and that the selloff could climb to over $8 billion if other index compilers followed MSCI’s example. The market’s growing awareness about MSCI’s plans has already triggered a selloff. Shares of MSTR (the MSTR ticker sign reflects Strategy’s previous name, Microstrategy) are down around 50% since Oct. 1. This has led a key metric known as mNAV, which reflects the value of a crypto company’s shares as a ratio of its Bitcoin holdings, to drop below one on several recent occasions. For a company whose mNAV a year ago reached around 2.45, the current figure underscores how the longtime premium that Strategy shares held over Bitcoin has evaporated. In response to such a spate of bad news, most CEOs would have issued a series of muted statements asking for patience. But Saylor is not an ordinary CEO and has instead responded by cranking up the number of memes he posts on social media. The memes extol Bitcoin and depict Saylor in AI-generated action hero poses—leading his many acolytes to retweet the memes or post their own version of them. These meme tactics have served Saylor well in the past, turning Strategy into a momentum play during bull markets. More recently, though, the gimmick has failed to stanch the stock’s downturn, and last month, Saylor posted a rare social media misfire. Seeking to rebut a rumor the company was selling its Bitcoin, Saylor shared an image of himself riding a life preserver in storm-tossed seas as a flaming ocean liner sank behind him. Critics, including Saylor fans, pointed out the meme implied Strategy’s captain was saving himself at a time of trouble rather than going down with his ship. HODL pic.twitter.com/sQysm4i88t Regardless of Saylor’s intent, the minor controversy raises questions about whether Strategy will resort to selling its Bitcoin holdings—a move the company has portrayed as unthinkable but, in recent weeks, appears set to accept. In late November, Strategy acquired 130 Bitcoin, bringing its total hoard to an even 650,000, which is worth around $58.5 billion at early December prices. For context, that amounts to around 3.1% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million (95% of which has been mined), and makes Strategy the biggest holder of the currency save for its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, whose 1.1 million coins are believed to be gone forever. According to Saylor, the company has paid an average price of $74,436 per Bitcoin, spending a total of around $48.4 billion, including fees and expenses. In order to pull this off, Strategy has needed a source of capital, and given that Bitcoin does not produce any yield, the company’s go-to technique has been to sell common shares to fund its purchases. A big upside to this approach is that, unlike debt, common shares do not create any financial obligations for the company. That’s not the case, though, with preferred shares—and Strategy has issued plenty of these as well, which obliges it to pay regular dividends to shareholders. These obligations include payments of roughly $200 million that are due by Dec. 31, the bulk of which are owed in the form of dividends (Strategy, like most companies, also carries some debt). In order to project a sense of financial stability, Strategy took the unusual step in early December of creating a so-called dollar reserve of $1.4 billion that Saylor says will be enough to cover the next 21 months of dividend obligations. Saylor announced the reserve fund at a Dec. 1 investor presentation where he added, with his usual bravado: “It’s our intention to keep stacking Bitcoin.” In the near future, though, that goal is likely to be aspirational and Strategy may instead find itself selling Bitcoin instead. “We can sell Bitcoin and we would sell Bitcoin if we needed to fund our dividend payments below 1x mNAV,” Strategy CEO Phong Le said on a podcast last Friday. It was a remarkable statement from a company that is premised on the value of Bitcoin always increasing. More remarkable was when Saylor, who frequently exhorts the popular hold-on-to-your-Bitcoin phrase “HODL,” repeated on Monday that Strategy could sell some Bitcoin. On Tuesday, Strategy CFO Andrew Kang qualified the statement by saying the company planned to sell Bitcoin as a last resort and only if mNAV stays below one for a “very extended period.” Whatever the specifics, Strategy’s acknowledgment it could sell Bitcoin combined with the new dollar reserve fund has sparked a new wave of vitriol from Strategy critics. Those include Peter Schiff, an advocate for the gold industry and longtime crypto critic, who claims the company is coming undone, and that Saylor is the “biggest con man” on Wall Street. Today is the beginning of the end of $MSTR. Saylor was forced to sell stock not to buy Bitcoin, but to buy U.S. dollars merely to fund MSTR's interest and dividend obligations. The stock is broken. The business model is a fraud, and @Saylor is the biggest con man on Wall Street. If Schiff’s view—hardly a consensus one—is correct and Strategy has to liquidate, then the broader crypto market could be hit hard since the selloff would almost certainly trigger a downward price spiral for Bitcoin. Even if Strategy has to sell only a portion of its holdings, it could trigger a contagion in which hundreds of other so-called digital asset treasuries (DATs) do the same. But even as skeptics label Strategy and the DAT model as a house of cards built on financial chicanery, others view them as early leaders in an emerging category of crypto banks. Whatever one thinks of Saylor, there is no denying he is a natural showman. In his Dec. 1 presentation announcing the new U.S. dollar reserve, he displayed a futuristic-looking spaceship in garish green and orange with a Bitcoin powered reactor at its core. “Think of [the dollar reserve] as a $USD battery. We’re basically using a nuclear reactor to spin a generator to charge a battery,” explained Saylor. For Saylor’s detractors, all of this smacks of the worst type of hucksterism. Others see a visionary who is using compelling metaphors and imagery to help the public understand a complex new financial mechanism. The latter include Sebastian Bea, a former longtime BlackRock executive and Olympic rower, who is now president of a digital asset treasury called ReserveOne. According to Bea, Saylor is pursuing a sophisticated long-term strategy, and has surrounded himself with a team of corporate finance experts, including board member Peter Briger, who has had a distinguished career at Goldman Sachs and Fortress Investment Group. In this context, Saylor’s plans to purchase a growing supply of Bitcoin by tapping into capital markets for equity, commodities, and derivatives makes sense. As he and Strategy’s CFO explained this week, that plan includes bringing in revenue by lending Bitcoin and selling covered call options. For all of this to work, though, the value of Bitcoin will have to keep appreciating. This notion strikes crypto skeptics as absurd, but crypto advocates point out correctly that Bitcoin has grown faster than nearly any other asset over the past decade, and is poised for longer-term gains as large entities ranging from sovereign wealth funds to university endowments add it to their portfolios. In the latest bullish signal, Vanguard—which has refused to add crypto to its portfolio for years—elected to add Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs this week. If Bitcoin does keep appreciating, Strategy will be able to keep obtaining credit against the surplus value in the same way a company can do with real estate in a desirable market. There will of course be downturns but, according to Bea, Strategy “has planned for this” and has a healthy overall asset to debt ratio. Bea adds that the recent wave of digital asset treasury companies are akin to a new type of bank, and that their model is evolving rapidly. He points out that some, including ReserveOne, are based around cryptocurrencies like Ethereum that do provide yield unlike Bitcoin, which provides additional breathing room on the corporate finance front. Bea acknowledged that the impending move by MSCI to exclude DATs from indexes could be a significant headwind, and said that companies based around crypto holdings need time to evolve. Cosmo Jiang, a partner at the crypto-focused venture capital firm Pantera, likewise believes that digital asset treasuries—including a Solana-focused company he is backing—will become a permanent feature of the financial landscape. “We’re seeing the genesis of a whole new category of business,” Jiang told Fortune, adding that DATs are poised to earn significant revenue from the fast-growing world of decentralized finance. In separate remarks to Bloomberg, Jiang made the case that the sector is currently at a low point, but that the current malaise around Strategy and similar firms is temporary. “We’re at the point where all the bad news is out there, and the bears are the loudest voices in the room.” Jiang noted, however, that many in the recent wave of crypto-hoarding companies are unlikely to survive, and that the business model required not just a stash of tokens, but deep experience in capital markets and corporate finance. “There will be two or three large winners” for each major cryptocurrency, he predicted. If this is the case, the coming months will likely determine whether one of those is Strategy.

Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, laid out its vision for 2026 and — reading past its bearish outlook for U.S. bonds and the world's largest economy — it’s a bullish blueprint for institutional crypto adoption. U.S. federal debt will swell past $38 trillion, setting the tone for a market outlook defined by fragility and the failure of traditional hedges, according to the report. For crypto that's good news, because this economic environment will lead to accelerated digital asset adoption among the Wall Street behemoths. More government borrowing "... creates vulnerabilities to shocks such as bond yield spikes tied to fiscal concerns or policy tensions between managing inflation and debt servicing costs," the report said. The warning on long-term U.S. Treasuries, the traditional backbone of finance, is a signal AI-driven leverage and government debt is likely to make the financial system more fragile, and may compel institutions to turn to alternative assets like bitcoin BTC$92,081.34 as a hedge against fiscal failure. The institutional flood of money into crypto, exemplified by the BlackRock’s $100 billion in bitcoin ETF allocations, its top revenue source, promises to take digital assets to all-time highs next year, with some analysts forecasting the largest cryptocurrency will climb to more than $200,000. This is all part of a "modest but meaningful step toward a tokenized financial system," which provides the decentralized infrastructure to handle the private credit and asset management institutions seek. CEO Larry Fink described tokenization as the next generation of financial markets. The world’s largest asset manager’s report says it clearly: where government debt fails, the digital economy begins. ​​As for stablecoins, digital assets whose value is pegged to a real-world asset like the dollar or gold, they "are no longer niche, they're becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity," said Samara Cohen, Blackrock's global head of market development. The surge in computing power to drive AI is already benefiting bitcoin miners, who are able to parlay their energy deals into new uses as surging demand for high-performance computing drives up the value of their infrastructure. The AI buildout is constrained not by chips, but by power, accordion the report. In fact, AI data centers could demand up to 20% of current U.S. electricity by 2030. Several publicly traded mining firms reported increased revenue this year not just from mining, but from leasing out data center capacity to AI companies in need of power-hungry GPUs.

Title: Secretive $3T Fund Giant Makes Flashy Move Into Private Assets

Capital Group is teaming up with KKR to add private credit to its fund lineup and retirement portfolios. December 3, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Capital Group succeeded in keeping a low profile for almost a century, not even posting a sign outside its sprawling Los Angeles headquarters to call attention to its presence, as it offered millions of investors an array of mutual funds branded with a different humdrum name. But over much of the past decade, the firm looked on while rivals reinvented themselves and the rise of passive index investing and exchange-traded funds eroded its core business. Now, insiders say the world’s biggest active-only money manager can’t afford to watch from the sidelines any longer. In a break from its traditionally staid and secretive approach, the firm is embarking on a splashy marketing campaign, expanding its lineup of ETFs and ramping up a private-markets partnership with buyout giant KKR & Co. that it hopes will attract more retail money. The efforts, led by Chief Executive Officer Mike Gitlin, amount to one of Capital Group’s biggest strategic shifts since its 1931 founding. In an industry under immense pressure to change, the $3.3 trillion firm — best known for its lineup of American Funds and a big investor in the S&P 500’s top five companies including Nvidia Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. — is worried about getting left behind as private-markets rivals such as Apollo Global Management Inc. and Blackstone Inc. ramp up their own initiatives to attract more retail investors. Related:RIA Edge Private Markets: Crosscurrents in Private Credit, Real Estate “Every single client is shrinking their list of preferred partners,” Gitlin, 55, who declined an interview request, said in an emailed response to questions, adding that raising the firm’s voice reinforces its position with clients and helps attract new ones. “We’re constantly evolving.” Wealth advisers are narrowing rosters to just two or three managers that can offer a wide range of investing menus, including illiquid private-market strategies. New alliances are forming between established firms with access to everyday Americans and alternative asset managers that can originate privately negotiated deals. To that end, Gitlin is teaming up with KKR to launch funds for retail investors — and the pact is set to expand next year, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg. It includes Capital Group’s first target-date fund for retirement plans that will contain public and private assets, as well as a similar model portfolio for retail investors. The firm will also manage some money for KKR’s Global Atlantic insurance arm. The partnership is designed to give investors diversified portfolios that blend public and private markets, according to KKR Co-CEOs Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall. “Together, we can help close the gap between what’s available to institutions and what’s accessible to everyday savers,” they said in an emailed statement. Related:Smaller Loans, Big Impact: Direct Lending Excels in the Lower Middle Market This story is based on conversations with more than 20 people familiar with Capital Group whoasked not to be identified discussing internal matters. There’s a lot at stake for Gitlin, the former Citigroup Inc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. sales and trading executive, who took the helm in 2023, after investors had begun to turn away from the very mutual funds that long fueled Capital Group’s success. For each of the past 10 years, clients pulled more money out of the firm’s equity mutual funds and related products than they put in. Inflows into fixed-income and retirement products and new ETFs are beginning to mitigate those redemptions, which had persisted since 2021. “Private markets are the natural next frontier for asset managers like Capital Group,” said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management, which invests in other money managers. “They can’t keep growing or even maintain their AUM by just continuing to do what they’ve done before. They have to evolve more than ever, but it's an increasingly crowded space, so it won’t be easy.” Related:InspereX Teams with SUBSCRIBE, Luma to Launch Alts Platform So far, two new funds with KKR have more than $500 million of assets under management. “It would take us 50 years to create KKR’s 50-year track record,” Gitlin said, adding that a partnership was always more likely than expanding through acquisitions. Capital Group’s clandestine and quirky culture — some even call it cult-like — has long fascinated the industry. Employees — in phone conversations, emails and meetings — are known by a combination of letters relating to their initials instead of their actual names. “Performance” is a shunned word, as it’s deemed to be better suited for the stage. Instead, executives talk about “results.” Given that the average tenure of portfolio managers is about two decades, these idiosyncrasies have become embedded in the culture. The firm has even branded its own management approach: the Capital System. Every portfolio is split across a team of managers and analysts, with each overseeing their own sleeve to avoid “star manager” risk. Junior employees expend a lot of time and energy networking internally, with potentially big rewards for those who can climb the ladder to become partner, which comes with life-changing compensation. Pay packages have elicited envy, with top portfolio managers earning about $10 million a year. But true to the firm’s typical pace, that doesn’t happen quickly, even for the best performers. Long-term bonuses aren’t paid based on the amount of assets managed, but on one-, three-, five- and eight-year track records, with more weight given to the latter, which discourages portfolio managers from making outsize short-term bets. With its push into privates, Capital Group is discarding some of the legacy peculiarities to appeal to retail investors. This year, it commissioned a hot-air balloon dubbed Winds of Frankfurt emblazoned with the firm's logo to fly over Germany to promote its business there. In September, it set up a pickleball court at an industry event in California that attracted thousands of financiers. Gitlin, described by some insiders as a driven salesman, is getting into the act, too: He hosts podcasts with the firm’s investors and sports stars, and posted photos of himself at the beach and elsewhere while he trained for a half-marathon. Like others in the industry, Gitlin is taking to social media to engage directly with a new prospective audience and shape the firm’s story. There are some personnel changes afoot, including the nature of Gitlin’s role as CEO. The firm has grown more complex and began pumping out new products in recent years, competing with the likes of BlackRock Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. in actively managed ETFs. As a result, Gitlin was tasked with solely running the business, rather than also managing money as his predecessors had done. There also has been turnover among senior executives, a rare occurrence historically, with at least five recent departures. They include Maddi Dessner, head of global asset class services, and Ryan Murphy, product leader of public-private strategies. Beth Rodenhuis, who oversaw digital products, left to become chief operating officer at Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. Meanwhile, more outsiders are joining the top ranks. The firm is hiring for a head of private markets — a newly created position — and brought on a prominent Washington lobbying firm with close ties to the Trump administration. Joseph Lai, a former McKinsey & Co. partner and leader in its asset-management practice, was tapped to become senior vice president of strategy, digital capabilities and analytics. The challenge for the firm has grown more apparent within the past decade. Its ETFs, which debuted in 2022, account for about $100 billion of assets — and before taking the helm, Gitlin built the fixed-income business into apowerhouse with more than $600 billion. But that still hasn’t been enough to completely offset the redemptions from its core lineup of American Funds. Read More: Capital Group Builds Bond Team to Chase Pimco in Fixed Income Capital Group’s mutual fund business has long been dominated by a relatively small list of very large US equity funds that have often beaten benchmarks and rivals. But its biggest mutual fund — Growth Fund of America, which dates to 1973 — shows the limits of its investing prowess when clients continue to march toward ETFs or low-cost index funds. With about $340 billion of client assets, it’s the largest actively managed mutual fund in the US, and it’s held in retirement and individual brokerage accounts for years at a time. Its performance has boosted assets roughly 40% over the past five years, fueled by large holdings in Nvidia, Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp., as well as a leading stake in Broadcom Inc. It also has one of the largest mutual fund stakes in OpenAI. That apparently hasn’t been enough for clients, who pulled $122 billion from the fund since the start of 2015 through September, according to Morningstar Inc. “Mutual funds remain in net outflows across the industry,” Gitlin said. “But overall we’re seeing strong demand for our investment services.” Capital Group, which previously dabbled in private markets, deliberated for roughly two years over how to grow in the asset class. Its portfolio managers regularly talk about investing in companies for the long term rather than trading in their shares, somewhat similar to take-private deals. Decades ago, it had a relationship with Sequoia Capital, the famed Silicon Valley tech investor, and some of its employees were able to invest in Sequoia’s funds, amassing considerable wealth in the process. Capital Group also briefly had an emerging-markets private equity strategy that struggled to grow and then shuttered. This time it’s trying to do private markets at scale and with its own resources. The hunt for a partner came with some fanfare, including pitches from KKR competitors including Apollo, Blackstone and Carlyle Group Inc. Top executives from some of those firms visited Capital Group’s headquarters, and Capital Group managers traveled to the East Coast for additional talks. Capital Group’s distribution network and relationships with legions of financial advisers was the crown jewel, as the winning bidder would inherit access to potentially millions of clients. The firm has relationships with more than 20 million households, and about 75% of all US financial advisers — roughly 216,000 in all — have Capital Group or American Funds in their portfolios. A meeting at Gitlin’s home with KKR’s Nuttall clinched the deal. KKR won because of its range of investment strategies and lack of overlap with what each firm was already offering: KKR can originate private assets, and Capital Group can bundle them to sell through its vast network of salespeople. The pair noted publicly that their cultures were among the most aligned. The two new funds, Capital Group KKR Core Plus+ and Capital Group KKR Multi-Sector+, have targets of 60% publicly traded debt and 40% private credit, including direct loans and debt backed by tangible assets. Two more planned funds will include private equity and real assets, according to the memo seen by Bloomberg. Negotiations on economics and break clauses for the partnership went down to the wire, with final terms being hashed out in the hours before it was announced. Agreeing on fees was among the thorniest challenges. Capital Group’s funds typically charge 0.2%to 1% of assets. By comparison,some KKR funds for wealthy individuals — in the K Series — levy management fees of more than 1% and performance fees of roughly 12%. The co-run funds charge as little as 0.84% and 0.89%, with no incentive fee. KKR will earn fees on the amount of assets it manages for the public-private credit funds. Another source of friction: differing expectations about how quickly products can be rolled out. KKR has been trying to accelerate the timing of some of the funds, while Capital Group has been taking a more deliberative approach, according to people familiar with the matter. A Capital Group spokesperson said the two firms are aligned on timing. Capital Group hasn’t pitched itself directly to investors historically, preferring to distribute funds through so-called wholesalers to financial advisers, who then market them to retail clients. American Funds are regularly among the top financial distribution relationships with the likes of Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill. American Funds’ ties with Edward Jones, a firm with more than 20,000 financial advisers, is among the tightest in the history of mutual funds. American Funds paid Edward Jones $125 million in revenue-sharing agreements last year, more than triple the next largest recipient, and more than JPMorgan, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Invesco Ltd. combined, according to disclosures by Edward Jones. LPL Financial Holdings Inc., which services thousands of advisers, receives as much as 0.035% of assets invested in American Funds, plus a flat annual payment of up to $5 million. The Capital Group-KKR products “are designed to be more accessible and easier to implement,” Cheri Belski, LPL’s head of investment management solutions, said in an emailed statement. The race to capture the trillions of dollars of wealth in the hands of retail investors may be one of the biggest opportunities of the next decade, and Capital Group’s deep ties with such clients could position it to be one of the winners. “The partnership and push into private assets is potentially a big identity shift for Capital Group,” said St. Aubin, the Ocean Park CIO. “How it positions itself will be key.” To contact the authors of this story:Laura Benitez in Los Angeles at [email protected]Silla Brush in New York at [email protected] Laura Benitez Silla Brush You May Also Like Trusts & Estates for Advisors Copyright © 2025 Informa Connect Limited.

Title: BlackRock bets on tokenization, but IMF warns of uncontrollable ‘atomic’ domino effect

Time Published: 2025-12-03T14:30:28Z

Both BlackRock and the IMF acknowledge the potential of tokenization, but differ on its long-term effects. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world, has described tokenization as the most critical market upgrade since the early internet. On the other hand, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) describes it as a volatile, untested architecture that can amplify financial shocks at machine speed. Both institutions are looking at the same innovation. Yet, the distance between their conclusions captures the most consequential debate in modern finance: whether tokenized markets will reinvent global infrastructure or reproduce its worst fragilities with new velocity. In a Dec. 1 op-ed for The Economist, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein argued that recording asset ownership on digital ledgers represents the next structural step in a decades-long modernization arc. They framed tokenization as a financial leap comparable to the arrival of SWIFT in 1977 or the shift from paper certificates to electronic trading. In contrast, the IMF warned in a recent explainer video that tokenized markets could be prone to flash crashes, liquidity fractures, and smart-contract domino cascades that turn local failures into systemic shocks. The split over tokenization arises from the fact that the two institutions operate under very different mandates. BlackRock, which has already rolled out tokenized funds and dominates the spot ETF market for digital assets, approaches tokenization as an infrastructure play. Its incentive is to expand global market access, compress settlement cycles to “T+0,” and broaden the investable universe. In that context, blockchain-based ledgers look like the next logical step in the evolution of financial plumbing. This means the technology offers a way to strip out costs and latency in the traditional financial world. However, the IMF operates from the opposite direction. As the stabilizer of the global monetary system, it focuses on the hard-to-predict feedback loops that arise when markets operate at extremely high speed. Traditional finance relies on settlement delays to net transactions and conserve liquidity. Tokenization introduces instantaneous settlement and composability across smart contracts. That structure is efficient in calm periods but can propagate shocks far faster than human intermediaries can respond. These perspectives do not contradict each other so much as they reflect different layers of responsibility. BlackRock is tasked with building the next generation of investment products. The IMF is tasked with identifying the fault lines before they spread. Tokenization sits at the intersection of that tension. Fink and Goldstein describe tokenization as a bridge “built from both sides of a river,” connecting traditional institutions with digital-first innovators. They argue that shared digital ledgers can eliminate slow, manual processes and replace disparate settlement pipelines with standardized rails that participants across jurisdictions can verify instantly. This view is not theoretical, though the data requires careful parsing. According to Token Terminal, the broader tokenized ecosystem is approaching $300 billion, a figure heavily anchored by dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC. However, the actual test lies in the roughly $30 billion wedge of regulated real-world assets (RWAs), such as tokenized Treasuries, private credit, and bonds. Indeed, these regulated assets are no longer restricted to pilot programs. Tokenized government bond funds such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and Ondo’s products are now live. At the same time, precious metals have moved on-chain as well, with significant volumes in digital gold. The market has also seen fractionalized real estate shares and tokenized private credit instruments expand the investable universe beyond listed bonds and equities. In light of this, forecasts for this sector range from the optimistic to the astronomical. Reports from firms such as RedStone Finance project a “blue sky” scenario in which on-chain RWAs could reach $30 trillion by 2034. Meanwhile, more conservative estimates from McKinsey & Co. suggest the market could double as funds and treasuries migrate to blockchain rails. For BlackRock, even the conservative case represents a multi-trillion-dollar restructuring of financial infrastructure. Yet the IMF sees a parallel, less stable future. Its concern centers on the mechanics of atomic settlement. In today’s markets, trades are often “netted” at the end of the day, meaning banks only need to move the difference between what they bought and sold. Atomic settlement requires every trade to be fully funded instantly. In stressed conditions, this demand for pre-funded liquidity can spike, potentially causing liquidity to evaporate exactly when it is needed most. If automated contracts then trigger liquidations “like falling dominoes,” a localized problem could become a systemic cascade before regulators even receive the alert. Part of the enthusiasm around tokenization stems from the question of where the next cycle of market growth may originate. The last crypto cycle was characterized by memecoin-driven speculation, which generated high activity but drained liquidity without expanding long-term adoption. Advocates of tokenization argue that the next expansion will be driven not by retail speculation but by institutional yield strategies, including tokenized private credit, real-world debt instruments, and enterprise-grade vaults delivering predictable returns. Tokenization, in this framing, is not merely a technical upgrade but a new liquidity channel. Institutional allocators facing a constrained traditional yield environment may migrate to tokenized credit markets, where automated strategies and programmable settlement can yield higher, more efficient returns. However, this future remains unrealized because large banks, insurers, and pension funds face regulatory constraints. The Basel III Endgame rules, for example, assign punitive capital treatment to certain digital assets classified as “Group 2,” discouraging exposure to tokenized instruments unless regulators clarify the distinctions between volatile cryptocurrencies and regulated tokenized securities. Until that boundary is defined, the “wall of money” remains more potential than reality. Furthermore, the IMF argues that even if the funds arrive, they carry hidden leverage. A complex stack of automated contracts, collateralized debt positions, and tokenized credit instruments may create recursive dependencies. During periods of volatility, these chains can unwind faster than risk engines are designed to handle. The very features that make tokenization attractive, such as the instant settlement, composability, and global access, create feedback mechanisms that could amplify stress. The debate between BlackRock and the IMF is not about whether tokenization will integrate into global markets; it already has. It is about the trajectory of that integration. One path envisions a more efficient, accessible, globally synchronized market structure. The other anticipates a landscape where speed and connectivity create new forms of systemic vulnerability. However, in that future, the outcome will depend on whether global institutions can converge on coherent standards for interoperability, disclosure, and automated risk controls.

Title: Binance Bitcoin Reserves Decline: Is It Time to Worry?

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. As Bitcoin reserves on Binance continue to drop, many fear it’s a sign of lost faith. However, experts argue it’s actually a bullish trend in disguise. Bitcoin reserves held at Binance have fallen sharply in recent months: from roughly $71 billion at the peak to about $51 billion. However, on-chain researchers argue the move reflects structural accumulation and custody shifts rather than an exodus of confidence. CryptoQuant trackers and exchange-balance roundups attribute the decline to coins leaving trading wallets for longer-term storage, a pattern that has historically aligned with constructive market phases. Why Binance’s Bitcoin Reserves Are Declining “Historically, such conditions have supported medium- to long-term price appreciation. The current trend suggests that Binance’s reserve decline is a normal re-accumulation phase.” – By @xwinfinance pic.twitter.com/g3TCG4o6GD — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 3, 2025 Part of the drawdown is mechanical. As U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs gather assets, acquired BTC $92 375 24h volatility: 0.9% Market cap: $1.84 T Vol. 24h: $66.75 B is moved off exchanges and into external custodians for safekeeping. Therefore, it reduces the immediately tradable supply at venues like Binance. Industry coverage this week singled out inflows to funds from BlackRock and Fidelity as a key driver of lower exchange balances. It is consistent with CryptoQuant’s own playbook, which interprets exchange-reserve outflows driven by long-term custody as a bullish signal. Despite a 36% price decline from the ATH, the total Bitcoin ETF AUM (in BTC terms) has only declined by 3.5%, and 8.0% in USD cumulative terms. 60% of ETF inflows were at prices higher than today. Get more insights like this our market update newsletter: https://t.co/DFzmnPjy0U pic.twitter.com/oLwou1DK9R — Alec Dejanovic 🟠 🐊 (@alecdejanovicAU) December 2, 2025 While BTC reserves declined, stablecoin balances on Binance rose to record highs. The numbers crossed $50–51 billion by several tallies. Analysts frame this as sidelined capital that could re-enter as sentiment improves. CryptoQuant and market dashboards also note the BTC-to-stablecoin reserve ratio at Binance has sunk to multi-year lows, a setup that has preceded past rallies by signaling outsized buying power relative to available BTC on the venue. Broader tape still matters. Bitcoin dipped below $90,000 earlier this week amid risk-off flows and ETF redemptions, then stabilized. The move reminds traders that macro conditions can swamp constructive on-chain reads in the short run. Still, the combination of fewer coins on exchanges and more stablecoin “ammo” is the kind of on-chain backdrop bulls prefer.

More Info Saudi Arabia has launched production at the giant Jafurah natural gas field, the largest non-associated gas development in the Kingdom, which is key to the Saudi goal to significantly boost its gas processing capacity to meet rising demand. Saudi Aramco, the state oil giant, has completed the first phase of the Jafurah Gas Plant construction and launched production at the field with a capacity of 450 million cubic feet per day, the Saudi Finance Ministry said in the 2026 Budget announcement. Sustainable production at Jafurah is expected to reach 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day after the project is completed by 2030, the ministry said in highlights of the key Saudi achievements in the 2025 fiscal year. Earlier this year, BlackRock, through its Global Infrastructure Partners unit, led an $11 billion lease deal with Saudi Aramco involving key natural gas infrastructure tied to the Jafurah project. With a price tag of a total of $100 billion, the Jafurah development is described as the largest unconventional gas development outside the United States. Its reserves are estimated at some 229 trillion cubic feet of natural gas plus 75 billion barrels of condensate. When completed by 2030, the huge project is also expected to produce 420 million standard cubic feet per day of ethane, and 630,000 barrels per day of high-value liquids by 2030. The Jafurah project is a cornerstone of Saudi Aramco’s strategic gas expansion, which focuses on supplying growing natural gas demand in the Kingdom while investing in global LNG markets. “Jafurah kickstarts our plan to expand our overall sales gas production capacity, which will contribute to Saudi Arabia’s growth ambitions across multiple sectors including energy, artificial intelligence, and major industries such as petrochemicals,” Aramco president and CEO Amin Nasser said upon the completion of the $11-billion Jafurah midstream deal.

Title: Wall Street FOMO Over Vanguard’s Bitcoin ETF Pivot: $HYPER Rides the Wave
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/vanguard-etf-pivot-causes-fomo-as-hyper-rides-the-wave/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: For years, Vanguard stood out as the big asset manager that wanted nothing to do with spot Bitcoin ETFs. That stance quietly shifted, and the pivot matters. When a $9+ trillion retirement giant opens the door to $BTC exposure, it adds another massive gatekeeper to the on-ramp for mainstream capital. It saw $BTC rally on Tuesday, jumping back up to the $92K mark from a recent dip below the $86K region. You now have BlackRock, Fidelity, and Vanguard funneling retirement portfolios, 401(k)s, and brokerage accounts into spot Bitcoin. That flow doesn’t just push up $BTC’s market cap; it changes how traditional investors think about crypto risk. Bitcoin starts to look like ‘digital gold core holding,’ not a speculative side bet. The knock-on effect is obvious for traders: if Bitcoin becomes the safe, ETF-wrapped asset, the search for higher-octane upside moves further out on the risk curve. That’s where ecosystem plays, infrastructure tokens, and early-stage presales come in. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself exactly in that lane, pitching itself as a Bitcoin-native Layer 2 with Solana-grade performance. As capital crowds into spot BTC via TradFi rails, the question for more aggressive crypto traders isn’t ‘Should I own Bitcoin?’ anymore. It’s ‘Where can I get leveraged exposure to the Bitcoin network’s growth without using actual leverage?’ Wall Street’s ETF embrace solves one thing: easy Bitcoin exposure inside familiar accounts. It doesn’t solve Bitcoin’s technical pain points. The base layer still processes roughly 7 transactions per second, with confirmation times measured in minutes and fees that spike into double digits when mempools clog. That limitation is a feature for store-of-value purists, but a brick wall for anyone wanting DeFi, gaming, or consumer apps atop Bitcoin. So you’re seeing a rush of infrastructure projects racing to bolt smart contracts and high throughput onto $BTC without compromising its settlement assurances. Competing visions include Ordinals-centric tooling, sidechains like Rootstock, and experimental rollup frameworks. In that crowded field, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is pitching itself as a unique contender, differentiating through Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) compatibility. It has an explicit focus on traders and DeFi power users looking to amplify Bitcoin’s upside rather than just hold ETF shares. Zooming in, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) markets itself as ‘the first ever Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration,’ aiming to deliver performance that can exceed Solana’s own execution speeds. Anchored by a canonical bridge that links Bitcoin’s security to high-speed execution, Bitcoin Hyper’s modular architecture combines the best of both worlds. The system relies on Bitcoin L1 for settlement while offloading processing to a real-time SVM Layer 2, where a single sequencer commits state roots on-chain. This bridge allows you to escape L1 congestion and access an ecosystem of instant, low-cost wrapped $BTC payments, NFTs, and DeFi. With support for Rust SDKs and Solana-style APIs, Bitcoin Hyper brings high-performance gaming and complex smart contracts to Bitcoin. If you want more info, check out our ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper’ guide. The market seems to be paying attention as the Bitcoin Hyper presale has raised over $28.8M so far. And smart money is moving. High-net-worth wallets have been making purchases as large as $500K. Our experts see a potential end-of-2026 high of $0.08625, which, if you bought at today’s price, would see you with a potential ROI of over 545%. If you believe Vanguard and its peers will keep funneling conservative capital into spot Bitcoin, Layer 2s like $HYPER offer a different angle: upside tied not just to $BTC’s price, but to whether Bitcoin can finally host high-throughput applications at scale. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

Share this article BlackRock, the investment management giant, moved 44,140 Ethereum worth around $135 million in Ethereum to Coinbase Prime today. The transfer represents the latest on-chain activity involving the asset manager’s crypto operations. BlackRock oversees spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds, focusing on integrating crypto into traditional investment portfolios. The firm has been actively depositing Bitcoin and Ethereum into Coinbase Prime to facilitate operations for its crypto ETFs amid portfolio adjustments. Coinbase Prime serves as a specialized platform for institutional crypto custody and trading, providing secure handling of digital assets in regulated environments. The platform often facilitates ETF operations and strategic asset management for large institutional clients. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA) reported around $89 million in net outflows yesterday, while funds from Fidelity and Grayscale posted gains. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Vanguard Raises White Flag Over Crypto ETFs

The company on Tuesday reversed its ban on Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs, giving access to many of its 50 million clients. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com For having a name that means leading actions, movements and the development of new ideas, Vanguard has been curiously behind the industry in giving its clients access to crypto ETFs. That was the case until yesterday, when the low-cost, investor-focused financial giant made a big change, allowing some of the more mainstream (meaning not memecoin) digital-asset exchange-traded funds onto its brokerage system. That followed a decision by Morgan Stanley in October to expand crypto access to all clients, rather than limiting it to those with high risk tolerance and at least $1.5 million, as it previously had. And Vanguard’s change coincides with a move by Bank of America to recommend allocations of 1% to 4% of wealth management clients’ assets to Bitcoin ETFs. “Vanguard is the latest TradFi firm to do an about-face on crypto,” said Ric Edelman, founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, crediting CEO Salim Ramji, who has been at the helm since mid-2024, with the development. “It’s impossible to view this as anything other than highly bullish for Bitcoin and other major digital assets.” Vanguard acknowledged the already high and growing demand for Bitcoin ETFs and other crypto assets, in a note to investors. The company didn’t publicize the change in the ways it would for a fund launch, new model portfolios or retirement data report. But it stated clearly on its site that its more than 50 million investor clients should approach crypto with caution. “These products have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity; the administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured; and investor preferences continue to evolve,” the company stated. The funds are available in brokerage accounts, meaning that defined-contribution plan participants don’t have access outside of brokerage windows, a spokesperson told ETF Upside. There’s plenty for people to be excited (or worried) about: Righting the Ship? Edelman cast Vanguard’s until-now ban on crypto as a mistake. But in fixing the alleged mistake, the company is doing so at an opportune time, he said. “By making Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana and other crypto ETFs available to its 50 million customers, Vanguard is letting them buy while crypto prices are 30% below their all-time highs,” he said. “Vanguard customers who take advantage of the sudden availability will find themselves sitting on nice profits in the future.”Still, it’s not necessarily right for everyone. “Crypto access is all well and good. But access is not an investment plan,” Jeff DeMaso, editor of the Independent Vanguard Adviser, said in a note to investors. “For most investors, owning little, or none, is perfectly acceptable.” The rise of model portfolios has enabled issuers to choose funds in their best interest — not necessarily the client’s. AI and other tech platforms can help ETF issuers identify the best sales prospects among firms in their target markets. Asset managers acknowledge the reality of paying to access Schwab customers, as they have started to do with Fidelity. As active ETFs have exploded, so too has thematic investing, a dangerous trend for most investors, the author of a Morningstar report said. Some products don’t have the capital to get off the ground. Larger ETF issuers can fix that. The bond ladder ETFs come with a target date and can help advisors build income for clients’ major life events. The ETF issuer is among the first in line for dual share classes, and it plans to use mutual-fund shares to access 401(k) plans. Buffered ETFs are surging in popularity, particularly among retirees, and that bodes well for their future. More than half of RIAs increased the number of strategies in which they invested. ETF investors can feel the magic between A and I. It’s why they say they’re loading up on funds. Investors pulled more than half a billion dollars out of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust in just one day last week. So-called copycat filings are picking up, but whether they’re a problem remains up for debate. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Model Portfolios Decide Which ETFs Succeed. That Might Not Be a Good Thing

The rise of model portfolios has enabled issuers to choose funds in their best interest — not necessarily the client’s. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Advisors need to be unbiased, but what about the model portfolios they choose? Not surprisingly, when issuers create a model portfolio, they’re incentivized to include their own ETFs. But more and more funds with meager assets are suddenly spiking to reach hundreds of millions of dollars in AUM in just a few days, all because they were added to a major issuer’s model. The consequences could be significant for advisors who are increasingly relying on model portfolios, and who want to provide unbiased fiduciary advice to their clients, but don’t know where to start. “We see this trend, and it’s a little disturbing,” said Joe Mallen, CEO of Modelist, which builds customized portfolios for fiduciaries. “I don’t blame anyone for doing that. We just think that the relationship of who’s designing the model for the advisor should be one that suits the advisor, not the asset manager.” Earlier this month, the iShares Systematic Bond ETF (SYSB) grew to more than $600 million from just $67 million in a matter of days after it was added to one of BlackRock’s portfolios. The reason for BlackRock’s decision came down to expense ratios, Mallen said. However, BlackRock stated in a client communication shared with VettaFi that the firm is reducing “overweight to growth by adding to value, and pivoting from quality to momentum.” SYSB charges 25 basis points, while a comparable iShares bond product, IUSB, has a fee of just 6 basis points. That spread could generate more than $1 million in annual revenue based on the funds’ assets, according to Mallen. A recent VettaFi report pointed out spikes and falls in other funds due to model adjustments: A New Model. As more advisors rely on model portfolios to free up time with their clients, they’re spending less time doing due diligence, said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF Research & Analytics at CFRA Research. What might help in the future are tools that not only compare ETFs, but model portfolios, as well. “Should [advisors] be more aware? I think the answer is yes,” he added. “They need to know who’s the provider, what kinds of funds they tend to select, and then also choose the right model provider. You may want a model provider who’s agnostic to which funds are included.” The company on Tuesday reversed its ban on Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs, giving access to many of its 50 million clients.

Title: Ron Johnson tells ‘Pod Force One’ he is perplexed by ‘bizarre’ mystery surrounding would-be Trump assassin

WASHINGTON — Sen. Ron Johnson raised concerns about the lack of information about would-be presidential assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks and defended his subpoena of the FBI for records on him during an interview on “Pod Force One.” “All of a sudden I realize, here we are a year later, I haven’t heard a peep out of this. We still don’t know about, what did his social media accounts say?” Johnson (R-Wis.) lamented on the podcast. “Why haven’t we unlocked this information? Why doesn’t America know more about it?” he added. “There’s some odd things about it, him appearing in commercials for, was it BlackRock, just like the other potential assassin down in Palm Beach. I mean, it’s just bizarre stuff. I mean, explain this to us.” Crooks was ultimately killed by countersnipers after getting off a shot that grazed the top of President Trump’s right ear during his fateful July 13, 2024, rally in Butler, Pa. The 20-year-old killed firefighter Corey Comperatore and injured two others. Johnson, who helms the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, subpoenaed the FBI back in July this year for records on Crooks amid those concerns. “My subpoenas to this administration are friendly subpoenas,” he explained, before later adding: “There’s so many enormous messes that Trump and his department heads are trying to clean up. Some of these are maybe a high priority to me or you, but they’ve got kind of bigger fish to fry.” The Wisconsin senator is hoping that the telecommunications companies will help with his investigation into unraveling some of the mysteries around Crooks. “I think this was a news outlet, it might have been New York Post [that] did a geo-positioning search on Crooks’ phone and kind of like that Family Circus deals, all over the place, the FBI headquarters,” Johnson recounted. “My staff kind of cautions me about talking about that, because we’re not quite sure of the validity of thatas well. But I mean, again, those are the kinds of questions that deserve answers,” he added. “It’s those kind of questions that go unanswered that just feed into conspiracy theories.” In February, The Post reported on how a private investigator who looked into Crooks concluded that one of the electronic devices geolocated with Crooks at several different places at the time of the shooting was still pinging in Bethel Park High School. That investigator was suspicious that Crooks didn’t act alone.

Title: Michael Dell, who’s donating $6.25 billion to ‘Trump Accounts’ for kids, says a childhood savings account changed his life
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/03/michael-dell-donation-trump-accounts-kids-childhood-savings-account/
Time Published: 2025-12-03T10:54:14Z
Full Content:
Good morning. Earlier this week, I spoke to Michael Dell about his plan to put $250 in the so-called Trump Accounts (now called Invest America accounts) of 25 million American kids when the savings program launches next year. The $6.25 billion donation is more than double the total amount that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation has dispensed in its 26-year history. As he told me in a wide-ranging interview: “When children have accounts like this, their outlook on life just changes.” In some ways, it changed his. “When I was about 6 or 7 years old, I got a passbook savings account. I had maybe $6 or $7 in it. I’d go to the Savings & Loan, put in a quarter, and they’d stamp my book. I learned about compound interest and savings and, I’m like, ‘This is really cool,’” he said. “That ignited an interest in me. Hopefully, these accounts will cause children to want to learn more about compound interest and the companies in the S&P 500 and investing and saving.” Dell went on to famously create the company now known as Dell Technologies in his freshman dorm room at the University of Texas at Austin in 1984, and made enough money to start giving it away about a decade later, with the foundation launching in 1999. Of course, it’s easier to give away billions when you’re worth close to $150 billion, but Americans tend to be a generous lot. Overall, people gave $592.5 billion to U.S. charities last year, a new high that was no doubt boosted by stock market gains and a buoyant economy. It helps to have mechanisms that encourage giving, such as company matches and GivingTuesday, which the Dells chose for making their announcement. Brunswick Group CEO Henry Timms deserves credit for cofounding the GivingTuesday campaign in 2012 as a day for philanthropy following the big-spending traditions of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It’s since become a global ritual that raises billions in more than 60 countries. Dell, for one, approaches philanthropy less as a handout than as an investment. “We’re very results-oriented, data-driven, outcome-focused. We took all the lessons from business and treat every grant like an investment,” he said, adding that he and his wife have other significant announcements to come. “I’ve had the opportunity to create a significant impact on the world through Dell Technologies, but the goal that we’ve set is that we want our philanthropy to have an even bigger impact.”Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Anthropic preps for an IPO Anthropic has reportedly hired lawyers from Wilson Sonsini for an upcoming IPO that could be one of the largest listings ever.

Further and 3iQ have launched a $100 million market-neutral crypto hedge fund for institutions, including a Bitcoin share class that reinvests gains in BTC. United Arab Emirates-based digital asset manager Further Asset Management has partnered with Canadian crypto investment firm 3iQ to launch a $100 million hedge fund targeting institutional investors seeking structured exposure to cryptocurrencies, including a Bitcoin-denominated share class that reinvests gains directly into BTC. According to a Wednesday announcement, the Further x 3iQ Alpha Digital Fund is a market-neutral, multi-strategy vehicle designed to deliver risk-managed exposure to liquid crypto markets under an institutional framework. The fund was seeded with capital from institutional investors, family offices and sovereign backers. “We’re providing institutional-grade, risk-managed and scalable access to digital assets, including Bitcoin, within a structure that has successfully passed the rigorous institutional due diligence of leading global capital allocators,” said Faisal Al Hammadi, managing partner at Further. Pascal St-Jean, president and CEO of 3iQ, said that the fund’s structure enables investors to “confidently pursue double-digit potential returns.” Related: Goldman Sachs buys Innovator, adds Bitcoin-linked ETF to lineup One of the fund’s key features is its dedicated Bitcoin (BTC) share class, which allows qualifying investors to subscribe in BTC and receive returns in the same denomination. The share class was anchored by a large in-kind contribution from an unidentified Abu Dhabi-based family office, providing participants with exposure designed to steadily increase Bitcoin holdings while maintaining long-term exposure to the asset. Founded in 2012, 3iQ focuses on regulated products and services tailored for institutional and professional investors seeking exposure to digital assets within traditional compliance frameworks. The company has been expanding its institutional crypto offering through infrastructure including its Digital Assets Managed Account Platform. Further operates as a UAE-based investment platform providing access to regulated opportunities across venture capital, structured products and digital assets.

The product targets a net annual yield of 4% to 8% and is aimed at meeting increasing demand for income-generating crypto strategies among professional investors. The fund has attracted backing from several investors, including Abu Dhabi–based Aspen Digital, which is regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority.

Title: Lightning in a Bottle

Time Published: 2025-12-03T10:30:00Z

This article appears in the December 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. Electricity is a public good, dating back to when rural electrification was a pressing need for the nation during the New Deal era. Yet control over this essential service today rests largely in the hands of private monopolies known as investor-owned utilities (IOUs), which provide power to nearly 70 percent of utility customers in the U.S. These monopolies are regulated at the state level by public utility commissions, which are responsible for setting rates. Utilities must justify any rate increases and convince regulators of the need for their actions. But 2025 may be the year that this regulatory framework collapses under its own contradictions. More from James Baratta In just the first half of the year, IOUs requested approval for an unprecedented $29 billion in additional revenue. They cited growing electricity demand, including from data centers powering artificial intelligence, needed upgrades to aging infrastructure, and mandates to decarbonize in several states. Yet rate hikes have also translated into skyrocketing CEO compensation and record-breaking profits for shareholders. And in many parts of the country, IOU rates are rising much faster than those of their municipally owned counterparts. This has put unbearable weight on customers. Electric bills are increasing at twice the rate of inflation on average. More than 52 million Americans were unable to pay their electric bills at least once last year, and on an annual basis, roughly three million people who cannot afford these bills have their electricity shut off. The myriad factors driving up electricity demand are “actually just shining a spotlight on the fundamental design of the utility system,” Isaac Sevier, founder and executive director of Public Grids, told the Prospect. And that design is badly broken, with public utility commissions either too confused or too captured to resist an onslaught of IOU pressure to approve rate hikes. Sevier believes this necessitates a rethink of how utilities deliver power in the U.S., and how to protect those who pay for it. He wants to restore a promising and proven alternative—public power. The movement to reclaim democratic control over utilities has cemented itself in communities across the country. In their outreach, public power advocates have connected soaring electricity prices with the need to trigger a paradigm shift in the fundamental design of the utility system, one that decouples investment planning from shareholder profits. ACCORDING TO CONSULTING FIRM ICF, load growth in the U.S. is projected to increase by 25 percent over the next five years. One of the biggest and most scrutinized factors for this is the historic expansion of data centers. Big Tech hyperscalers plan to spend up to $400 billion on the data center build-out just this year. To meet the colossal demand for AI and cloud services, data centers will more than double their 2024 energy consumption by the end of the decade. Just keeping up with all that demand would be costly for utilities. But a number of other issues are converging at once to squeeze the system. For instance, adding more power would meet demand and keep rates low, but interconnection queues can take years to hook up energy sources. As Grist reported, utilities “are now putting more than half of their expenditures into transmission and distribution through the end of the decade.” This has led to shortages of critical grid assets. More critically, IOUs have been slow to implement transformative upgrades like non-wires alternatives, which reduce reliance on traditional transmission infrastructure, and are instead plowing capital into legacy assets like poles and wires, with customers footing the bill. The IOU financial model disincentivizes grid improvements that would simply make things more efficient, as the Department of Energy (DOE) acknowledged in a report last year. Unlike investments in traditional infrastructure, modernizing the grid does not contribute to the growth of a utility’s rate base. Information asymmetry between utility commissions and utilities has given the latter carte blanche to squeeze ratepayers. Tariffs on metals like steel and aluminum have put upward pressure on construction expenses, further stalling grid upgrades and making it more costly to rebuild after disaster strikes. Hardening the grid is already an expensive endeavor ratepayers must finance. In California, utilities have spent more on underground transmission lines and passed insurance costs on to customers, while utilities in the Southeast have been known to seek higher rates to cover the cost of rebuilding after hurricanes. As the Trump administration pursues its policy of “American energy dominance,” the U.S. has continued to export more natural gas than it imports and is actively expanding its export capacity. That presents another problem for ratepayers, who find themselves more exposed to global gas market price swings. In 2022, U.S. households saw electric bills go up by almost 15 percent when the Russian invasion of Ukraine caused gas prices to spike. Trump’s full-frontal assault on renewables threatens to drive up electricity prices even further. Over the summer, he ordered the Treasury Department to “strictly enforce” the termination of wind and solar energy credits. In other words, it is now official policy to make clean-energy projects, which accounted for almost all new U.S. electrical generating capacity in the first four months of 2025, as unprofitable as possible. Fitting this together, you have the elements of a perfect storm: There’s a greater need for power at precisely the moment when there are limits, both real and artificial, on how much supply can be added. But against the backdrop of these factors, the IOUs are using their immense influence to push for even higher rates than the economic fundamentals would indicate. As a result, faith in the regulatory compact appears to be waning. IOUs ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF A REGULATORY SYSTEM they built for themselves decades ago. They enabled the concept of public utility commissions as the electricity industry was built in the early 20th century, vowing that this setup would keep the rapaciousness of the profit motive in check. In reality, the idea was to cement private ownership of utilities and resist municipal control. And it set the stage for the shenanigans that we see today. “The whole thing is like the emperor’s new clothes,” said Mark Ellis, a senior fellow at the American Economic Liberties Project and an independent expert witness who testifies before state utility commissions. In a recent report, Ellis provided evidence that unwarranted rate increases cost customers $50 billion per year, or about $300 for every U.S. household. “Many people know what’s going on is wrong,” he said, “but they’re all playing along because they’re afraid to call it out.” In his past life, Ellis was the chief economist at Sempra Energy, a consultant with McKinsey, an analyst for ExxonMobil, and an engineer for SoCal Edison. At times, he feels like the little boy in Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale who says aloud what others know but won’t admit. Regulators set electricity rates through a process known as cost-of-service regulation. The ratemaking process, in theory, is a delicate balancing act. On the one hand, public utility commissions that review utilities’ requests have the goal of ensuring that any rate increases are just and reasonable. On the other, they are pressured to set rates high enough so utilities can cover operating costs, maintenance, and expansion projects. The rate charged for electricity is supposed to equal operating costs, the cost of the capital investment, and a “just and reasonable” profit; in sum, this is known as the rate of return. All shareholder-owned companies finance their capital expenditures through a blend of debt and equity; IOUs are no different. Calculating a utility’s cost of debt is relatively straightforward, but its cost of equity, which is not directly observable, must be estimated. This becomes a key variable, and the way that additional capital expenditures can translate into higher profits. Even in the context of needing massive upgrades to decarbonize and meet expanding demand, IOUs are overinvesting, typically in the kinds of activities that don’t benefit consumers or the environment, but instead juice returns. The Supreme Court has long upheld that rate of return should equal the “cost of capital,” as determined by financial markets. Yet any cursory look at the stock prices of major IOUs shows that something is wrong. These staid, low-risk companies that are supposed to be earning tightly regulated profits are actually some of the most dazzling gainers on Wall Street. An RMI report earlier this year found that the top 20 IOUs were trading at an 81 percent premium, because their return on equity was far higher than their cost of equity. The canyon of information asymmetry between public utility commissions and the utilities they regulate has given the latter carte blanche to squeeze ratepayers. Four consulting firms, Ellis says, scour the country to testify in 90 percent of all commission rate cases, using economic models to estimate rates of return that are not used in any other area of finance. Ellis acknowledges that the legal standard “doesn’t necessarily say what model to use,” but in his paper, he explains that the models IOUs use seem to be a means to an end. For example, many consultants use an “expected earnings” analysis that arrives at a rate of return based primarily on future forecasts that the company expects to receive, a totally circular analysis. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission banned the expected earnings model from use in federal hearings in 2022, but it continues to be used at the state level. Whenever ratepayer advocates use their own witnesses and their own economic models, they come up with wildly different figures for what the rate of return should be. They are so different, in fact, that most public utility commissions wind up throwing those numbers out, so committed are they to utility industry dogma. Herein lies the fundamental ratemaking dilemma: Public utility commissions have seldom acted as a fiscal boundary to minimize operating costs. In fact, it’s just the opposite. There are signs that policymakers are beginning to get fed up with the continued burdening of the public with higher costs, without improvements to grid reliability that might justify them. This past year, lawmakers in six states introduced measures to limit utilities’ return on equity, the key variable that is overestimated to give utilities excess profits. Legislation in New York and Rhode Island seeks to cap return on equity at 4 percent, while legislators in Massachusetts and New Jersey have proposed new regulatory guidance that would require public utility commissions to minimize return on equity. To keep rates just and reasonable, enhance reliability, and accelerate the energy transition, Ellis launched MarketClear Utility Capital with the goal of delivering attractive returns on utility assets without shifting unnecessary costs onto ratepayers. In conjunction, he has proposed a new investment model for regulated utilities: competitive direct equity (CDE). IOUs generate roughly $2 in shareholder value for every dollar they invest in infrastructure. CDE would eliminate this “capital bias,” which is the driving force behind utility overinvestment. The idea is to establish a market for equity capital that links financial incentives to regulatory outcomes and affordability by replacing “the current system of regulators setting utility returns with actual market competition for utility equity investment,” Ellis wrote in a Real Clear Energy article he co-authored in October. “Under CDE, utilities would earn only their actual market-based cost of capital, removing the reward for excess spending,” he continued. “With capital bias eliminated, regulators could implement meaningful performance-based incentives that are better aligned with the public interest.” WHEN PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONERS TAKE the rare step of striving to keep rates just and reasonable, they risk their careers. According to the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI), IOUs “often use donations to charitable organizations as a means to encourage organizations to support their political agenda.” Avangrid, which owns electric and gas utilities in Connecticut, has been especially combative toward the state’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA). In 2023, several charitable organizations receiving donations from the Avangrid Foundation called on PURA to “moderate” a draft decision in which regulators rejected a rate hike requested by the company’s Connecticut-based subsidiary, United Illuminating. PURA upheld the decision. Subscribe for analysis that goes beyond the noise. Allegations lodged against Avangrid President and CEO Pedro Azagra Blázquez suggest he made “thinly veiled” efforts to pressure PURA to play ball. In a letter first obtained by CT Mirror, PURA General Counsel Scott Muska accused Azagra Blázquez of implying that the company would reduce its investment in the state if commissioners continued to hand down “adverse rulings.” Muska also alleged that Azagra Blázquez had offered opportunities for “international exposure” to then-PURA Chair Marissa P. Gillett in exchange for her support. (The Spanish multinational electric utility conglomerate Iberdrola is Avangrid’s parent company.) Gillett resigned from her post this past fall following intense backlash—particularly by Avangrid—over her efforts to boost cost savings and modernize Connecticut’s approach to ratemaking through performance-based regulation (PBR), which despite its flaws, is premised on realigning utilities’ incentive structure with the public interest. Under Gillett’s leadership, PURA reined in IOU profit margins, advanced its Equitable Modern Grid initiative, and created the Office of Education, Outreach and Enforcement, “which has become a national model for public engagement and is even being replicated in other states and at the federal level,” she wrote in her resignation letter. Utilities took PURA to the state Supreme Court five times during her tenure, all of them ending in PURA victories. Other lawsuits remain active. The pushback on Gillett’s attempts at reform was a constant, including public records requests designed to embarrass her and her team. Opponents claimed that Gillett sought to restrict access to staff from other members of the commission, and one state lawmaker threatened impeachment proceedings and suggested that Gillett lied under oath. The series of episodes “exacted a real emotional toll both for me personally, as well as my family, and for my team,” Gillett wrote in her letter. “I did not make this decision lightly, but there is only so much that one individual can reasonably endure, or ask of their family, while doing their best to serve our state.” Meanwhile, the lucrative nature of the modern utility industry has drawn in a troubling yet familiar face: private equity. The core incentive of the IOU financial model ties profit to capital spending. Private equity ownership turbocharges this incentive. In theory, a private equity owner could generate multiplicative returns by piling on debt and accelerating a utility’s capital deployment. Utilities also enjoy predictable cash flows and guaranteed cost recovery. That bodes well for BlackRock and Blackstone, which have been pursuing utility acquisitions to cash in on the AI data center boom. In October, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission met to approve BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners’ acquisition of ALLETE, the parent company of Minnesota Power. Previously, Ellis had testified before this commission, arguing that the transaction “proves, unequivocally, that Minnesota Power’s authorized rate of return is excessive, and that excessive [rates of return] are the key motivation for the transaction and the root cause of the forecast unprecedented rate increases.” But a settlement between ALLETE and the Minnesota Department of Commerce, endorsing the sale, made the October proceeding in St. Paul all but a formality. When I attended the hearing, a fellow journalist was approached by an attorney for the buyers, Dan Lipschultz. He used to be on the commission, revealing a popular tactic for industry: hiring former regulators to influence their ex-colleagues. During deliberations, commissioners assured critics that they had the authority to hold the buyers accountable if anything untoward happened. “I really became convinced … when I realized that the goal here was to grow this Minnesota company,” said Commissioner John Tuma, who was initially a skeptic of the deal. He cited organized labor’s support; it had already been reported that Lipschultz ghostwrote a comment letter from the North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters and International Union of Operating Engineers Local 49. Tuma also cited another benefit from the BlackRock purchase: the possibility of a new utility owner willing to make investments being attractive to data centers. In the end, the vote was unanimous in support of the acquisition. As part of the $6.2 billion deal, Global Infrastructure Partners made several commitments, including a one-year moratorium on rate increases and a modest reduction to its authorized return on equity. But critics argue the concessions are not enough to prevent excessive rate increases over the long term. “Even with concessions made, the deal is still a bad deal for Minnesotans,” Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, an expert witness in the case, said at the time. THE INABILITY OF PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS to keep costs down for customers sits squarely at the center of the affordability crisis. It also reflects the failure of technocratic liberalization, which as Sevier observed in an October report he co-authored, “has failed at its core promise of increasing competition, without lowering costs for working people, stabilizing costs, making services more reliable, increasing energy conservation, reducing private utility opposition to rooftop solar, and slowing upward wealth redistribution.” If regulatory capture is to blame, what might a viable alternative look like? “Public power is the most sensible solution to answer these big questions,” Sevier told the Prospect. This idea has appealed to a growing number of community organizers across the country who contend that cutting shareholders out of the equation would free up additional resources to strengthen the grid, enhance reliability, ease ratepayers’ debt burdens, and expand benefits for workers. There are existing models going back centuries that have delivered cheaper power and maintained energy democracy with public input. “We’re part of a national movement … something that gets lost a little bit when you’re working at a local level,” Jessica Cook, an organizer with Milwaukee DSA’s Power to the People campaign, told the Prospect. Cook is also legislative assistant to Alderperson Alex Brower, who represents the city’s Third District. The first socialist to win a Milwaukee Common Council seat in 77 years, Brower campaigned on replacing We Energies, an investor-owned electric and gas utility that serves more than two million Wisconsinites. Greater Milwaukee is its largest service area. “We Energies acts like they own this town,” Brower said in an interview with the Prospect. “People are fed up, and they’ve realized the profit motive driving We Energies is to blame.” In the last three years, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has approved two consecutive rate increases: an 8.8 percent base-rate increase, effective January 2023, and a cumulative increase of 12.38 percent for 2025 and 2026. “People are already hurting,” Alexander Hagler, a 35-year-old Milwaukee resident and owner of Kuumba Juice & Coffee, told the Prospect. “Electricity is like the air we breathe,” he added, describing it as one of the “many different resources in our society that we need to bring under the control of the people.” Power to the People, which started in Milwaukee three years ago, has called on the city to replace We Energies with a municipal or cooperative utility, which would require a majority vote from the Milwaukee Common Council. Organizers have proposed funding the acquisition through tax-exempt municipal bonds, lowering the cost of capital without jeopardizing the city’s credit rating so long as a dedicated utility enterprise fund is established. The campaign runs weekly canvasses and phone banks, speaking directly to ratepayers’ frustration and offering an established alternative. “People are looking for something,” said Audra Hale, an organizer with Power to the People and at-large executive committee member at Milwaukee DSA. The day before we spoke, Hale and other canvassers collected over 300 signatures for the campaign’s petition to replace We Energies at a local No Kings Day protest. Nearly 14,000 people have now signed that petition, which Brower will eventually submit to the Common Council. “We’re trying to convince my colleagues that this is a good idea,” Brower said, adding that Power to the People has been “doubling down” on canvassing in districts whose alderpersons “can be moved.” To date, no other alderpersons have come out to publicly support the campaign. With an election coming up in 2026, Milwaukee DSA is trying to change that by endorsing candidates who support Power to the People and running challengers against those who do not. During a canvass in late October, volunteers split into two groups to collect signatures in District 6. I tagged along with the second group; we stopped at four different laundromats. Among the volunteers was Andy Barbour, co-chair of Milwaukee DSA. He spoke with a resident who, having been a We Energies employee, declined to sign the petition due to concerns over their pension. But the message seemed to stick; Barbour was pleasantly surprised when that same resident convinced a friend to sign on. At one point, another resident who added her name to the petition claimed that We Energies had shut off her electricity after she missed a payment. “They suck … We’ve got to come together,” she said. By 3 p.m., canvassers had collected close to 60 signatures. Despite the “success rate” of its canvasses, Barbour said Power to the People will need to “prepare for the fights ahead, because we know they are coming.” UTILITIES HAVE SPENT BIG TO PREVENT public power campaigns from gaining traction in communities across the country. “Utilities are trying to make it as difficult as possible for cities to liberate themselves from corporations who do not care about actually delivering affordable service [and] would rather enrich themselves to increase returns for their shareholders,” said Shelby Green, a research and communications manager at EPI. And they have been successful. As Maine Public reported, the parent companies of Central Maine Power and Versant Power spent tens of millions of dollars to defeat public power at the ballot box in 2023. Avangrid, which also owns Central Maine Power, contributed more than $18 million to the paradoxically named utility front group Maine Affordable Energy, while Maine Energy Progress received approximately $15 million from Enmax, the parent company of Versant Power. Our Power, the advocacy group behind the municipalization effort, only raised about $236,000. Yet as electric rates skyrocket, this spending may mean nothing to angry voters. In Georgia, an industry front group called Power for Tomorrow spent almost $200,000 this year around the Georgia Public Service Commission race, an off-year special election where two Republican incumbents who had approved six rate increases over a two-year period were running for re-election. Democrats Alicia M. Johnson and Peter Hubbard campaigned on affordability and reliability, laying the blame for recent rate increases on excessive profit margins and the slow pace of decarbonization. Despite the spending against them, they became the first Democrats in Georgia to win a nonfederal statewide election in nearly 20 years, smoking the Republican incumbents by 26 points. “Affordability is front and center in voters’ minds, and today they overwhelmingly said they’re tired of subsidizing corporate interests at the expense of their families,” Hubbard said on election night. With affordability front and center, the public power movement has an opportunity to reclaim the narrative around public power. Next year, Ann Arbor for Public Power will submit a ballot proposal asking voters to create a consumer-owned utility that would replace DTE Energy, an electric and gas utility holding company serving more than three million customers across southeastern Michigan. Meanwhile, public power organizers in Clearwater, Florida, and Tucson, Arizona, pressed local officials to rigorously consider municipalization after the cities had commissioned feasibility studies. In September, the Clearwater City Council authorized an appraisal process to further evaluate the viability of a consumer-owned utility. (We Stand for Energy, a utility front group backed by the Edison Electric Institute, promptly blasted the idea in a social media ad campaign.) “The electricity system connects all of us to one another in the country, no matter who you are or where you live, which makes it an incredible site for building back our relationships and our social fabric,” Sevier said. “We have to rebuild trust and to demonstrate that our infrastructure can serve a public good, not a private profit.” First, I want to thank you for reading the Prospect.

Title: Are Bitcoin ETF inflows finally back after IBIT ETF’s 7% jump?

Is Bitcoin’s ‘Santa rally’ back, or will Japan spoil the party? Bitcoin’s [BTC] price jumped over 8% to over $93K in the past 24 hours, at press time, following renewed ETF inflows led by BlackRock. On the 2nd of December, BlackRock’s iShares BTC ETF (IBIT) netted $120 million in Daily Net Inflow, marking a 7% surge. Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also drew institutional inflows of $22 million and $7.4 million, respectively. However, ARK Invest’s ARKB bled out about $91 million, bringing the total Daily Net Inflows to $58.5 million. Source: SoSo Value Even so, the performance on the 2nd of December marked the fifth consecutive day of net inflows, which has stabilized the BTC price above $80,000. But do the positive inflows signal the return of the ‘Santa rally’? For his part, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas viewed the IBIT-induced price recovery as the “Vanguard effect.” The world’s second-largest $11 trillion asset manager lifted the crypto ban on the 2nd of December, allowing over 50 million users to trade crypto ETFs, including IBIT. Balchunas said that the IBIT’s renewed inflow was likely driven by Vanguard clients. He added, “Also $1B in IBIT volume in first 30min of trading. I knew those Vanguardians had a little degen in them, even some of the most conservative investors like to add a little hot sauce to their portfolio.” According to him, Vanguard saved BTC from the Q4 plunge. For Coinbase analysts, however, the easing macro front was juicing up liquidity and risk assets. “With quantitative tightening ending, the Fed is back in the bond market, and the drain of cash from markets may be behind us. That’s usually good for risk-on assets like crypto.” The analysts highlighted that the current macro landscape favors ‘breakout trades over knife catching.’ Notably, the extended BTC drop in the past few weeks cleared key supports, including the $98K-$100K which was a significant cluster as a cost basis for most bulls. For Coinbase analysts, this was the next key level to watch. Source: Coinbase/Glassnode Put differently, reclaiming $98K-$100K could attract more demand or cap BTC recovery if most bulls opt to break even and exit positions at the level. Swissblock analytics also echoed the Coinbase outlook. It projected a potential ‘tactical recovery’ from mid-December, citing past liquidity capitulation events that were followed by a strong rebound after 1–3 weeks. Source: Swissblock Despite the optimism, the risk of the Yen carry trade unwinding still appears likely, with an 86% chance of a 25-basis-point rate increase by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) at its meeting set for the 19th of December.

Time Published: 2025-12-03T07:54:26Z
Full Content:
The anchor book allotment for the highly anticipated Initial Public Offering (IPO) of e-commerce platform Meesho ignited controversy after higher anchor allocation to SBI Mutual Fund. Meesho’s IPO advisors prioritised investors who were keen on a long-term partnership with the e-commerce firm, people in the know told NDTV Profit. With this in mind SBI MF secure approximately 25% of the total anchor book portion which was viewed as disproportionately large by other Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs). Meesho did not provide an official comment. Meesho, on Tuesday said it has garnered a little over Rs 2,439 crore from anchor investors, including SBI Mutual Fund, Fidelity Funds, and BlackRock, ahead of its IPO opening for subscription. The anchor book witnessed demand of over Rs 80,000 crore, translating into nearly 30 times oversubscription. The anchor book saw participation from 60 investors, including major domestic institutional investors and leading global names such as the Government of Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Tiger Global, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, according to a circular uploaded on the BSE website. On the domestic front, SBI Mutual Fund (MF), UTI MF, Tata MF, Motilal Oswal MF, Axis MF, Motilal Oswal MF, Bandhan MF, and HSBC MF, among others, have been allotted shares. As per the circular, the company has allocated 21.97 crore equity shares at Rs 111 apiece, raising a total of Rs 2,439.5 crore. The IPO will comprise a fresh issue of shares worth Rs 4,250 crore, along with an offer for sale (OFS) of 10.55 crore shares valued at Rs 1,171 crore at the upper band, taking the total issue size to Rs 5,421 crore. The offer for sale includes the sale of equity shares by some of Meesho's early investors, including Elevation, Peak XV, Venture Highway and Y Combinator, among others. Meesho plans to utilise proceeds for investment in cloud infrastructure, marketing and brand initiatives, as well as funding inorganic growth through acquisitions and other strategic initiatives, and general corporate purposes. The company will make its debut on the stock market on December 10. Overall, 75% of the issue size has been reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 15% for non-institutional investors and the remaining 10% for retail investors.

Retail investors led the demand with 3.85 times subscription, followed by qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) support at 2.12 times and non-institutional investors (NIIs) at 1.80 times. Meesho on Tuesday raised ₹2,439.54 crore from anchor investors, including SBI Mutual Fund, Tiger Global, ADIA, GIC, BlackRock, GIC, Fidelity, WCM investment, Goldman Sachs and Dragoneer. The e-commerce firm aims to raise ₹5,421 crore through the IPO, which concludes on December 5. It has fixed a price band of ₹105-111 per share, valuing the company at ₹50,096 crore ($5.6 billion) at the upper end. The IPO comprises of a fresh issue of shares worth ₹4,250 crore, and an OFS of 10.55 crore shares valued at ₹1,171 crore at the upper band. The company will use the proceeds for investment in cloud infrastructure, marketing and brand initiatives, as well as funding inorganic growth through acquisitions and other strategic initiatives, and general corporate purposes. Meesho IPO: Key things to know and should you subscribe? Most analysts acknowledged the company’s strong position in the value-e-commerce segment, deep penetration in Tier-2 and Tier-3 markets, and its asset-light marketplace model, which has helped it scale rapidly. They noted that Meesho’s improving unit economics and declining losses make it a promising long-term growth story. However, several brokerages also highlight risks such as intense competition, the company’s still-evolving path to profitability, and the need to sustain growth without heavy discounting. Brokerages have largely issued a “subscribe for long term” stance rather than an aggressive “subscribe” for listing gains. Overall, brokerages see potential but recommend that investors approach the issue with realistic expectations and a long-term horizon. Two other mainboard IPOs, which opened today, Aequs and Vidya Wires, also witnessed healthy first-day subscription, largely fueled by retail buyers. The Aequs IPO drew 3.42 times subscription on its opening day, driven largely by strong retail interest at 11.46 times. Non-institutional investors subscribed 3.40 times, while QIB participation remained modest at 0.66 times. The employee quota was subscribed 6.72 times. The contract manufacturing firm Aequs launched its ₹922-crore IPO at a price of ₹118-124. It comprises of a fresh issue of shares worth ₹670 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 2.03 crore shares valued at ₹252 crore by promoters and existing investors. Ahead of the IPO, it collected ₹414 crore from anchor investors. Vidya Wires’ IPO recorded 2.89 times overall subscription, with strong interest from retail investors at 4.02 times and NIIs at 3.42 times, while QIB participation remained subdued at 0.47 times. The ₹300-crore IPO of Vidya Wires comprised of fresh issue of shares worth ₹274 crore and OFS of 50.01 lakh shares valued at ₹26 crore, at a price band of ₹48-52 per share. The company raised ₹90 crore from anchor investors. Published on December 3, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Thames Water debt pile rises further despite return to profit

The UK's largest supplier reveals a surge in complaints about rising bills but says its performance, such as in preventing sewage spills, has improved. Business and economics reporter @SkyNewsBiz Wednesday 3 December 2025 07:33, UK Cash-strapped Thames Water has revealed a further rise in its debt pile while recording a return to profit on the back of inflation-busting hikes to bills. The UK's largest supplier said the 31% rise to customer bills since April had allowed it to increase capital investment by 22% to £1.3bn amid demands it improve performance in preventing sewage spills and stopping leaks. Thames Water said it recorded a 20% drop in pollution incidents over the six months to the end of September, and leakage performance was holding steady despite the "extremely dry summer". Money latest: How much is a fair restaurant tip? While waste complaints dipped by 11%, according to the company, there was a 42% surge in the number of customers complaining about the hike to bills. Thames Water revenue rose 42% on the same period last year to £1.9bn, helping a return to profit after tax of £328m on the back of a £190m loss during April-September 2024. Oil prices are down, but petrol prices are clearly not: What's going on - and will it get better? Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan warns countries to 'be careful' when raising tax Major airport increasing drop-off charge | Money blog The company said profitability was damaged by higher debt serving costs. Its debt pile was recorded at £17.6bn - a rise of 5%. The results were released against the backdrop of continuing talks involving the government and regulators over a proposed rescue deal by major Thames Water creditors. Their consortium is known as London & Valley Water. It effectively already owns Thames Water under the terms of a financial restructuring agreed early in the summer but regulator Ofwat is yet to give its verdict on whether the consortium can run the company, averting the prospect of it being placed in a special administration regime. Without a deal the consortium, which includes investment heavyweights Elliott Management and BlackRock, would be wiped out. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Ofwat, which is to be scrapped under a shake-up of industry oversight, has been leading scrutiny of London & Valley's operational plan and proposed capital structure. The prospective deal would write off billions of pounds of the company's debt and inject billions in fresh equity, in return for an adjustment in the regulator's approach to future financial penalties. Thames sees the creditors' proposal as the only viable solution. Despite huge hikes to household bills - allowed across England and Wales to bolster aging infrastructure including storm overflows - the company says its financial turnaround has been hampered by record fines for things like sewage leaks and bonuses to retain key staff. Sky News revealed on Tuesday that its remuneration committee will meet next week to decide whether to proceed with nearly £2.5m in retention payments to 21 senior managers.

"This progress has all been achieved as we also manage the recapitalisation of the business. We continue to work closely with stakeholders to secure a market-led solution that we believe is in the best interests of our customers and the environment. "This in turn will allow the transformation of Thames to continue, a programme that will take at least a decade to complete and will restore the infrastructure and operations of the company."

Title: BlackRock’s top brass says tokenization will bridge crypto and finance

BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with over $13.4 trillion in assets under management, and operates the largest tokenized cash market fund, worth $2.8 billion. Former crypto skeptic BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and chief operating officer Rob Goldstein say tokenization will act as a bridge between the crypto industry and traditional finance, doubling down on their support of the sector. In an opinion article penned by Fink and Goldstein and published Monday in The Economist, the pair said that tokenization won’t replace the existing financial system any time soon, but predict it will help merge the two industries. “Think of it instead as a bridge being built from both sides of a river, converging in the middle. On one side stand traditional institutions. On the other are digital-first innovators: stablecoin issuers, fintech’s and public blockchains,” the pair wrote. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, with over $13.4 trillion in assets under management. Its co-founder and CEO, Fink, was previously a crypto skeptic before he changed his mind. Fink and Goldstein said at first glance, it was hard for them to see the “big idea” because tokenization was tangled up in the crypto boom, which “often looked like speculation.” “But in recent years, traditional finance has seen what was hiding beneath the hype: tokenization can greatly expand the world of investable assets beyond the listed stocks and bonds that dominate markets today,” they added. BlackRock already has the largest tokenized cash market fund, worth $2.8 billion. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, or BUIDL, launched in March 2024. However, Fink and Goldstein also stated that tokenization must proceed safely, with appropriate regulations, which requires policymakers and regulators to update the rules to enable traditional and tokenized markets to work together. Related: Plume CEO tips RWA to grow 3-5x in 2026 as it grows past crypto natives Bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) followed a similar path for fixed income, connecting dealer markets with public exchanges, allowing investors to trade more efficiently, according to Fink and Goldstein. “And now with spot Bitcoin ETFs, even digital assets are on traditional exchanges. Each of these innovations builds bridges. The same principle applies to tokenization,” they said.

Title: Meesho IPO: Samir Arora Calls For Regulator Intervention On Fairness Amid Anchor Allotment Row

India’s red-hot IPO market has been jolted by a rare backlash after several major global investors reportedly pulled out of Meesho Ltd.’s anchor book, prompting Helios Capital founder Samir Arora to call for urgent regulatory intervention to make the process “more fair.” Arora criticised the current structure of anchor allocations in high-demand IPOs, describing them as “a valuable gift to be given to big funds by brokers and their investment banking arms.” Regulator must intervene to make this process more fair. Right now allocations in hot IPOs are just a valuable gift to be given to big funds by brokers and their investment banking arms. pic.twitter.com/IFjGHDD9H3 His comments followed a Bloomberg report that Meesho allocated nearly a quarter of its anchor tranche to SBI Funds Management Pvt., India’s largest asset manager a move that triggered pushback from other institutional investors. In a clarification posted later, Arora stressed that his criticism was not directed at SBI MF. “They are genuine anchors who do help in setting the price and commit very early,” he said. The issue, he insisted, lies with funds that inflate orders at the last minute to secure allocations without truly participating in price discovery. “Then what anchor,” he wrote, arguing that many so-called anchors simply “pile on” because the IPO is hot. My tweet is not against SBI MF for they are genuine anchors who do help in setting the price and commit very early. My point is against all these funds who inflate their orders at the last moment and do not really "anchor" any deal but pile on. Then what anchor.May be one ideaâ¦ https://t.co/FmCBITtB0W Arora floated a potential solution: anchor lists should be finalised and announced 30 days before an IPO opens, ensuring that institutions engage meaningfully in negotiating and setting valuations instead of swooping in based on the momentum of the deal. The current process, he said, encourages opportunistic bidding driven by commissions and size rather than long-term commitment. According to a report by Bloomberg, Meesho’s anchor book faced withdrawals from several prominent investors after the disproportionate allocation to SBI Funds. Those who pulled out included Capital Group, Aberdeen Group Plc, Norges Bank Investment Management, ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon India Life Asset Management, and Nomura Asset Management. Many of these funds, according to the report, had sought allocations similar to SBI Funds and opted out in protest when their expectations were not met. The anchor tranche is a crucial signalling mechanism for market confidence, typically drawing long-only global investors who help set the tone for pricing. Meesho, however, received strong institutional participation in its pre-IPO anchor round, raising Rs 2,440 crore on Tuesday. Marque foreign entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, Government of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Schroder Group, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were allotted shares.
