How far could tokenizing real-world assets really go? Fink called tokenization a game-changing innovation that lets investors, including crypto holders, access long-term products like ETFs on blockchain platforms. BlackRock currently manages BUIDL, a tokenized money market fund with $2.8 billion AUM. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink struck an optimistic tone in a recent interview with CNBC’s Squawk on the Street. He highlighted the firm’s strong third-quarter results, while also touching upon its expanding footprint across key financial verticals. Fink noted that the company’s growth has been broad-based, driven by robust performances in cash management, AI-powered equity strategies, and blockchain initiatives. Looking ahead, he spotlighted the tokenization of real-world assets, including real estate, equities, and bonds, as the “next wave of opportunity.” He also positioned this initiative as a central pillar of BlackRock’s long-term innovation strategy. Fink said, “You know, I do believe we’re just at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets, from real estate to equities.” During the interview, Fink also outlined how tokenization could fundamentally transform the investment landscape. He explained that blockchain-based tokenization would bridge traditional finance with digital infrastructure. This approach would allow investors, even those using digital wallets or crypto holdings, to seamlessly access conventional long-term financial products such as ETFs. As part of this vision, Fink revealed that BlackRock already operates a tokenized money market fund – BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity (BUIDL) Fund. It also manages one of the largest Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs in existence, with assets surpassing $100 billion. In short, once a crypto skeptic, Fink candidly admitted that he now “loves it,” signaling how institutional confidence in digital assets has evolved over the years. Fink also cited decades of market resilience, from the dot-com crash to the pandemic. In doing so, he emphasized that staying invested through volatility allows compounding to work in investors’ favor. The discussion arose on the back of BlackRock’s rapid growth across markets. Its Spot-based Bitcoin and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs remain the largest of their kind in the U.S, with $93 billion and $17 billion in AUM, respectively. Beyond ETFs, BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), launched in partnership with tokenization firm Securitize, now manages $2.8 billion across Ethereum, Solana [SOL], and Avalanche [AVAX]. This makes it the largest tokenized money market fund to date. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price was hovering around $111,828, following modest gains of 0.3% in 24 hours. As it stands, BlackRock plans to expand its tokenized products, potentially including its flagship crypto and traditional ETFs. In facr, according to a Bloomberg report, BlackRock is exploring plans to bring stocks and other real-world assets on-chain, allowing them to trade as digital tokens. In short, all these moves could position the firm at the forefront of Wall Street’s tokenization revolution.

Title: Paddy McCarthy is match-sharp and ready if called upon for Ireland debut against Japan

Paddy McCarthy will be hoping it’s second time lucky after being named in Andy Farrell’s Ireland squad for the four November Tests. The 22-year-old prop was one of 11 uncapped players who travelled to take on Georgia and Portugal during the summer but while nine made their debuts, McCarthy and Ulster scrumhalf Nathan Doak missed out. That fate is unlikely to befall him again, with a crack at Japan at the Aviva Stadium on November 8th a likely occasion for his first cap. Paddy is the youngest of three McCarthy boys alongside Leinster, Ireland and Lions secondrow Joe and the eldest, Andrew, a former Leinster culture captain and a member of the Seapoint Dragons mixed ability team. Paddy started in Old Belvedere minis before attending Blackrock College where he won a Leinster Schools Senior Cup under the captaincy of hooker Gus McCarthy, who has gone on to represent Leinster and Ireland. Centre Hugh Cooney, also from that Blackrock schools side, has featured for Leinster while Ruben Moloney, Liam Molony and Oliver Coffey are in the Leinster academy. Tom Brigg is in Ulster’s academy, while Conor O’Shaughnessy and Mikey Yarr are in Connacht’s. McCarthy’s talent, athleticism, speed, power, capacity to break or beat tackles and facility to play both sides of the frontrow made him a standout player in the Ireland Under-20’s Grand Slam-winning team in 2023. That team went to South Africa that summer and reached the World Junior Championship final, where they lost to France. He made his Leinster senior debut in October of that year, coming on as a replacement against Glasgow Warriors, and won a further three caps before Christmas. Injuries limited his involvement thereafter and he made just two further appearances, but he played for Ireland in an A international against England at Bristol and was then selected for the summer tour to Tbilisi and Lisbon. Having come on against the Stormers in the first game of the season, he made his first start for Leinster in his seventh cap for the province against the Bulls. McCarthy then retained his place in the run-on team for last weekend’s win over the Sharks at the Aviva Stadium. His latest performance was a tour de force that showcased all of those qualities listed above. There’s little doubt he benefits from being in an environment where he is subjected to rigorous daily challenges laid down by his fellow Leinster props in the Ireland squad – Andrew Porter, Jack Boyle, Tadhg Furlong and Thomas Clarkson. The call-up is a fitting reward for an outstanding prospect. Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: US, China still committed to global debt efforts, IMF strategy chief says

The International Monetary Fund, World Bank and current G20 president South Africa issued a progress report after the meeting, calling for continued efforts to address elevated debt vulnerabilities, particularly in low-income countries. It said debt levels in low-income countries and emerging economies had generally stabilised but remained higher than during the pre-COVID-19 era, with a few being particularly vulnerable. Many also faced elevated debt-service challenges, crowding out spending on education, health and infrastructure. "Recent shifts in global policies and cuts in foreign aid add to the challenges," the report said, underscoring the need for domestic reforms by debtor countries to boost growth, with specific attention to rising domestic debt vulnerabilities. Participants agreed to keep working to improve debt restructuring processes, including looking for ways to accelerate the restructuring of non-bonded commercial debt, accelerating support to countries with sustainable debt but high debt-service challenges, and strengthening transparency. IMF strategy chief Ceyla Pazarbasioglu said the continued participation of the US and China in the roundtable, despite a fierce trade war dividing the world's two largest economies, showed their commitment to keep addressing the high debt levels hurting developing countries. The roundtable, which met during the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, had led to progress in shortening the timelines of official debt restructurings and reworking bonded debt, but there was more work to do on non-bonded debt, Pazarbasioglu told reporters before the meeting. "These discussions have been important to get everyone on the same page," she said. "The fact that tomorrow we will have the US Treasury Secretary (Scott Bessent) there, China will be there, and others will be there, is a sign that they are still committed to this discussion." The progress report showed that transparency was a shared concern, especially regarding non-bonded debt. "Non-bonded debt is the laggard at this point," Pazarbasioglu said, noting some countries had moved through a restructuring but still faced bank exposures or other loans that prevented credit ratings agencies from removing their default status and raising ratings. "This is a critical step to make sure that countries are able to access lower cost financing. So that's what we are really focusing on now," she said. A recent IMF paper detailed the challenges faced by such countries - including Ghana, Sri Lanka, Zambia and Suriname. The report cited broad support for earlier and more comprehensive publication by official creditor committees of the key terms of restructurings - including the net present value reduction - once an agreement was reached, though full consensus had not yet been reached. Participants also broadly supported extending to all G20 creditors the World Bank's "Debt Data Sharing Exercise," which ensures the data of debtors and creditors are reconciled. Many of them expressed strong interest in the World Bank's proposal for a digital platform to automate loan data reconciliation, building on a pilot program launched with Indonesia, it said. Negotiators continue to work on a declaration on debt issues that the Group of 20 major economies, which launched the Common Framework for debt restructurings during the COVID-19 pandemic, hopes to issue on Thursday, participants said. Global debt is at record levels, but many emerging markets have actually reduced their debt-to-GDP ratios, although they still face crushing debt service payments and have been crowded out of the capital market by advanced economies. Liquidity is a bigger concern now than solvency, Pazarbasioglu said. Debt experts say high borrowing costs on international capital markets have effectively shut out many riskier borrowers, pushing governments to opt for loans where terms and conditions are rarely published. Jose Vinals, former group chairman of Standard Chartered, one of the two private-sector creditors together with BlackRock that are part of the global sovereign debt roundtable, said more transparency was clearly needed. "This is something that complicates enormously the restructuring processes and I think one of the things where progress needs to be made," he said during an event hosted by the Bretton Woods Committee late on Tuesday. Loans lack mechanisms such as collective action clauses often written into bonds that help to streamline sovereign debt restructurings by allowing a majority of bondholders to bind the minority to a new deal and prevent "holdout" creditors. He also pointed to working groups such as the London Coalition on Sustainable Sovereign Debt, launched in June by the British government to help make contracts clearer and more transparent, as improving the way loan terms address natural disasters, and addressing problems with group lending practices. Almost all international bond and loan contracts across emerging markets use England and New York as jurisdictions.

On Wednesday, during the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington, top officials gathered to discuss debt vulnerabilities in developing countries and explore solutions for improved debt management. (Source: Reuters) The meeting included top officials from the U.S. and China, alongside representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and South Africa as the current G20 president. The discussions focused on the lack of transparency in commercial bank loans, which complicates debt restructuring efforts in developing nations. Debt levels in low-income and emerging economies have generally stabilised but remain higher than in the pre-COVID-19 era. Some countries are particularly vulnerable, and elevated debt servicing obligations limit spending on essential sectors such as education, health, and infrastructure. Recent global policy shifts and cuts in foreign aid have further increased these challenges. Participants agreed on the need to improve debt restructuring processes. This includes accelerating the restructuring of non-bonded commercial debt, supporting countries with sustainable debt but high debt-service obligations, and enhancing transparency in debt-related processes to make financing more accessible. IMF strategy chief Ceyla Pazarbasioglu highlighted that the participation of the U.S. and China, despite ongoing trade tensions, shows their commitment to addressing high debt levels in developing countries. While progress has been made in shortening official debt restructuring timelines, more work is needed to address non-bonded debt. Non-bonded debt remains a critical concern. Countries may complete restructuring of some loans but still face bank exposures or other debts that prevent credit rating improvements. The focus now is on ensuring that countries can access lower-cost financing, with Ghana, Sri Lanka, Zambia, and Suriname cited as examples facing challenges. The meeting showed broad support for early and comprehensive publication of restructuring terms once agreements are reached. Participants also backed extending the World Bank’s “Debt Data Sharing Exercise” to all G20 creditors. There is growing interest in a digital platform to automate loan data reconciliation, building on a pilot programme in Indonesia. Global debt has reached record levels, yet many emerging markets have reduced their debt-to-GDP ratios. Despite this, high debt-service obligations and limited access to capital markets remain major challenges. Liquidity is currently a bigger concern than solvency, and high borrowing costs push many governments toward non-transparent loan arrangements. Private-sector creditors, including Standard Chartered and BlackRock, emphasised the need for greater transparency in loan terms. Unlike bonds, many loans lack collective action clauses, complicating restructuring processes. Initiatives like the London Coalition on Sustainable Sovereign Debt aim to improve contract clarity and address issues in group lending practices. Negotiators continue to work on a G20 declaration on debt issues. The goal is to enhance transparency, streamline restructuring, and provide support to vulnerable countries. Collaboration among nations, international organisations, and creditors is critical to address the growing challenges of global debt.

Title: Newly Launched Waypoint West Puts Liquidity Planning at the Center of Its Advisory Model

October 16, 2025 00:13 ET | Source: Waypoint West Waypoint West Photo courtesy of Waypoint West. SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Waypoint West, the independent wealth advisor founded earlier this month by siblings Haley and Brooks Schaffer, underscored liquidity planning as a central focus of its offering for founders and builders. According to the firm’s briefing, entrepreneurs and senior employees often hold 70–90 percent of their net worth in company equity. Without careful preparation, more than half of that wealth can be lost to taxes at the point of liquidity. At the same time, companies are remaining private for 10–12 years on average before IPO, more than double the timeline of a generation ago, forcing individuals to manage concentrated positions for longer and seek innovative ways to unlock value. The firm noted that the challenge is amplified in today’s environment, where industries such as artificial intelligence are experiencing rapid transformation. It drew parallels to the dot-com bubble, when companies like AOL and Sun Microsystems were once considered untouchable but eventually faded, while others such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft went on to become enduring leaders. The takeaway for founders and employees: concentration can feel safe inside an iconic company, but diversification is what sustains wealth. Waypoint West stated that the goal of its program is to put structure and strategy around liquidity events, positioning them as turning points for long-term financial independence rather than short-term transactions. The firm emphasized the importance of beginning planning 12 to 24 months ahead, when strategies can be coordinated across a client’s full team of advisors, including estate planners, tax specialists, and legal counsel, to maximize after-tax outcomes. The program highlights a toolkit of public-market solutions that can be customized to client needs, including options-based hedges, exchange funds, custom ETFs and direct indexing, long/short overlays, and, where appropriate, simple sale and reinvest strategies. Waypoint West noted that as an independent RIA operating in an open-architecture framework, it sources across custodians, banks, and counterparties to design the optimal mix for a client rather than relying on a single provider. The firm also pointed to the rise of private-market liquidity solutions as companies stay private longer. These include secondary sales, NAV or portfolio loans, and structured financing arrangements tied to company performance. While each approach carries trade-offs in terms of cost, complexity, and signaling, Waypoint West said it helps clients evaluate these paths in the context of broader retirement, family, and philanthropic goals. By positioning liquidity as both a financial and life event, Waypoint West is seeking to fill a gap for founders, builders, and early employees who face unique challenges in converting on-paper wealth into enduring prosperity.

Title: Microsoft and Nvidia-backed AI consortium buys Aligned Data Centers for $40B
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/15/microsoft-nvidia-backed-ai-consortium-buys-aligned-data-centers-40b/

UPDATED 21:57 EDT / OCTOBER 15 2025 by Mike Wheatley An artificial intelligence infrastructure consortium led by Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and BlackRock Inc. today announced it’s planning to buy Aligned Data Centers LLC in a deal valued at about $40 billion. It’s one of the largest-ever acquisitions of data centers, designed to secure vast and highly coveted AI computing capacity for the consortium’s members. The consortium, known as the AI Infrastructure Partnership or AIP, was formed last year by BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit, Abu Dhabi’s state-backed investment group MGX and Microsoft. Nvidia and Elon Musk’s xAI Corp. joined the consortium in March, along with Singapore-based Temasek Holdings Ltd. and the Kuwait Investment Authority. Founded in 2013, Aligned Data Centers has emerged as one of the major winners of the AI infrastructure spending boom. It operates a number of colocation data centers that rent capacity to customers, and it also builds data center facilities for hyperscale and enterprise firms. It currently operates data centers in Chicago, Dallas, Phoenix, Salt Lake City and Northern Virginia, and it’s building additional sites in Illinois, Maryland, Ohio and Virginia. In addition, it has a massive operation in Latin America, having acquired a company called OData in May 2023, which has facilities in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. It’s also an investor in the Canadian data center operator QScale SEC, which gives it a foothold in that country, too. All told, it operates 50 data centers globally, amounting to 5 gigawatts of compute capacity. In January, Aligned was boosted by a $12 billion capital injection that came from two sources – $5 billion in primary equity from its current parent company Macquarie Asset Management LLC and $7 billion in new debt commitments. Aligned’s customers include the data center software company Nutanix Inc. and the information technology services provider Datto Inc. The AIP consortium said the acquisition will help it to accelerate its mission of “advancing the infrastructure and innovation needed to power the future of AI.” “With AIP, MGX and GIP’s global reach, extensive resources, and deep expertise across AI, energy and finance, we are poised to scale faster, innovate further and redefine what’s possible in sustainable data center infrastructure,” said Aligned Data Centers Chief Executive Andrew Schaap. The acquisition is just the latest example of how big technology companies are funneling billions of dollars into the infrastructure required to power their AI innovations. The likes of Google LLC parent Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., CoreWeave Inc., Oracle Corp. and Microsoft have committed to spending more than $400 billion on AI data centers this year. Meanwhile, OpenAI has partnered with Oracle and SoftBank Group Corp. on the $500 billion Stargate initiative that aims to build a cluster of data centers in the U.S. In addition, the ChatGPT maker has also struck deals with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Broadcom Inc. that may eventually be worth over $1 trillion to secure the AI accelerators needed to fill those data centers, which will have a combined capacity of around 26 gigawatts. Meta also has plans to build a number of new data centers in the U.S., including a newly announced $1.5 billion facility in Texas and a massive complex in Louisiana called “Hyperion” that’s expected to provide 5 gigawatts of capacity when it comes fully online in 2030. The enormous spending on data centers is the AI industry’s equivalent of the “gold rush”, with companies hunting for computing resources rather than precious metals, said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. “It’ll take time to see if these efforts pay off, but the deal makes sense because data centers take a long time and a lot of money to build,” he said. “It’s a solid acquisition because Aligned has been building and operating data centers for years, and so this expertise will come in handy too.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG Published Oct 16, 2025, 07:52 AM Updated Oct 16, 2025, 10:14 PM Bengaluru – An investor group including Singapore’s Temasek, BlackRock, Microsoft and Nvidia is buying one of the world’s biggest data centre operators with nearly 80 facilities in a deal worth US$40 billion (S$51.8 billion) to secure coveted computing capacity for artificial intelligence (AI). The deal is the biggest-ever data centre transaction as companies race to lock in AI computing power. Aligned Data Centers, which is based in Texas, currently has 50 campuses in the US and South America. It has 78 data centres under management or in future development, according to its website. Its purchase from Australia’s Macquarie Asset Management on Oct 15 is also the first deal for the AI Infrastructure Partnership, formed in 2024. The partnership includes Temasek, the Kuwait Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi-based fund MGX and Mr Elon Musk’s start-up xAI among its backers. “With this investment in Aligned Data Centers, we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI,” said BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, who also serves as the chairman of the AI Infrastructure Partnership. The acquisition is the latest in a series of big-ticket deals involving big tech and Silicon Valley start-ups, which the boom in AI has fuelled. Major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon.com, Meta, Microsoft and CoreWeave are on track to spend US$400 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, Morgan Stanley estimates. OpenAI, the start-up at the heart of the AI boom, struck deals in recent weeks with chipmakers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom that may cost over US$1 trillion to secure about 26GW of computing capacity, enough to power roughly 20 million US homes. OpenAI, the start-up at the heart of the AI boom, struck deals in recent weeks Meta Platforms is building several multi-gigawatt AI data centres, including one called Prometheus, due to come online in 2026, and another, Hyperion, which can scale up to 5GW. Privately held Aligned Data Centers currently has over 5GW of operational and planned capacity. Mr Joe Tigay, portfolio manager at Nvidia shareholder Equity Armor Investments, said the acquisition highlights the growing value of data centre assets for investors. “They’re looking at rapid expansion to meet AI demand and optimise for it.” Founded in 2013, Aligned has been a big winner of the AI infrastructure spending boom, raising US$12 billion in equity and debt earlier in 2025 – one of the largest private capital injections into a data centre company. Its customers include cloud computing platform Nutanix and information technology services provider Datto, according to its website. The company also has a land portfolio with access to significant near-term power capacity in key markets, said Macquarie, which first invested in the company in 2018. Shares of its publicly-listed rivals, such as Applied Digital, have soared more than fourfold in 2025. Applied Digital shares jumped 5 per cent on Oct 15. The investment group buying Aligned has an initial target of deploying US$30 billion of equity capital, with the potential of reaching US$100 billion including debt. It has not disclosed how much each partner has contributed to the group nor the equity value of the deal. Nvidia and Aligned declined to comment, while the investors did not immediately respond to requests seeking more details on the deal. “All the major parties in that consortium, they are showing the strength of the AI ecosystem,” said Mr Hendi Susanto, portfolio manager at Nvidia investor Gabelli Funds. Aligned will remain headquartered in Dallas, Texas, under CEO Andrew Schaap when the deal closes in the first half of 2026, the investor group said in its statement.

Title: SL Green Buying Blackstone’s Park Avenue Tower for $730M: Sources

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Blackstone is officially under contract to sell Park Avenue Tower for nearly the same price the 36-story office building fetched 11 years ago. SL Green will acquire the 622,000-square-foot property at 65 East 55th Street for $730 million, sources told Commercial Observer. Blackstone subsidiary EQ Office (now known as Perform Properties) purchased the Midtown Manhattan office asset for $750 million in 2014 from Shorenstein Company. Eastdil Secured’s Gary Phillips and Will Silverman negotiated the latest megadeal, sources said, which went under contract yesterday. The sale of Park Avenue Tower is being executed nearly a decade after EQ Office undertook a $25 million renovation project following the exit of the building’s anchor tenant, law firm Paul Hastings, which relocated to the MetLife Building, as CO reported at the time. Perform Properties inked a 17,458-square-foot lease from Reinsurance Group of America in August, to house the St. Louis-based global reinsurance firm’s first New York office, CO previously reported. Other tenants include Panagram Structured Asset Management and Quilvest Capital Partners. Just last month, SL Green also snapped up 346 Madison Avenue and 11 East 44th Street for $160 million just last month. “This acquisition will deliver sustainable cash flow and provide long-term value creation while further solidifying our commitment to being the leading owner of premier properties along Park Avenue at a time when demand has never been higher,” Harrison Sitomer, chief investment officer at SL Green, said in a statement announcing the Park Avenue Tower acquisition. “Park Avenue Tower is strategically located and well-leased at below-market rents, offering significant upside as vacancy in the Park Avenue corridor continues to trend below six percent.” The property in the deal was part of a Blackstone fund that is 95 percent realized and generated a 14 percent internal rate of return. “This successful exit from a substantially realized fund capitalizes on the strong rebound in demand for office in Midtown Manhattan and demonstrates the momentum for recently renovated office assets in prime submarkets,” the Blackstone spokesperson said in a statement. Eastdil Secured did not immediately return a request for comment. Andrew Coen can be reached at acoen@commercialobserver.com. Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

A consortium led by BlackRock, including Nvidia and Microsoft, will acquire Aligned Data Centres for US$40 billion ($69.9b). Photo / Getty Images A consortium led by asset manager BlackRock, including chip giant Nvidia and Microsoft, is set to acquire data centre specialist Aligned Data Centres from Australian financial services group Macquarie for approximately US$40 billion ($69.9b). The deal marks another sign of the tech sector’s insatiable appetite for AI infrastructure, including chips, servers, and data centres that provide the computing storage and processing power required by artificial intelligence. And it comes on the heels of Macquarie’s A$23b deal to sell Australian and Asia Pacific data centre operator AirTrunk to Blackstone for A$23.5b and the rise and rise in valuation of Canberra Data Centres, half-owned by NZX-listed Infratil. On October 7, Infratil said the latest 2025 independent valuation of CDC showed an increase of A$77 million since June 30 to A$13.6b, making its 49.72% stake worth a new high of A$6.8b. Founded in 2013, Aligned currently operates more than 50 data centres across the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia, with a projected capacity exceeding 5 gigawatts. Macquarie initially acquired a stake in the Texas-based company in 2018 through its subsidiary Macquarie Asset Management and subsequently increased its investment in 2020. The acquiring consortium consists of BlackRock, Emirati sovereign tech fund MGX, and the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), a joint venture established by BlackRock in 2024 that includes BlackRock, MGX, Nvidia, and Microsoft. AIP plans to raise US$30b in direct investments and leverage debt to achieve a total investment capacity of US$100b. The partners have not disclosed how equity will be distributed among Aligned’s new shareholders following the transaction’s completion, expected in the first half of 2026. “We are entering a new era in which AI will fundamentally re-engineer our economies and enable accelerated growth,” said Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi, CEO of MGX and vice-chairman of AIP, in a press release. BlackRock CEO and AIP chairman Larry Fink said the acquisition enabled its clients to participate in the growth of AI. -Agence France-Presse with Herald staff New battery-powered aircraft has a range of nearly 400km.

Title: Argentina First? Trump Treasury Sec Reveals Bailout Amount Has Doubled
URL: https://newrepublic.com/post/201811/donald-trump-treasury-secretary-argentina-bailout-doubled
Time Published: 2025-10-15T18:56:32Z
Full Content:
One day after Donald Trump celebrated a multibillion-dollar bailout for Argentina, his administration moved to double the ante. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters at the Treasury building Wednesday that the United States is “working on a $20 billion facility that would be adjacent” to the $20 billion credit swap line Trump already approved, totaling $40 billion in assistance for the economically fragile South American country. “Many banks are interested in it, and many sovereign funds,” Bessent said. “It is a private-sector solution to Argentina’s upcoming debt payments.” The aid is intended to salvage Argentina’s collapsing economy ahead of the country’s October 26 midterm elections. That vote will determine if Argentine President Javier Milei, one of Trump’s international allies, will maintain the ability to pursue his dramatic cost-cutting agenda. But there’s another notable beneficiary of the Trump admin’s Argentina bailout package: major hedge funds led by Bessent’s friends. Several major investment funds, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Pimco, stand to significantly gain from the aid transfer, as do several independent investors with ties to Bessent, The New York Times reported earlier this month. Bessent described the exchange Wednesday as an “economic Monroe Doctrine,” referring to the 1823 policy that rejected European intervention and colonialism in the Western hemisphere. “Much better to use the heft of the U.S. economic power rather than have to use military power,” Bessent continued, comparing the situation to the supposed “narco traffic coming out of Venezuela.” But the White House’s planned Argentina bailout is remarkably hypocritical for an administration that has axed critical executive agencies under the auspice of slashing spending. Stateside, the government is still shut down over how to fund Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget, which included cuts of billions from Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid—a shutdown that Bessent himself claimed Wednesday was costing America “$15 billion a day.” And the U.S. will likely need a bailout of its own very soon. American soybean farmers have been pummeled by Trump’s tariff policies, which have ripped the Chinese market from their grasp. However, after it came to light that Argentina had replaced the U.S. as China’s top soybean supplier, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that the anticipated Argentina-bound cash infusion had morphed into a “credit swap line.” House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested that harassment, assault, and stolen valor allegations against Republican Representative Cory Mills are not “serious” matters of discussion at a Wednesday press conference. A Florida judge on Tuesday issued a restraining order against Mills, after his ex-girlfriend alleged that he had threatened to blackmail her using sexually explicit images of her and to commit violence against her future romantic partners. Johnson bristled at reporters after being asked twice about the matter. Responding to a question from NBC News’s Melanie Zanona, Johnson initially claimed to have “not heard or looked into the details of that.” NOTUS’s Reese Gorman followed up, noting additional scandals—two out of a bevy of others—that Mills has faced, i.e., a different woman once accused him of assaulting her at his apartment, which she since recanted, and Mills, an Army veteran, has also been accused of stolen valor, including by military veterans who served alongside him. “Are you concerned about these allegations?” Gorman asked. Johnson told him to ask Mills, whom he called “a faithful colleague,” before pleading ignorance of the allegations. “Let’s talk about things that are really serious,” said the speaker, growing cross, before taking another question. Federal agents arrested a Portland mother who was playing the “Ghostbusters” theme song on her clarinet at a protest outside an ICE facility. Oriana Korol, 38, is a member of the Unpresidented Brass Band, which calls itself a “social action oriented, horn driven marching band,” and seeks to deescalate protest tensions. In a video of her arrest from Sunday, a federal agent can be seen violently dragging Korol to the ground, as two more agents come to his aid and her clarinet falls out of her hands. She has been in Clark County Jail in Vancouver, Washington, since, and is still being held without bail. Video of the Portland clarinet player being arrested.Honestly ditching the black bloc in favor of silly costumes, naked bike rides & brass bands is politically quite ingenious. It makes ICE look utterly foolish in any footage that appears on the news average Joe watches. pic.twitter.com/FY87x9xKGr “Out of the corner of my eye, I saw someone running, and then a federal officer running after them. By the time I turned around, this person had been tackled to the ground, and there was an officer on top of them,” said Mike Thompson, Korol’s bandleader. “This was happening right at Oriana’s feet. And she was kind of, they were kind of pinned against a fence,” he said. Korol’s husband didn’t know she’d been transported across state lines until 2 a.m. the next morning. “It is a beautiful party atmosphere. Everybody’s really excited. Then the band hits into ‘Ghostbusters,’ and then at ‘Ghostbusters,’ that’s when ICE start storming in,” Korol’s husband told KOIN 6. “Why are they targeting a clarinet player? A clarinet player standing on the sidewalk far away from the street, following instructions. “We’re not seeing her. We don’t know when we’re going to see her again,” he added, referring to himself and their 3-year-old child. This arrest is yet another example of the excessive, indiscriminate, and in some instances unlawful actions that the federal agents who’ve flooded American cities in the past few months have taken. On Tuesday, federal agents in Chicago violated a freshly minted temporary restraining order banning them from tear-gassing civilians, also gassing local police officers in the process. The Portland Mutual Aid Network has called for Korol’s release, urging supporters to call the Clark County Jail. “Oriana Korol was peacefully protesting ICE on 10/12 and was illegally detained by ICE and DHS,” their statement reads. “She is the clarinet player for Unpresidented Brass Band, and was playing music for protestors. Protesting for immigrants is not a crime!” Republicans are rushing to recast upcoming protests against President Donald Trump as anti-American rallies that are somehow prolonging the government shutdown. During an interview on CNBC Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent blamed the Democrats for a lack of movement on reopening the federal government, claiming that they were waiting to move until after the “No Kings Day” rally planned for October 18 opposing the administration’s authoritarian tilt. “There’s a thought out there that they’re at least waiting to get this crazy ‘No Kings’ rally this weekend, which is gonna be the farthest left, the hardest-core, the most unhinged in the Democratic Party which is, you know, a big title,” Bessent claimed. “You know, no kings equal no paychecks,” he added. During a propaganda press conference later Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson framed the upcoming “No Kings Day” as a “Hate America rally.” “Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson said. “I bet you see pro-Hamas supporters. I bet you see antifa types. I bet you see the Marxists in full display. The people who don’t want to stand and defend the foundational truths of this republic, and that’s what we’re here doing every single day.” Other Republicans were quick to join Johnson, with Representatives Steve Scalise and Lisa McClain also referring to the protest as the “Hate America rally.” Johnson started the trend of villainizing constitutionally protected protest last week when he inexplicably claimed that the “No Kings Day” demonstration was somehow to blame for the government shutdown. “It’s being told to us that they won’t be able to reopen the government until after that rally, ’cuz they can’t face their rabid base,” Johnson said of Democrats at the time. For the past three weeks, GOP lawmakers have been phoning in that whole defending-the-Republic thing, ever since Johnson sent them home amid the ongoing government shutdown. It seems clear that it’s Republicans who have refused to negotiate with Democrats—not the other way around. Crucially, Republicans are blatantly mischaracterizing the attendees of the nationwide “No Kings” rally, in an attempt to criminalize dissent against Trump. These protests, which have been recurring since the beginning of the second Trump administration, have been notably tame, reportedly populated by older, liberal white people who love America but hate Trump’s policies. The temperate collective action would likely not be left enough for anyone who was ostensibly anti-fascist. Republicans’ outlandish predictions for who is likely to attend are simply setting the stage for law enforcement crackdowns on protesters’ First Amendment rights. The speaker’s suggestion that protesting the government is un-American is particularly disturbing, as it is not only a historically American activity, but also a foundational right supported by the U.S. Constitution—a right that Republicans such as Johnson seem to care about less and less everyday. The largest political advertisement spender of the year is: you, the U.S. taxpayer. While the rest of the Trump administration hatchets away at the federal budget, the Department of Homeland Security has gone on a spending spree to heap praise on Donald Trump. The agency has so far spent at least $51 million in 2025 on a sprawling ad campaign warning undocumented immigrants to either exit the country or be “hunted down.” Fox News bought the bulk of the ad spots, airing $9 million worth of content, Axios reported Wednesday. America’s morning shows saw the most program-specific spending, with Today, CBS Morning, and Good Morning America leading the pack. Over the course of the last month, viewers of three programs consumed the most DHS advertising: the Mexican soccer league (Fútbol: Liga MX), Fox’s The Five, and Univision’s Despierta America. But the campaign has also had a digital arm targeting social media users. The ads have specifically targeted Spanish speakers and users who like Mexican pop music, Latin music, the Mexican Grand Prix, Latin cuisine, and the Mexican national soccer team, according to Meta ad library data obtained by Axios. Almost all the adverts feature DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Directly facing the camera, Noem suggests that undocumented immigrants are “violent criminals” flooding American cities with drugs, and accuses the Biden administration of taking a weak stance on border crossings. (Joe Biden increased border enforcement across the board and arrested an “unprecedented” number of immigrants that crossed illegally, according to the libertarian think tank Cato Institute.) One detail is consistent across all the DHS adspots: unmitigated applause for the current president’s agenda. “Strong borders mean a stronger America. President Trump is making America safe again,” Noem says at the end of one advert. Compare that to DHS’s last ad campaign under the Biden administration: a series of billboards in Texas that read a person “in immigration custody has rights.” That campaign cost $150,000, and did not feature President Joe Biden or former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. In a now infamous September raid on a 130-unit apartment building in Chicago, hundreds of agents reportedly rappelled in from helicopters, kicked in doors, ransacked rooms, deployed flashbangs, and zip-tied people—immigrants and native Chicagoans, adults and children—in the middle of the night. Amid growing criticism of this heavy-handed blitz, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller defended the operation, calling it a “brilliantly executed raid against a Tren de Aragua complex filled with TdA terrorists.” (Tren de Aragua, or TdA, is a Venezuelan gang that the Trump administration, with characteristic alarmism, claims has “invaded the United States.”) So, how many members of the Venezuelan gang did they catch in the controversial September raid? DHS says that, of the 37 individuals arrested that night, agents got ahold of “just one ‘verified’ Tren de Aragua member,” MSNBC reported this week. It was previously reported that two of the 37 arrested were members of TdA, but even that disappointing figure was evidently overstating it. Further, DHS has yet to provide proof of the alleged gang member’s connection to TdA—a point worth noting, since the Trump administration has faced criticism for advancing weak claims of immigrants’ gang membership in service of its mass deportation campaign. This new finding lends itself to the conclusions Illinois Governor JB Pritzker shared in his recent conversation with TNR’s Greg Sargent about the raid: “If this was Pinochet’s Chile, if this was Argentina under authoritarian rule, maybe you’d call it successful,” he said, adding later, “Whenever the [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and [Customs and Border Protection] agents say something, they put out a release or, you know, you’ve got Stephen Miller talking about it, they are lying.” Federal agents ended up tear-gassing Chicago police officers on Tuesday while trying to perform basic crowd control, violating a temporary restraining order banning the very use of tear gas in the process. A crowd of community members and protesters formed near 105th and Avenue N, where Border Patrol struck a civilian car while trying to arrest the people inside. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said that the crowd “eventually turned hostile,” forcing them to use “crowd control measures” like tear gas. CPD officers present were caught in the crossfire. About 13 officers were exposed to the tear gas, Chicago police said. This is the second time CPD officers have been gassed by ICE while trying to work with them. The federal agents are also blatantly ignoring the temporary restraining order sent down from Judge Sara Ellis on October 9, after journalists and community organizations brought the issue forward. Ellis explicitly banned the agents from “using riot control weapons,” “firing [tear gas] canisters,” “using force, such as pulling or shoving a person to the ground, tackling, or body slamming an individual,” “striking any person with a vehicle,” and more abuses of power. The order applies to all agents from the Department of Homeland Security, including ICE and Border Patrol, and was supposed to last until October 23. The federal agents violated it almost immediately. Civilians have continued to be terrorized by these riot tactics. “The eyes and the nose ... it burned,” community member Pascal Manuel told NBC 5 Investigates. “This type of escalation is going to cause harm—it’s not the people of Chicago. It is the federal agents,” said Beatriz Ponce De Leon, Chicago’s deputy mayor of immigration and refugee rights. There is currently no update on the status of the temporary restraining order. Republican Senator Tim Sheehy of Montana appeared dumbstruck Tuesday night after his ridiculous attempts to blame Democrats for massive funding cuts to energy projects blew up in his face. During an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Sheehy was asked about the $1 billion grant that the Department of Energy pulled from the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, a clean energy project spanning Washington state, Oregon, and Montana. “They just yanked a billion dollars from that. So, is that taking away good paying jobs in Montana?” asked Collins. “Of course it is. As I said, we want the government to be open. You should be saying this to Chuck Schumer, who is closing the government down,” Sheehy replied. “I’m agreeing we should have the government open right now, this is an unnecessary shutdown.” Collins pressed whether Sheehy was acknowledging that President Donald Trump’s administration was hurting his state, prompting the Republican to launch into an unrelated list of federal services interrupted by the government shutdown. “So, this shutdown is not a good thing, and that’s why we don’t want it to continue,” he said. Collins tried to steer Sheehy back to the topic at hand. “The Trump administration didn’t have to make that decision, they decided to pull that billion dollars from your state,” she said. “Do you disagree with that?” “Well, I think the reality is we wouldn’t be here if the government was still open, and now we’re going on week three of a pretty unnecessary shutdown,” Sheehy repeated. But Energy Secretary Chris Wright had specifically told Collins earlier this month that the canceled grant had nothing to do with the shutdown, or the Democrats, for that matter. “He said they would’ve done that even if the government wasn’t shut down, that that was months in the making even before the government shut down,” Collins said. The two fell silent, as Sheehy’s desperate excuses evaporated. After a long moment, Sheehy replied: “Well, it’s unfortunate we’re still shut down. We shouldn’t be.” COLLINS: The Dept of Energy just canceled a billion dollars for a hydrogen hub that covers your state of Montana. Is that taking away good-paying jobs?SHEEHY: Of course it is. We want the govt to be openCOLLINS: But the Energy Secretary says they would've pulled that funding… pic.twitter.com/6AAfmldQf8 Last week, OMB Director Russell Vought—not Wright—declared that the Trump administration would cut nearly $8 billion in lawfully approved funding for energy projects, targeting 16 Democratic-led states. A longer list of grants to clean energy projects assembled by DOE senior staff totaling roughly $30 billion circulated Capitol Hill, alarming energy advocates and lawmakers, including Republicans whose districts could be affected by the cuts. The fate of the remaining $22 billion, which is mostly earmarked for Republican districts, remains unclear. An opinion on Charlie Kirk could be what keeps people in or out of America. The State Department announced Tuesday it has revoked at least six visas from foreign nationals after their recipients made comments about Kirk in the wake of the far-right youth leader’s assassination. So far, individuals from Mexico, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and Paraguay are affected. “The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans,” the State Department wrote on X. “The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk.” Exactly what qualifies for expulsion is not clear, though some of the remarks were notably benign. An Argentine national who had their visa revoked said that Kirk spread “racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric”—all of which is demonstrably true. That language in particular has even been circulated by House lawmakers in criticizing Kirk’s point of view. In a string of social media posts, the official account for the State Department shared several examples of the comments that caught its attention from individuals “who are no longer welcome in the U.S.” The State Department claimed that nearly all of the examples suggested the commenters were attempting to justify Kirk’s death. “Charlie Kirk was a son of a bitch and he died by his own rules,” wrote the Paraguayan national. A German, writing in German, commented that “when fascists die, democrats don’t complain.” The State Department warned in an X post that “[President Donald Trump] and [Secretary Marco Rubio] will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws.” “Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed,” the department wrote. Vice President JD Vance late Tuesday decried “pearl clutching” over a Politico story unearthing a private group chat in which prominent members of Young Republicans chapters called Black people monkeys, spoke approvingly of rape and slavery, and wrote other odious remarks, such as “I love Hitler” and messages containing racial and homophobic slurs. Opting for whataboutism, Vance highlighted unearthed messages by Jay Jones, a Democratic nominee for attorney general in Virginia, who recently apologized for leaked private messages from August 2022, in which he joked about shooting then-state House Speaker Speaker Todd Gilbert. Jones also said Gilbert would not take action on gun safety unless his children were endangered, writing, “Only when people feel pain personally do they move on policy.” Vance posted a screenshot of the latter comment on X, with the caption: “This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia. I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence.” For one, it’s not a matter of fact that Jones’s messages are worse than those of the Young Republicans, who spoke about having their political opponents raped and sent to gas chambers. Vance is also trying to downplay the importance of the messages by claiming they were shared in a “college group chat.” But Young Republicans groups include those between 18 and 40 years old, with members of the reported group chat well into adulthood. The man Politico identifies as “the most prominent voice in the chat spreading racist messages,” for instance, is 31. The members held notable positions in Republican politics, with several leading state affiliates of the GOP’s youth arm. Some worked in state politics, and at least one serves as a state senator. Vance’s tweet exemplifies his time-tested willingness to excuse vitriol in his own ranks, embracing a “no-enemies-to-the-right” stance that is seemingly limitless.

Title: Did A Cyber School Giant Try To Hide Its Troubles By Attacking A Public School?

ByPeter Greene, Senior Contributor. Stride, a giant in the cyber charter school industry, was accused by a New Mexico school district of violating rules and regulations. Now a lawsuit alleges that Stride responded by mounting a coordinated attack on the district and its superintendent. In 2020, Gallup-McKinley County Schools contracted with Stride (formerly known as K12 Inc) to operate its New Mexico Destinations Career Academy. But the district alleges that the for-profit organization repeatedly cut corners, violated staffing rules, and inflated enrollment numbers. In May 2025, the school board voted to end the contract. "Our students deserve better," said School Board President Christopher Mortensen in a press release. "This action is not sudden; it is the result of months of effort to address persistent issues with the contractor. We are taking this step to protect our students, uphold academic standards, and meet our obligations under state and federal law." Within months, the district had filed a complaint against Stride, charging them with fraud, unfair trade practices, civil conspiracy, and seven other counts. That lawsuit outlines the issues between Stride and the district. According to the complaint, Stride had continuing issues with meeting requirements for student-teacher ratios, having been notified as early as September 2023 that it was out of compliance. Special education teachers were over their permitted caseloads, and IEP students were not receiving their due process. Further, Stride failed to employ certified teachers, complete background checks, or provide state-mandated occupational and professional trainings to their staff. The district also alleges that Stride “retained nonexistent students on its rolls” and took school district funds for educating these ghost students. Stride failed to provide timely required communication with the district. Stride’s graduation rate, says the district, was “horrific,” with a graduation rate of 27.67% in 2024. The district also claims that through it all, Stride has “ignored compliance requirements” and failed to produce a remediation plan. According to the suit filed by the district, a management representative of Stride came forward in May as a whistleblower, declaring that the increases in student-teacher ratios was “intentional… in order to increase profit margins." The whistleblower reported that he made multiple attempts to inform upper management that Stride was out of compliance with state law, and asked for authority to hire the roughly 80 teachers needed. The Vice President of Finance, says the whistleblower, refused to authorize those hires. Instead, in a later meeting, the whistleblower was allegedly told that his “projected profit margin was too low.” He was directed to cut staff for the next year to meet projected profit margin." According to the whistleblower, Stride’s plans to deal with their troubles were not focused on meeting their obligations to the district. Instead, the whistleblower says, at an April meeting Stride’s Senior Vice President of School Development “Peter Stewart said the company should attack first publicly and Stride Inc. should develop a strategy for that” and that Stride CEO “James Rhyu said [to the group] that the Superintendent [for the School District] was in over his skis on this issue.” Alleges the district’s suit, ”Stride’s management, including the individual Defendants, engaged in and agreed to a civil conspiracy to cover up its misconduct and illegal activities acting, by and through its employees, agents and attorneys, in planning and engaging in a systemic public attack on the School District and its Superintendent of Schools to distract from its illegal activities and its breach of the contract with the Board of Education." And counter-attack they did. On April 22, the district sent Stride a letter charging it had “materially breached” its contract. On April 28, the company filed an ethics complaint against GMCS Superintendent Michael Hyatt, alleging that he had tried to leverage Stride’s contract with the district in order to secure a “lucrative position” with Stride. Hyatt had applied for a management position with Stride in 2024; the company declined to hire him. The list of complaints by the district against Stride is long, but the theme is simple enough. Asked for comment on the suit, a Stride representative directed me to the company’s suit-related web site which argues that the company has been working on an improvement plan, that their student-to-staff ratios are better than those reported by the district, and that “explosive growth” of NMDCA makes it hard to stay caught up with staffing. A reply to the district’s Aprill 22 letter contests virtually every point that the district has made about Stride’s performance. Since being cut loose from GMCS, Stride has re-opened NMDCA as a cyber charter school partnered with Charna Valley Independent Schools and Santa Rosa Consolidated Schools; a fact sheet from Stride says 3,000 students are enrolled, including 2,300 returning families. Those families, they say, are largely satisfied with the school. They also point out that many students enter the school short of credits, and that the majority of students are closing that gap. The Stride representative also sent a fact sheet alleging that GMCS is facing other legal problems. But Stride is no stranger to legal issues. It was founded in 2000 as K12 Inc by Ron Packard, former banker and Mckinsey consultant, and quickly became the leading national company for cyber schooling. One of its first big investors was Michal Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the “biggest fraud case in the securities industry” ending his reign as the “junk bond king.” Besides Milliken, Stride investors have included brothers Lowell and Larry Elison, and BlackRock, founded by Larry Fink, whose brother Steve sits on the Stride Board of Directors. In 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12’s schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, "despite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012." In 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about “the company’s business practices and academic performance.” In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company’s business practices “are at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.” In 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance. In 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their "epic series of tech errors." K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising “puffery.” The district is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from Stride. Four Stride executives are named in the suit in addition to Stride Inc itself. The court will decide who’s blowing smoke here. In the meantime, school districts continue to learn about the price of teaming up with aggressively for-profit partners.

Title: Abu Dhabi Fund MGX Emerges As Key Player In Two Major Trump-Era Deals

Time Published: 2025-10-15T17:24:27Z
Full Content:
ByZach Everson, Forbes Staff. MGX, a state-backed Abu Dhabi fund, has surfaced in two of the most scrutinized deals in Donald Trump’s second term—it’s reportedly set to take a stake in TikTok’s U.S. business and used a Trump-linked stablecoin for a $2 billion transaction that may have benefited the president’s family financially. The Abu Dhabi government created MGX in March 2024 as a technology investment company, tasked with “accelerat[ing] the development and adoption of AI and advanced technologies” through global partnerships, according to a launch announcement. MGX was launched by Mubadala, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, and G42, an artificial intelligence holding company, in which Microsoft has invested $1.5 billion. The fund targets semiconductors, infrastructure, software, tech-enabled services, life sciences and automation services, with past investments in OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Databricks, Altera and Binance. Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan chairs MGX’s board—he’s also the deputy ruler of Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates’ National Security Adviser and chair of G42’s board as well as those of four other companies. MGX’s CEO, Ahmed Yahia Al Idrissi, studied at MIT, worked in investment banking and previously oversaw private equity investments at Mubadala. Asked about the TikTok talks, MGX chief communications officer Noelle Camilleri told Forbes, “On TikTok, we don’t have anything to share at this time.” In April 2024, President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill banning TikTok in the United States over privacy and data concerns, effective January 2025. The ban was never enforced, and on Sept. 25, Trump signed an executive order, “Saving TikTok While Protecting National Security,” that would allow the platform to remain available. The executive order paves the way for U.S. investors to take majority control, while the Chinese parent company ByteDance’s stake will drop to less than 20%. The new owners have not been confirmed but, citing unnamed sources, CNBC reported that MGX, Oracle and private-equity firm Silver Lake will be the main investors, owning a combined 45% of TikTok USA. Oracle and Silver Lake did not respond to inquiries. On Wednesday, MGX announced it was teaming with the Artificial Infrastructure Partnership and BlackRock to buy Aligned Data Centers in a deal that values the company, which has 50 facilities, at $40 billion. The TikTok deal is not the first time MGX has been tied to Trump’s administration. The day after his second inauguration, Trump announced Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative backed by MGX, OpenAI, Oracle and Japan’s SoftBank. And earlier in September, MGX joined Silver Lake in buying a 51% stake in Altera, Intel’s programmable-chip unit. The U.S. government owns 9.9% of Intel, after taking the extraordinary step of purchasing an $8.9 billion stake as part of the Trump administration’s semiconductor strategy. Final terms of the TikTok restructuring are not publicly known, including how large a stake MGX may take and what governance rights it could secure. Another open question is whether MGX will use the Trump-linked USD1 in future deals. $100 billion: The amount MGX hopes to have under management within a few years, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. World Liberty Financial says it was “inspired by the vision of Donald J. Trump” and lists him as co-founder emeritus, alongside co-founders Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Barron Trump. According to the company’s website, an LLC affiliated with the Trump family owns about 38% of World Liberty Financial, which issues the USD1 stablecoin. Stablecoin issuers typically earn interest on the reserves backing their tokens, such as U.S. Treasurys and cash equivalents. In May, World Liberty Financial co-founder Zach Witkoff said MGX would use $2 billion worth of USD1 to invest in the crypto exchange Binance. That choice effectively placed $2 billion of reserves with USD1’s custodian, potentially increasing the interest income for World Liberty Financial’s owners. The transaction also helped lift USD1’s market cap, aiding its scale and visibility. As of 1 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, USD1’s $2.7 billion market cap made it the sixth-largest stablecoin, according to CoinGecko, a crypto analytics firm. Also, two weeks after Witkoff announced the deal, the Trump administration agreed to allow the UAE to buy advanced computer chips from U.S. companies, the New York Times reported. One company set to benefit from the deal: G42, a founding partner of MGX, which Tahnoon chairs. (Although that deal is delayed, with some administration officials concerned about G42’s involvement, the Wall Street Journal recently reported. G42 did not respond to Forbes’ inquiry.) An MGX spokesperson told Forbes that Binance asked to settle in cryptocurrency and both sides opted for a stablecoin to limit volatility. Binance’s said that while its client “did not control the payment method chosen by MGX,” it welcomed the use of a stablecoin. MGX said it evaluated stablecoins on business suitability, the jurisdiction and currency of the reserves, and compliance history, then chose USD1 because it is fully reserved in U.S. dollar-denominated assets held by an independent U.S. custodian and audited. MGX added that it did not invest in World Liberty Financial, paid no fees and doesn’t hold USD1 today. MGX said it weighed “compliance history” in picking USD1, but that claim doesn’t match the timeline: MGX announced its $2 billion Binance investment on March 12, and World Liberty Financial didn’t unveil USD1 until March 25—leaving little track record to assess. Another firm Tahnoon chairs, G42, already had owned a stake in ByteDance but divested it after in response to U.S. lawmakers concerns about his ties to China. In January 2024, a Republican-led House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party urged the Commerce Department to impose export controls on G42—an AI holding company that helped found MGX—after an investigation found G42 had ties to Huawei and other blacklisted Chinese companies. The probe also linked G42 affiliates to a scientist accused of stealing U.S. military-funded research from UCLA to establish a government lab in Beijing. The following month, G42 divested from Chinese companies—including what had been a $100 million stake in ByteDance, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the deal. In April, Microsoft announced its $1.5 billion investment in G42 and a partnership to accelerate AI in the UAE. After MGX’s use of USD1 became public, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., joined by 11 other Democrats and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., filed a resolution to enforce the Constitution’s foreign emoluments clause, which bars presidents from “accept[ing] of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State” without Congress’ consent. Senate Republicans blocked the measure. Separately, Sens. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote to Binance and MGX, asking why they used USD1 instead of fiat or another cryptocurrency. Any responses have not been made public, and Binance’s attorney declined to share details on any response it sent beyond saying its client “conducted themselves entirely properly with regard to the MGX investment.” The senators also asked the Office of Government Ethics to weigh in, but it has not responded. “You probably don’t have to scratch very deep to find an instance where the president has received an enormous infusion of cash to his crypto coin from a CEO or foreign oligarch who is then asking for a favor from Donald Trump,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told MSNBC in May. Since 2008, MGX vice chair Khaldoon Al Mubarak also has chaired Manchester City Football Club. Forbes ranks the team no. 5 on its list of the world’s most valuable sports franchises, estimating it’s worth $5.3 billion.

Title: BlackRock-led Consortium Buys Aligned Data Centers for $40B

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy The AI revolution is expensive, but a group of investors led by BlackRock aren’t shy to open their wallets. The Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership (AIP), founded late last year by BlackRock, NVIDIA, Microsoft and MGX, bought Aligned Data Centers for $40 billion. The deal, which also included BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), is aimed at funding next-generation cloud and AI computing infrastructure. Australia-based Macquarie Asset Management sold the equity. Founded in 2013, Aligned has emerged as a leader in the data center space with more than 5 gigawatts of current and planned capacity across 50 global campuses. Aligned’s portfolio is found across Northern Virginia (which include two hyperscale campuses in Sterling and Ashburn), Chicago, Dallas, Salt Lake City, Phoenix, Ohio, São Paulo, Brazil, Queretaro, Mexico and Santiago, Chile. The consortium — financially anchored by the Kuwait Investment Authority and Singapore’s state-owned Temasek Holdings — plans to accelerate that growth, though expansion details were not disclosed. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Aligned will stay headquartered in Dallas with CEO Andrew Schapp at the helm. “AI is reshaping every sector of the global economy,” Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP chairman and CEO, said in a statement. “By combining Aligned’s scalable, adaptable platform with AIP’s capital and capabilities, we will build the infrastructure to support innovation at scale.” Aligned’s trajectory is emblematic of the sheer energy surrounding data center investment. The company earlier this year raised roughly $12 billion in capital, split between equity and debt, in one of the largest-ever private sector investments in a data center developer. Indeed, tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others are expected to spend some $400 billion on AI infrastructure this year alone, according to Morgan Stanley.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to statements made on CNBC, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has topped $100 billion in assets under management less than two years after it launched. That figure marks one of the fastest rises for any ETF in recent memory. It also puts the world’s largest asset manager squarely at the center of institutional Bitcoin holdings. Based on reports, BlackRock holds 804,944 BTC. At current, lower market levels, that stash is worth close to $90 billion. When Bitcoin hit an all-time high last week, the same holding was worth more than $100 billion. BlackRock’s position represents 3.83% of Bitcoin’s total supply. For comparison, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) owns 640,250 BTC, or 3.048% of supply, according to available figures. Those numbers show how ownership of Bitcoin is shifting toward big financial firms as ETFs and other products bring new capital into crypto markets. Larry Fink told viewers the firm is moving faster into digital assets and that tokenization will be used for a wide range of investments, from property to bonds. BlackRock also manages an Ethereum portfolio valued at more than $17 billion. The company has launched tokenized money market vehicles, and one product called BUIDL has become the largest tokenized cash money market fund, according to the firm. With about $4 trillion reportedly sitting in digital wallets worldwide, BlackRock sees an opportunity to reach investors who prefer digital channels. Reports show IBIT’s rapid growth has changed the balance of large holders. Where corporate treasuries and early adopters once dominated ownership, institutional funds now control a rising share. That matters for liquidity and for how large inflows or outflows might affect the market when they happen. It also shifts some power over market behavior to managers who must answer to clients and regulators. Based on market updates, Bitcoin fell below $112,500 on Wednesday. Price action cooled after recent gains, with renewed headwinds including US-China trade tensions and a temporary US government shutdown contributing to weaker sentiment. Analysts say the next few weeks could offer buying chances as funding and perpetual markets calm. Institutional flows into ETFs like IBIT will be watched closely because they can tilt short-term demand. BlackRock’s move signals a larger reality: digital assets are now part of mainstream finance. Fink’s change in tone — from caution to active investment — reflects that shift. The presence of a major manager with hundreds of thousands of BTC and a growing set of tokenized offerings will influence how investors view crypto exposure.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock’s $40 billion deal highlights the unstoppable AI data center gold rush, as CEO Larry Fink pushes back on AI bubble fears

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Today’s announcement that a group of investors led by BlackRock has agreed to buy Aligned Data Centers in a $40 billion deal underscores the seemingly unstoppable flow of money into AI data centers—and comes as its CEO, Larry Fink, pushes back on AI bubble fears. The deal to buy Aligned, which is owned by Macquarie Asset Management, is being inked by the AI Infrastructure Partnership (AIP)—a coalition formed in September 2024 by BlackRock, its infrastructure arm, Global Infrastructure Partners, as well as Microsoft, Nvidia, and MGX, an AI investment firm backed by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala. The Kuwait Investment Authority, xAI, and Temasek joined as additional participants. The AIP was formed to invest up to $30 billion of equity capital in AI, data centers, and energy; this is its first deal, which ranks as one of BlackRock’s largest infrastructure investments to date. If completed, it would be among the largest data center transactions on record, and regardless it underscores how Wall Street is racing to claim a stake in the AI boom. Fink has rejected the idea that AI infrastructure spending represents a dangerous bubble, arguing that massive data center build-outs are essential if the U.S. is to remain the global leader. “Well, there’s a bubble in investing,” he said on CNBC Squawk Box yesterday. “But are we inferring a bubble means a bad thing? There is certainly a skyrocketing amount of capital being put to work. If you put it in a framework of geopolitical positioning, we as a country need these investments if we’re going to be the leader in AI technology.” Aligned Data Centers, which is based in Plano, Texas, was founded in 2013 to build and operate data centers for hyperscalers and cloud-computing companies. It has data centers across the U.S.—including in Northern Virginia, Chicago, Dallas, Ohio, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City—as well as in Mexico, Brazil, and Chile. The timing of the deal comes as Big Tech firms race to secure scarce land, power, and compute capacity—the foundational resources underpinning the AI race. For example, over the past few weeks, OpenAI has announced multibillion-dollar deals with Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD in order to lock in the computing power the company needs. “We cannot fall behind in the need to put the infrastructure together to make this revolution happen,” Altman told reporters during a media event at OpenAI and Oracle’s flagship 800-acre Stargate data center location in Abilene, Texas, last month, where he also announced the companies will build five massive new data center complexes across the U.S. over the next several years. OpenAI is far from alone: Microsoft has made several multibillion-dollar deals in the past two months with U.K.-based data center developer Nscale, including the announcement today of a new site in Texas that will have capacity of as much as 240 megawatts of power. Also today, Meta announced it would invest $1.5 billion in an AI data center in El Paso, Texas, that could scale to 1 gigawatt, making it one of the largest planned data center campuses in the U.S. The total numbers are staggering: On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. And McKinsey said U.S. data center demand, driven largely by AI, could triple by 2030, and require data centers to make nearly $7 trillion in investments to keep up. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The long list of proposed funds includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP ETFs, as well as funds giving amplified exposure to crypto-related stocks such as crypto exchange Coinbase and Bitcoin treasury firms Strategy and Tesla. Typical ETFs give investors exposure to an asset—be it a security or commodity—via shares that track its price and trade on stock exchanges. A leveraged ETF holds debt to amplify its position. The idea is that returns for investors can be greater than the tracked asset, but losses can also be compounded—in this case, potentially by five times. Volatility Shares had already filed the paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to get crypto ETFs on the market with three times exposure to the daily returns of the asset. The company in March debuted two ETFs tracking Solana futures, including one with two times daily exposure to SOL. Leveraged crypto ETFs are already on the market: Miami, Florida-based Defiance ETF's MSTX gives investors access to a leveraged position in Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy's stock (MSTR), amplifying gains—and losses—by 175%.

The funds were launched by prestigious asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, and had the most successful launch in the history of ETFs, with Ethereum funds following in summer last year. Asset managers are now trying to get ETFs approved that give exposure to altcoins, including top assets like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin—though a couple have already started trading.

A group including BlackRock, Nvidia and Microsoft is buying Aligned Data Centers in an approximately $40 billion deal in an effort to expand next-generation cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure. The acquisition comes amid a flurry of deals in recent months involving top AI developers that are flooding the booming AI sector with resources and money, and addressing resources -- such as electricity and infrastructure -- needed to support such technology. Last week it was revealed that semiconductor maker AMD will supply its chips to artificial intelligence company OpenAI as part of an agreement to team up on building AI infrastructure. OpenAI will also get the option to buy as much as a 10% stake in AMD, according to a joint statement announcing the deal. Last month, OpenAI and Nvidia announced a $100 billion partnership that will add at least 10 gigawatts of data center computing power. Aligned’s portfolio includes 50 campuses and more than 5 gigawatts of operational and planned capacity, including assets under development, mostly located across the U.S. and in Latin America. Some locations include northern Virginia; Chicago; Dallas; Ohio; Phoenix; Salt Lake City; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Queretaro, Mexico; and Santiago, Chile. Aligned, which is privately held, will continue to be led by CEO Andrew Schaap and keep its headquarters in Dallas. One of the sellers, Macquarie Asset Management, initially invested in Aligned in 2018. Ben Way, head of Macquarie Asset Management, said in a statement, “The scaling of Aligned Data Centers from two locations to 50 in seven years is representative of our approach to working with great companies and teams to support their rapid growth and deliver positive impact.” The transaction is the first deal for the investment consortium, which is named the Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership. The consortium has an initial target of mobilizing and deploying $30 billion of equity capital, with the potential of reaching $100 billion including debt. “AIP is positioned to meet the growing demand for the infrastructure required as AI continues to reshape the global economy," BlackRock Chairman and CEO and AIP Chairman Larry Fink said in a statement. “This partnership is bringing together leading companies and mobilizing private capital to accelerate AI innovation and drive global economic growth and productivity.” The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Shares of Nvidia rose about 1% in morning trading. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

AI darling Nvidia just struck another big data center deal—this time as part of a group with Microsoft, BlackRock, and others. A consortium including BlackRock (BLK), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) said Wednesday it would buy AI data center infrastructure company Aligned Data Centers in an agreement valued at $40 billion. Aligned Data Centers is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing data center firms, and the group said the purchase “will fuel the expansion of next-generation cloud and AI infrastructure.” The massive deal could be taken as another strong signal of AI demand expectations, with Nvidia, Microsoft, and BlackRock making big bets on AI-driven growth. The deal marks the latest in a string of high-profile agreements and partnerships for AI chip leader Nvidia, and infrastructure deals for BlackRock, which has been eying energy providers as another way to ride the AI boom. BlackRock CEO and AIP Chair Larry Fink said that with the acquisition, “we further our goal of delivering the infrastructure necessary to power the future of AI, while offering our clients attractive opportunities to participate in its growth.” Shares of Nvidia and Microsoft pared back early gains and were down about 1% in recent trading. Shares of BlackRock were less than 1% lower. This article has been updated since it was first published for clarity and to reflect more recent stock price values.

Title: The Protocol: Monad Airdrop Portal Opens as Token Launch Nears

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: MONAD AIRDROP COMES CLOSER AS PORTAL OPENS: Monad is gearing up for one of the most anticipated token launches of the year. The Layer-1 blockchain project has opened its MON airdrop portal, inviting eligible users to check their status ahead of the official token distribution. While the airdrop itself hasn’t gone live yet, the Monad Foundation said that users can now verify eligibility and connect their wallets, with the window remaining open until Nov. 3, 2025. “There is NO incentive to claiming really fast, so take your time. Triple check everything,” said Keone Hon, the co-founder of Monad, on X. The Monad Foundation shared in a blog post that it will target around 5,500 core community members and 225,000 broader crypto users, rewarding those who’ve helped grow the Monad ecosystem. Distribution will be done through a multi-track system spanning five categories: Monad Community, Onchain Users, Crypto Community, Crypto Contributors & Curious and Monad Builders. Those who qualify across multiple tracks can stack their allocations, giving more weight to active participants. The team also said it will be combining on-chain activity data (such as DEX volume and NFT ownership) with off-chain verification through platforms like Twitter, Discord and Telegram. The airdrop marks a step toward Monad’s upcoming mainnet launch, though the details of when that will happen and the number of tokens allocated towards these communities are still unknown. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. FUSAKA GOES LIVE ON ETHEREUM’S SEPOLIA TESTNET: Ethereum developers launched the second test of the upcoming Fusaka upgrade earlier this week on the Sepolia network, marking another step toward the upgrade’s mainnet debut. The test follows a successful rollout on the Holesky testnet two weeks ago. Developers plan one final rehearsal on the Hoodi network on Oct. 28, after which they’ll set a date to activate Fusaka on Ethereum’s main blockchain. Coming only a few months after Ethereum’s major Pectra upgrade, Fusaka is designed to lower costs for institutions using the network. One of its key features, PeerDAS, allows validators to verify only portions of data rather than entire “blobs.” This improvement reduces bandwidth demands and helps cut costs for both layer-2 networks and validators. Testnets like Sepolia play a crucial role in Ethereum’s development cycle, giving developers a reliable environment to test upgrades under real-world conditions before they go live on the main network. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. MONERO RELEASES PRIVACY BOOST AGAINST SNEAKY NETWORK NODES: Leading privacy blockchain Monero has released an important upgrade that significantly strengthens user protection against spy nodes. The blockchain announced CLI v0.18.4.3 'Fluorine Fermi' on X, calling it a highly recommended release that enhances protection against spy nodes. Monero relies on a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network where nodes (computers) connect directly to each other to share and verify transactions and blocks. Privacy is ensured through several key technologies: each transaction uses unique stealth addresses so that the recipient’s actual address stays hidden; ring signatures mix a sender’s transaction with other decoy transactions, making it unclear who really sent the funds; and Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) hide the amount being transferred. Still, a paper published on the research sharing platform arXiv in September noted the growing presence of non-standard nodes in the network. These nodes pose as honest nodes but are likely intended for monitoring the network and spying on other nodes, thereby endangering privacy. The Fluorine Fermi update tackles this challenge by implementing an improved peer selection algorithm that reduces the chance users connect to multiple nodes within the same IP subnet, a common spy node tactic. It discourages connections to large clusters of suspicious IP addresses, steering users toward safer nodes. — Omkar Godbole Read more. EF MAKES PRIVACY A PILLAR OF ITS WORK: The Ethereum Foundation is making privacy a formal pillar of its roadmap, expanding research efforts into a dedicated cluster that now covers private payments, proofs, identity, and enterprise use cases. Ethereum has supported privacy research through its Privacy and Scaling Explorations (PSE) team since 2018, with experiments like Semaphore for anonymous signaling, MACI for private voting, zkEmail and zkTLS, and the Anon Aadhaar project. These have become reference points for developers across the ecosystem, spawning hundreds of forks and integrations. The new “privacy cluster,” coordinated by Igor Barinov, brings these experiments under a single umbrella alongside new initiatives, per a blog post. Those include private reads and writes for payments and interactions, portable proofs for identity and asset ownership, zkID systems for selective disclosure, UX work to normalize privacy tools, and Kohaku, an SDK and wallet designed to make strong cryptography usable by default. An Institutional Privacy Task Force is also part of the cluster, translating compliance and operational requirements into specifications that larger enterprises can test. The Foundation framed privacy as essential to Ethereum’s credibility. Blockchains are transparent by design, but widespread adoption requires that users and institutions have the option to transact, govern, and build without exposing sensitive data. – Shaurya Malwa Read more.

"Five years from now, there's not going to be a stock, there's not going to be an option, there's not going to be a mutual fund, ETF, anything that's not in effect tokenized," Moglia told CNBC on Tuesday, describing traditional finance professionals as still struggling to grasp the shift happening in Web3 and DeFi markets. “Going forward, real-world assets are going to be tokenized as the rest of the world is going to be,” he added, while adding he’s pursuing tokenization of its reinsurance company's risk as part of its strategy. His comments come as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink appeared on 60 Minutes advocating crypto ownership after previously dismissing Bitcoin in 2017 as an "index of money laundering,” a shift Moglia attributes to Fink becoming "a DeFi guy" who "appreciates the future." BlackRock is developing proprietary tokenization technology and "having conversations with all the major platforms" about digital wallet integration, according to Fink's recent earnings call. "We need to be tokenizing all assets, especially assets that have multiple levels of intermediaries," Fink said, pointing to real estate, where tokenization could reduce fees and make home ownership more affordable by cutting out layers of middlemen. Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum, told Decrypt that tokenization will now "work its way up that risk curve" toward less liquid assets. "I truly believe ultimately we will have almost every financial asset in a tokenized version because it just helps to automate the value chain, starting from issuance over the primary market, secondary market, the legal anchor, corporate actions, all of this. Musheer Ahmed, Founder & MD of Finstep Asia, told Decrypt, "while there is significant momentum for tokenization of financial products and I am also bullish on the use case, this timeline of 5 years to tokenize everything is highly optimistic." Ahmed noted that the timeline is plausible even as “most trading rails and infra will take many years” and that “the tokenization wave is led by the US, Hong Kong, Singapore, and UAE,” while most markets still “lack frameworks for digital assets.” The low trading volume in tokenized assets stems from “the nature of the underlying assets,” he said, noting “most RWAs are not liquid or in high demand for daily turnover.” “Current tokenized products (outside of bonds) are not being actively marketed by brokers, private banks, or investment funds,” he said, and that once they are offered more widely, “demand will pick up and help create a more dynamic secondary market.” Total real-world assets on-chain have reached $33.91 billion, up 6.6% from 30 days ago, with 483,892 total asset holders, according to RWA.xyz data.

Title: CAIS Summit Underscores the Growing Adoption of Alts in Wealth Space

The alternative investment platform’s fourth annual conference highlighted how far advisors have come in moving into private markets. October 15, 2025 Asset managers and advisors converged in Los Angeles this week for the fourth annual CAIS Summit—a conference that brings together many of the alternative investment platform’s users. It also serves as a useful barometer for the ongoing trend of increased adoption of private markets in the wealth space. Attendance at the show has grown from a few hundred at its inaugural event to over 1,200 at this year’s show. Of that, CAIS reported 325 wealth management firms, and 800 advisors are attending the event. (In all, CAIS said that 2,000 wealth firms and 62,000 advisors currently use its platform.) On the asset management side, most of the major alts managers increasingly targeting the wealth space are also represented, including names like Apollo, Ares, Blackrock, Blackstone, Blue Owl, Brookfield Oaktree, Carlyle, Coller Capital, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs, Invesco, JP Morgan, KKR, Partners Group, T. Rowe Price and others. In reflecting on the evolution of the space since launching CAIS about 15 years ago, CAIS CEO and founder Matt Brown pointed to the rush by firms that historically served institutional investors to gain traction in the private wealth space. “The alternative asset management community really cares about wealth management,” Brown said. “That hasn’t always been the case. By the way, that’s a huge positive for the advisor community. Alts managers see an opportunity to grow their businesses, and advisors are no longer an afterthought. [Asset managers] are collaborating, designing products, rolling out education and building teams to service you. They are all in. My recommendation is to take advantage.” Related:Blackstone Creates Business Group to Bolster 401(k) Strategy Several major trends were apparent throughout the first full day of the conference, including the coalescence around evergreen funds (interval funds, tender offer funds, BDCs and non-traded REITs) as the preferred vehicle for delivering private markets to the wealth channel. Today, there are more than 400 registered funds available with alts exposure, and about half of those have been launched in the last 24 months. (A recent report from consulting firm Deloitte projected that over the next five years, semiliquid funds’ global AUM could grow 12-fold to $4.1 trillion.) In addition, the convergence of public and private markets, marked by a surge in mergers and partnerships among traditional and alternative asset managers, was a significant theme. Several products (some as model portfolios, others as semiliquid funds) have already come to market with more on the way. Related:Envestnet, Orion, Vestmark Expand Integrations with CAIS For its part, CAIS has launched a models marketplace that is selectively adding managers and strategies. “With the use of models, it goes from manager selection to outcomes,” said CAIS Advisors Chief Investment Officer Neil Blundell. (CAIS Advisors was created last year to assist financial advisors with streamlining portfolio construction.) “It’s a big strategic shift. It’s a lot easier to say, ‘Are you looking for enhanced income? Diversification? Growth? Etc.’ Models are designed with strategic asset allocations in a fashion that can deliver that outcome.” Lastly, unsurprisingly, AI was a significant theme, both as an investment opportunity gained via exposure to private market stakes in AI firms and data center and energy infrastructure, and in terms of its application in the space. (For its part, CAIS showcased AI that will soon be integrated into its platform, named CAIS.ey.) The state of private credit was also a hot button topic, especially amid the announced bankruptcies of U.S. auto parts supplier First Brands and car dealership Tricolor and recent comments from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon during the bank’s third quarter conference call. “I probably shouldn’t say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more,” Dimon said during the call. Related:Former Envestnet CEO Bill Crager Joins Private Markets Startup Private credit managers bristled at those remarks and pointed to the fact that private credit has withstood several business cycles with low loss rates. They also pointed to the importance of due diligence, underwriting and sponsor quality. “Credit quality is reasonably good,” said Glenn R. August, founder and CEO of Oak Hill Advisors. “We are not leveraging these investments 10 times with mark-to-market financing. ... We learned in 2008 that marked-to-market financing doesn’t work.” In a separate session, Ken Kencel, President and CEO of Churchill Asset Management, pointed to his firm’s average loss rate of five basis points per year on private credit as a sign of stability in the asset class. “We welcome the scrutiny because we know we’ve proven ourselves over 20 years,” Kencel said. “The best managers have a longstanding track record you can look to support performance and values.” He added that focusing on less volatile sectors—for example, it doesn’t do loans to energy companies, restaurants or retailers—as a major part of the firm’s strategy to avoid risk. “Our belief is individual investors in particular are looking for excellent risk-adjusted returns,” he said. “They are not looking for managers chasing an extra 50 basis points. They know that chasing leads to taking on more risk.” He also pointed to the significant number of deals the firms passes on financing. “There are top borrowers that you want to finance,” he said. “And then there are deals you turn down. In our case, those are deals that are cyclical and higher risk. It’s not about chasing yield. It’s about financing the best businesses. That’s where you want your direct lending partner to be.” Comments at the conference also touched on the state of the macroeconomy and regulatory environment. Despite the increased volatility in markets largely stemming from President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, speakers retained a bullish outlook on the economy. Many pointed to how markets rebounded after a sharp drop in April from Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement, and in subsequent months, reactions to shifting policy have been more muted. “What I look for is not what politicians say, but what businesses need and what consumers are demanding. That leads to a series of trends that policymakers usually back,” said Ken Mehlman, partner, global head of public policy and affairs at KKR. (Mehlman previously served stints as chair of the Republican National Committee from 2005 to 2007 and as White House director of public affairs for two years during President George W. Bush’s administration.) “Is there a risk that because of policy change and political change, it could be disrupted? Yes,” he said. However, he underscored that focusing on trends that transcend who is in power is a way of limiting policy risk. On the regulatory front, panelists welcomed the lighter touch from government agencies and expected that to continue, potentially expanding access to private markets to more investors. In concert with the conference, CAIS announced expanded integrations with several TAMPs (Orion, Envestnet and Vestmark) and managed account platforms. It also announced a partnership with secondary market specialist LODAS Markets. LODAS Markets enables investors in private vehicles such as non-traded REITs, interval funds and other structures, an option outside those funds’ dedicated redemption windows to sell shares. Through the partnership, LODAS secondary trading tech will be integrated into the CAIS platform. The functionality is expected to go live in the first quarter of next year.

Title: Apple Tops Global Brand Rankings Again, But An AI Contender Is Closing In

Apple has topped Interbrand’s annual Best Global Brands ranking for the 13th consecutive year—but AI giant Nvidia is closing in on its crown. Interbrand’s list ranks 100 companies based on their financial performance, the role their brand plays in purchase intent, and the brand’s competitive strength. The total value of this year’s Best Global Brands stands at $3.6 trillion, a 4.4% increase versus last year. 2025’s top five brands remained unchanged from 2024, with Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Samsung following Apple’s lead. However, further down the list, there’s been a historic surge for Nvidia and 12 new entrants across tech, finance, retail, and more, underlining shifting market dynamics. AI chipmaker Nvidia recorded the largest-ever brand value increase in Best Global Brands’ history, rising by 116% to reach $43.2bn—catapulting it from 36th place in 2024 to 15th in 2025. “Nvidia’s stellar product marketing and complete dominance in its ecosystem have spurred its meteoric rise,” said Greg Silverman, global director of brand economics at Interbrand. However, he cautioned that the Silicon Valley company (which was founded in 1993, but has recently surged in prominence as its hardware drives the AI boom) shouldn’t get too comfortable. “The emergence of a disruptor could undo this brand if it does not invest in long-term brand storytelling,” Silverman said. “It has the scale, but that’s not a brand strategy. To maintain sustainable growth, this is imperative.” Despite their recent advertising blitzes, consumer-facing AI brands like OpenAI and Anthropic did not make this year’s list. Notable new entries included investment firm BlackRock, which landed at number 31, Booking.com (32), and Uniqlo (47). Instagram’s brand value grew 27%, leading it too enter the top 10 for the first time, too. When it came to brand tumbles, Nike—which is transforming to regain its marketing edge—dropped from the 14th to the 23rd spot after losing 26% of its value. Elon Musk’s Tesla also dropped 13 spots to 25th place, with a 35% decline in brand value. Interbrand’s Best Global Brands 2025 – Top 10 1. Apple 2. Microsoft 3. Amazon 4. Google 5. Samsung 6.

Crypto exchange Backpack said it is adding SEC-registered U.S. equities to its trading platform with Superstate, the blockchain finance startup led by Compound founder Robert Leshner. Announced on Wednesday, the deal embeds Superstate’s Opening Bell platform into Backpack, allowing non-U.S. users to trade tokenized shares of public companies onchain. With the addition, Backpack claimed the bragging rights of being the first centralized crypto exchange to list issuer-backed, SEC-registered equities natively onchain. Supported equities and rollout date will be announced in the coming weeks, the firms said. These offerings are not synthetic or wrapped derivative products, the firms said, but real equities issued under U.S. securities law with the same CUSIP identifiers as their traditional counterparts on Nasdaq or the NYSE. "For traders, that means more assets to buy, sell and use as collateral — with better margin opportunities than traditional markets," Robert Leshner said in a statement. "For issuers, it expands reach to millions of crypto-native investors, connecting them directly with modern capital markets infrastructure." The move comes as tokenization of financial instruments, such as equity shares, bonds, and funds, is gaining momentum across crypto markets. A wide range of tokenized equity offerings debuted over the past few months, including Robinhood, Gemini, Ondo Finance's Global Markets and xStocks by Kraken and Backed Finance, creating token versions of the largest publicly-traded companies and ETFs. Superstate's Opening Bell focuses on creating tokenized versions of publicly traded stocks by working through a registered transfer agent. The platform brings the structure of U.S. capital markets onto blockchain rails, offering direct ownership and future access to DeFi tools. Backpack was founded by crypto developer Armani Ferrante and is best known for its role in the Solana ecosystem and having acquired imploded crypto exchange FTX's European arm. It has since grown into a broader financial platform. It launched a centralized exchange in 2023 with a virtual asset service provider license in Dubai, while it opened last month its EU-focused derivatives venue based in Cyprus and regulated under the MiFID II framework.

Bitcoin BTC$110,901.10 mining firm Bitdeer Technologies (BTDR) jumped as much as 30% on Wednesday after announcing new steps to fast-track its expansion into high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. The Singapore-based company said it will directly manage development of its own AI data centers rather than rely on outside partners, starting with its facility in Clarington, Ohio. Bitdeer said the local utility confirmed that all 570 megawatts (MW) of electrical capacity will be available by the end of the third quarter of 2026, nearly a year ahead of schedule. Two other sites — Tydal in Norway and Wenatchee, Washington in the U.S. — will also be converted, with Tydal expected to support 164 MW of AI computing by late next year, the firm said. The company said it sees a "sustained imbalance" between demand and supply of AI computing power. The firm expects to deploy over 200 MW for AI computing by the end of next year. In an optimistic scenario, Bitdeer said its AI operations could generate more than $2 billion in annualized revenue. "This push is driven by a marked increase in inbound interest in our power assets, which has become a strong catalyst for expanding our efforts," Matt Kong, chief business officer at Bitdeer, said in a statement. The company's shares rose as much as 30% in the early minutes in the Wednesday session, trading above $26 for the first time since early January. They were 26% higher at press time. Bitdeer's development fits into a broader trend of crypto mining firms pivoting to repurpose their computing power for the fast-growing AI demand. Miners such as Bitfarms, IREN, TeraWulf have been investor favorites as proxy bets on AI infrastructure and optimism that they would strike lucrative data center hosting deals.
