In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. To many inside Cubist Systematic Strategies — the roughly $7 billion quant division of Steve Cohen's hedge fund Point72 Asset Management — the ouster of president Denis Dancanet last month came as a shock. When Cohen's September 10 memo announcing the change landed, Dancanet had already begun preparing for year-end performance reviews, and scheduled meetings that day — including with job candidates — were abruptly canceled, according to people familiar with the matter. "People close to Denis were surprised," one of the people said. "Standard business was occurring." His big-name replacement, former WorldQuant Chief Investment Officer Geoffrey Lauprete, added to the curiosity. Lauprete had spent much of the past year laying the groundwork for an ambitious hedge fund launch of his own. Uncertainty loomed in the aftermath, with rumors of cuts and executive resignations swirling. The dust has started to clear in the six weeks since. In town halls and smaller meetings, Point72 leadership reaffirmed its commitment to its roster of 60 independent trading teams and the centralized investing unit that Dancanet built starting in 2020. "There are no plans to cut [portfolio managers] or investment teams — we remain focused on attracting great talent and growing Cubist," a Point72 spokesperson said in a statement to Business Insider. They declined to comment on Cubist's leadership changes. Dancanet also declined to comment. This week, Issam Bazzi, a key leader on the central team whose future has been the fixation of market chatter for weeks, signed a long-term contract extension after discussions with Cohen, Business Insider has learned. But what led to the surprising change at the top has remained murky. Cubist's performance had been strong during Dancanet's five-year run, and it remained positive in 2025 even after a short stint of summer losses that plagued the whole industry. If the shake-up felt sudden to some, that was by design. The announcement capped months of quiet maneuvering by Cohen and his top deputies, who'd started to question whether Dancanet was the right person to lead Cubist, people with knowledge of the matter said. Point72 started a hush-hush search in early summer, auditioning candidates in a closely guarded process to avoid leaks and disruptions to the business, one person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The result wasn't a fait accompli. A series of converging events and chance timing culminated in one of the industry's most unanticipated leadership swaps. This story is based on conversations with more than a dozen people close to Cubist and Libero Capital, including current and former employees, allocators, and service providers. They requested anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on behalf of their companies or to protect client relationships. Fundamental stock picking is at the core of Cohen's Point72. But he's been involved in systematic trading for nearly as long as he's been running funds, hiring his first quant portfolio manager in 1994. After longtime Cubist head Ross Garon decamped for Izzy Englander's Millennium in 2020, Cohen brought in Dancanet, a veteran of the collaborative quant fund PDT — in large part to help realize a long-held desire to diversify from independent teams, or the so-called pod structure, and build a centralized systematic trading team in the mold of traditional powerhouse quant shops like PDT, Renaissance Technologies, or Two Sigma. "The difference compared to the pod model is that it's much more collaborative and there's open communication between the various teams across strategies," Dancanet explained in a 2023 blog post, which has since been scrubbed from the Point72 website. "The goal is to create a hybrid business structure combining the PM platform and the central team, which we feel would be unique for our industry." Dancanet was a cerebral, serene, and well-liked leader, according to those who've worked with him. He started on Wall Street in the mid-1990s after defecting from communist Romania in 1985. He joined Cubist after a four-year hiatus from quant trading, working on startups — one focused on flying cars and the other on applying data science to consumer lending. Dancanet immediately got to work building a centralized trading unit from scratch, an endeavor that, like any quant investment platform, would be expensive and take years to realize. Dancanet lured marquee hires, including former colleague Bazzi, from places like Citadel, Jump Trading, Squarepoint, and Tower Research. The road didn't lack bumps — the head of Cubist's high-frequency trading effort left after less than a year on the job — but the central group began trading and making money after a couple of years. It reached 100 people in 2025 and through mid-year had strong performance, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The other key part of Dancanet's job was something he lacked experience in: hiring PMs to run the independent pods Cubist is known for. Unlike hiring discretionary stock pickers, who can be up and running in days or weeks, bets on systematic PMs can take years to bear fruit as they assemble the necessary data and infrastructure, research and backtest strategies, and execute trading models. While returns at Cubist, which has doubled head count over the past three years, remained robust in the years after Dancanet joined, a pain point emerged with Cohen: Many of the PMs Dancanet brought in weren't moving the needle, according to people familiar with the matter. Cubist money managers who predated Dancanet generated a disproportionate amount of the returns, according to people familiar. Whether his leadership contributed to or improved the legacy PMs' performance is unclear, but Cohen wanted to see improvement on the disparity. While many PMs dislike micromanaging executives, Dancanet's more laissez-faire leadership style may have given Cohen and top deputies pause, insiders said. Dancanet's contract was up for renewal before the end of the year, and Cohen's team started to quietly explore alternatives. For Point72, Lauprete was a uniquely attractive candidate. At WorldQuant, he oversaw a massive centralized investment process, though the fund also has independent pods. Moreover, Lauprete, who left WorldQuant after 17 years in early 2024, wasn't bound by one of the lengthy noncompete clauses that often sideline quants for years, meaning he could start immediately — minimizing disruption at Cubist. The catch: He had spent considerable time and money preparing the launch of his own fund, Libero Capital. Lauprete initially secured Paloma Partners, the storied hedge fund founded by Donald Sussman in the 1980s, as an anchor investor. The relationship soured, and by April, according to Hedge Fund Alert, Lauprete and Paloma parted ways. Lauprete continued pitching investors through the spring and summer, drawing interest from firms including Engineers Gate, BlackRock, and Blackstone, people familiar said. (Representatives for those firms declined to comment.) He also held an initial meeting with Cubist, including Dancanet, in early summer about having Libero manage a slug of capital. But unbeknownst to Dancanet, discussions continued separately with Point72 leaders and evolved in scope. In early summer, Cubist — like most quant funds — was having a strong year. Systematic long-short funds were up double digits heading into June, according to a Goldman Sachs research report. The central team was profitable, and Dancanet aimed to eventually dedicate half of Cubist's capital to it, people familiar with his plan said. But then the steady, mysterious losses across the quantitative trading industry started to pile up, turning into a two-month bloodbath. Cubist experienced a severe drawdown, suffering its worst stretch since the COVID pandemic in early 2020, but recovered some of those losses, and year-to-date performance remained positive. Unlike setups at some rivals, Cubist isn't a stand-alone fund investors can allocate to with separately reported returns; its performance flows into Point72's overall returns. Point72 recorded gains in July and August and is up 9.7% through September. Point72's under-the-radar search for a potential Cubist successor continued. But while Libero was generating intrigue, capital commitments sufficient for its ambition weren't materializing, sources with knowledge of the matter said. Some investors were wary of the scale and associated costs of a large-scale quant launch as well as the autonomy Lauprete wanted, the people said. Lauprete, who was funding Libero out of his own pocket, was simultaneously interviewing with Point72 executives about the Cubist job, a process kept closely guarded to avoid leaks, one insider said. Dancanet and Cohen discussed contract extensions over the summer without coming to a conclusion. Then, over the first weekend in September, Lauprete and Cohen agreed to terms that would install Lauprete as Cubist president and move Libero under the unit's umbrella, people close to the firm said. Days later, Cohen sent out the memo announcing the leadership change. Cohen convened a short-notice virtual meeting with Cubist PMs the next day, one company insider said, reassuring them that he remained committed to both sides — the pods and the central team — of his hybrid vision for Cubist. Some industry insiders called it an opportunistic fit for both sides: a more seasoned leader for Cubist, and for Lauprete, a chance to land one of Wall Street's most coveted quant jobs while keeping Libero alive, which will join Cubist as an independent pod, people familiar said. He started the role at the beginning of October. The months and years ahead will reveal whether Cohen's leadership shake-up pays off — and whether Lauprete can deliver on the challenge of fusing Cubist's independent pods and central team ambitions into a single machine that churns out industry-beating returns.

Title: Ethereum Market Outlook: $4,100 Resistance Holds as BlackRock and Major Funds Boost Exposure
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-market-outlook-as-the-4100-resistance-hold/
Time Published: 2025-10-23T06:00:33Z

After two weeks of a disappointing run, Ethereum (ETH) is once again capturing institutional interest as major funds and asset managers step into the smart-contract platform. According to recent data, Bitmine Immersion Technologies purchased approximately $251 million worth of ETH, adding 63,539 tokens to its portfolio and bringing its holdings to over 3 million ETH ($13 billion). BlackRock’s clients have added $41.91 million in Ethereum, marking another sign of growing institutional adoption. These inflows come as Ethereum breaks out of a descending trendline pattern and parallels the rally seen in gold, with ETH’s correlation to gold reaching 0.7 in Q3 2025, driven by ETF inflows and DeFi-driven growth. On-chain metrics further reinforce this accumulation narrative. Wallets are moving more ETH off exchanges, signaling long-term holding behavior, while tokenization and DeFi usage on Ethereum’s network continue to expand meaningfully. Institutions appear to be treating Ethereum not just as a speculative bet, but increasingly as a foundational infrastructure asset, particularly given Ethereum’s post-Proof-of-Stake upgrade energy efficiency and suitability for ESG mandates. From a technical vantage, Ethereum is testing the key resistance zone near $4,100–$4,440. Analysts like Ali Martinez point out the recent breakout of the descending trendline provides a bullish structural shift, but only if support levels remain intact. The most critical support lies near $3,800, with a deeper fallback to $3,600 if momentum fades. A sustained move above $4,440 could unlock a run toward $4,800–$5,000, provided institutional flows and macro conditions align. Conversely, a close below $3,800 would weaken the momentum thesis and potentially invite a retracement toward $3,560 or lower. With ETF flows, macro liquidity, and network fundamentals converging, Ethereum is showing a rare blend of structural strength, but execution is key. The near-term jury is out until Ethereum closes decisively above $4,100 with volume confirming the move.

Title: The Great Democratization: Why Your Pension Deserves Bitcoin
URL: https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/10/the_great_democratization_why_your_pension_deserves_bitcoin.html
Time Published: 2025-10-23T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
For decades, the investment elite have enjoyed a secret: alternative assets deliver superior returns. While ordinary Americans watched their 401(k)s stagnate in index funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds quietly reaped gains from private equity, venture capital, and—lately—digital assets. President Trump’s Executive Order 14330, “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors” (Aug. 7, 2025), finally tears down that wall, giving working Americans the same opportunities long hoarded by the wealthy. Leveling the Field The reform works on three levels: federal directive, state legislation, and congressional codification. At the federal level, Trump’s order directed the Department of Labor to lift Biden-era restrictions that effectively banned cryptocurrencies from retirement accounts under the guise of “extreme care.” States responded swiftly. Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas legalized modest Bitcoin allocations in early 2025. North Carolina proposed allowing up to five percent of its $127 billion retirement fund—$6.35 billion—to flow into Bitcoin ETFs. Michigan already holds $11.4 million in Bitcoin exposure, and Wisconsin disclosed $164 million in spot ETF holdings. Florida’s House Bill 183, filed for the 2026 session, is the boldest initiative yet. It would authorize the State CFO to invest up to 10 percent of public funds—including the $218 billion Florida Retirement System Trust Fund—in digital assets. Even a 1 percent allocation would add $2.2 billion to Bitcoin markets; 5 percent would exceed $11 billion. The bill imposes strict custody and compliance requirements, limiting holdings to qualified custodians or SEC-registered ETFs. It cites Trump’s earlier Executive Order 14233 establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, defining Bitcoin as a store of value and inflation hedge. In Congress, Rep. Troy Downing’s Retirement Investment Choice Act seeks to codify the reform permanently, shielding it from future reversals. Senate Republicans are pressing for regulatory safe harbors to protect plan sponsors. Critics decry “speculation,” ignoring that institutions have owned crypto for years. Harvard, Yale, and Stanford invested in digital assets long ago; Michigan and Wisconsin pension funds now follow. The paternalism that deems Harvard’s allocation “prudent” but a Kentucky teacher’s “reckless” is indefensible. Oklahoma lawmakers estimated that a five-percent Bitcoin allocation would have yielded $750 million in just five months—reducing pension liabilities without costing taxpayers. Macroeconomic Realism The macro case is simple: the old rules no longer apply. The 60/40 stock-bond portfolio worked when inflation was tame and rates predictable. Since Nixon abandoned gold in 1971, the dollar has lost nearly 90 percent of its purchasing power. Pension funds invested solely in dollar assets are slowly boiling away their value. Bitcoin offers scarcity and independence from central banks. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins provides what fiat currency cannot—certainty against dilution. While the Fed prints trillions, no government can mint more Bitcoin. For funds managing decades of liabilities, that scarcity is protection. Since 2015, Bitcoin has appreciated over 15,000 percent. Even accounting for volatility, its risk-adjusted returns beat every traditional asset over ten years. With BlackRock, Fidelity, and other giants now offering Bitcoin products, the real question is why ordinary savers were barred from this asset class for so long. Monetary Sovereignty and Stability Cryptocurrency is not rebellion but evolution. The Fed’s monopoly on money creation produced asset bubbles, the 2008 crisis, and inflation that punishes savers. Bitcoin provides a decentralized system where no bureaucracy can rewrite the rules. For pensions, diversification across uncorrelated assets enhances stability. Bitcoin’s movements have low correlation with equities, particularly during inflation shocks. When the dollar weakens, Bitcoin often rises—the hedge long-term portfolios need. The 2022 “crypto winter,” endlessly cited by skeptics, was followed by a recovery that rewarded patient holders. Pension funds, with multi-decade horizons, are ideally suited to absorb short-term volatility. Integrating crypto also secures America’s leadership in digital finance. China has its digital yuan; Europe experiments with a digital euro. If U.S. pensions remain confined to 20th-century assets while others advance on blockchain rails, America risks obsolescence. Trump’s order ensures American savers, not foreign innovators, benefit from U.S. financial ingenuity. The Geopolitical Dimension The dollar’s supremacy is not eternal. Its strength rests on faith in U.S. institutions and the dollar’s global utility. Endless deficits and monetary expansion corrode both. Bitcoin, a neutral and borderless asset, is becoming a global reserve hedge. Far from undermining American power, adopting Bitcoin reinforces it. The U.S. still commands the deepest capital markets and most advanced financial infrastructure. Keeping Bitcoin innovation under American jurisdiction ensures it strengthens, not weakens, the national system. Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve mirrors the role gold once played at Fort Knox: a signal of monetary credibility in the digital age. Vermont’s proposed ban on pension crypto holdings shows the opposite impulse—fear masquerading as prudence. Dismissing Bitcoin as “too young” recalls those who once said the same about equities or the internet. Pension funds that avoided technology stocks in the 1990s underperformed disastrously; those that shun digital assets now will repeat the mistake. The Path Forward Trump’s order does not compel investment; it restores fiduciary discretion. The three-tier system—federal deregulation, state empowerment, congressional codification—forms a durable structure resistant to political shifts. Florida’s plan exemplifies best practice: a 10 percent ceiling, strict custody rules, ETF channels, and explicit recognition of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. As Brian Graff of the American Retirement Association notes, “Professional fiduciaries—not the federal government—are best placed to decide what serves participants’ interests.” Maintaining the status quo is the true recklessness. States like Kentucky and Oklahoma face massive pension shortfalls. With traditional assets underperforming, fiduciaries must seek alternatives.

For decades, the investment elite have enjoyed a secret: alternative assets deliver superior returns. While ordinary Americans watched their 401(k)s stagnate in index funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds quietly reaped gains from private equity, venture capital, and—lately—digital assets. President Trump’s Executive Order 14330, “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors” (Aug. 7, 2025), finally tears down that wall, giving working Americans the same opportunities long hoarded by the wealthy. Leveling the Field The reform works on three levels: federal directive, state legislation, and congressional codification. At the federal level, Trump’s order directed the Department of Labor to lift Biden-era restrictions that effectively banned cryptocurrencies from retirement accounts under the guise of “extreme care.” States responded swiftly. Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas legalized modest Bitcoin allocations in early 2025. North Carolina proposed allowing up to five percent of its $127 billion retirement fund—$6.35 billion—to flow into Bitcoin ETFs. Michigan already holds $11.4 million in Bitcoin exposure, and Wisconsin disclosed $164 million in spot ETF holdings. Florida’s House Bill 183, filed for the 2026 session, is the boldest initiative yet. It would authorize the State CFO to invest up to 10 percent of public funds—including the $218 billion Florida Retirement System Trust Fund—in digital assets. Even a 1 percent allocation would add $2.2 billion to Bitcoin markets; 5 percent would exceed $11 billion. The bill imposes strict custody and compliance requirements, limiting holdings to qualified custodians or SEC-registered ETFs. It cites Trump’s earlier Executive Order 14233 establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, defining Bitcoin as a store of value and inflation hedge. In Congress, Rep. Troy Downing’s Retirement Investment Choice Act seeks to codify the reform permanently, shielding it from future reversals. Senate Republicans are pressing for regulatory safe harbors to protect plan sponsors. Critics decry “speculation,” ignoring that institutions have owned crypto for years. Harvard, Yale, and Stanford invested in digital assets long ago; Michigan and Wisconsin pension funds now follow. The paternalism that deems Harvard’s allocation “prudent” but a Kentucky teacher’s “reckless” is indefensible. Oklahoma lawmakers estimated that a five-percent Bitcoin allocation would have yielded $750 million in just five months—reducing pension liabilities without costing taxpayers. Macroeconomic Realism The macro case is simple: the old rules no longer apply. The 60/40 stock-bond portfolio worked when inflation was tame and rates predictable. Since Nixon abandoned gold in 1971, the dollar has lost nearly 90 percent of its purchasing power. Pension funds invested solely in dollar assets are slowly boiling away their value. Bitcoin offers scarcity and independence from central banks. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins provides what fiat currency cannot—certainty against dilution. While the Fed prints trillions, no government can mint more Bitcoin. For funds managing decades of liabilities, that scarcity is protection. Since 2015, Bitcoin has appreciated over 15,000 percent. Even accounting for volatility, its risk-adjusted returns beat every traditional asset over ten years. With BlackRock, Fidelity, and other giants now offering Bitcoin products, the real question is why ordinary savers were barred from this asset class for so long. Monetary Sovereignty and Stability Cryptocurrency is not rebellion but evolution. The Fed’s monopoly on money creation produced asset bubbles, the 2008 crisis, and inflation that punishes savers. Bitcoin provides a decentralized system where no bureaucracy can rewrite the rules. For pensions, diversification across uncorrelated assets enhances stability. Bitcoin’s movements have low correlation with equities, particularly during inflation shocks. When the dollar weakens, Bitcoin often rises—the hedge long-term portfolios need. The 2022 “crypto winter,” endlessly cited by skeptics, was followed by a recovery that rewarded patient holders. Pension funds, with multi-decade horizons, are ideally suited to absorb short-term volatility. Integrating crypto also secures America’s leadership in digital finance. China has its digital yuan; Europe experiments with a digital euro. If U.S. pensions remain confined to 20th-century assets while others advance on blockchain rails, America risks obsolescence. Trump’s order ensures American savers, not foreign innovators, benefit from U.S. financial ingenuity. The Geopolitical Dimension The dollar’s supremacy is not eternal. Its strength rests on faith in U.S. institutions and the dollar’s global utility. Endless deficits and monetary expansion corrode both. Bitcoin, a neutral and borderless asset, is becoming a global reserve hedge. Far from undermining American power, adopting Bitcoin reinforces it. The U.S. still commands the deepest capital markets and most advanced financial infrastructure. Keeping Bitcoin innovation under American jurisdiction ensures it strengthens, not weakens, the national system. Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve mirrors the role gold once played at Fort Knox: a signal of monetary credibility in the digital age. Vermont’s proposed ban on pension crypto holdings shows the opposite impulse—fear masquerading as prudence. Dismissing Bitcoin as “too young” recalls those who once said the same about equities or the internet. Pension funds that avoided technology stocks in the 1990s underperformed disastrously; those that shun digital assets now will repeat the mistake. The Path Forward Trump’s order does not compel investment; it restores fiduciary discretion. The three-tier system—federal deregulation, state empowerment, congressional codification—forms a durable structure resistant to political shifts. Florida’s plan exemplifies best practice: a 10 percent ceiling, strict custody rules, ETF channels, and explicit recognition of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. As Brian Graff of the American Retirement Association notes, “Professional fiduciaries—not the federal government—are best placed to decide what serves participants’ interests.” Maintaining the status quo is the true recklessness. States like Kentucky and Oklahoma face massive pension shortfalls. With traditional assets underperforming, fiduciaries must seek alternatives. Crypto offers return, diversification, and protection against monetary debasement—the very goals of responsible investment. Volatility fears are outdated. Institutional adoption and regulatory clarity have stabilized markets, and Bitcoin’s swings have narrowed as liquidity deepens. For pensions with long horizons, near-term fluctuations are noise; long-term appreciation is the signal. The democratization of alternative assets is overdue justice. For too long, working Americans were excluded from wealth-building strategies reserved for elites. Trump’s reforms end this financial apartheid. Every worker deserves access to the same instruments that enriched universities and sovereign funds.

Rowe Price on Wednesday applied for a mixed digital asset exchange-traded fund, according to a regulatory filing, its first in the crypto space as it joined a growing list of traditional finance firms that have proposed token-focused products. The Baltimore-based firm, which manages $1.77 trillion in assets, said that the T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF would hold five to 15 digital assets, including potentially Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, Hedera, Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Litecoin, and Polkadot, according to its S-1 prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest digital coins by market cap, will have the biggest weighting, according to the application. SEMI-SHOCK: T Rowe Price just filed for an Active Crypto ETF. They are a Top 5 active manager by assets (mostly mutual funds). Did not expect it but I get it. There’s gonna be land rush for this space too. pic.twitter.com/gXbCsll9kG — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 22, 2025 "Under normal circumstances, the Fund is expected to hold between five and fifteen crypto assets; however, the Fund may hold more than fifteen or less than five crypto assets at any time," the filing said, adding that the ETF would try to outperform the FTSE Crypto U.S. Listed Index. The application comes as traditional finance firms look to expand their digital asset fund offerings to meet soaring investor demand, a result of the success of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum funds that debuted last year and a friendlier regulatory and political environment. Fidelity, VanEck and ProShares have all proposed Solana funds. This week, ProShares also submitted a proposal for a mixed digital coin fund. Several crypto-focused asset managers are also looking to list ETFs based on altcoins. The SEC is currently weighing more than 90 applications for crypto-focused ETFs. T. Rowe Price told Decrypt that it could not provide information aside from what was in the filing. In January 2024, the SEC approved a slew of Bitcoin ETFs, including funds proposed by BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale. The funds have had the most successful start in the ETF industry's 32-year history and now manage over $150.3 billion in assets. Ethereum funds, approved later in the year, now control about $23 billion in assets, most of those coming in the last four months. The funds have given more traditional investors and some institutions access to the world of crypto via shares that trade on a stock exchange. Previously, investors were discouraged by some aspects of buying digital assets, such as storing digital coins and paying tax on gains.

The 54-page analysis paints an optimistic picture of crypto's trajectory, emphasizing 2025 as the pivotal year for institutional embrace while highlighting surging user growth, technological advancements, and regulatory progress in the U.S. "This is the year the world came on-chain," the authors wrote. With Bitcoin dominating over half the cryptocurrency market cap and stablecoins rivaling global payment giants like Visa in transaction volume, the report argues that crypto is anchoring the modern economy—yet it warns that challenges like privacy, scalability, and AI integration must be addressed to unlock its full potential. That optimism isn't unexpected: Andreessen Horowitz is Silicon Valley's biggest booster, having raised more than $7.6 billion across four funds earmarked for crypto. At the heart of the report is the assertion that crypto's market is "big, global, and growing," driven by cyclical feedback loops between rising prices, developer activity, and user adoption. The total crypto market capitalization has seen dramatic ups and downs, but recently topped $4 billion for the first time ever. And underlying metrics show resilience: monthly active developers have climbed to over 40,000, while mobile wallet users approach 60 million. Bitcoin remains king, holding more than 50% of the global crypto market cap and ranking among top global assets—its value now surpasses companies like Meta and Saudi Aramco, though gold's market cap is still 11 times larger. The report notes Bitcoin's increasing correlation with macro forces, behaving at times like a safe haven (similar to gold) and at others like a risk asset (tracking the Nasdaq). In the report, Andreessen Horowitz dubbed 2025 "the year of institutional adoption." Major financial players are diving in: Circle's market cap exceeded $50 billion earlier this year after a splashy IPO, Robinhood launched its own Arbitrum-based layer-2 blockchain, BlackRock continued expanding its tokenized money-market fund, and Fidelity started testing its own USD-pegged stablecoin. Traditional giants like Stripe, Visa, PayPal, Mastercard, Shopify, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley are integrating crypto features, from stablecoin payments to tokenized assets. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs alone hold over $170 billion in on-chain assets, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust holding over $91 billion worth of BTC as of this writing. Meanwhile, publicly traded "treasury companies" now hold billions in crypto reserves—led by Bitcoin giant Strategy with $69 million—signaling a shift toward treating digital assets as core balance-sheet items. Stablecoins emerged as a breakout star, having "gone mainstream" with adjusted transaction volumes hitting $9 trillion over the past year—gaining on ACH ($87 trillion) while dwarfing PayPal ($1.7 trillion). Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC dominate stablecoin supply, primarily on Ethereum and Tron, and stablecoin issuers now rank among the top 20 holders of U.S. Treasuries, ahead of nations like Saudi Arabia and Germany. The report posits that stablecoins could bolster USD dominance amid rising national debt and declining foreign demand for Treasuries, with organic adoption decoupling from speculative trading. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is expanding, capturing 25% of spot trading volume as users shift from centralized exchanges (CEXs) to decentralized ones (DEXs). Real-world assets (RWAs) like tokenized Treasuries and corporate bonds have reached $30 billion on-chain, bridging traditional finance. Decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) plays are also gaining steam, with projects like Helium generating revenue through user-owned wireless services. Meme coins, with over 13 million different tokens launched in the past year, are framed as a symptom of regulatory gaps, while NFTs evolve from speculation to broad collecting on low-fee chains. Prediction markets, buoyed by post-election traction, are "here to stay," the report claims. The report claimed that crypto infrastructure is "(almost) ready for prime time," processing over 3,400 transactions per second—approaching scales of Nasdaq or credit card networks. Solana stands out as a hub for economic activity, with rising throughput and billions in app revenue, while Ethereum's layer-2 upgrades have driven record volumes at all-time-low fees. Bridges are funneling billions to more robust chains, and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs are accelerating privacy and scaling. Blockchains are also preparing for quantum threats, with 6.65 million Bitcoin ($717 billion) still at risk from vulnerable addresses. A key convergence is between AI and crypto, with the report arguing that crypto can solve AI's pain points: proving human uniqueness (over 17 million verified on World), enabling agent payments ($30 trillion projected AI-influenced purchases by 2030), tracking IP provenance ($80 trillion in intangible assets), and decentralizing compute (over 420,000 models on Gensyn's network). Since ChatGPT's launch, crypto has seen a talent exodus to AI but net gains from other sectors, fueling a wave of "AI x crypto" startups—now representing 30% of crypto VC deals. AI's power consolidation in Big Tech underscores the need for crypto's decentralization. AI needs identity, payments, and provenance tracking. Crypto provides all three. Together, crypto & AI are shaping a more open internet—one where both money and intelligence move freely. pic.twitter.com/slZvgB0ruj — a16z crypto (@a16zcrypto) October 22, 2025 In America, the industry is "stronger than ever," the firm wrote, thanks to advancing legislation like the GENIUS Act—which President Trump signed into law in July with bipartisan support—and the pending CLARITY Act. Federal agencies are being proactive, too: the DOJ revised crypto prosecution policies, the CFTC clarified that code isn't a crime, and the SEC issued guidance on stablecoins and ETFs. This environment enables tokens to capture revenue directly for holders, the report suggests, closing economic loops with $33 billion in user-paid fees generating $18 billion for projects and $4 billion accruing to tokens. Looking ahead, Andreessen Horowitz forecasts market structure as top policy priority, accelerated stablecoin use strengthening USD, traditional finance doubling down on-chain, infrastructure breakthroughs, and revenue-generating tokens. It also projects AI-crypto innovations addressing internet challenges, a surge in tokenized real-world assets, clearer regulations unlocking developer opportunities, and consumer products onboarding the next wave of users.

Title: T. Rowe Is Aiming to Beat an Index of Investments — in Crypto

T. Rowe Price's actively managed ETF would invest in a “diversified basket of commodity crypto assets,” according to regulatory filings. October 22, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- T. Rowe Price Group Inc. is planning to launch its first cryptocurrency fund, a bold move for the mutual-fund giant that mostly trades in traditional stocks and bonds. The actively managed exchange-traded fund would invest in a “diversified basket of commodity crypto assets,” according to a Wednesday filing. T. Rowe’s managers will aim to beat the FTSE Crypto US Listed Index, which is meant to include the top ten crypto assets by market capitalization. Digital assets have become a major windfall for some of the industry’s largest fund managers, including BlackRock Inc., whose two-year-old spot-Bitcoin ETF now has about $90 billion in client assets. Fidelity Investments’ Bitcoin ETF has about $23 billion. President Donald Trump’s support for cryptocurrencies has driven more finance firms to expand in the market. Earlier this month, CME Group Inc. said it will enable round-the-clock trading of cryptocurrency futures and options from early next year. A spokesperson for T. Rowe said the firm has closely monitored developments in the market and has also developed end-to-end capabilities to trade digital assets. The company didn’t disclose a fee on its new fund, which is subject to regulatory approval. “This is all about crypto moving onto the traditional rails of asset management,” said Todd Sohn, a senior ETF strategist at Strategas. Related:10 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Oct. 21, 2025) For T. Rowe — which oversees $1.8 trillion — the ETF is another push from the firm to lure in more money after struggling with client redemptions from its actively managed stock and bond funds. The Baltimore-based firm has also been trying to expand in other asset classes with deals and new products. In 2021, T. Rowe bought private credit firm Oak Hill Advisors. This year, the company partnered with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to sell private-market products to retail investors.

Ever since AI supplanted crypto as the shiny new toy in Silicon Valley, there’s been no shortage of jokes about workers jumping ship. New data from prominent venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (commonly referred to as a16z) shows that the truth is more complicated. In its annual state of crypto report released on Wednesday, a16z found that since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, around 1,000 workers left the crypto industry for AI startups. But, in that same time period, blockchain companies gained the same number of employees from other industries, including traditional finance and tech. “People forget that the collapse of FTX and the launch of ChatGPT were less than a month apart”, said Daren Matsuoka, a partner on the crypto investment team at a16z, in an interview with Fortune. “There was a period of time in the crypto industry where it was looking very negative for crypto and very promising for AI.” Today, the outlook for crypto is markedly different than it was in late 2022. AI continues to drive record investment, but crypto has mounted a comeback. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies in circulation has surpassed $4 trillion, and Bitcoin’s value hit new all-time highs this year. The resurgence comes as the Trump administration embraced the sector, pushing for a regulatory thaw and championing legislation in Congress to establish oversight for stablecoins and exchanges. Top financial institutions like JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Fidelity are all expanding their crypto offerings. In its report, a16z found that workers coming into the crypto industry are tending to join from a traditional finance and consulting background, or from emerging fintech companies, another sign that the line is blurring between traditional finance and crypto. “We started doing this report four years ago, when crypto was in its teenage years,” Matsuoka added. “But now the world takes crypto seriously… the industry just got a lot more mature.” This year’s crypto annual crypto report is the fourth of its kind to be published by a16z, which spun out its crypto arm in 2018. Following the spin-off, the entity known as a16z crypto raised staggering funds during an earlier boom era for blockchain, including a $2.2 billion vehicle in 2021 and a $4.5 billion fund in 2022. Led by Chris Dixon, a16z crypto has invested in top startups such as Worldcoin, Uniswap, and Phantom. While the soaring AI industry has dominated tech headlines, a16z crypto’s new report shows that crypto users’ desire for privacy is becoming more pronounced. The firm cites Google searches related to crypto privacy surging in 2025. “It’s a common trope in the industry for people to say users don’t really care about privacy”, said Eddy Lazzarin, a16z crypto’s chief technology officer, in an interview with Fortune. “I personally don’t think that that’s true. I think that people either do or will care.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Banks once shunned crypto custody; now they’re racing to tokenize trillions in cash and securities. The quiet rebuild is underway, and it’s happening inside the balance sheets of Goldman, Citi, and BlackRock. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Wall Street’s biggest balance sheets are quietly rebuilding the crypto stack under the banner of tokenization and custody. What began as a defensive stance toward digital assets is turning into an infrastructure shift: bringing fund administration, cash management, and settlement onto blockchain rails that look more like BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirect platform than a typical crypto exchange. Since late summer, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have taken tokenized money market funds live, Citi has positioned itself as a tokenization agent and custodian on Switzerland’s SDX exchange, and BlackRock has doubled down on the thesis that tokenized funds will eventually sit beside ETFs as a core product line. In the span of a few months, tokenized treasuries have become an $8.3 billion asset class. Broader real-world assets (RWAs) now range between $24 and $30 billion. Yet the real contest isn’t in the numbers; it’s in who will custody the next $100 billion of digital paper and how those assets connect to traditional balance sheets. The first wave of bank entries shows a clear pattern. Goldman and BNY chose the least volatile and most systemically relevant asset they could: money market funds. Money market funds are among the safest and most liquid investment vehicles in traditional finance. They hold short-term government and corporate debt, giving institutions a way to park cash while earning modest yields with minimal risk. Tokenizing them turns those holdings into digital units that can be transferred instantly and settled 24 hours a day. For large institutions, the benefit is not speculative but operational: corporate treasurers can move cash faster, pledge assets as collateral, and reduce the frictions that come with banking cut-off times. Citi’s strategy moves in parallel through private markets. By joining SDX, Citi now provides custody and tokenization services for regulated digital securities, acting as the back-end for issuers experimenting with tokenized bonds or shares. The structure resembles traditional custody, but settlement happens atomically, meaning payment and asset transfer occur simultaneously without intermediaries. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund demonstrates how this can scale. The fund holds tokenized Treasury bills and represents them as programmable tokens. Its assets have grown more than eightfold in 18 months. With total assets at $13.5 trillion and nearly $100 billion of crypto-linked funds, BlackRock has the reach to turn tokenized products into standard portfolio components for institutions. If the early 2020s were about crypto custodians learning compliance, the mid-2020s are about banks learning blockchain. The players are different, but the economics are familiar. Coinbase, Fidelity, and BNY already charge custody fees of roughly 0.05% to 0.15% of the value they hold, depending on client size and risk profile. As tokenized cash and securities become mainstream, these percentages start to resemble the fees charged in fund administration and collateral management, creating an overlap that did not exist before. In this version of tokenization, the appeal is not headline innovation but efficiency. A tokenized Treasury or fund share can move instantly between accounts and settle in real time, cutting costs for both clients and custodians. The conservative outlook for this market sees tokenized Treasuries hovering between $6 billion and $8 billion if regulation slows and yields fall. A middle-ground projection expects around $10-15 billion by mid-2026 as more banks integrate money-market products. The optimistic scenario reaches $25-40 billion if tokenized cash accounts tied to ETFs take off and if banks start testing repo markets for tokenized collateral. Repos are the backbone of short-term lending in finance. Banks lend cash in exchange for safe collateral such as Treasuries, agreeing to reverse the trade later. Tokenized repos would allow these transactions to settle automatically on a blockchain, reducing the operational delays and counterparty risk that currently require expensive intermediaries. That collateral link is what turns tokenization from a bookkeeping experiment into real financial plumbing. Goldman and BNY’s tokenized money-market shares already move within closed, permissioned environments. The next question is whether those tokens can move across custodians safely. The joint Project Guardian initiative between the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and Singapore’s Monetary Authority is testing that exact idea: shared standards for verifying compliance across public and private blockchains. If the project succeeds, 2026 could bring the first bank-to-bank repo transactions executed entirely with tokenized assets. Today’s systems still operate inside walled gardens. Networks such as Goldman’s GS DAP, SDX, and JPMorgan’s Onyx offer efficiency at the cost of interoperability. Regulators prefer this model because every participant is known and verified, but financial institutions are beginning to explore how permissioned systems might connect to public networks through cryptographic proofs that preserve compliance. If that link is established, custody fees could expand toward $300–600 million in annual revenue, assuming tokenized cash and Treasury products reach $25–40 billion in assets and charge service fees near 0.1–0.15%. Regulation will decide how fast this happens. In Europe, MiCA has introduced uniform rules for custodians and crypto-asset service providers, known as CASPs. These rules define how digital assets must be segregated, safeguarded, and reported, allowing banks to passport tokenized funds across the European Economic Area without facing different national requirements. The UK and Singapore are building similar frameworks through Project Guardian to standardize tokenization in asset and wealth management. In the US, the obstacle is accounting treatment. Under the now-revised Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, or SAB 121, banks holding crypto for clients had to record those assets on their balance sheets as liabilities. That made large-scale custody uneconomical for systemically important banks, also known as G-SIBs. If future guidance removes that burden, these banks could hold tokenized assets without incurring punitive capital requirements, unlocking the full balance-sheet potential of tokenization. Until then, the firms already embedded in ETF custody, Coinbase, Fidelity, and BNY, retain a practical advantage. Coinbase’s $246 billion in assets under custody shows how much flow still runs through crypto-native infrastructure. Yet the gravitational pull of regulated fund structures is increasing. As tokenized Treasuries and money-market products scale, the operational logic of banking begins to merge with blockchain’s settlement mechanics. Money-market tokens may sound like plumbing, but plumbing determines who controls the flow of funds. In this race, the flow is not just digital assets but the future structure of the balance sheet itself.

Pump it up, Until you can feel it When we think about ETFs, we tend to think about large, cheap passive indexes. After all, those are the biggest ETFs from places like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. But when we look at all the new ETF launches, they tend to not be passive indexes, not be cheap, and not come necessarily from those three big companies. They’re active and they are involved in all sorts of different areas, that are off the beaten path. To figure out what this means for you and your portfolio, let’s bring to figure out what this means for your portfolio. Let’s bring in Dave Nadig. He is the President and Director of Research at ETF.com and an ETF structural expert, really since the inception of the entire sector. Dave, we’ve seen an explosion in the growth of not just new ETFs, but primarily active ETFs in all sorts of niches. What are you seeing in this space? Dave Nadig: Well, you know, for a long time ETF meant cheap index, right? I mean you go back to SPY and then the first iShares products, and then even when we started getting into the big expansion of the two thousands, it was all just index, index, index. Then we got some smart beta where we tried to be a little bit more clever and it wasn’t really until the late 2010 cycle where Kathy Wood at Ark Invest, launched ARKK and really put herself out there as the portfolio manager in a way that I don’t really frankly remember seeing since the dot-com boom, right? It’s been a long time since we’d had superstar managers on CNBC talking about, you know, pounding the table for a single stock. And Kathy did that and obviously had enormous amounts of success, has had some performance hiccups along the way, but that sort of went a little bit dormant during some of the pandemic when people really discovered trading. What we’ve seen now is this resurgence – particularly to folks I’d mentioned Dan Ives Wedbush, people know him; and Tom Lee from Fundstrat with his Granny Shots ETF, both of which have pulled in huge money, Barry Ritholtz: Billions of dollars? Dave Nadig: Billions and billions of dollars. And for the reasons you would expect because you’ve got smart people talking on podcasts and TV and on their own air and their own newsletters telling you why they own what’s in the fund. I know that sounds so dumb, but that’s why people love superstar managers because they can look and they can see Tom Lee on screen and he can sit there and say, yeah, this is why we like Bitcoin here. Here are the three firms we have in our fund because of it. We might be wrong, we might be right. There’s a level of authenticity to that that I think is really appreciated. I also think the fact that they’ve doubled the S&P this year doesn’t hurt. Barry Ritholtz: So to put some flesh on the bones here, Kathy Woods during 2020 was a huge Tesla and Bitcoin bull. The fund arc put up giant numbers, triple digit gains. Dan Ives has been an apple and an Nvidia bull, pretty much for as long as I can remember. He’s been a whole lot more right than wrong, and Tom Lee has been very constructive exactly when it paid to be constructive and stay bullish. All three of those managers have really big followings. What does the resurgence of brand name active managers mean for the ETF space? Dave Nadig: Well, first of all, I think it’s great for the ETF space because I think the dichotomy that we’d had where people thought of active as being a thing that happens somewhere else and ETFs were only passive, wasn’t helpful. I think we are moving towards a world where all of your exposures, for the most part are gonna be in an ETF wrapper. So by all means we should get active managers as part of this mix. And now we’ve got lots of them. You know, we’ve got a bunch of active funds from PIMCO was early, we’ve got lots in the bond space. You know, everything from Cumberland advisors to State Street with the double line and, and Jeff Gundlach. Lots of active managers in lots of different areas. I think that’s very healthy for the industry. For the individual investor, it doesn’t necessarily make your life easier because as much as I happen to, like all the people we have talked about, Dan, Dom Lee and Kathy – personally as people I would have dinner with, the math is not on their side as an industry, right? Barry Ritholtz: Why is that? Dave Nadig: As an industry, we have to point out active managers categorically underperform over time. Doesn’t mean they all do, but it means that you’ve gotta be the special person who managed to pick the right active manager at the right time. That is a tough business and even the active managers running these funds will tell you trying to time when to get in and out of their own funds is gonna be tough. So that’s the problem is that active management is tough to evaluate. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, and to put some numbers there, half of all active managers underperform in any given year. You go out to 10, five years, it’s 80% underperform; at 10 years it’s 90%. So it’s a tough road to hoe But let’s talk about what makes active ETFs somewhat different than active mutual funds. And that data I referenced where all mutual fund data, mutual funds have to do a regular filing each quarter about their largest holdings, there has been a lot of back and forth about how transparent active ETFs have to be versus other active funds. What’s the state-of-the-art today? What is the regulatory environment? Dave Nadig: So there are solutions if you’re an active manager and you don’t want to tell everybody what you’re doing every day. There are solutions and there’s plenty of funds that have been launched on them. Fidelity has their versions. T Rowe Price has been one of the more successful funds out there. They have a pretty popular blue chip strategy called T Chip, which isn’t semi-transparent, meaning they’re not telling you the whole portfolio every day. They’re telling you once in a while and they’re giving the street just enough information to make a good market, not knowing all the information. So it’s sort of a, a clue, a bit of a hack to be semi-transparent. This solves a problem for some asset managers. It doesn’t solve a single problem for an individual investor, right? So like I’ve never heard an individual investor say, golly, I wish I knew less about what I owned. Right? Barry Ritholtz: Let’s talk about why it’s a problem for fund managers. Fund managers don’t buy a stock on a Monday and then they’re done. If they say, “Hey, we like XYZ, they’re buying that stock trying to take advantage of drawdowns buying it over days, weeks, even months. So there is a price advantage to the investor if the fund manager can be a little less transparent. Fair, fair description. Dave Nadig: That’s the, that’s certainly the argument that the active management industry who does not wanna disclose what they’re doing would give you. So you have articulated that side of the argument. Well, my counter to that would be if your strategy requires you buying securities where your action is going to move the market absent disclosure or absent, you know, obfuscation, then that strategy probably doesn’t belong in an ETF because you’ve got bigger problems, right? That means that you are in something small or a liquid or micro cap, at which point already, my question would be how do you plan on running a $10 billion ETF with that strategy? Because you can’t really close an ETF. So if you are a special situations manager, if you are a really sort of obscure nichey finding those stocks, nobody else knows about manager, you do not belong in the ETF industry. I’ll just flat out say it as simple as that. The mutual fund structure or even better, a liquidity cap structure like a CEF or an interval fund is actually a better structure for those kinds of investments. Everybody else, CEF, honestly there’s so much liquidity. I think it’s tough to argue that somebody like Tom Lee is being particularly hurt by being transparent. He’s double, he’s at 30% for the year. The S&P500 is up 15% Barry Ritholtz: CEF stands for closed end funds as opposed to ETFs. Dave Nadig: Yes. Barry Ritholtz: So, let’s talk about some other varieties of active funds that are a little bit out there. We see funds with options, futures, derivatives, inverse leveraged, and along with some wild income promises in an ETF wrapper. Tell us about some of those products. Dave Nadig: Yeah, the, the interesting thing about those is most of them are very mechanical, right? So if you’re running a leveraged strategy, you’re not making any decisions, right? I’ve got Apple, I need 2X Apple, I’m gonna go to my swap counterparty overnight and they’re just gonna settle up my two x swap. That’s the whole management process. But technically that’s gonna be an actively managed fund because you can’t just automate that whole process. Somebody still has to make a call about whether or not you’re teeing up the swap at this rate or that rate. Same thing with almost anything in the option space, because the options are constantly changing and constantly repricing and constantly rolling off. It’s very difficult to create solid index product around actively or high frequency moving positions in the options market. So for convenience as much as anything, almost all of those type products you mentioned are listed as active products. I refer to them as AiNOs — Active in Name Only, because they’re really, there’s no Tom Lee saying I really want Apple options today. There’s some guy generally Jay, pastor Elliot at title, sitting on a desk somewhere pushing a button to say yes, we want those options because the model says we need to roll. And that becomes active management. And consequently, I mean it is active management, it has higher costs associated with it for a reason. Some of that is the profit that the issuer wants, but some of it is legitimately you need a trading desk with a bunch of people doing work. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about another niche. Illiquid alts, things like private equity, private credit, private debt, real estate. Are we gonna see those asset classes that really don’t trade on their own — because they’re not public – are we gonna see those in an ETF wrapper? Dave Nadig: We’re starting to, we’re starting to the, the canary in the coal mine here was some products from State Street, the big ones, priv, PRIV for private, which has a bunch of Apollo private credit in it. Generally pretty short maturity stuff, two, three year kind of things and, and fairly straightforward, understandable private credit. Intel needs to bill a fab in Ireland. They go get a loan, Apollo gives ’em the loan, you get a slice of it. Nothing super complicated, nothing super interesting either. I mean, it’s not, you’re not getting 20% yields out of or anything like that. You’re getting some marginal increase in the yield you would get if you were simply investing in say, junk or short term co corporates. So those products are starting to come to market. The concerns I have about them is they’re just gonna be untested. We’re not gonna really know how they’re going to perform when the markets go hinky, right? And, and also what does that even mean? Like if we had a corporate bond blowout and we saw a bunch of triple C stuff start defaulting, I have no idea what the impact on Apollo private credit issued in Ireland to Intel is going to be when that happens. I also have no idea how they’re gonna respond if half the fund decides they want out on that Tuesday and now you’ve got a bunch of illiquid stuff, which can be up to 35% of the portfolio that literally the only buyer is Apollo. Technically they’ve got answers to all those questions. I’m, and I read all the answers to those questions and I’m sort of not convinced, but it’s one of those things that if you wanna be, if you wanna be out there on the edge, by all means go ahead. But I think the private securities in the daily liquid vehicle has not really been through the ringer yet, so I remain very skeptical. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk a little bit about crypto and, and how that’s going to impact in both investor behavior and portfolio construction. Last year, BlackRock, was it last year or this year, BlackRock introduced IBIT. 2024. So it’s a year ago coming up on a 100 billion dollars in assets, probably the fastest ETF ever to do that. What does this mean? And explain the concept of tokenization. Dave Nadig: Yeah, so what it means is all of these assets are going to be more and more available to the average Joe like us who’s just trading in their Schwab account or something like that. And because the SEC has said they’re gonna make it very easy very soon, we’re gonna have every major coin that people know about a Solana and Avay whatever. There’ll be a sleeve of that in an ETF that you’ll be able to trade. That’s all great. Then having those building blocks is awesome, also because it will now allow portfolio managers to create portfolios of those individual securities, which right now you can’t even do, you can’t even buy an index right, of the top 10 coins because there isn’t a target for the top 10 coins to invest in. So that will be fun when we get that, and I suspect you’ll see firms like Bitwise and BlackRock who’ve got some real bonafides in the crypto management space, start bringing pretty institutional active management products there. That’s probably a 2026 side. Long term though, if we wanna talk 10 years from now, that’s when crypto starts becoming an interesting competitor to the ETF space. I think we will eventually end up in a world where how you move your ownership of Apple around is going to happen. Not by going to the New York Stock Exchange and exchanging ledger entries to move around your Schwab account. Instead, you’re gonna have an actual token. You’ll be able to look at the serial number of it, you’ll be able to put it in a wallet and say, “Oh no, this is worth a hundred shares of Apple.” And that wallet will be able to directly move that security to your wallet without any exchange being part of the process. Most of it will happen, like crypto happens now on giant exchanges because price discovery. But just like with Bitcoin, I could walk up to you when we could engage in a direct transaction, you’re gonna start seeing that with other securities. It’s happening more in bonds and real estate now. To do it in equities is gonna require some actual legislation and we don’t make so many laws these days. So that may take some time. Instead, what we’ll do is we’ll wrap a lot of stuff. So you, you’ll probably hear about things like Wrapped Apple and wrapped Cisco and what that’s gonna be is a token that owns the security in some sort of trust pool. That’s a baby step, but that’s what we’ll start hearing first. So be skeptical when people say we’re tokenizing everything ’cause it’s gonna be a decade. Barry Ritholtz: I had a conversation with Jose Minyana who is the head of wealth strategies at investment Giant BNY (Bank in New York) and he was saying, Hey, we went from T+3 to T+1, meaning it used to take three days to settle a trade. Today it’s gonna take one day. If we wanna get to T+0, we have to really have confidence in both sides of the transaction. And theoretically, tokenization solves that problem. Dave Nadig: It does. Although think about how many big transactions in the world that we could be doing easier. We deliberately put breaks on, think about buying a house… Barry Ritholtz: Wiring money?! Dave Nadig: BarryRight? So it, there’s, you know, the, there’s escrow, there’s secondary inspection processes, there’s separate contracts around just the intention to buy and sell. So the bigger and more interesting a transaction gets, the less T zero is actually a good idea, right? I mean, I, the, the thing I always say about T zero is, did you really want T zero during the flash crash in 2010? Like, did you really want no recourse for that? That fat fingered billion dollar pennies on the dollar trade? No. You wanted this ecosystem that protects you from a bad actor spoofing something into the system. So we we’re gonna have a lot to evaluate as a market, what we actually want. The idea of slowing down markets has actually gotten a lot of traction, like speed bump markets, things like that, that, that are actually pushing against this idea of instantaneous settlement for anything. I don’t even want instantaneous settlement for my bank account. I like knowing that I’ve got somebody I can call when something goes wrong. Barry Ritholtz: So, so you’ve written about volatility and liquidity laundering. Explain what this is and are these really gonna be ETFs? Dave Nadig: They already are, man. So volatility laundering is simply moving volatility from one bucket to another and charging something for the privilege of doing that. Right Now you can buy something like MSTY, which will give you a hundred percent income return on a MicroStrategy position through the magic of options, right? And it creates a synthetic long position. Then it does a synthetic covered call against the synthetic long position, and then it does a whole lot of return of capital to give you your money back and promises you this endless stream of high distributions, a high percentage distributions that is volatility laundering. Because what you are actually doing is you are trying to sell other people the volatility of MicroStrategy, which is probably not a fantastic idea because it, the vol of all is high in those cases. So you are being the person picking up the, in this case, quarters in front of the steamroll, not the pennies, but you’re still exposed to MicroStrategy collapsing and going to nothing. That volatility laundering is what all of these options strategies are really doing. Barry Ritholtz: So really to wrap this up, the bottom line is bring the same level of common sense and scrutiny to new ETFs that you would to any financial product. Make sure you understand what the product is, how it generates gains, the sort of risks you’re incurring, especially with these exotic products — And the costs. Are these products worth spending 75, 100, 125 basis points more than what you would get for a plain vanilla passive index that seems to be dominating the asset allocation space and the space for ETFs?

Title: U.K.’s FCA sues Justin Sun-linked exchange for unlawful promotions
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/u-k-s-fca-sues-justin-sun-linked-exchange-for-unlawful-promotions/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T18:50:29Z
Full Content:
The FCA has taken legal action against HTX, formerly Huobi Global, alleging it unlawfully promoted crypto services to UK consumers. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority is accusing Justin Sun-linked exchange HTX of promoting crypto services without proper authorization. The lawsuit demonstrates a welcome of regulated products, while cracking down on offshore exchanges that violate promotion laws. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority [FCA] has filed a civil lawsuit against crypto exchange HTX, formerly Huobi Global. It accused it of unlawfully marketing digital-asset services to U.K. consumers without authorization. The case, lodged in London’s High Court, targets HTX. Also, it targets its predecessor entity Huobi Global, and four unnamed individuals connected to the exchange’s promotional operations. The FCA stated that the exchange breached the country’s financial promotions regime by offering crypto services without meeting requirements. The FCA stated, according to a Financial Times report, that firms operating outside the U.K. but promoting crypto services to British consumers are still subject to the U.K.’s financial promotion rules. “We will not hesitate to act where firms flout the law or put UK investors at risk,” an FCA spokesperson told reporters. HTX already appears on the FCA’s warning list, which alerts the public to firms “not authorized and likely to be operating illegally.” Market observers are describing the new case as a test of jurisdiction for U.K. authorities seeking to rein in global exchanges marketing to domestic users. The lawsuit adds to a growing list of legal challenges linked to Justin Sun, HTX’s de facto owner and founder of the Tron Network. In March 2023, the U.S. SEC charged Sun and the Tron Foundation for allegedly selling unregistered securities and orchestrating wash trades in TRX and BTT. That case remains open, although court filings indicate that both parties are exploring a potential settlement. Sun has also faced scrutiny over governance concerns, with reports alleging he controls the majority of TRX’s circulating supply. The U.K. action could widen regulatory pressure on Sun-associated firms. HTX’s integration with Tron-based assets and Sun’s recent efforts to expand HTX’s global footprint have kept his empire in regulators’ crosshairs. The lawsuit comes amid sweeping regulatory changes in the U.K. Earlier this month, the U.K. lifted its ban on retail access to crypto exchange-traded products [ETPs]. This allows Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs from firms such as BlackRock and WisdomTree to list on the London Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is preparing new stablecoin rules, signalling a broader tightening of oversight even as the country opens to institutional crypto investment.

Title: Hollywood’s Next Financier: You

You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Hollywood has hit a breaking point. Audiences are fatigued by franchise sequels and reboots. YouTube has overtaken Disney as the world’s largest distributor. And Gen AI tools like Sora 2 can soon turn anyone into a filmmaker. Yet one thing hasn’t changed: how films get financed. And that’s why we keep getting fewer original films. Decline of original screenplays at the US box office (1984-2023) Source: The Numbers and Box Office Mojo For decades, filmmakers have had only two ways to raise capital: courting wealthy “patrons of the arts” or signing away IP in restrictive studio deals. These small circles still control who the next David Lynch will be, or which film becomes the next Napoleon Dynamite, while everyday fans — the people who live and breathe these films — have never had a seat at the table. (Fewer than 1% of Americans meet SEC “accreditation” standards to invest in most private ventures, including film.) That’s finally changing, thanks to tokenization. The promise of "decentralization in film” has arrived, quietly and legally this time. A few years ago, “Web3 Film” had the right dream but the wrong tools: people were slicing films into NFT frames, touting complex tokenomics and skirting securities laws. None of it worked. Projects like Stoner Cats, Ashton Kutcher’s NFT cartoon, became cautionary tales after the SEC cracked down for selling unregistered securities to unaccredited investors. Today, the difference is compliance. Through licensed platforms operating under SEC exemptions such as Reg CF, production companies can take on thousands of unaccredited investors (even in the U.S.) to back real film projects and share in the upside. Security tokens issued on blockchain rails make it possible to distribute dividends transparently and cost-effectively — and, eventually, trade investors’ stakes on secondary markets. And it’s already working. Tens of thousands of investors have contributed more than $30 million to premium productions from some of Hollywood’s most respected names. This year, Robert Rodriguez (Sin City, Spy Kids) raised $2 million from 2,000 fans to invest in new action films — and every investor got to pitch him a film as part of the slate. Pressman Film — the company behind American Psycho, Wall Street and The Crow — raised $2 million for a slate of bold, original films, and is already starting to return capital within six months. And Eli Roth (Hostel, Inglorious Basterds) launched a fan-owned horror studio that maxed out its $5 million Reg CF campaign in July. He was tired of studios deeming his ideas too gory, even though the most profitable film of 2024 was the unrated slasher, Terrifier 3. Tokenized fan investing is opening up new paths for capital and creativity. Filmmakers can now tap their audiences for capital instead of taking the studio deal, allowing them to retain more ownership of their IP and take creative risks without interference from the suits or the algorithm. For fans, tokenization opens up access to a previously inaccessible opportunity: investing in film as an alternative asset class. Ultimately, these projects tend to perform better — not just creatively but financially — as audiences with skin in the game drive buzz and box-office returns. The timing couldn’t be better. With IPOs slowing and private markets swelling, tokenization is unlocking billions in household capital and opening doors to previously gatekept opportunities across private credit, venture capital and now, film. The GENIUS Act has brought long-awaited regulatory clarity to digital assets, while institutions from BlackRock to Visa are embedding blockchain infrastructure into the mainstream economy. Tokenization has quietly graduated from crypto casino to financial plumbing, and entertainment is proving to be one of its most relatable (and needed) use cases. There may be no better Trojan horse for mainstream adoption of tokenization than culture real-world assets (RWAs). Few industries are as ripe for disruption as film, and none as universally relatable, considering nearly all of us end our day watching Netflix (and then complain about the content). But when the audience can invest in the projects they want to see, whether from established filmmakers or up-and-coming creators, we won’t just get new financing models. We’ll get better movies.

Title: Andreessen Horowitz Says Crypto Has Entered a ‘New Era’ of Real Utility
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/22/andreessen-horowitz-says-crypto-has-entered-a-new-era-of-real-utility
Time Published: 2025-10-22T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Crypto’s future is starting to look more like a global financial system and less like a speculative playground, according to Andreessen Horowitz. In its State of Crypto 2025 report, a16z analysts argue that the industry has entered a new era shaped by infrastructure upgrades, regulatory clarity and deeper ties with traditional finance. Among the most important trends for the coming year: stablecoin growth, real-world assets moving onchain, and new intersections with artificial intelligence (AI). Stablecoins, which enable fast and cheap dollar transfers, are seeing wide adoption from institutions like Visa, Citi and PayPal. Visa said it sees strong demand in volatile emerging markets and cross-border payments. According to a16z, stablecoins handled $46 trillion in transactions over the past year — more than double PayPal — and now rival major networks like ACH and Visa. They’re also becoming major U.S. Treasury holders, surpassing countries like South Korea and Germany. As regulatory efforts in the U.S. gain traction, stablecoins could strengthen the dollar’s global position. Legislation around market structure is expected to be a top priority in 2025, giving companies a clearer framework to launch products and onboard users. Institutional momentum is picking up too. BlackRock and JPMorgan are building crypto partnerships, while Morgan Stanley plans to offer crypto trading on E*TRADE starting at the beginning of 2025. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for bitcoin BTC$111,166.51 and ethereum ETH$3,958.78 now hold over $175 billion combined, signaling a shift from fringe asset to portfolio staple. Meanwhile, a quiet infrastructure revolution is underway. Ethereum upgrades and the rise of Solana have pushed blockchain transaction speeds to over 3,400 per second — closing in on the scale of credit card networks. These technical improvements, along with new privacy tools like zero-knowledge proofs and preparations for quantum-resistant encryption, are making blockchains more usable and secure. Real-world assets such as U.S. Treasuries, commodities and equity instruments are beginning to move onchain, with $30 billion already tokenized. This shift could rewire how capital markets operate by creating more efficient settlement layers and round-the-clock liquidity. AI is also becoming part of the equation. Developers are exploring how crypto tools like decentralized infrastructure and smart contracts can check the growing concentration of power in big tech's hands. Though crypto has lost some engineering talent to AI startups, it's also pulling new entrants from adjacent industries. Finally, developers are starting to focus more on revenue-generating products. Projects brought in $18 billion last year, and about $4 billion of that flowed directly to tokenholders — hinting at a maturing business model that rewards users and investors alike. As user numbers reach up to 70 million, a16z expects consumer apps to drive the next wave of growth. The report paints a picture of crypto not as a trend but as a long-term platform — one that’s finally finding its footing in the mainstream economy.

Time Published: 2025-10-22T14:48:10Z
Full Content:
Jennie O\u0027Sullivan The jury in the trial of two men accused of the murder of a man whose skeletal remains were found five months after he was first reported missing, has retired to consider its verdicts. Luke Taylor, aged 28, formerly of Cherry Lawn, Blackrock, Cork, and 33-year-old Niall Long, formerly of St Michael's Close, Mahon, Cork, have both pleaded not guilty to the murder of Kieran Quilligan. The murder count which each man denies states that on a date unknown between 1 September 2023 and 29 January 2024, at an unknown location within the State in the District Court area of Cork City he did murder 47-year-old Kieran Quilligan contrary to Common Law. Before the jury began their deliberations this afternoon, Ms Justice Siobhán Lankford told the two women and 10 men that they are dealing with two seperate trials and the verdict in respect of one of the defendants could be different to the verdict on the other, if the jury so decided. Ms Justice Lankford said their verdicts had to be unaminous. She said there are three verdicts open to the jury in respect of each defendant. They can find him guilty of murder, not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, or not guilty of murder. Mr Quilligan was first reported missing on 1 September 2023. His skeletal remains were found on scrub land near Midleton on 29 January 2024, almost five months later. © RTÉ 2025.

After dipping to a yearly low earlier this month, Aptos has staged an impressive comeback, fueled by real-world asset tokenisation and enterprise-grade innovation across its ecosystem. Aptos has outperformed a sluggish crypto market, gaining around 5% in the past 24 hours to trade near $3.32. This sharp rebound follows BlackRock’s expansion of its Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to the Aptos blockchain, a move that has injected $500 million worth of tokenised Treasuries into the network. 🚨 $500M more of @BlackRock's BUIDL just landed on Aptos. This pushes Aptos back into the Top 3 in RWAs, with $1.2B+ tokenized assets on-chain. And now, we're #2 in BUIDL adoption. Institutions are choosing Aptos, the chain to move what matters. pic.twitter.com/vT3jfZYmPb — Aptos (@Aptos) October 21, 2025 The deployment of BUIDL has pushed Aptos into the top tier of real-world asset (RWA) blockchains, sitting just behind Ethereum and zkSync Era. Data shows that more than $1.2 billion in RWAs are now tokenised on Aptos, a milestone that marks growing trust from traditional finance. Notably, BlackRock’s involvement brings not only prestige but also liquidity and credibility to the network. In parallel, Jump Crypto has launched Shelby, a decentralised, high-performance storage layer developed in collaboration with Aptos Labs. Storage is the missing layer. Blockchains run fast. Oracles work. Messages move across chains. But without high performance storage, real execution stays centralized. We're building Shelby with @AptosLabs to fix that.https://t.co/VFtuFRQp4P — Jump Crypto 🔥💃🏻 (@jump_) October 21, 2025 Designed to rival traditional cloud providers such as AWS and Google Cloud, Shelby enables sub-second latency, low-cost reads and writes, and improved scalability. Its architecture reduces redundancy while maintaining high data durability through erasure coding. The new system could become a backbone for decentralised applications that require real-time data access and high-speed processing. By combining Aptos’s parallel execution engine and Move programming language with Shelby’s efficient data design, the two firms aim to create infrastructure suited for enterprise and AI-driven decentralised finance (DeFi). This blend of performance and programmability is helping Aptos carve a niche in a crowded Layer-1 field. As institutional adoption accelerates and on-chain liquidity grows, the Aptos price could continue to benefit from renewed investor confidence. While short-term volatility remains, the network’s long-term fundamentals appear stronger than ever — anchored by innovation, partnerships, and a clear path toward real-world integration. The Aptos price is currently testing resistance near $3.50 after rebounding from a recent low of $2.22. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with moving averages flashing multiple sell alerts, although oscillators remain neutral. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 34, suggesting mild accumulation. If APT breaks above $3.50, it could extend gains toward $3.85. However, failure to maintain current momentum could see the token slip toward $3.00 or even retest its earlier lows. Analysts like Michaël van de Poppe have noted that APT remains at one of its lowest valuations in years, hinting at potential upside if broader market sentiment improves.

Title: Blockbuster $40b AI Investment Is Only 10% of What’s Coming (NVDA, MSFT, META, BLK)

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 AI giants including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle recently announced a $40 billion deal that will help them secure coveted computing capacity for artificial intelligence. The blockbuster data center deal is a big reason why Morgan Stanley estimates that Global AI infrastructure spending is projected to hit $400 billion this year. Some speculate that all of this AI dependency can be risky, however, because if AI stumbles, all major tech stocks could fall simultaneously. Previously, individual companies were affected by performance in their specific sectors, but now many will rise and fall together based on AI sentiment. It’s why so many have compared this moment to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, where enthusiasm for a single technological trend drove valuations beyond reason. Douglas McIntyre: Lee, one of the things we’re seeing in the world of AI is these massive alliances, you know, where different companies form partnerships and everybody brings piece of their expertise to the thing and work together. It’s not always clear who gets what from whom and who put what in, but you’ve got one, you just, you got one that just came out. Lee Jackson: Boy, do I ever, I mean, when you get, okay, and I’m gonna have to, I’m gonna read these off to you, Doug. When you get BlackRock, who’s clearly has more dough than anybody in the world, Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI to all chip in $40 billion to buy aligned data centers. That shows you that the demand for cloud computing and data center storage, and, and retrieval and all of that has got to be, they see it to be exponentially much, much bigger than we can see it right now. Or why would they go in and spend $40 billion to buy this? And I think it’s, I think it’s pretty provocative because it’s, it’s like all four major partners in the industry who have been very happy to just do circular financing is now, we have now deemed it to be that they’re gonna combine to have this capacity for, for cloud computing and, and all the above. But $40 billion is a big chunk of dough even for those kind of major players. And it’s interesting. Will we see more of this? Will we see other data center providers? And there’s big ones, you know, there’s super big ones and, you know, Digital Realty people like that. Will somebody go in and make a big play for them? Or somebody you know of that size and scope. I think it’ll be interesting to see if this expands and there’s more data center purchases, you know, as we head down the road. McIntyre: If you called me up tomorrow and said to me that Microsoft bought Duke Energy there’s, or Constellation, it’s, this is crazy enough now, so that you could actually see a consolidation based on an based on ownership. If I’ve got, if I’ve got the technology and you’ve got the infrastructure, maybe I should just buy you. Jackson: Absolutely. And I don’t think, you know, and as we’ve discussed, you know, you’re not gonna build any small scale nuclear reactors anytime soon. And the approval process, you know, could take forever. Although I’m sure they could help speed it up ’cause we’re gonna need it for the national power grid ’cause we’re gonna need it. But yeah, I think, I think that’s true. And you know, there’s big players like Digital and Equinix and people like that, you know, that have been in the business forever, you know, from, you know, startup, you know. In that industry. And it’s interesting to focus on, well, will they continue to build more or will people continue to consolidate that industry? Because again, the question is, is it getting away from itself as well? Are we building too many data centers? I don’t think so because the demand is just never ending. But boy, it, there’s gonna be a point, I think when, and, and we’ve had this discussion where data center usage and power usage is gonna, there, there’s gonna be an issue here at some point, and that’s why most of these people are trying to desperately to find a way. That’s why they’re building data centers in North Dakota and South Dakota because of the, the big, you know, oil fields up there, and that’s why they’re building them in Texas. That’s why they’re building them out in the Permian and out there. And so it’s like, okay, if we can’t bring the electricity to us, we’ll go to where the gas, the natural gas is, and we’ll build our own. McIntyre: It’s funny, CNBC did a, an article today and it’s, it’s, it’s based on a, a see your own shadow premise. Apparently, the people looking for data centers are shopping around the utilities. So if I’m gonna build a data center, I may call 10 utilities try to. What’s happening is the utilities are now getting confused about how many data centers there might be. Because if, if you call me and it’s just, I’m the one utility and you’re the one person who wants a data center, that’s easy to count, right? One guy called me about one data center, but if I’m the utility and ten data centers around and you say to me, “Do a forecast. I want you to forecast for me how many data centers we’re gonna have to support. It’s like, well, ten guys called me, but if I don’t get any of them? Or what if I get all 10? So there’s a capacity calculation problem that has the chance of me being that you’ll have overbuilding it. It could be that people have phone calls that they think, well, I’ll, I’ll build because I’m gonna get five of the ten. The town over does the same thing. There is a situation, scenario, as they say, where you could have overbuilding based on shadow demand, is they asked me, so it must be that they’ve picked me. Jackson: And the thing that will be interesting to see, if we do overbuild, which typically you know, has happened in the United States for, you name it, what do you do with empty data centers, with racks and racks and racks of servers> McIntyre: When that happens, we’ll just pull out the racks and turn ’em into huge barnyards. Listen, at least we know they have to be close to water for cooling. We know that they’ll get some electricity, so we need to keep the lights on for the cattle. So there’ll be water for the cattle ’cause they’ll be located, they’ll have water and we’ll have some electricity and we can use it. We can use them basically as a huge farm. Jackson: Well, I think this deal is either the beginning of the end or the end of the beginning. You know, I don’t know what it is for the data center wave and, and, and data center building and data center construction, but we’ll find that out soon enough.

Title: The M&A Curse of Warner Bros. Discovery | Analysis

Time Published: 2025-10-22T13:00:00Z

Pro Available to WrapPRO members WBD is officially in play. Can CEO David Zaslav do right by his shareholders after three-plus years of holding a declining stock? Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was undergoing a “strategic review” on Tuesday after the company said it is fielding “unsolicited interest” from “multiple parties” for all or part of its business. Its stock popped 11% on the news. But mergers have generally not been kind to the company that started out as Warner Brothers in 1923, including what history will record as one of the worst mergers ever with AOL Time Warner, whose shareholders lost $2oo billion in the aftermath of that dot-com bubble marriage in the early aughts. That didn’t stop the Ellisons’ billions, which have actually made what would have otherwise been a ho-hum year for M&A in media and entertainment pretty interesting. Through their own new acquisition, Paramount, they set off a steeplechase for Warner Bros. Discovery — either as a whole entertainment conglomerate, or as two separated units in Warner Bros. and Discovery Global. That now begs the question of whether the Ellisons would take yet another crack at buying WBD, or maybe just the Warner Bros. studio and HBO, on a hot streak right now. Or do we see some new deep-pocketed buyers emerge? Paramount reportedly made a $20 a share bid for WBD that was spurned, and then two additional bids under $30 a share according to CNBC, leading to CEO David Zaslav‘s announcement: “After receiving interest from multiple parties, we have initiated a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives to identify the best path forward to unlock the full value of our assets.” But the constituency we aren’t reading too much about here is the WBD shareholders who are sitting on a stock at Tuesday’s close that is still 17% lower than when WBD first started trading on April 11, 2022, after Zaslav engineered his Discovery’s takeover of Warner. That is 17% lower, notably, even with the takeover talk bump to WBD stock from when Paramount’s interest first broke and then the 11% rise on Tuesday. For shareholders, that’s three-plus years of watching your stock go in the opposite direction of where it’s supposed to go. Big shareholders include Vanguard Group and BlackRock on the institutional side, and Condé Nast owners the Newhouse family and cable mogul John Malone on the individual side. (Malone inherited the Warner stock, a big bonus over the downward course where Discovery was headed.) The Ellisons seem suited to shake things up. It feels like their parachuting into Hollywood was all about that, with the bags of cash to make it happen. But now that the “For Sale” sign is officially up at WBD, you’d have to consider Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Comcast or maybe even a consortium of private equity or Saudi backers as potentially interested suitors. On Tuesday, Ted Sarandos left the door open to considering Warner, saying on the earnings call: “We focus on profitable growth and reinvesting in our business, both organically and through selective M&A,” Sarandos said, with an emphasis on selective M&A for effect. Zaslav brought in the big-gun investment bankers to assist with his review, Allen & Co., J.P. Morgan and Evercore. Let’s pause for a minute to consider the math: $12.54 — This was WBD’s closing price on Sept. 10, the day before Bloomberg broke the news that Paramount was preparing a bid. $16.17 — This was WBD’s closing price the next day, showing a 29% bump on a so-called takeover premium. Takeover offers in the media space have been attracting a 20% to 25% premium. If Paramount did indeed offer $20 per share offer, that represents a 59% premium from the $12.54 where WBD was languishing before the takeover news broke. But clearly Zaslav and team are thinking that WBD could see more upside from bringing in other potential buyers to boost a premium for the company. Circling back to those downtrodden WBD shareholders. Bank of America Securities on Tuesday placed a value of $30 per share on WBD ($26 for the Warner Bros. studio, which includes HBO, and $4 for the cable networks side, which includes CNN). So what if a buyer would come in with a $30 a share offer for the whole company? That would be a 48% premium to the current price, and 140% premium to the Sept. 10 closing price. Pretty enticing for a shareholder who’s held on for three years in a downward slide. Zaslav was schooled under the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch when he was starting out at NBC, so don’t underestimate his deal savvy, even though WBD shareholders are feeling like they got stuck with a dud.

Discovery becoming officially up for sale.

Tech Companies Pushing Off Those Exits: Research firm CB Insights reported some interesting data last week as part of its State of Venture Q3’25 Report that shows that tech companies are in less of a rush to strike an exit. “The ability to raise at decacorn ($10 billion and above) valuations while staying private removes the pressure to go public for capital. Companies can now scale to a massive size, hire top talent through liquid secondary markets, and maintain founder control — all without the quarterly earnings pressure or regulatory burdens associated with going public,” CB Insights explains. Average time for tech startups to stay private rose from 12.2 years in 2015 to 15.9 years in 2025. See below. 2. AI Killing Jobs? Not if You Look at This Data: It seems like companies are increasingly bringing people on board who help embed AI into daily operations, but new data dispells the widespread notion that the technology is a job killer. The Economist cites work by Seyed Hosseini and Guy Lichtinger, both doctoral students at Harvard University who have been tracking companies that hired “generative-AI integrators.” The students used AI itself to go through 200 million job postings and found 130,000 such vacancies at 10,600 firms that they called “AI adopters.” See below for the upward trend. When you hear Libby Bush talk about her motivating drive over the years, one that has been rewarded with a senior executive role for partnerships at CAA, it’s hard not to think it came from her days on the soccer pitches and lacrosse fields of her youth outside Philadelphia. She ended up playing Division I lacrosse for the University of Richmond Spiders, a sport she’s still involved with near her home in Pacific Palisades. “I certainly didn’t get promoted because I waited for somebody to recognize my worth. It takes fighting for yourself, asking for things even though you might not feel qualified or you might not feel like you’ve hit the mark completely to deserve it. The worst people can say is no. “It’s a little bit of the fake it til you make it. I never worked for an agency. How did I have the right to start one? But I believed enough in myself, I was willing to take the risk and I was willing to hear the word no as many times as I needed to until I heard the word yes. Holding myself back and not doing it because I didn’t have the qualifications was just never a part of the trajectory for me.” Sure feels like the spark of a competitive athlete is still in there somewhere. Bush, 43, spoke to our TV business reporter Lucas Manfredi for last week’s installment of our Office With a View executive Q&A series about the importance of brands becoming an essential tool for creators to both finance and market their projects across platforms. Bush has been responsible for leading the CAA team behind collaborations between hit series like Netflix’s “Bridgerton” and Flonase and Apple TV+’s “Severance” and State Farm. She’s also worked closely on connecting brands directly with CAA clients through projects like Ariana Grande’s Swarovski ad campaign, the NBC competition series “On Brand With Jimmy Fallon” and Kerry Washington’s YouTube series “Street You Grew Up On.” Bush, whose career has taken her to the NBA, WNBA, Disney and to her own startup agency Tandem Entertainment that CAA later purchased, is aware how important it was to hone her own story if she was going to help creators and brands do the same. “One size does not fit all in this business. There’s a lot of options on how to financially get deals done and creatively tell great stories in entertainment and culture.” Ad Age this year put her on its list of Leading Women, an honor for which some commenters on LinkedIn called her a “badass.” Our favorite part of her interview with Lucas was this career advice: “I would also say I learned a lot about mentorship and mentoring. When you work in really big corporations and you start out young in your career in these big organizations, you realize really quickly that people will continue to grow in their careers and they may end up anywhere. “So to me, it was always about treating everybody — whether they were next to you, below you or above you — the same, and how important it is to collect relationships and nurture them. Your network becomes everything to you in your career. Understanding how to use it and protect it and nurture it is a really big lesson for me throughout those companies.” The PR Guy Who Says The AI Boom Is a Bust, Channels with Peter Kafka podcast What’s Your AI-dentity?

Today’s top news: DraftKings just made its most aggressive move yet outside of sports betting. And it wasn’t into casino, poker, or fantasy. It was into prediction markets. 📌 What Happened DraftKings announced it is acquiring Railbird Technologies, a CFTC-regulated prediction market exchange, and will use it to launch a standalone events trading app called DraftKings Predictions. Railbird comes with what Kalshi and others fought hard for - federal approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to let people trade real-money contracts on real-world outcomes. Now DraftKing’s 6M monthly users will get access to prediction markets (and its $15B company has a shiny new expansion path). DraftKings says the new app will launch “in the coming months” and initially cover non-sports markets - things like finance, pop culture, elections, entertainment, and news. Though sports are very likely to come later (especially in states where DraftKings is currently banned). 🗣️ What Are They Saying “We are excited about the additional opportunity that prediction markets could represent for our business. We believe that Railbird’s team and platform—combined with DraftKings’ scale, trusted brand, and proven expertise in mobile-first products—positions us to win in this incremental space.” - DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement to CNBC “DraftKings acquires prediction market firm Railbird As I shared last week prediction markets are the future for sports wagering Less than a week later you see $DKNG getting involved.” - Rippe, on X “$DKNG is acquiring CFTC-licensed predictions platform Railbird to launch “DraftKings Predictions” a marketplace for trading outcomes in finance, culture & entertainment. It’s a move to tap non-sports states like California & Texas in the coming months.” - Shay Boloor on X 🧠 Why It Matters If prediction markets needed any more validation, they got it here from DraftKings. They have simply become too big to ignore and are now fully crossing over into mainstream betting. There’s also a new battle brewing between two worlds: DraftKings brings three big advantages: They will be a force to be reckoned with in this space. A lot depends on timing here. Someone who is used to betting elections on Polymarket probably won’t switch to DraftKings. But - if DraftKings beats Polymarket to the US market with its new DraftKings Predictions app, it could absolutely steal that average user who knows what prediction markets are / Polymarket is, but doesn’t want to hassle with VPNs. And if DK sports prediction markets have the same liquidity that Kalshi has shown over the past few months, then they could steal significant market share in sports. The bull case is, the entrance of DraftKings into the prediction market sector grows the overall pie and drives weekly volumes even further up and to the right. The bear case - the sector is zero-sum for the near future and any DK share is taken from an existing leader. My gut is, the bull case will prevail for the near future.

Title: Dublin to host Michelin star ceremony – could Ireland be about to get a three-star restaurant?

The Michelin Guide annual ceremony for Britain and Ireland will land in Dublin for the first time in February next year. The selection of an Irish city for the ceremony on February 9th, following Glasgow in 2025, is not just about geography – it’s about signalling that Ireland’s culinary moment is now. At the event in Dublin’s Convention Centre, the Guide will unveil stars, Bibs Gourmands, Green Stars and special awards for “the most talented restaurant teams and chefs from Great Britain and Ireland”. The ceremony will also be livestreamed globally. La Rousse Foods, Musgrave’s premium food service brand, will be official partner. If past years are anything to go by, the Bibs and Green Stars will be teased or quietly announced before the main stars are revealed. In Ireland the speculation about awards is electric. Chapter One in Dublin under Mickael Viljanen and Ross Lewis is viewed as possibly being in line for a third Michelin star. It currently holds two. Liath in Blackrock, Co Dublin, with chef Damien Grey is widely tipped as one to watch – again, rumours suggest a push toward three stars. Dede in Baltimore, Co Cork, helmed by Ahmet Dede and managed by Maria Archer, is also in the conversation for top-tier elevation. For two-star upgrades, names to watch include Lady Anne at Mount Juliet Estate (chef John Kelly) and Adare Manor (chef Mike Tweedie), which is also gearing up to host the Ryder Cup in 2027. Dublin’s incomprehensibly overlooked spots are Library Street Café and Una Mas, both long considered deserving of a first star. The newer challengers – Lena and Comet – may well be poised to make their first splash. Outside Dublin, the Park Hotel Kenmare in Co Kerry under Bryan and Tara Meehan already holds two Michelin Keys for its hotel offering and is undergoing a significant expansion. The owners may well be holding off on chasing a Michelin star for their Landline restaurant, adorned with Seán Scully paintings, until after this upgrade is complete. In a more general sense, hosting the Michelin ceremony in Ireland is symbolic, speaking of recognition and rising ambitions. But hosting isn’t the same as winning. The kitchens still need to deliver. Between now and next February, a few questions are sure to keep buzzing around the Irish restaurant scene. Will Chapter One finally get its third star? Given its pedigree this is internationally accepted as overdue. Will Liath and Dede join the three-star club? It would be a big ask, but the talk is loud. And will there be any surprise entries? We should remember that newcomers often sneak in; we’ll be watching Lena and Comet closely.

Title: How Beyond Meat became the market's latest meme-stock darling

You get out of an "Avengers: Endgame" screening and pop your earbuds in. You like this up-and-coming artist, Billie Eilish, who seems pretty promising. You fire up a new app called TikTok. You can't figure out how it's different from Vine, but everyone seems to be into it. You pop into a local eatery and order one of those new plant-based Beyond Meat burgers that everyone's talking about. The company is valued at $14 billion. It doesn't taste great, but you're told it's the future of food. Fast-forward to the present day. Beyond Meat is worth less than $1 billion, and was a penny stock until very recently. Sales are a fraction of what they were. No, this is not some dystopian reality. The fact is, the competition stacked up against Beyond, and demand for meat alternatives waned. But something has shifted in the stock this week. Shares surged 128% (to $1.47) on Monday, on trading that was roughly 70 times the average. It followed that up on Tuesday with a 146% increase (to $3.62) on even more volume. Then it soared another 65% on Wednesday, bringing the three-day move to more than 800%. What gives? Well, it turns out that a retail investor named Dimitri Semenikhin (screen name: Capybara Stocks) has been buying up all the Beyond shares he can find. He says he now owns about 4% of the company's outstanding stock, and he posted about it on Reddit. Given the fact that Beyond already carried the natural characteristics of a meme stock — a nostalgic brand heavily shorted by institutions — the post was like catnip to Semenikhin's fellow retail traders. Business Insider's Sam O'Brient tracked down Semenikhin — who is based in Dubai — on Monday, while Beyond stock was ripping. He wanted to find out what was motivating him. Why take such a big position in a downtrodden penny stock down more than 80% year to date? Semenikhin provided some fundamental reasons. Key among them was the completion of a convertible note exchange, which he says lessens its previously high risk of bankruptcy and greatly strengthens its balance sheet. He said this was incorrectly viewed by some as a negative. "At the current price that I bought in, the pricing was just way too low for what was happening," he told BI. In a separate interview on Tuesday, he said that he sees the stock soaring another 66% from current levels, to around $6 per share. Semenikhin's undervaluation thesis may very well be true. After all, Beyond on Tuesday announced a collaboration with Walmart that — when combined with the lingering retail rocket fuel, and the stock's addition to a meme-stock ETF — sent shares surging more than 100% for a second straight day. But there's also no denying that Semenikhin is trying to emulate the playbook of Roaring Kitty, the GameStop-obsessed retail investor who was eventually immortalized in his very own movie. It's also clear he's having a similar effect, with Monday's price surge in Beyond defying fundamental logic. There's the regular YouTube posting. There's the Reddit activity (although his original post is now deleted). And there's the unrepentant desire to drive a short squeeze. Will Semenikhin go full Roaring Kitty and start wearing a signature headband? That remains to be seen. But the similarities run deep, and BI will continue to check in with him for updates. Look at that V-shaped bounce! Thanks a lot, Dimitri Semenikhin (and Walmart). Beyond Meat stock is now down just 4% in 2025, compared to the 86% loss through last Thursday's close. The rally has coincided with unprecedented options-trading volume for the stock, and as daily shares traded broke the 1 billion threshold for two straight sessions. The title of this chart from BlackRock Investment Institute says it all: earnings expectations for companies in the S&P 500 are reaccelerating. This is reflected by the upward slope of the orange line, which shows the 12-month change in profit forecasts. This aligns with the guidance we've gotten so far from industry bellwethers during the third-quarter reporting season. On Tuesday alone, General Motors, GE, Lockheed Martin, and RTX raised future earnings forecasts. Culture confidential Business Insider's Will Edwards spotlights a hot trend dominating Wall Street and the finance industry. They make you feel like you're walking on a cloud. You can wear them with a suit or with jeans. They'll earn you street cred with finance bros. The catch? They're $1,100. Zegna's Triple Stitch shoes have unofficially become Wall Street's hottest footwear, exploding in popularity in recent years amid the quiet luxury movement. Apple CEO Tim Cook sports them. CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin told BI he wears them too, and that he sees them everywhere. The Wall Street Journal proclaimed a few years back that they're the most-worn shoes on private jets. But they're not only popular with the uber-rich. Sales associates at multiple Zegna locations in Manhattan said that they have a wide age range of financial industry clients. Are they really worth the hype? Eager to see for myself, I went to the brand's global store on 57th Street in NYC to try on a pair. My review, in short? They're absolutely worth the money. If you're the type of person who is OK with dropping a rent payment on some sneakers, at least. I didn't love their plain look initially, but how they feel on your feet completely changes your perception of them. I'm usually a size 11.5, but the folks at the store said they recommend going a half-size up. They come in 30 different color options — I went with a black and white scheme. They were easily the most comfortable pair of shoes I'd ever worn. After being made a convert, I decided to head out and try to spot a pair of them in the wild. Given that it was rainy, I was doubtful I'd find anyone. But within minutes, as I approached Park Avenue, there was a pair walking right at me. A visitor from Charleston, South Carolina, said he had his custom-made last year and picked up three pairs. "I love them," he said, before asking: "Are you gonna buy a pair?" I'll have to save up first, I told him. Do you own a pair of Zegnas or another quiet luxury item you love?

Title: Why Some Bitcoin Whales Are Converting Their BTC Into Spot ETF Shares: Bloomberg
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/22/why-some-bitcoin-whales-are-converting-their-btc-into-spot-etf-shares-bloomberg

Some large bitcoin holders are moving coins into spot exchange-traded funds through in-kind creations, converting off-platform BTC into brokerage-account assets they can borrow against or include in estate plans, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. The mechanics rest on a summer policy shift. On July 29, 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the decision to approve orders allowing in-kind creations and redemptions for crypto-asset exchange-traded product (ETP) shares, a policy which covers spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs). The agency called the change a break from earlier cash-only approvals for spot bitcoin and ether and an alignment with long-standing practice for commodity ETPs. In practice, the SEC said authorized participants can deliver or receive the underlying asset, rather than cash, when creating or redeeming ETP shares. SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the shift would make products “less costly and more efficient,” while Trading and Markets Director Jamie Selway called it an “important development” that adds flexibility for issuers and investors. Against that backdrop, Bloomberg reported that some whales are handing BTC to ETFs and receiving fund shares without selling, a structure the outlet noted is generally tax-neutral because no sale is recorded. The exposure stays the same, but it appears in a brokerage account where it can be pledged as collateral or folded into estate planning, Bloomberg said. Activity is already visible, Bloomberg reported. BlackRock has facilitated more than $3 billion of such conversions, its head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick said. Bitwise told Bloomberg it is getting daily inquiries from clients who want holdings reflected on wealth platforms. Galaxy has processed a handful of transactions, Bloomberg added, citing Michael Harvey. Some clients shift only a slice of holdings; a “subset” consolidates entirely because “it’s the easiest way” to hold going forward, Mitchnick told Bloomberg. Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro said there are “benefits of having things in the traditional financial system,” including how clients are serviced by private banks. Banks already play a limited role in facilitating these trades — particularly on creations — even as only non-bank broker-dealers can currently complete the full process, Bloomberg added. Neither BlackRock, Bitwise nor Galaxy immediately responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Title: DWS Transforms $2.5M ESG ETF into Something Much Different
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/industry-news-etf/dws-transforms-2-5m-esg-etf-into-something-much-different/

Asset managers have repurposed sustainable funds amid a pullback from them in the US. This change is more substantial than most. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com It’s not that unusual to change one’s appearance: Just ask all the bros who can’t wait to stop shaving in Movember. But if a fund got a different name, ticker, benchmark and investment process, is it still the same fund, or just a way of seeding a new product? One DWS Xtrackers ETF is having something of an identity crisis, going from a value ESG mandate to being an S&P 100 fund that simply cuts out the biggest names in the index. And that’s after a name change the fund already had earlier this year. On Dec. 19, the Xtrackers S&P 500 Value Scored & Screened ETF (SNPV), which until February had been the S&P 500 Value ESG ETF, will become the S&P 100 Ex Top 20 ETF (XOEX). Whew. It’s common for asset managers to change funds’ names and investment strategies. That has all but been the norm amid a pullback in the US from sustainable and ESG mandates, with many products removing any hint of those labels. The trend was in the opposite direction a few years ago, when seemingly every fund shop wanted in on ESG, and many existing products saw slight modifications to reflect that. This year, however, the Janus Henderson Responsible International Dividend Fund dropped “Responsible” from its name, and the BlackRock Sustainable Balanced Fund scrapped “Sustainable.” Both of those funds backed off from ESG-related goals, according to a Morningstar analysis. Other products, such as the Sprott Critical Materials ETF and Cromwell Foresight Global Infrastructure Fund, had name changes but retained their investment strategies. Assets have been pouring out of US sustainable and ESG-themed products in recent years, and small funds have been closing : The move by DWS to morph its ETF into essentially a different product stands out from the more measured changes many issuers have made in repurposing funds. Nonetheless, SNPV’s metamorphosis won’t affect too many investors, as it represents just $2.5 million in assets. DWS, through a PR firm, declined to comment. However, the fund’s new strategy aligns it somewhat with others this year that have addressed the extreme concentration in market-cap-weighted indexes of just a few companies, like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. What Are Sustainable Investors to Do? Clearly, there are fewer ESG-related funds on the market today than just a few years ago. But investors still have choices, as asset managers dedicated to the space aren’t leaving. “There are big players out there like Parnassus, Calvert, etc., who are starting to offer ETFs. This is a huge shift and helps open the space to investors who want a more tax-friendly approach and lower investment minimums,” said Justin Horowitz, owner of Just Advising, which offers an ethical investing option. “Other mainstream names, like BlackRock, still offer their ESG funds, but it does seem harder to find them through their website nowadays.” Soon, ETF shareholders may opt for proxy policies that could support (or oppose) issues like the $1 trillion Tesla pay package for Elon Musk. Some of the largest S&P 500-based funds lost billions this year as institutional investors sought out cheaper alternatives. The rare earths industry is booming as the materials are used less in electric vehicles and more in AI data centers. Tokenized securities are moving closer to a reality as issuers make plans to bring more assets and funds on-chain. Even with the lights out at the SEC, it’s unlikely that ETF issuers seeking 3x and 5x funds will sail through the approval process. The new VanEck TruSector ETFs invest in stocks and other ETFs to maximize exposure to individual companies and reflect actual market caps. No one knows the future, but high inflation could make some investments virtually worthless. As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. Low-fee products tracking indexes have outperformed their higher-fee ETF counterparts and have raked in assets. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Bitcoin ETFs record $477M in inflows after four days of outflows
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-etfs-record-477m-in-inflows-after-four-days-of-outflows/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T08:16:05Z

Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US registered strong inflows on Tuesday, reversing the previous week’s outflow trend. According to data from Farside Investors, total daily net inflows reached $477.2 million, signalling renewed investor confidence following a period of volatility in the crypto market. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the inflows with $210.9 million, while the Ark & 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) followed with $162.8 million. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also recorded $34.15 million in new investments. The inflows come after several consecutive sessions of net withdrawals across spot crypto ETFs, which collectively lost over $1 billion in recent days as persistent trade tensions between the US and China weighed on investor sentiment. Despite the rebound in inflows, overall trading activity remained elevated. Bitcoin ETFs posted $7.41 billion in total trade volume on Tuesday. Throughout October, daily trading volumes have fluctuated between $5 billion and $9.78 billion — significantly higher than the $2 billion to $4 billion range seen in September. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw renewed investor participation. On Tuesday, the funds collectively attracted $141.6 million in net inflows, according to Farside data. Fidelity’s FETH accounted for the largest portion at $59 million, while additional inflows came from funds operated by BlackRock, Grayscale, and VanEck. The combined rebound across Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs suggests that institutional appetite for crypto exposure remains strong despite recent price corrections. At the time of writing on Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading around $108,500, stabilising after facing resistance the previous day. The cryptocurrency found support near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $106,453, drawn from its April low of $74,508 to its record high of $126,199. BTC rebounded nearly 4% by Monday but later slipped 2% on Tuesday after being rejected from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $113,606. If the downward momentum continues, Bitcoin could revisit support near $106,453. A decisive close below this level may open the door for further declines toward the October 10 low of $102,000. Ethereum (ETH) has also shown signs of weakness, extending its recent correction. After retreating by more than 4% last week from resistance at $4,232, the cryptocurrency continued to slide by another 3% through Tuesday. ETH was trading around $3,847 on Wednesday. Should the downward trend persist, Ethereum may test the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $3,593, which aligns closely with the 200-day EMA — a key area that could determine whether the broader trend remains intact or shifts further bearish.

Title: Reimagined 1970s three-bed apartment in the heart of Ballsbridge for €800,000

One of Dublin 4’s most sought after addresses, Pembroke Road, is a short stroll to cafes and restaurants on Baggot Street Upper and a short walk up the two bridges in either direction on the Grand Canal will take you to local Dart and Luas stops. A 15-minute stroll will have you in the centre of St Stephen’s Green, the Aviva Stadium for rugby internationals and the villages of Ranelagh, Donnybrook and Sandymount, all of which have a great selection of pubs and restaurants. Number 75 Pembroke Road is set well back from the road itself. It originally had an office block to one side, which was replaced in the 1970s with a set of apartments, though is accessed through the original period doorway. Located just off the junction triangle of Northumberland, Lansdowne and Pembroke Roads, it’s as smack bang in the centre of Ballsbridge as you can get. Sharing its site with 30 other units, number 21 Pembroke Court is a second-floor dual aspect apartment that has just been released to the market through estate agent Owen Reilly. It has three bedrooms and a generous 97sq m (1,044sq ft) of floor space that has undergone a recent transformation since its owner purchased the unit in early 2021, for €525,000, according to the Property Price Register. It’s a smashing renovation of a 1970s unit that had little in the way of features until its owners gave it a stylish upgrade: “It was easy to see its potential, even though nothing had been done since the 1970s,” says its owner, adding “you don’t always get the luxury of all-square rooms, with proper windows that overlook a garden, but that, and the location made us buy”. With the help of Belgradian architectural duo Tihomir Dicic and Iva Njunic, the entire space has been reimagined to a superb, spacious three-bedroom contemporary apartment in the heart of one of the most desirable addresses in Dublin. By removing small hallways, the entire unit was opened up to give a lovely internal flow with the benefit of lots of light from large windows, all of which have been replaced with more energy-efficient aluclad units. When the walls were being insulated and upgraded, builders discovered the original brick walls of the period property next door. With advice from the architects that it could be exposed, and though it took “lots of cleaning and sealing” it is now a standout feature in the apartment, which owners have highlighted with the use of smart LED lights in an overhead shadow gap. In fact, thoughtful lighting – as 1970s ceilings are rarely high – was one of the many considerations when this unit was being refurbished. Central to the living space – off the dining and kitchen area – is a modular unit the family sourced from Nordic Elements in Blackrock, which sits so well around the television that you would think it was custom made for the room. Solid oak floors run through the C1-rated apartment, which has a streamlined kitchen with Bosch appliances and the focus on storage at design stage, allows the whole place to be streamlined and clutter free – despite this being home to a family with young children. Its three bedrooms comprise of two doubles and a single, and the family who live here say they were amazed at how the architects managed to rearrange the space to accommodate an en suite and so much storage in their home. Even the bathrooms are luxuriously subtle in a pared back kind of way, with focus on storage and illuminating soft tones from the wood. The owners, who are moving due to a growing family, have loved their time here – especially the garden out front where their children play – and say they live a mostly car-free life due to the location. This unit shows what a 1970s apartment can become with a bit of thought, and is now seeking €800,000 through Owen Reilly.

Share this article BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, acquired $211 million worth of Bitcoin on behalf of clients on Tuesday. The purchase adds to BlackRock’s crypto holdings through its spot Bitcoin ETF, which managed over 800,000 BTC as of mid-October 2025. The acquisition reflects continued institutional demand for Bitcoin amid ongoing market volatility. BlackRock has been consistently purchasing Bitcoin for clients, demonstrating strong institutional interest in crypto assets as part of broader investment strategies. The spot Bitcoin ETF has served as BlackRock’s primary vehicle for providing client exposure to BTC, helping mainstream crypto investments among institutional investors. The firm’s ongoing accumulation strategy represents part of a broader shift of Bitcoin ownership from retail investors to large-scale institutional entities.

Share this article Bitcoin whales executed around $3 billion in ETF trades through BlackRock’s $IBIT, a spot Bitcoin ETF, using portfolio trade mechanisms that offer significant portfolio benefits, Bloomberg reported today. The trades allow large Bitcoin holders to convert their holdings directly into ETF shares through custom creation processes. BlackRock has been facilitating these in-kind creations for $IBIT, enabling Bitcoin whales to seamlessly integrate their holdings into traditional finance portfolios. The structure mirrors portfolio trades commonly used in bond markets, where assets are exchanged directly rather than through cash transactions. The portfolio trade mechanism provides Bitcoin whales with benefits including enhanced liquidity and tax efficiencies. These custom ETF creation methods have gained traction in crypto markets as institutional investors seek regulated investment vehicles for their digital asset holdings. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has seen heightened institutional interest as traditional finance firms adapt to cryptocurrency integrations through ETF structures. The asset management giant has been expanding its crypto offerings in response to evolving investor demands for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

PHOTO: GIC Published Oct 22, 2025, 08:44 AM Updated Oct 22, 2025, 05:57 PM London – Deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds are helping drive a resurgence in dealmaking that has taken global merger and acquisition (M&A) volumes past US$3.5 trillion (S$4.5 trillion) in 2025. The M&A volume is now up 34 per cent this year, putting 2025 on track to be the best year since 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than US$1.3 trillion in transactions were recorded in the third quarter, driven by a few mega deals. State-backed funds from the Middle East and Asia, including Singapore, provided firepower for some of 2025’s biggest transactions. Blackstone and TPG agreed on Oct 21 to acquire medical-device maker Hologic for as much as US$18.3 billion including debt, with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia) and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC taking minority stakes. Last week, BlackRock teamed up with Singapore’s investment company Temasek and MGX, an artificial intelligence investment firm set up by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment, on a US$40 billion deal for Aligned Data Centres. US$40 billion deal for Aligned Data Centres The week before, Carlyle Group partnered with Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) to buy control of BASF’s coatings business in a deal valuing the unit at €7.7 billion (S$11.6 billion). It was only in September that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund agreed to take video-game maker Electronic Arts private in a US$55 billion leveraged buyout – the biggest ever. Sovereign wealth funds have been building out their internal deal teams as they seek to do more direct investments, giving them a chance to profit without having to pay fees to Wall Street. They are among the biggest backers of private equity funds, and have squeezed out concessions that force the buyout firms to give them opportunities to invest alongside them in return for the cash they provide. The funds have been particularly active in tech. In August, private equity giant Thoma Bravo got backing from Adia for its roughly US$12 billion acquisition of human-resource software provider Dayforce. Abu Dhabi’s state-backed MGX has invested in OpenAI at a US$500 billion valuation. It has also backed Mr Elon Musk’s xAI and plans to contribute to US President Donald Trump’s Stargate venture. GIC and QIA have put money into rival AI start-up Anthropic. Rainmakers at the top investment banks said they expect the flurry of takeovers to continue. Goldman Sachs Group is predicting a major ramp-up in dealmaking towards the end of 2025, with a chance that 2026 will be a record year for M&A. Sovereign investors are on the hunt for more deals. Mubadala’s asset management arm is exploring an acquisition of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, the billboard operator with a market value of around US$930 million. And they are looking beyond takeovers, with the Qatari sovereign fund joining a more than US$2 billion fundraising for Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel’s new company, alongside other investors like Apollo Global Management and Ares Management Corporation.

Title: Trump rebukes “young lady” reporter questioning Argentina bailout as farmers rips his beef deal

Time Published: 2025-10-21T18:00:00Z

Rachel Kiley President Donald Trump is facing renewed backlash for his support of Argentina following a tone deaf comment he made about a potential beef trade deal with the country. Trump has been publicly mulling over the possibility of beginning to import beef from Argentina as a way to bring down prices at U.S. grocery stores. “If we buy some beef now—I’m not talking about that much—from Argentina, it would help Argentina, which we consider a very good country, a very good ally,” he said over the weekend. No deal has officially been made as of yet, but even the idea of it is causing an uproar among farmers who already feel betrayed and misled by the allegedly “America First” president. A reporter recently questioned Trump about this backlash, asking, “What do you have to say to U.S. farmers who feel that the deal is benefiting Argentina more than it does them—” “Look, Argentina’s fighting for its life, young lady,” he said, cutting her off. “You don’t know anything about it. They’re fighting for their life.” He went on to claim that “nothing’s benefiting Argentina” and that he wants to “help them survive in a free world,” before letting his true motivation slip. “I happen to like the president of Argentina,” he said. “I think he’s trying to do the best he can. But don’t make it sound like they’re doing great. They’re dying, alright? They’re dying.” The reporter’s identity could not immediately be confirmed. Q: What do you have to say to farmers who feel that the deal is benefitting Argentina more than it is them?TRUMP: Look, Argentina is fighting for its life, young lady. You don’t know anything about it. You understand what that means? They are dying pic.twitter.com/1DMyaHtcTR Trade wars have led to China, previously the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, halting its purchases. Instead, they’re now getting soybeans from Brazil and Argentina. Adding insult to injury, the Trump administration has authorized a $20 billion currency swap for Argentina while U.S. farmers continue to struggle. And Trump himself has repeatedly made it clear that this help is motivated by his ideological allyship with Argentina’s president, Javier Milei. “Just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” he recently said, while warning U.S. financial support for the country would drop if Argentinian politics shift left. Putting this relationship and Argentina’s economy above struggling Americans has angered some farmers, with many worrying that creating a beef deal with Argentina will only exacerbate an already bad situation for rural Americans. “President Trump’s plan to buy beef from Argentina is a betrayal of the American rancher,” Farm Action’s Senior Director of Programs, Christian Lovell, said in a press release. “The U.S. beef industry is dominated by four major meatpackers that control roughly 85% of the market. This consolidation allows them to suppress prices paid to ranchers while keeping consumer prices high. Importing more beef into this rigged system will not lower costs for families or restore fair markets for producers.” As frustrated as farmers may be, there’s been a fair amount of frustration aimed at them from other Americans, as well, considering many of them voted for him despite being warned that it would hurt the economy and their own bottom line. Still, that doesn’t mean people are keen on Trump throwing money at Argentina while gutting American programs—or that anyone was impressed by his condescending response to the reporter who actually asked him about it. The tone of “young lady” here then calling the reporter stupid is quite the combo https://t.co/dC6GDoDXts it’s quite funny that argentina’s current situation is a direct result of Milei’s policy. Farmers: We’re struggling. Trump: Okay, but have you tried being Argentina?MAGA farmers voted for the guy who bankrupted casinos, and they’re shocked he’s bankrupting them too. https://t.co/4Rw1LVBB8c I think the media should be doing a better job of explaining that Argentina is “fighting for it’s life” because they followed right wing policies which caused their economy to collapse. https://t.co/g2sxwYlaKY Why would Trump buy beef from Argentina while US farmers struggle?Maybe it’s because the Trump-connected fund managers at BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco, and his mega-wealthy friends are heavily invested in Argentina.Always follow the money and you’ll find Trump’s corruption. https://t.co/4SM5nFaP4q Just found out that the first A in MAGA stands for Argentina. I could’ve sworn it was America before the election. https://t.co/BuPyMooLKU Make Argentina Great Again! By the way, when is our government opening back up?
