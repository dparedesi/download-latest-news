On a rainy afternoon in May, the 96 members of New York University Grossman School of Medicine, Class of 2025, gathered with their families in Carnegie Hall. They crossed the stage, collected their degrees, and all together recited the Hippocratic oath. But while their graduation into the ranks of medical doctors was the point of the ceremony, in some ways it did not feel like the day’s main event.That belonged to another pair on stage, Dr. Robert Grossman and Ken Langone—graduates of a different sort, who as dean and board chairman respectively were presiding for the 18th and last time over the graduation ceremony. This was their swan song, or maybe something more of a victory lap. Grossman spoke of his hard-fought path to the top of NYU Langone—“I had no sponsors, no mentors, no coaches. No one was there to introduce me to any ‘important’ people or direct my career”—before imparting 15 nuggets of wisdom he had collected. (No. 1: “It doesn’t matter where you come from, it does matter how high you aim.” No. 5: “Depth of knowledge is very important.” No. 14: “Find the right partner.”) His business partner, Langone, gave him a warm embrace and in his own speech, remarked that his association with Grossman was “one of the most rewarding of his life.” The audience was well-disposed to share the spotlight: Thanks to Langone and Grossman, their medical educations had all come tuition-free. And Grossman’s lessons were on point—since they encapsulated the ambition and tenacity that made NYU Langone an enviable success story in American health care. Two decades ago, NYU’s academic medical center was a troubled institution, treading water; today, it’s one of the country’s most efficient providers of high-quality care, with 53,000 employees, roughly $14 billion in revenue—up from $2 billion in 2007—and more than 320 locations. Its innovations in medical-school education—introducing an accelerated three-year curriculum, and that free tuition—have made its programs models for others around the country. NYU Langone has wooed world-leading talent while scaling the ranks of federally funded research hospitals. And while it has taken place in a health care setting, the NYU Langone recovery has been driven by two interlinked factors—a disciplined reliance on data and a relentless culture of accountability—that wouldn’t feel out of place on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley. The turnaround is a source of much pride for the somewhat unlikely pair that presided over it: Grossman, a neuroradiologist who had no formal business training when he became CEO and dean of the medical center in 2007; and Ken Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot who has chaired its board—and given so much time and money to the institution that it now bears his name—since 1999. (Langone, who is also a major Republican donor, later honored Grossman by naming NYU Langone’s two medical schools after him.) It’s a story the two men, 78 and 89 respectively, are eager to tell as they prepare to hand over their roles to carefully selected successors come September 1. NYU Langone granted Fortune access to its executives and inner workings to better understand the organization and its transformation. For a reporter who has written extensively about the nation’s often dysfunctional health system, it was an opportunity to learn what it took for one American health system to succeed—and what others can learn from it. It’s also a time when many hospitals need help—stat. In 2023, 48% of the nation’s rural hospitals operated at a financial loss. More than one-third of them—some 700—were at risk of closure, according to a 2024 report by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. And this year’s cuts to Medicaid and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding have imposed serious turbulence on hospitals of all kinds. NYU Langone has been blessed by geography—headquartered amid the concentrated wealth of midtown Manhattan—and supported, in time and generous donations, by a board that reads like the guest list of a Davos cocktail party. Beyond Langone, and to name just a few, trustees include board co-Chair and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Ken Chenault (former CEO of American Express), and former Goldman Sachs exec and Trump advisor Gary Cohn. Overseers include JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon, billionaire hedge funder Paul Tudor Jones, and David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Brothers. NYU Langone is a non-profit health system, but make no mistake, it’s run like the big business that it is. (By 2024 revenues, it would rank No. 308 on this year’s Fortune 500.) Grossman earned $22.8 million in total compensation in 2023, and its doctors rank among New York’s highest paid—as Tom Murphy, founder and partner at private-equity fund Crestview Partners and another trustee, proudly pointed out to me, “We pay our people well to do a good job.” Many are uncomfortable with the notion of non-profit hospitals operating more like Fortune 500 companies than charity wards. But Ge Bai, a professor of accounting and health policy at Johns Hopkins, says, “That’s the reality nowadays.” She notes that NYU Langone has been uniquely successful in the industry because of its strengths generating patient revenue and controlling expenses. “Their operations are amazing,” Bai adds. $14 billionApproximate revenue for the NYU Langone health system in 2024. You may wonder if NYU Langone is successful simply because it is charging more. But an analysis of Turquoise Health data, showing rates charged by New York’s five large hospital systems for eight frequently performed procedures found that NYU’s prices, on average, ranked second-lowest, behind Mount Sinai. Indeed, the operations are where the learnings are. And while it’s tempting to ask how transferrable lessons from a wealthy, well-connected hospital system can be in other parts of the country, NYU Langone in recent years has expanded into more difficult markets—that is, ones with poorer and sicker patients—generating evidence that its turnaround playbook can work outside of the rarified confines of Manhattan. What then is NYU’s secret sauce, and how can others replicate the formula? Things were not good when Grossman arrived at New York University Medical Center to run the radiology department in 2001. He was days into the role when a pipe burst in his office, leaving a pile of plaster and unsightly debris. It took eight weeks to get someone from the organization to fix it, because no one would take ownership: Was the medical school responsible for the wall, or the hospital? To Grossman, who had come from Penn, the absurd situation symbolized the inefficiency and dysfunction that ailed NYUMC and academic medicine more broadly. When he became dean and CEO in 2007, Grossman vowed to run the school and hospital as a single integrated entity. He also boldly committed to make the institution “world-class”—“an academic medical center competing successfully with the Hopkins, the Harvards and Penns,” he wrote in his investiture speech. Langone, a self-made business titan who, before co-founding Home Depot, had taken Electronic Data Systems public with Ross Perot, shared Grossman’s lofty goals. He had joined the board in 1999 when his friend, Martin Lipton, an M&A attorney and NYU trustee, told Langone he needed help with a mess at the medical center. (A graduate of NYU’s business school, Langone says he didn’t even realize NYU had a medical center.) That mess: a 1998 merger with Mount Sinai that had gone so badly that the hospitals broke up a few years later. By 2003, the combined entity had racked up three straight years of losses, $670 million in debt, and a junk-bond rating. The institution was independent again, but not profitable, when Grossman got promoted in 2007. Langone and Grossman had bonded several years earlier when Grossman, wanting to replace his department’s radiology equipment, had put out a request for proposals. Showing some raw business talent, he negotiated an unthinkably good deal with Siemens: The medtech company agreed to give NYU the technology, plus $100 million for NYU to serve as a showroom. Those terms impressed Langone, who happened to be on the board of General Electric, a losing bidder. That Langone didn’t let that conflict—or his friendship with GE’s then-CEO Jack Welch—interfere with the Siemens deal, meanwhile, impressed Grossman. Over the years, the two have become incredibly close, trading regular phone calls and referring to each other as “brothers from different mothers.” Grossman attributes their kinship to their hardscrabble childhoods and the resilience it fostered. He was a scholarship kid who described his mom to me as “an illegal immigrant.” Langone’s parents, also immigrants, worked as a plumber and a cafeteria worker, and didn’t get schooling beyond junior high. Langone, 11 years Grossman’s senior, plays the gregarious and protective older sibling in the relationship. When I met him at his Park Avenue office, he heaped praise on Grossman—“He’s brilliant…values beyond reproach…this guy could take my job doing deals!” (When it comes to himself, Langone’s prone to absurd self-effacement: “I’m not the brightest bulb,” he tends to say, emphasizing his science education ended in 8th grade.) The big-brother vibe plays out practically too: Grossman, who described Langone as “the best guy in the world,” says he’s a keenly intelligent sounding board, and some extra muscle. “We deal with politicians, and he’s connected, and that’s very important as well.” The board sees the duo’s dynamic as a key to NYU Langone’s success. Murphy describes Grossman as the transformation’s visionary, and Langone as its enabling force. Fink, who points out his firm owns 5%-10% of virtually every major company in the world, says, “I see some really good leadership and some really crappy leadership, but it was very clear, very early on that the chemistry between Bob and Ken was something very unique.” He adds, “Bob grew into the CEO role—a lot of it was the trust he had with Ken, and maybe a little bit with me.” Grossman’s leadership was a shock to the broader system, however. He fired most of the executive team before his first day. Not long after, he ripped out a relatively new $35 million electronic health-record system, telling the board he needed to install the more expensive Epic system instead. Rather than acquiring hospitals—the go-to strategy for health systems at the time—Grossman committed to building a network of outpatient facilities, correctly anticipating that technology would allow an increasing share of procedures to be performed outside of hospitals. (That strategy has paid off: Ambulatory facilities don’t require 24/7 staffing and are more profitable.) Relaying the events to me 18 years later, Grossman still seemed tickled by his own audacity, and the fact that he has shown up naysayers, like a McKinsey consultant who told him he was doing too many things too fast. Satisfying too, was his experience watching a class at Harvard Business School discuss NYU Langone, the case study. The students struck Grossman as timid: They’d all viewed his early management purge—“Black Wednesday,” as it became known—as cataclysmic. “I didn’t think it was any big deal,” he told me. “I just didn’t think the institution was functioning.” Dr. Andrew Brotman, NYU Langone’s outgoing chief clinical officer, recalls that Grossman fired people he was friendly with that day, with no apparent anguish. That sort of compartmentalization is “characteristic of Bob,” he told me. “He does what’s best for the organization.” Fiona Druckenmiller, a former portfolio manager who joined NYU Langone’s board in 2006—and who will succeed Langone as chair on Sept. 1— describes Bob “as one of the most decisive people I’ve ever met.” The key to decision-making at NYU Langone is the “dashboard,” a data-rich tool that tracks more than 800 metrics across the system in real time. Grossman created the platform, which he refers to as the organization’s “sole source of truth,” with the help of a small, select team early in his tenure; he felt the input of other managers would muddy his vision. The dashboard captures everything from teacher evaluations and high-impact publications to ICU bed space and operating-room turnover time. It’s how Grossman obsessively manages the place, and how the contribution of every department, physician, nursing unit, and administrator is measured. Big data is hardly novel in the corporate world, but the analytics that has already revolutionized most industries has been slower to transform health care, due to clumsy IT systems, fragmented providers, and heightened privacy concerns. Perhaps what sets NYU Langone’s dashboard apart is its thoroughness and its centrality to the organization. I was eager to see the dashboard data through Grossman’s eyes, and he agreed to give me a demonstration one morning. He clicked through his go-to pages—one flagging trending data across the system, another showing emergency department stats. (Average “door to doc time” that morning: 13 minutes; average time in ER: 4.5 hours, which Grossman described as “damn good.”) We looked up his own dashboard usage (269 log-ins in the past year; enough to put him in the top 2.5% of the system’s users, but well short of his Chief of Hospital Operations, Dr. Fritz François, whose count topped 4,000.) The granularity of data has been key to identifying issues and fixing them. Even before the dashboard came online, for example, Grossman noticed a quirk with the NYU Langone’s “case mix index,” a measure that reflects the complexity of patient cases and care provided. Grossman realized that physicians weren’t fully documenting cases, and as a result, weren’t being fully reimbursed for care. A major documentation effort followed, an exercise which helped turn around the organization’s finances. If Grossman has a north star metric, it’s “length of stay.” Hospital operations are more profitable, in essence, when in-patient stays are short, and so length-of-stay has become an NYU Langone benchmark of focus. To some, that may sound sinister, like an incentive for kicking patients out before they’re ready to go home. But there’s considerable evidence that unnecessary time in the hospital can do patients more harm than good, increasing their risk of infection or other complications, which are also costly for the system. NYU Langone now has one of the nation’s lowest average lengths of stay—something Grossman could show me thanks to third-party data that populates the dashboard and allows comparing NYU Langone to 115 other large health systems. He navigated over to a screen ranking hospitals by observed-to-expected mortality. The dashboard showed NYU Langone with the lowest mortality index, which Grossman pointed out before somewhat gleefully namechecking his lagging rivals. “New York-Presbyterian, probably twice the mortality,” he noted, scanning the list. “University of Pennsylvania…Duke… Here’s North Shore—four times the mortality!” he exclaimed, breaking into a hearty chuckle. (It should be noted that because NYU Langone’s rate was very low—32 patients dying when 100 would have been expected to die in similar circumstances—those competitors had death rates that were roughly in line with or better than industry standards.) “Bob is very competitive,” Druckenmiller later told me, “He does keep track of how everyone else is doing.” The dashboard is key to keeping operations on track, but Grossman says it’s more important impact has been on culture. To make his point, he showed me the page of a faculty member: Dr. Robert Montgomery, an award-winning transplant surgeon with a prodigious handlebar moustache. He pointed out the range of available stats (on-time OR starts, patient infection rates, grant funding) and double-clicked on a few to show how Montgomery ranked among colleagues. I asked if this feature led some doctors to obsessively check their own performance. “Well, that’s the behavior,” Grossman said matter-of-factly. “That’s how you become number one.” Are there any limitations to the metrics or cases where they aren’t fair? Plenty of faculty members have challenged assessments that they’re underproductive, Grossman says, but when that happens, he can simply point them to the dashboard: Why do they have zero grants or zero high-impact publications when others in the same department have several? The measures are objective, he says, and the system fully transparent. Even as I marveled at the data available, I wondered if the dashboard-driven culture—part Moneyball, part panopticon— might feel oppressive to some. “It’s not for everyone,” Brotman later told me. “You’re on the hook 24/7, 365, and you’ve got this vulnerability and this expectation of accountability. If you don’t have the right disposition, it’s hard to deal with.” I felt awkward simply being in the room for moments of the “Snapshot Review,” a meeting where the chairs of clinical departments filed onstage for dashboard-informed questioning from administrators. The review sessions, in an airy conference room overlooking the East River, varied considerably in tone and substance. Some involved praise and practical problem-solving; others, discussions of “low-performing faculty members”; and another—featuring a relatively new leader who clearly hadn’t found his footing—the feel of a man pleading for mercy. Over time, NYU Langone leaders have gotten better at identifying the people who buy into the culture and thrive, and those who don’t. (The health system claims an approximate 10% annual employee turnover rate.) Who does thrive? People who like data, who accept that medicine is a science and not an art (NYU standardizes processes, right down to the surgical tools used). A theme that came up in my interviews—somewhat surprisingly, at a high-performing health system—was how little people sleep. “Bob doesn’t turn off,” Druckenmiller said of Grossman. She explained that a lot of the hospital’s most important business gets done over phone calls at 4:30 in the morning, because that’s an hour when Langone, Grossman, and she (and others) are all awake and not commuting yet. She said that Grossman’s successor, Dr. Alec Kimmelman, is that way too. (When Druckenmiller asked Kimmelman’s wife if she was ready for him to take on the role, she answered she didn’t expect anything would change—he was gone before she woke up and home after she went to bed.) When I asked Langone how he managed it all, he told me, “I don’t sleep. The other guy’s sleeping while I’m doing other stuff.” The culture of self-care has not yet come for NYU Langone leadership, but work-life balance is on its radar. At a Snapshot review meeting I attended, there was discussion of the outgoing infectious disease chief, and how his “Iron Man Model” was not as in-fashion with the younger generation of doctors. Kimmelman, who comes across as thoughtful and laid-back, assured me NYU Langone’s culture welcomes non-workaholics. What matters, he says, is that “even if their attitudes towards work-life balance are different than mine, they’re still devoted to excellence and quality and taking great care of patients.” At the time of my visit, I had just finished watching The Pitt, the HBO medical drama focused on one chaotic, 15-hour shift in a Pittsburgh emergency room. Throughout the series, a suit-wearing, metrics-obsessed administrator drops by to scold the staff on the measures in which they’re falling short— wait times, patient satisfaction scores, documentation—ratcheting up the pressure on overstretched doctors and nurses trying to save lives. One naturally sympathizes with the staff, but it can be easy to overlook that the administrator’s goals—however warped by the economics of the health system—are actually in the interest of patient care, or at least of keeping the hospital’s doors open. (Grossman hadn’t watched the show. “I don’t think it’s my cup of tea,” he told me.) It can be easy to vilify micromanagement, but Dr. Oren Cahlon, a radiation oncologist who will take Brotman’s job in September—says it has been effective at NYU Langone. Recently Cahlon had been digging into patient access issues—the long wait times new patients face to make appointments at NYU. He’d been plumbing physicians’ schedules, drawing up new policies—How often did patients really need follow-up appointments? Could some of those existing patients see a nurse practitioner or physician assistant instead? —and even changing compensation models to incentivize providers to see new patients. Brotman approvingly compared Cahlon’s work to “guerilla warfare,” noting that he’d managed to increase new-patient appointments by 10% to 40%. It hadn’t immediately gone over well, but Brotman and Cahlon had engaged staff and patients about the reasons for the changes. Contrary to the concerns that adding more patients would cause burnout and tank satisfaction scores, Brotman says they’ve seen the opposite. A 30-minute ferry ride from NYU’s gleaming Manhattan campus delivers you to the health system’s Brooklyn hospital, on the industrial fringes of Sunset Park. The facility, wrapped in scaffolding due to ongoing renovation, is shabbier than the midtown mothership. It serves a diverse population, many of whom are not native English speakers, and 82% of whom depend on government insurance.But the care and increasingly the range of services match those back at headquarters. Since NYU Langone completed its merger with Lutheran, a struggling community hospital, in 2016, its patient safety and health outcome measures have vastly improved. (Observed-to-expected mortality has fallen 60% since 2017; complications have come down 58%.) And it’s profitable this year, because it’s seeing more patients, and seeing them more efficiently. Getting there involved many years of taking the same fine-tooth-comb data-driven approach to hospital operations. When NYU took over, most of the doctors there were contractors, and the under-resourced facility was working with outdated infrastructure and technology: Cardiologists, for example, would view electrocardiograms on VHS tapes. There’s often suspicion and fear when a large health system acquires a smaller community hospital, and it’s well-founded; big systems often strip their acquisitions of services and send patients to their larger facilities for sophisticated care. NYU Langone met with similar skepticism, but the result has been the opposite: it invested in the Brooklyn hospital, hired a full-time staff, and added a range of higher-end services—cardiac catheterization labs, neurosurgery, cancer care—bringing care into the community. The day I visited, I found Dr. Bret Rudy, chief of hospital operations, in his office, studying dashboard data on a large monitor. It was 9:45 a.m., and so far, 41 patients had arrived in the emergency department; seven were waiting for beds, including one whose digital profile he clicked on for my benefit, who was being admitted for a possible case of tuberculosis. Rudy navigated to operating stats—where 92% of the day’s first procedures that month had started on time. “That should be higher,” he said, explaining that turnaround time between procedures should be 30 minutes or less. The dashboard had allowed him and a pair of surgeons he’d deputized to optimize workflow, investigating late starts and rooting out inefficiencies. Since 2017, they’ve increased the number of surgeries by more than 20% (a total of 2,000 more surgeries per year), through disciplined scheduling and 6 a.m. start-times. Nine years in, NYU Langone Hospital-Brooklyn is practically a well-oiled machine. The front lines of NYU’s transformation effort have shifted to Patchogue, a town on 12,000 on Long Island, where it recently completed a merger with a community hospital, now known as NYU Langone Hospital-Suffolk. Suffolk County is famed for the glitzy Hamptons, but closer to Patchogue it’s home to working-class towns troubled by the opioid epidemic and MS-13 gang activity. The Suffolk County hospital was in rough shape when NYU Langone entered the picture a few years ago; after years of underinvestment, its reputation had suffered, and patients that ended up there tended to be either very sick or accident victims brought in from the Long Island Expressway. Other health systems had considered purchasing the hospital but always walked away; Dr. Marc Adler, chief of hospital operations, recalls that when he first introduced himself, a staff member said, “You’ll be gone in three months.” Adler is now several years into the job, implementing the NYU Langone playbook. The patient population is largely covered by Medicare and Medicaid, and it suffers from greater levels of substance abuse and mental health issues than NYU Langone-Brooklyn’s does. Among NYU’s first investments were a larger security staff and a new behavioral health facility; surgical robots and new operating rooms have been added too. They’ve hired a new full-time staff, some poached from NYU’s hospital in neighboring Nassau County. There had been plenty of room for efficiency improvements at the hospital. “If everyone’s coming in at 9 a.m., you’re never going to start your cases at 7 a.m.,” says Adler. Only 30% of the day’s first surgeries started on time in 2021. The doctors, who were on contract and would stop by only a few days per week, erred on the side of longer stays—keeping patients in the hospital over the weekend or for another day if they hadn’t seen them. Adler of course, showed me his dashboard. The quality of care and patient outcomes are much improved over the past few years, and over 90% of the day’s first cases now start on time. NYU Langone Hospital-Suffolk has a “C” safety grade by the standards of Leapfrog Group, a hospital ranking group—all other NYU hospitals have an “A”—but Adler explains it’s due to Leapfrog’s methodology, which relies on data from up to three years prior. NYU Langone executives say the level of care is now equivalent to the system’s other hospitals. Like other nonprofit health systems, NYU Langone is facing cuts to Medicaid and NIH funding. Last year, the NYU Grossman School of Medicine ranked 11th in terms of NIH awards, with $490 million in funding according to the Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research, which tracks the field. According to BRIMR’s analysis, NYU’s medical school has so far had a handful of grants worth $12 million terminated; 56 schools had greater losses in funding. “Obviously we think a lot about that,” Kimmelman, Grossman’s successor, tells me. Like a lot of institutions, NYU Langone is looking at ways to diversify research funding from other sources, and some affected researchers have had to pivot. At the same time, Kimmelman says his team is trying to not let the uncertainty distract them from their mission or the various expansion projects already in motion. He takes inspiration from Grossman, who in the depths of COVID, a financially perilous period, didn’t hesitate to invest in important but extremely expensive technology. The decision came down to impact on patient care. “I think our fundamentals are incredibly solid,” Kimmelman says. “If we can’t thrive or survive in whatever happens to NIH, I don’t think there’s going to be any health care system that can.” It’s not the first time a dire situation has largely been out of NYU Langone’s control. Many vividly remember the night in 2012 when Hurricane Sandy plunged lower Manhattan and NYU Langone (its generators failed) into darkness, flooding the Manhattan campus and shuttering the hospital and medical school for several weeks. “I thought it was all over,” says Brotman. Langone happened to be a patient that night, recovering from pneumonia. He was evacuated from the 17th floor at 3 a.m., along with 23 infants staying in the neo-natal intensive care unit. Langone vividly remembers following the procession—the babies still attached to tubes, each one cradled by a nurse lying on a sled, while others carefully carried the sled and medical equipment down the pitch-dark stairway—and the sound of nurses, in perfect unison, saying “Step, step, step,” until they made it to the ground floor. It’s still one of his proudest moments. And as instrumental as he has been to NYU Langone’s recovery and its broader accomplishments, the day I visited him Langone kept steering me back to the system’s smaller, anecdotal triumphs—like the too-scared-to-sleep heart transplant patient who was comforted in the middle of the night by a kind building services worker. While Grossman’s laser focus on industry-leading care is filtered through an obsessive, data-driven wonkiness, Langone relishes the human stories, the living, breathing proof their work has made a difference. On his desk, behind boxes of Dots Christmas candy, framed photos, and a sign that reads “The Buck Stops Here,” were cards that he’d occasionally pick up mid-conversation and read to me—from grateful patients, or family members, or former employees, thanking him for their experience at NYU Langone. “I’ve got a bunch of them,” he told me, as if the testimonies answered all remaining questions. He always writes a note back. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Saudi Press Agency Thursday 20/02/1447 Dhahran, August 14, 2025, SPA -- Aramco, one of the world's leading integrated energy and chemicals companies, signed an $11 billion lease and leaseback deal involving its Jafurah natural-gas processing facilities with a consortium of international investors, led by funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a part of BlackRock. Jafurah is the largest non-associated gas development in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, estimated to contain 229 trillion standard cubic feet of raw gas and 75 billion stock tank barrels of condensate. It is a key component in Aramco's plans to increase gas production capacity by 60% between 2021 and 2030, to meet rising demand. As part of the transaction, Jafurah Midstream Gas Company (JMGC) will lease development and usage rights for the Jafurah Field Gas Plant and the Riyas NGL Fractionation Facility, and lease them back to Aramco for a period of 20 years. JMGC will receive a tariff payable by Aramco in exchange for granting Aramco the exclusive right to receive, process, and treat raw gas from Jafurah. Aramco will hold a 51% majority stake in JMGC, with the remaining 49% held by investors led by GIP. The transaction, which will not impose any restrictions on Aramco's production volumes, is expected to close as soon as practicable, subject to customary closing conditions. According to Aramco president and chief executive Amin Nasser, "Jafurah is a cornerstone of our ambitious gas expansion program, and the GIP-led consortium's participation as investors in a key component of our unconventional gas operations demonstrates the attractive value proposition of the project. This foreign direct investment into the Kingdom also highlights the appeal of Aramco's long-term strategy to the international investment community." "As Jafurah prepares to start phase one production this year, development of subsequent phases is well on track," Nasser said. "We look forward to Jafurah playing a major role as a feedstock provider to the petrochemicals sector, and supplying energy required to power new growth sectors, such as AI data centers, in the Kingdom." GIP chairman and chief executive Adebayo Ogunlesi said, "We are pleased to deepen our partnership with Aramco with our investment in Saudi Arabia's natural-gas infrastructure, a key pillar of global natural-gas markets. Today's announcement builds upon BlackRock and GIP's longstanding relationship with Aramco to serve growing market needs for cleaner fuels, energy security, and energy affordability." The opportunity to invest in one of the region's most significant natural-gas developments garnered significant interest from investors worldwide. Co-investors in the transaction include leading institutional investors from Asia and the Middle East. When completed, the transaction will support the optimization of Aramco's assets and capture additional value from the development of the Jafurah gas field. GIP's mid-market infrastructure equity team, which invests in diversified and contracted mid-market infrastructure assets and businesses around the world, has a robust, long-term track record of successful investments in the Middle East. The investment also builds upon the strong existing relationship between Aramco and BlackRock. In 2022, BlackRock co-led a consortium of investors in a separate minority investment in Aramco Gas Pipelines Company. -- SPA 23:43 Local Time 20:43 GMT 0057

Share this article Wells Fargo increased its holdings in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), during the second quarter of 2025, according to a new SEC filing. The fourth-largest bank in the US by asset size disclosed that it held over $160 million worth of IBIT shares as of June 30, up from over $26 million at the end of the first quarter, the filings shows. Bloomberg reported last February that Bank of America’s Merrill and Wells Fargo started providing spot Bitcoin ETFs to brokerage clients in their wealth management units upon request. In addition to IBIT, Wells Fargo boosted its stake in the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO) from $2.5 million to around $26 million in Q2. Between March and June, Wells Fargo’s stake in the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust also grew from about $23,000 to $31,500, and its GBTC holdings climbed from $146,000 to over $192,000. The firm also reported smaller positions in Bitcoin funds managed by ARK Invest/21Shares, Bitwise, CoinShares/Valkyrie, Fidelity, and VanEck, as well as spot Ethereum ETFs. In related developments, Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala maintained its position of 8,7 million IBIT shares valued at $534 million as of June 30, according to an SEC filing. Al Warda Investments, managed by the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, reported holding 2,4 million IBIT shares worth $147 million at the end of June.

Title: Why Chainlink (LINK) Could Be The Biggest Winner In Stablecoins And Tokenization Era

The stablecoin and tokenization sectors are experiencing a significant resurgence, fueled by pro-crypto regulations introduced by the Trump administration. As a result, experts believe that decentralized oracle network, Chainlink (LINK), is poised to reap substantial benefits from these progressive developments. Market expert Miles Deutscher recently highlighted that LINK may be the most promising large-cap investment opportunity this cycle, despite the possibility that many investors could overlook it. In a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), the expert asserted that Chainlink is uniquely positioned to benefit from the “institutionalization of cryptocurrency” and the explosive growth of stablecoins, tokenization, and real-world assets (RWAs). Notably, the total value locked (TVL) in RWAs has surged thirteenfold in just two years, climbing from approximately $1 billion to over $13 billion as institutions increasingly recognize the limitations of the traditional SWIFT payment system. In response, major financial players like asset manager and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer, BlackRock, are advocating for tokenization, while companies such as Stripe and Circle (CRCL) are now exploring the development of their own blockchain solutions. In this environment, Chainlink serves as a crucial “universal translator.” According to Deutscher, each tokenized stock, bond, or piece of real estate requires an oracle to accurately reflect its value on-chain, and Chainlink dominates this space, controlling 84% of the oracle market. The Chainlink network generates revenue through two primary channels: on-chain fees for services used across various blockchain networks, and partnerships with large corporations that pay for Chainlink’s solutions. This revenue model supports its operations and facilitates buybacks of LINK tokens, further enhancing the network’s sustainability. Moreover, Chainlink’s protocol automatically converts all revenues—whether in Ethereum (ETH) or Circle’s USDC stablecoin—from corporate partnerships into LINK tokens on the open market, depositing them into a strategic treasury. This mechanism not only strengthens the network’s financial foundation but also creates a persistent supply sink as users stake LINK to secure the network, earning a sustainable yield of approximately 4.32%. Deutscher emphasizes that this dynamic creates a powerful feedback loop: increased adoption leads to higher revenues, which in turn results in more LINK purchased and locked, enhancing network security and utility. In his analysis, Deutscher also drew comparisons between LINK and XRP, arguing that LINK has gained more traction within institutional circles than XRP, making it a more logical investment given its current valuation. For context, the total value secured by Chainlink stands at an impressive $84.65 billion, dwarfing XRP’s decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked of approximately $85 million. Despite this disparity, XRP’s market cap is roughly twelve times larger than LINK’s, which Deutscher believes highlights LINK’s potential value at current levels. From a pricing perspective, Chainlink has recently broken above the $20 weekly resistance level, currently trading at $22.This is likened to Ethereum’s pivotal $4,000 level, indicating a potential upward trajectory for LINK in the coming months.

Title: ADA vs XRP: Best Investment for the 2025 Altcoin Season?
URL: https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/ada-vs-xrp-best-investment-for-the-2025-altcoin-season/
Time Published: 2025-08-15T06:00:00Z

The altcoin market’s heating up, and you can feel it in the charts. Cardano (ADA) has been grinding its way back toward that $1 threshold after a strong weekly push, while XRP is flexing above $3, refusing to give up its spot. Traders are locking in positions and eyeing the next few months like it’s the calm before the storm. Both have fresh narratives driving momentum, but the real debate is this — which one’s going to take the crown when the 2025 run kicks into full gear? Before we get into the head-to-head breakdown, it’s worth noting that some sharp money isn’t just watching the majors. There’s a lot of buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE — an early-access play that’s pulling in heavy interest as big-cap coins take a breather. Early buyers are treating it like a shot at catching the next breakout before it’s plastered across every exchange ticker. Cardano (ADA): Can the momentum hold? ADA’s rally isn’t just luck on the charts — there’s real groundwork being laid. The network just wrapped up its first on-chain governance vote, unlocking a massive $71 million in treasury funds for scaling upgrades. Hydra, a Layer-2 protocol designed to boost transaction speeds, and Ouroboros Leios, a next-gen consensus upgrade, are now locked in for development. These are the kind of changes that could finally put Cardano’s “slow but steady” reputation to bed and open the floodgates for DeFi growth. Then there’s the ETF angle. Grayscale just filed a Cardano trust, a key first step toward ETF status, after ADA got tagged as a “mature blockchain” under the Clarity Act. Betting markets are giving 2025 approval odds as high as 85%, though the SEC’s track record means nothing is a sure thing. Whale activity is also adding fuel. About 200 million ADA have been scooped up ahead of the Midnight Network’s NIGHT token airdrop, with half of the supply reserved for ADA holders. Open interest is climbing, but leverage isn’t running wild — a healthy sign. The short-term challenge? Clearing that stubborn $0.92 resistance. ADA Speculation: An Opportunity to Get Into Something Before Everyone Else While ADA’s busy stacking technical wins, some traders are hedging with a completely different kind of play. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been turning heads thanks to its rapid-fire growth, a tight early supply, and a community that’s moving in fast. It’s the sort of setup that gets both retail and institutional eyes glued to the order book — and the word is, the ROI projections from seasoned analysts are eye-popping. The thinking is simple: lock in a spot before it lands on major exchanges and futures markets. And for those jumping in now, the EXTRA50X code unlocks a 50% bonus before the current window closes. XRP: The post-lawsuit runway For XRP, the biggest cloud hanging over it is gone. August’s joint dismissal with the SEC ended a five-year grind of uncertainty, officially declaring that retail XRP sales aren’t securities. Ripple settled for $50 million, got the ban on institutional sales lifted, and now has a clear path to expand — including ongoing CBDC trials with France and Georgia. Next up: the ETF push and Ripple’s banking ambitions. Heavyweights like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock have XRP ETF applications pending, and odds look good on paper. Ripple’s also going after a national banking license, which could tie its RLUSD stablecoin and XRP directly into the banking rails — though timelines here could make or break momentum. On-chain data’s giving mixed vibes. Roughly 130 million XRP hit exchanges in August — a possible profit-taking move — but whale wallets are at all-time highs, and open interest is hovering near $9.2 billion. That combo can make for some wild swings. XRP Speculation: Bottom line The biggest network development and light of an airdrop is pushing Cardano, and XRP at last can keep the courts out of its sideboards and waiting to make its institutional overtures count. They both have the firepower to surge, that is why so many smart traders are not taking sides, they are holding a bit of both. However, the actual buzz at the moment is over MAGACOIN FINANCE, an incredible golden opportunity whose early-stage allocations are being bought out in record time. There is the possibility of a massive winner with the EXTRA50X bonus yet to be decided upon, it is one of those investments with breakout potential that can make a fortune before the next market rotation even begins setting in motion.

Title: Letters: Paschal Donohoe’s optimism out of place with the grim reality many in our country face

Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe. Photo: Collins President Michael D Higgins. Photo: PA Russian president Vladimir Putin will visit the US for the first time in a decade. Photo: Sputnik One has to admire the sunny disposition of Paschal Donohoe, who says the key to our success in the future will be dependent on increases in productivity (‘The resilience of Irish enterprise and our workforce will see us through hard times’, Irish Independent, August 14). Working longer and harder for the same returns is unlikely to resonate with most people, particularly so with disruptive technologies such as AI and profound demo­graphic trends affecting a multitude of industries. This comes on the back of a big increase of 12,700 in the seasonally adjusted number of people unemployed in July, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.9pc. Couple this with over 300,000 struggling to pay their electricity bills in the height of summer and the last thing anyone wants to hear is to work longer and harder. Why would a member of Generation Z, for example, want to increase their productivity when no matter what they do, they will never be able to afford a home or childcare? The only ones who really benefit from the younger generation working longer hours are the people who have it already made – in other words, your typical Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil voter. Tom McElligott, Listowel, Co Kerry President Michael D Higgins has condemned recent attacks on Indian people living in Ireland as a “stark contradiction” to the values the Irish public hold dear (August 13). Unfortunately, it seems that those traditional values of welcome and openness to the stranger have been diminishing and even disappearing, to the point that they are being replaced by open hostility and violence. It can be argued that our tradition­al welcome of “céad míle fáilte” is more of a myth and make-believe to attract tourism rather than ever being embedded in our culture. Hostility against the Traveller community was and remains endemic in settled society. It is heartbreaking to have to listen to international protection applicants as they describe how they are taunted with racist slurs on our streets and how they fear going out alone in public places for fear of being assaulted. Our streets have become a hostile environment not only for our Indian community and asylum-seekers, but for the LGBTQ+ and other marginalised groups. This hostility bordering on hatred against the stranger is not confined just to our cities, but has taken root throughout the country. A few extra gardaí might contain the violence for a while, but a more radical approach to this epidimic of hostility is needed. Brendan Butler, Homefarm Road, Dublin 9 Catherine Prasifka’s article on clankers and the role of technology in our lives is spot on (‘In a world of us and clankers, Big Tech is creating a future we haven’t consented to’, August 14). Lately, I’ve noticed many people worrying that George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four has finally arrived, thanks to artificial intelligence, facial recognition and CCTV cameras everywhere. To them, I say, welcome to my childhood. At Tullysaran primary school in the 1960s, I was taught with great conviction that God saw everything I did, said and even thought. Compared with that, CCTV is a mere intrusion. At least cameras don’t claim to know what’s in my head. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Armagh When we think of cancer, we often think of it in statistics – one in two of us will face it in our lifetimes – but behind every diagnosis is a person, a story and a family. That human experience, along with the incredible progress of Irish-led ­science, is at the heart of a new exhibition opening this week in Dublin. “Cancer Revolution: Science, Innovation and Hope” is the first exhibition of its kind in Ireland, and it exists because we believe it’s time to change the public conversation about cancer. It brings together deeply personal items donated by people affected by the disease, alongside groundbreaking research, innovations in treatment and historical discoveries that have changed the face of medicine. This is not a story of despair, it is a story of resilience. The exhibition is free and open to the public from today until October 31 at Stephen’s Green Shopping Centre, Dublin. Orla Dolan, Breakthrough Cancer Research If today’s meeting between presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump results in a repeat of Munich in 1938, then the dismemberment of Ukraine will not bring peace in eastern Europe, but a wider conflict and a repeat of mid-20th century worldwide war. Not only will Putin be rewarded for his blatant disregard for the rules-based order, but others such as China’s Xi and Trump will be encouraged to act in a similar manner. The EU must grow a backbone and reject, in the strongest terms possible, any concessions proposed to Russia and Putin. The only solution is a restoration of Ukrainian sovereignty over Crimea and Donbas, reparations to be paid by Russia for the damages and deaths caused by its illegal actions and the conviction of Putin for war crimes. The alternative is a world thrown into the chaos best described by Thomas Hobbes: nasty, brutish and short, where every man is enemy to every man. Bill Hawkes, Kilmihil, Co Clare Sixteen US congressmen and women stated “serious concerns” regarding the Irish Government’s Occupied Territories Bill (‘Government to push ahead with Occupied Territories Bill’, August 9). As there are 435 congressmen and women in the House of Representatives, this equates to just over 3pc of US government elected officials. With such a small number, it is hardly worth our Government’s while to be concerned with their concerns in moving forward with this important humanitarian bill.

Two others from Canary Funds and Marinade Finance have also been delayed. Issued Thursday under delegated authority by the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets, the orders use identical language for both filings. The orders cite the need for “sufficient time to consider” proposed rule changes that would list Commodity-Based Trust Shares for each fund under BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4). That rule sets eligibility, disclosure, and surveillance requirements for exchange-traded products backed by physical commodities. "Even with market infrastructure for Solana maturing in terms of liquidity, custody solutions, and institutional interest, unresolved concerns around regulatory classification, network stability, and potential concentration of control within the ecosystem are still looming," Shawn Young, chief analyst at MEXC Research, told Decrypt. Both proposals were first filed on January 28 and later published in the Federal Register, opening the proposals for public comments and triggering the standard review clock under current rules in the Securities Exchange Act. A representative from Bitwise declined to comment pending the regulatory decision. The SEC and 21 Shares did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment. After an initial extension in March and the opening of formal proceedings from May—when it similarly delayed the decisions—the SEC has now used its final allowable 60-day delay, leaving no further procedural options beyond the new deadline. “The SEC’s full extension likely stems from Solana’s still-shaky security-or-commodity status, a call that carries far more consequence than any other concern,” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, told Decrypt. “Market manipulation and surveillance safeguards are also squarely in play, as both factors will set the tone for all future altcoin ETF bids.” For markets, this could sharpen positioning around Solana and influence expectations for other altcoin-linked ETFs, which are publicly traded funds designed to track the price of an underlying asset. “Traders will speculate and stack Solana to front-run the final call, while the deadline sets the stage for other altcoin-linked ETFs, shaping sentiment, and deciding whether Solana becomes the precedent or the pause button for the next wave of products,” Liu said. Applications for Solana ETFs follow the path set by spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, using the same Commodity-Based Trust Share framework and leaning on surveillance-sharing arrangements tied to CME Solana futures. The Solana ETF lineup awaiting a decision has widened in recent months, with additional proposals from Canary Funds and Marinade Finance joining those from Bitwise and 21Shares. Other issuers, including ProShares, Grayscale, and VanEck, have made technical amendments to their filings in an effort to align with the SEC’s criteria. BlackRock, meanwhile, has previously confirmed it has no plans to launch a Solana product yet, with some observers saying it’s likely because the asset management firm is already content with its Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. With the final 60 days afforded to the SEC to make its decision, some are optimistic that a Solana ETF could be approved this year. “We're expecting standard spot Solana ETFs to be approved by mid-October at the latest, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart tweeted Thursday.

Posted on 08/14/2025 3:24:56 PM PDT by Kazan As we await US-Russia Alaska summit tomorrow (15), the MSM continues their painful process of recognizing the realities on the ground in the battlefields of Ukraine.One of the most difficult realities to face is the realization that literally millions of Ukrainian citizens will not fight for their country and hide from the conscription officers.More than half a million Ukrainian men of military age have fled the country, while many others are still in hiding.Add to that the desertion epidemic plaguing the Ukrainian forces, with hundreds of deserters abandoning their positions at the front every single day.Russian forces have breached Ukrainian defenses near Dobropillia and advanced nine miles into territory around the city of Pokrovsk.Ukraine deployed Azov brigade troops to face the attackers, but the situation remains ‘chaotic’.The Telegraph reported:“’The entire defense line is like a sieve’, wrote Stansislav Bunyatov, a Ukrainian serviceman and blogger, a sentiment echoed by Borden Krotevhych, former chief of the Azov Brigade. Krotevhych wrote: ‘This chaos has been growing for a long time, worsening with each passing day. A stable line of combat, as such, effectively doesn’t exist’.Ukraine is ‘visibly losing the war’, says Konrad Muzkya, a Polish military analyst, largely because of the manpower crisis. So why won’t men like Pavlo, 35 and a new father, enlist? ‘Probably because I am afraid’, he says, with disarming honesty.‘Afraid to die or, worse, lose my mind and become a burden to my family. Afraid to leave my family in poverty. Afraid that my daughter will grow up an orphan. Afraid of being captured and tortured for months’.”At this point in the war, besides the increasing troop shortage, Ukrainians have also lost the drone supremacy they had in the beginning of the war.“Worse, Ukraine’s infantry is shrinking, with desertions and casualties exceeding the 200,000 mobilized last year. Around 650,000 men of fighting age are thought to have fled Ukraine. Others hide, like Pavlo, or bribe draft officers and army psychiatrists for health exemptions.[…] The desertion crisis is even starker. Unofficial estimates suggest more than 400 soldiers are abandoning the battlefield daily – exhausted by years of war, frustrated by rigid, top-down command, and disheartened by those avoiding service.”Kiev command strips technical units to fill the gaps in the front line defenses, as vital mechanics and radar operators are sent to die as infantry.

A stable line of combat, as such, effectively doesn’t exist’.Ukraine is ‘visibly losing the war’, says Konrad Muzkya, a Polish military analyst, largely because of the manpower crisis. So why won’t men like Pavlo, 35 and a new father, enlist? ‘Probably because I am afraid’, he says, with disarming honesty.‘Afraid to die or, worse, lose my mind and become a burden to my family. Afraid to leave my family in poverty. Afraid that my daughter will grow up an orphan. Afraid of being captured and tortured for months’.”At this point in the war, besides the increasing troop shortage, Ukrainians have also lost the drone supremacy they had in the beginning of the war.“Worse, Ukraine’s infantry is shrinking, with desertions and casualties exceeding the 200,000 mobilized last year. Around 650,000 men of fighting age are thought to have fled Ukraine. Others hide, like Pavlo, or bribe draft officers and army psychiatrists for health exemptions.[…] The desertion crisis is even starker. Unofficial estimates suggest more than 400 soldiers are abandoning the battlefield daily – exhausted by years of war, frustrated by rigid, top-down command, and disheartened by those avoiding service.”Kiev command strips technical units to fill the gaps in the front line defenses, as vital mechanics and radar operators are sent to die as infantry.

The whole world should have been at war against Zelensky and his Nazi regime, that little pizzant dictator. He took away their elections, their freedom of speech, closed the churches, and sent hundreds of thousands of their people into a meatgrinder. And he stole gazillions of US dollars through the commie Biden regime. Hang them all. > Every dead Ukrainian and Russian man can be laid at the feet of the neocons, the RINOs That was their goal - dead white Christians. Mission accomplished. Don’t worry. Like Europe, whatever remains of Ukraine can be filled with Muslims. I hope that Trump is also aware of this situation despite Rubio’s false briefings. Zelensky is Jewish. His grandparents fought the Nazis in World War II. His great grandparents were killed by the Nazis. Yet the Jewish Zelensky is head of a Nazi regime? Riiiiight. Riiiiight. Been true for years. But it doesn’t seem to stop them. Russia has a similar problem but is still able to outman Ukraine. That was their goal - dead white Christians. Mission accomplished. I would like to see the fighting stopped today. How about you? There are plenty of fighting age Ukrainian men in Poland, driving around in nice cars. The natives are annoyed. fake news. Russia is on its last leg “Ukraine is ‘visibly losing the war’, says Konrad Muzkya, a Polish military analyst, largely because of the manpower crisis. So why won’t men like Pavlo, 35 and a new father, enlist? ‘Probably because I am afraid’, he says, with disarming honesty. ‘Afraid to die or, worse, lose my mind and become a burden to my family. Afraid to leave my family in poverty. Afraid that my daughter will grow up an orphan. Afraid of being captured and tortured for months’.”” Which is why he’s now doing his part to put an end to this war. “Don’t worry. Like Europe, whatever remains of Ukraine can be filled with Muslims.” That will certainly be the case if they join the EU, simply because WOMEN run the EU, many of them childless. “The whole world should have been at war against Zelensky and his Nazi regime” GREAT POINT, and not only is Soros Jewish and spent WW2 ratting out other Jews for the Nazis, TO THIS DAY, he has no regrets about doing it.

Title: Saudi Aramco signs 11 bln USD lease-and-leaseback deal for Jafurah gas assets

Friday, 15 Aug 2025 RIYADH, Aug. 14 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Aramco announced Thursday the signing of an 11 billion U.S. dollar lease-and-leaseback agreement for its Jafurah gas processing assets with a consortium of international investors, marking a major inflow of foreign direct investment into the Kingdom's energy sector. The deal is led by funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a part of New York-based global investment management corporation BlackRock, the company revealed in a statement. Jafurah is the largest non-associated gas development in Saudi Arabia. It is a key component in Aramco's plans to increase gas production capacity by 60 percent between 2021 and 2030, to meet rising demand. As part of the transaction, a newly-formed subsidiary, Jafurah Midstream Gas Company (JMGC), will lease development and usage rights for the Jafurah Field Gas Plant and the Riyas NGL Fractionation Facility, and lease them back to Aramco for 20 years. JMGC will receive a tariff payable by Aramco in exchange for granting Aramco the exclusive right to receive, process, and treat raw gas from Jafurah. Aramco will hold a 51 percent majority stake in JMGC, with the remaining 49 percent held by investors led by GIP. The transaction, which will not impose any restrictions on Aramco's production volumes, is expected to close as soon as practicable, subject to customary closing conditions.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Shirley Zhao and Shawna Kwan (Bloomberg) — CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.’s profit fell 92% in the first half of the year, due to a one-time and non-cash loss on account of the merger of its telecommunications arm with Vodafone Group Plc. Billionaire Li Ka-shing’s flagship firm reported HK$852 million ($109 million) in net income for the six months ended June. Revenue came in at HK$240.7 billion, compared with HK$232.6 billion a year earlier. It announced an interim dividend of HK$0.710 per share, compared with HK$0.688 per share a year before. The profit drop is the biggest since a group-wide restructuring in 2015 for CK Hutchison, which is now led by Li’s son Victor Li. While its main operations including ports and retail remain resilient — with underlying profit actually rising 11% from the year before — the company recorded a one-time, non-cash loss of HK$10.5 billion arising from the UK merger, including non-cash disposal loss and transactional related expenses. The group completed the merger in May, receiving about £1.3 billion ($1.8 billion) in net proceeds, it said in an earnings statement Thursday. The conglomerate has also been facing geopolitical headwinds. It missed a chance to complete a sale of 43 ports — including two in the strategic Panama Canal — to a consortium backed by American asset manager BlackRock Inc. before a window for exclusive talks expired late July. CK Hutchison said it may invite a major strategic investor from China to join the buyers group after Beijing expressed strong displeasure over the deal, which it sees as ceding its shipping and trade interest to US influence. State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. was negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the consortium, Bloomberg News reported in July. The company didn’t mention the ports deal in its earnings statement Thursday. The group is poised to gain more than $19 billion in cash if the agreement is completed. The buying consortium also includes Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd. “Geopolitical uncertainty is likely to remain elevated,” said Chairman Victor Li. “The global economic outlook in this half will continue to be uncertain and unpredictable, with persistent unresolved trade and fiscal and monetary policy issues affecting commodity prices, interest and currency rates, as well as consumer and business sentiment.” CK Hutchison has been active in mergers and acquisitions in recent months — with mixed results. Subsidiary CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. has been seeking to bolster its UK assets after completing a second listing in London last year, but pulled out of the bidding for a liquefied natural gas terminal in the country valued at about £2 billion, Bloomberg News reported this week. The company didn’t specify the reasons for its decision, which came after it said it was negotiating the final terms of a deal. An agreement was expected within days. CK Infrastructure has been in talks to sell British rolling stock leasing firm Eversholt Rail for as much as £4 billion and expressed interest earlier this year in investing in debt-saddled Thames Water, though that didn’t develop into a “progressable proposal,” according to the water and sewage company’s management. The unit was also considering a bid for KKR & Co.-backed UK waste management firm Viridor Ltd., Bloomberg News reported in March. Details on sectoral performance: © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

A rally in European stocks slowed while US equities tread water as markets digested stronger-than-expected wholesale price inflation data and US bond yields rose. The Iseq index rose by 1.1 per cent, slightly outperforming its European peers. Cairn Homes jumped 2 per cent after lodging new plans for 236 apartments and 16 houses from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for its site at Chesterfield, Cross Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin. The Irish banks also moved higher as part of a wider sectoral move across Europe. AIB climbed 3.4 per cent to close at €7.41 per share, while Bank of Ireland jumped 2.1 per cent to €13.22. Ryanair also advanced, adding 0.6 per cent to €26.30 per share while other large caps like Kingspan and Kerry Group were little changed. Adding to Wednesday’s 16 per cent surge, Glanbia added another 1.4 per cent to close at €14.32 per share after the nutritionals group raised its earnings forecast earlier in the previous session. European shares touched two-week highs as the blue-chip Stoxx 50 added 0.7 per cent and the pan-European Stoxx 600 advanced by 0.5 per cent. Insurers were in the spotlight with the likes of Swiss Re reporting earnings. The firm was down 3.9 per cent on the session, despite reporting better than expected net profits for the first half. Meanwhile, Carlsberg fell 5.5 per cent after the Danish brewer missed half-year profit and volume forecasts, and said it did not expect any improvement in the consumer environment this year. Thyssenkrupp tumbled 8.9 per cent after the German conglomerate cut its full-year outlook for investments and sales, citing disruption from US tariffs. After three consecutive sessions of gains, British stocks were little changed, with the benchmark FTSE 100 essentially flat on the session and the mid-cap FTSE 250 index down by 0.2 per cent. Insurers led sectoral gains with Aviva jumping 2.4 per cent after jumping to its highest level since 2007 earlier in the session. The group raised its interim dividend on Thursday after reporting a stronger half-year operating profit. British insurer Admiral hit a record high, rising 5.8 per cent after a strong first-half profit. The energy sector was the main drag on the FTSE 100, down 1.3 per cent Harbour Energy led the losses, falling 4.5 per cent, while oil majors Shell and BP fell by 1.5 per cent and 0.9 per cent. Industrial metal miners also retreated amid weakness in copper and iron ore prices, with Rio Tinto down by 4 per cent and Anglo American down by 1.7 per cent. Among individual stocks, British Gas owner Centrica rose 2.5 per cent after announcing it will jointly buy National Grid’s Grain LNG terminal with US-based Energy Capital Partners for about £1.5 billion (€1.7 billion). Wall Street’s main indices were little changed in early trading on Thursday despite a stronger-than-anticipated inflation reading that spurred a rise in bond yields and the dollar. US wholesale inflation accelerated in July by the most in three years, suggesting companies are passing along higher import costs related to tariffs, raising the spectre of renewed price pressures and causing traders to trim bets on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates next month. After a recent rocket-fuelled rally, the S&P 500 was flat despite gains in big tech stocks. Cisco Systems lost 1 per cent after the network equipment manufacturer’s broadly in-line forecast did little to encourage investors. Deere & Co fell 8 per cent after the farm-equipment maker reported a lower quarterly profit and tightened its annual profit forecast, while Tapestry plunged 17.6 per cent after the Coach handbag maker forecast annual profit below estimates. – Additional reporting: Reuters/Bloomberg Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Ian Curran is a Business reporter with The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

For more information, please contact: Sequana Medical Investor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.com T: +32 9 292 8065 About Sequana Medical Sequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload, a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease, heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. Sequana Medical is commencing US commercialisation through a small speciality salesforce initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025, CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements1. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com. Important Safety Information: For important safety information regarding the alfapump® system, see https://www.sequanamedical.com/wp-content/uploads/ISI.pdf.

Title: Who Thought It Was a Good Idea to Put Matt Rife in a Make-Up Ad?

By Kayleigh Donaldson | Celebrity | August 14, 2025 For some reason, Matt Rife has remained weirdly popular over the past few years. Despite a cavalcade of misogynistic jokes, palling around with Jordan Peterson, and pissing off Marc Maron, the man with the iPad jaw has kept getting work. He recently bought Ed and Lorraine Warren’s home and Occult Museum, which includes all of the fake haunted stuff those scammers claimed to have dealt with over the course of their deceitful careers. That seems like a good match of personalities, I suppose. It certainly makes more sense than putting Rife in an advert for make-up. e.l.f. Cosmetics paired up Rife with drag queen Heidi N. Closet for an ad on ‘beauty injustices.’ That means over-priced make-up, not brands taking massive investments from companies like BlackRock, which was listed in a recent report from the United Nations mapping out the corporations aiding Israel in the displacement of Palestinians during their siege on Gaza. It’s a weird ad and Rife’s weird face doesn’t help matters. View this post on Instagram A post shared by e.l.f. Cosmetics and Skincare (@elfcosmetics) A post shared by e.l.f.

Putting aside the misogyny and his off-putting personality and his desperation to appeal to men because he was so embarrassed by his once-dedicated female fanbase: what does this man have to do with make-up? Would you buy anything beauty-related from this man? Does he have good genes… I mean jeans? Having drag artists do something like this at least makes sense. Maybe if one of the contestants of King of Drag was there alongside Heidi, I’d appreciate some consistency. If Rife does wear concealer, I don’t for a minute think he’d admit to it, at least not without making some homophobic gag in the process. Plus, the irony of a guy who got famous making jokes about domestic violence playing a lawyer? Hmm… e.l.f. Cosmetics probably wanted people to react with the same fake fervour of American Eagle’s Sydney Sweeney ads. Mostly, their core demographic just thought this was dumb and didn’t want a gross sexist near their eyeshadow. So, they issued a ‘we’re listening and we hear you’ non-apology, because why not?

Title: Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High, But Analysts Say MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Best Altcoin to Buy Before 2026

Bitcoin has officially broken into uncharted territory, setting a new all-time high of $124,457 on August 14, 2025. While the crypto market celebrates this historic milestone, analysts and institutional players are already hunting for the next asymmetric opportunity. And increasingly, that conversation is starting to include MAGACOIN FINANCE—a small-cap token with outsized upside potential heading into 2026. Bitcoin’s latest rally leg was the result of macroeconomic tailwinds and on-chain strength. Lower-than-expected U.S. CPI data (July inflation reading at just 2.7%) has reignited expectations for future Federal Reserve rate cuts. This dovish outlook, characterised by the lack of aggressiveness in monetary policy tightening, has increased demand for rare digital assets, and the Bitcoin price has reached its peak. Whale wallets are also playing their part. The number of addresses holding over 100 BTC reached an all-time high this week, signaling deep-pocketed confidence in long-term price growth. Another catalyst has been ETFs. BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton’s Bitcoin ETFs saw a record inflow of over $1.2 billion in the last 72 hours. The price of Ethereum (ETH) is holding strong at USD 4,600 as bullish pressure increases due to the ETF. BlackRock’s ETHA fund raked in over $300M in inflows while several staking innovations have gained traction, with ETH bulls eyeing the $5000 target. Upcoming upgrades are likely to cut gas fees and improve the scalability in the Ethereum ecosystem. Once institutional capital rotates into Layer-1s other than Bitcoin, Ethereum will be one of the main ones for capital allocation. Ripple’s XRP token is recovering after the conclusion of its case with the SEC, currently priced above $3.15. As USA exchanges make XRP available again after legal clarity was restored, investors are betting on a price run that ends in Q4. Thanks to whale movements and the adoption of global payments, many analysts now think that a move to $4.20 is on the cards. XRP has been identified as a utility altcoin for a second time, and one that can make a run for the top five by market cap. Analysts forecast MAGACOIN FINANCE could hit a 25x ROI before the next altseason peak, as rising whale accumulation and cross-chain investor interest fuel momentum ahead of key market catalysts. With a scarcity-driven supply model, expanding community presence, and growing attention from institutional players, the project is building a strong foundation for accelerated growth. As liquidity rotates into high-upside altcoins ahead of the next market leg, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a prime target for early movers seeking substantial returns. While bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, the most significant returns in crypto are still found in an uplifted market, which is not in bitcoin itself. With intelligent positioning of funds and the buildup of optimistic catalysts, MAGACOIN FINANCE is, without a doubt, one of the most excellent altcoin prospects for 2026.

Ark Invest said it bought more than 2.5 million shares of crypto platform Bullish (BLSH) on the day of the company’s explosive debut on the New York Stock Exchange, securing a stake valued at more than $170 million by the end of the day. Shares of the company, which owns CoinDesk, surged to as high as $102 from the $37 IPO pricing, before closing at $68, an 84% gain. The company sold 20.3 million shares for its initial public offering, which had also attracted interest from BlackRock (BLK), according to a filing with the SEC. Ark added 1,714,522 BLSH shares to its flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), 545,416 shares to the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) and 272,755 shares to the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF). Bullish's rally extended into Thursday, recently trading 15% higher. That performance comes as the broader crypto market slipped, erasing part of the prior day’s gains when bitcoin BTC$117,546.79 hit a record high of $124,000. The CoinDesk 20 Index is down about 2.1% over the past 24 hours. Other recently listed crypto-related stocks fell. Circle (CRCL), which went public in June, fell about 2% Thursday, while trading platform eToro (ETOR) dropped nearly 3%. Wood has a track record of making sizable early moves in newly public crypto firms. Upon Circle’s IPO, Ark purchased about 4.5 million shares, valued at roughly $373 million at the time. Those shares are now worth about $675 million. Her stake in eToro is smaller — around 140,000 shares — currently valued at $6.5 million. Bullish’s strong debut and Ark’s rapid allocation across multiple ETFs highlight growing investor interest in publicly traded crypto infrastructure companies, even as market volatility remains high.

Title: Bitcoin In Retirement Funds—Here’s The 69% Monthly Dividend Play
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/08/14/bitcoin-in-retirement-funds-heres-the-69-monthly-dividend-play/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T14:58:00Z

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. The US is quietly monetizing its $36 trillion deficit (printing money to pay for it). Just around the edges. For now. Which supports more upside for this 69% dividend that is powered by Bitcoin. And Uncle Sam’s money printer. Yes, Fed Chair Jay Powell is stubbornly sticking with high rates. Vanilla pundits claim a “hawkish” Fed is supportive of the US dollar. Yes, but—let’s look past Powell’s hollow words for his actions! Behind the scenes, the Fed is quietly “buying” up to $25 billion monthly from Treasury auctions. Without Fed involvement, less demand would mean higher rates to attract buyers. Who wants to fund Uncle Sam’s “spend like a drunken sailor” habit? So when an auction is slow, the Fed picks up the slack. If you are scratching your head, you’re on to something. The Fed has the same income as my seven-year-old—zero. My daughter asks mom or dad to pay for the ice cream. The Fed essentially creates the cash out of thin air to buy the bonds. This is effectively printing new money. The Treasury issues, the Fed absorbs! This is bearish for the buck and explains why it is down 10% year-to-date relative to other major currencies. And why monetary hedges such as gold and Bitcoin have soared in 2025. In a minute we’ll highlight a Bitcoin ETF that yields 69%. (No, that is not a typo.) But first, let’s discuss another policymaker trick. Treasury debt—which the Fed is helping mop up—has traditionally been issued at the long end of the curve. Think bonds of 10 and 30 years in duration, purchased by pension funds and sovereigns. Janet Yellen flipped this on its head during the end of her term as Treasury Secretary in another effort to keep long rates from rising. She began issuing 75% of government debt on the “short end” of the yield curve—two years in duration or less. This “short instead of long” issuing practice was unheard of only a few years ago. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was critical of this practice. However, he has not only continued it but also turned up the volume a notch. Scotty dishes 80% of the debt in short duration! By issuing more short-term debt, the US needn’t rely on the “kindness” of strangers (other sovereign nations) and pension funds to finance its deficit. Banks can permanently stash more (cheaper!) short-term debt on their balance sheets. Recent legislative changes will let banks lend (long) against this debt, indirectly contributing to monetary expansion. Which brings us to Bitcoin. Historically, gold was the haven against monetary mismanagement. Today, Bitcoin – the “OG crypto”—is rapidly emerging as a credible alternative store of value, endorsed by financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley. The bullish Bitcoin news keeps coming. Last week, President Trump signed an executive order allowing Bitcoin as an investment option in 401(k) retirement plans. “America’s ticker” SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) will have some competition, especially with millennial retirement participants! In April, we added ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO) to our Dividend Swing Trader portfolio to play this trend. BITO harvests premiums from Bitcoin contracts and pays an impressive monthly dividend annualizing to a sizzling 69%: I look at BITO as more of a trading vehicle than a “buy and hold” forever idea. After all, Bitcoin plummeted more than 75% between late 2021 and 2022. I’m not comfortable with readers risking that type of drawdown. Fortunately, we don’t have to. BITO makes for a great Dividend Swing Trading fund. Bitcoin, which drives the price (and payouts) of BITO, tends to rally sharply and sustain momentum for months at a time. This is exactly the type of holding period we strive for at DST. We like to buy right and then sit on our hands as gains accrue (swing, if you will) in our favor. We’re up 36% since our initial BITO purchase, a trade that annualizes to 118%. The fund has already paid us back 19% of our original purchase price in dividends. Plus, it has appreciated in price. When it dips, we buy more. On June 17, I issued an alert that BITO was a Best Buy—it has rallied 11.2% since (109% annualized). And that’s all before factoring in the new 401(k) catalyst. Last Thursday in DST, BITO topped our Best Buy list again. It didn’t take long to pop—3.6% in four days (for a terrific 2,600%+ annualized).

Title: Analysts believe $10,000 Ethereum price is inevitable as institutional buying increases, PEPE and RTX could 20x

Analysts are becoming increasingly confident that the Ethereum price will hit $10,000 as institutional buying accelerates. Massive inflows from large funds are pushing ETH into a stronger position than ever, with BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone adding $640 million worth of ETH in a single day. While Ethereum dominates headlines, traders are also paying close attention to the PEPE coin and an emerging project called Remittix, which many believe could rival the biggest names in the next bull cycle. These three assets are becoming central to discussions on the best crypto project 2025 and the next big altcoin 2025. Source: TradingView The Ethereum price is currently trading around $4,630, just 5% below its all-time high. This move comes after a breakout from a multi-year pattern, backed by over $10 billion in institutional inflows. As historical data has shown, ETH tends to hit 30-35 percent of Bitcoin market cap during major runs, which would put the Ethereum price between 8,500 and 10,000 dollars in case Bitcoin hits 150,000 dollars. In-chain statistics also indicate that long-term holders invest with confidence whereas short-term traders are taking profits. Analysts think that these trends and increasing use in DeFi project ecosystems and cross-chain DeFi project integrations, indicate continuing upward pressure. This optimism is why many still list ETH among the top crypto to buy now and the best long-term crypto investment. The PEPE coin has recently seen trading volumes double to nearly $900 million, signaling renewed market interest. A whale investor turned $200,000 into nearly $2 million after holding PEPE for nine months, highlighting the token’s explosive potential. The PEPE price chart shows a symmetrical triangle pattern that often leads to significant breakouts. Source: DexGemsReal If the PEPE coin moves above key resistance at $0.00001600, analysts predict gains of up to 773%, potentially pushing it toward $0.00010. With rising open interest and spot market inflows, this low cap crypto gem could surprise many in 2025. For traders seeking the next 100x crypto or crypto with passive income potential, PEPE remains firmly on the watchlist. While Ethereum price targets dominate the headlines, Remittix is quietly building momentum that could outpace both ETH and the PEPE coin in percentage gains. The project has already raised over $19.3 million through the sale of more than 596 million tokens at $0.0922 each. Unlike most hype-driven projects, Remittix delivers real-world utility with a platform designed to send crypto directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries, supporting 40+ cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. Its audited smart contracts, mobile wallet with real-time FX conversion and upcoming centralized exchange listing reveal a project with strong fundamentals. Why Remittix Could Dominate the Next Bull Run This combination of tech and utility positions Remittix as one of the best DeFi projects 2025 and a crypto solving real-world problems, making it a serious contender for the fastest growing crypto 2025. Ethereum price momentum, PEPE coin’s breakout potential and Remittix’s strong fundamentals create a compelling trio for investors. ETH is the best long term crypto investment to gain institutional exposure, PEPE is a high growth crypto to add to a risk tolerant portfolio and Remittix has the rare combination of utility and growth. These assets may set the stage for the future of crypto projects and early stage crypto investment opportunities as the next big crypto launch cycle heats up.

Cairn Homes is to seek permission for 236 apartments and 16 houses from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for its site at Chesterfield, Cross Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin. The 236 apartments are to be located in two blocks ranging in height from five to eight storeys while the 16 homes will be five bedroom terrace houses. Cairn has been trying to develop the site for the past seven years and last year An Coimisiún Pleanála refused permission for 355 build-to-rent apartments as it would lead to an over-proliferation of such apartments for the area.

MHP state that the scheme "will facilitate increased housing supply and choice along Cross Avenue and its environs, which is also located 1km southwest of Blackrock Village". MHP further state that "the design rationale is to create and deliver a high quality sustainable residential development within this strategic infill site which respects its suburban setting and maximises the site's natural attributes while making maximum efficiency of existing infrastructure". The developers are proposing a density of 100 units per hectare and MHP state that "the proposed density and mix is considered suitable for the site ensuring a sufficient quantum of units is provided whilst also protecting the amenity of existing adjoining residential properties". As part of its social housing obligations, Cairn Homes is proposing to sell 25 units to the Council. A letter from the Council states that "while the unit costs exceed the Council's approved acquisition cost threshold, it is acknowledged that the stated costs are estimated, as actual costs cannot be quantified at this preliminary stage". The Council letter states that "the Council may seek a revision of the Part V proposal following evaluation of costs and land values". Reporting by Gordon Deegan © RTÉ 2025.

Ethereum is closing in on its all-time high, and investors are asking if this is just a rally or the start of a decade-defining bull run. Trading near $4,605 after touching $4,783, Ethereum has surged 16% in five days, driven by institutional buying, ETF approvals, and the powerful impact of the Pectra upgrade. Analysts at Fundstrat call it “the biggest macro trade of the next decade,” with price targets as high as $15,000 by year-end.

Title: Hutchison Sees “Reasonable Chance” of $22.8 bln Ports Sale Going Through

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Clare Jim and Donny Kwok HONG KONG, Aug 14 (Reuters) – CK Hutchison said on Thursday its $22.8 billion ports business sale had a “reasonable chance” of going through after a plan to add a Chinese major strategic investor to the buying consortium, as it tries to navigate through Sino-U.S. tensions. CK Hutchison, based in the Chinese-controlled territory of Hong Kong, has faced heavy criticism from Beijing since unveiling a plan in March to sell 43 ports in 23 countries, including two near the Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock BLK.N and Italian Gianluigi Aponte’s family-run shipping firm MSC. President Donald Trump had called for the U.S. to “take back” the Panama Canal, which is used by more than 40% of U.S. container traffic, valued at roughly $270 billion annually, from Chinese influence. CK Hutchison’s ports are not on the canal or part of it, however. “We are into a new stage of our deal,” group co-managing director and finance director Frank Sixt told analysts at an earnings conference. “There is a reasonable chance that those discussions will lead to a deal that is good for all of the parties, ourselves included. And most importantly, that we’ll be capable of being approved by all of the relevant authorities.” On July 28, the conglomerate said it was in talks to include a Chinese “major strategic investor” in the bid for its ports, and that it would allow as much time as needed to secure approval in relevant jurisdictions. On Thursday, Sixt said these included China, the U.S., Britain and the European Union. He said the talks were taking much longer than expected but that this was “not particularly troublesome” because the port business had delivered stronger earnings and cash flow this year than expected. Sources have said the investor is COSCO – one of the world’s dominant, vertically integrated marine transportation firms. They said COSCO wanted a bigger stake while the other parties were keen to keep it a minority. ALLAYING CHINESE CONCERNS The inclusion of a Chinese investor would alleviate Beijing’s security concerns and have its blessing, the sources and other experts have said. COSCO did not respond to a request last month for comment. Thursday’s results conference was the first opportunity for analysts to quiz management about the ports deal. But chairman Victor Li, eldest son of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, who took over the conglomerate from his father, was missing for the first time, as was deputy chairman Canning Fok. Also unusually, CK Hutchison did not brief analysts or media about its 2024 earnings when it released them in March. Its shares closed down 0.4% on Thursday ahead of the results, in line with the Hang Seng Index .HSI. The conglomerate posted an 11% rise in first-half underlying profit to HK$11.3 billion ($1.44 billion) on a post-IFRS 16 basis. UBS had forecast a 6% rise. However, including one-time non-cash accounting loss, notably from the merger of 3UK and Vodafone UK, net profit dropped 92% year-on-year to HK$852 million.

Title: Exclusive: Former Goldman Sachs exec heads to crypto startup founded by former Meta engineers

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune. Another Wall Street executive is defecting to the crypto industry. Mustafa Al Niama, former head of the Americas digital assets desk for investment bank Goldman Sachs, is joining blockchain developer Mysten Labs as head of capital markets, he told Fortune. He’ll help lead the crypto company’s outreach to large financial institutions, he said. “The objective is to expand that sphere materially more than what we have today,” Al Niama added. He’s the latest from the world of Wall Street to join an industry populated not so long ago by teens and twentysomethings in hoodies. Others include Mary-Catherine Lader, a former rising star at asset manager BlackRock who jumped ship in 2021 to join Uniswap Labs. There’s also Tom Farley, former president of the New York Stock Exchange, who joined crypto exchange Bullish as CEO in 2023. The flow of Wall Street executives into crypto mirrors the increasing integration of two sectors that were once thought to be opposites. Large banks like JPMorgan Chase are experimenting with issuing digital tokens meant to represent one dollar of deposits. And other institutions are exploring how to tokenize money-market funds, or put financial assets into blockchain wrappers. Al Niama already has experience sitting between Wall Street and crypto. He spent four years at American Express before he switched over to Goldman Sachs in 2015, where he eventually worked his way up to becoming a regional head on the firm’s digital assets desk. One of the initiatives he led was a collaboration announced in July between Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York, or BNY, to launch tokenized money-market funds. Now, he’s joining one of the most deep-pocketed firms in crypto. Founded by former engineers from Meta’s scuttled stablecoin project, Libra, Mysten Labs has raised about $336 million from prominent firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Franklin Templeton, according to PitchBook. (The company also raised significant sums from the venture arm of the failed crypto exchange FTX but bought back the stake after FTX declared bankruptcy.) Mysten Labs is the main developer behind the Sui blockchain, which uses some of the tech that engineers at Meta had once developed for the social media giant’s crypto moonshot. “Hiring Mustafa as head of capital markets is the next step towards helping the ecosystem bring Sui’s mainstream public blockchain to institutional finance,” Ryan Servatius, global head of partnerships at Mysten Labs, said in a statement to Fortune. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance. Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia. BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income, Rick Rieder, is bullish. He says the landscape has never looked so good for investing and believes Jerome Powell should be cutting interest rates. Rieder also happens to be in the running for Fed chairman, according to numerous reports. While the White House will be mindful of the fact that Jerome Powell’s successor will need to be a credible economic force, President Trump has also been clear that the next chair will be more dovish than the current one. Trump has been waging a one-sided war against the Fed since winning the Oval Office (and indeed began criticizing Powell even before the election), aggressively lobbying the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to cut rates. Having awarded the Fed chairman the nickname of “Too Late Powell,” Trump has turned his attention to Powell’s replacement when his term ends in May 2026. Trump has said he will name that individual shortly, potentially in a move to shift the market’s attention to the incumbent, dovish power. Rieder appears on a list of candidates in the running for that job, according to reports from CNBC and Fox Business. And the CIO is saying many of the things the Trump camp will want to hear. Speaking to CNBC’s Closing Bell yesterday, Rieder said a few “extraordinary things” in the economy had convinced him that now is the “best investing environment ever.” “First of all, the technicals and equities are crazy,” Rieder said. “[The] amount of cash on the sideline, the amount of buybacks relative to the IPO calendar—i.e., the demand versus supply—is pretty extraordinary. “Then you take the other side of it in fixed income—I think the Fed can cut rates, but until then—you got yield levels, you can create a portfolio with a 6.5%, 7% yield. That’s pretty good.” Rieder added that volatility in equities is relatively low at the moment, minimizing downside risks. Along with bullish signals on the Wall Street side (a token of approval that President Trump has demonstrated is important to him), Rieder is also confident of the need to cut the base rate from its current level of 4.25% to 4.5%. “I think it’s almost a given that they cut [in September],” Rieder said. “You’re seeing some sogginess around job hires, around job openings … more slack coming into the labor market. I still think the funds rate, you can get it down faster and more aggressively than where they are today.” Rieder did say the Fed will have to remain “respectful” of tariff costs. Markets will like this if he wins the Fed role as they, too, are pricing in some level of inflation as a result of the White House’s import cost regime. It will also be a check beside his name in the eyes of analysts, who will see it as a mark of independence from the political rhetoric, which is to insist that foreign governments will “eat” the hikes. President Trump, on the other hand, won’t like hearing talk of tariff inflation. In a note previously reported by Fortune, Goldman Sachs economist Elsie Peng wrote that the majority of tariff costs are likely to be passed through to consumers. This sparked fury from President Trump, who urged Goldman CEO David Solomon to “get a new economist” or consider resigning. The Fed sticks closely to its dual mandate of inflation at a target rate of 2% and maximum employment. The base interest rate is its lever to control these two factors. Breaking with tradition, Rieder suggested the base rate isn’t that useful when it comes to controlling price rises. He noted: “The interest rate tool doesn’t do a lot today. You think about how companies finance capex … You’re not borrowing. The banks are asset liability. The interest rate tool is not that important except for a couple of big factors. What it does to housing, and you look at mortgage applications, building permits, housing starts, new home sales—it’s stuck. “The mortgage rate has to come down, you drop the funds rate, there’s some yield curve [steepening] that probably happens. And then the other side of it is the low-income people who are borrowers. They are getting hurt by this; high-savings older people are actually benefiting from the high rates.” BlackRock declined Fortune’s request for comment. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Thumzup Media to invest $50M into mining as Trump eyes Jerome Powell’s replacement. Thumzup Media, backed by Donald Trump Jr., has raised $50 million to invest in crypto mining and blockchain as Bitcoin reaches a new all-time high. This coincides with President Trump’s latest attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Thumzup Media Corporation, a social media and crypto buying firm linked to Donald Trump Jr., has secured $50 million to push into crypto mining and blockchain bets. The move comes as Bitcoin [BTC] hits a new ATH and President Donald Trump threatens a “major lawsuit” against Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Fresh off a $50 million capital raise through a $10-per-share offering, the firm plans to expand its strategy to include large-scale Bitcoin mining and targeted blockchain investments. Source: thumzupmedia.com Part of the funds will go toward purchasing advanced mining rigs, with talks already underway with technology providers to fast-track deployment. Thumzup, which bought its first Bitcoin in January and now holds 19.1 BTC, joins a growing list of public companies treating crypto as a strategic asset. Donald Trump Jr. owns 350,000 shares in the company. Building on Thumzup’s bullish timing, Bitcoin surged past $123,231 on the 13th of August, a fresh all-time high on Coinbase. The milestone came alongside a record-setting S&P 500, as softer-than-expected inflation data caused optimism in risk markets. July’s CPI held steady at 2.7% year-over-year – below forecasts – while monthly price growth slowed, strengthening bets on a September rate cut. The CME FedWatch tool now pegs those odds at nearly 96%. Source: cmegroup.com Looser monetary policy and an end to quantitative tightening have so far supported Bitcoin’s momentum. Investors also see effects from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill making way for more crypto gains. As Bitcoin’s rally unfolds, the political spotlight is also on the Federal Reserve. President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on Jerome Powell, calling him “Too Late” and claiming “the damage” as “incalculable.” He blasted a $3 billion Fed building project as “a job that should have been a $50 Million Dollar fix up. Not good!” Source: Truth Social Meanwhile, the administration is vetting 11 potential successors for when Powell’s term ends in May. New names in the mix include Jefferies strategist David Zervos, former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey, and BlackRock CIO Rick Rieder. They join a roster of seasoned monetary policy hands. Officials have described the process as “deliberative.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to interview all contenders before narrowing the field for Trump’s decision.

Title: MAGACOIN FINANCE Tipped for 12,000% Gains as Chainlink and Ethereum See $1.4B Whale Inflows

A huge amount of capital is coming to the market. And this time, Ethereum and Chainlink are leading the way. In just the last week alone, over $1.4 billion in whale-sized inflows have been recorded between the two altcoins, suggesting a full-blown altcoin season, according to some analysts. While the major coins get the news, lesser-known but high-conviction tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting serious interest from early-stage investors. After whale wallets cumulatively added $740 million in LINK over five days, Chainlink is back in the spotlight. The recent surge in the adoption of a major cryptocurrency is coinciding with the rapid expansion of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) of Chainlink (LINK). Moreover, there are more than a dozen enterprises that have already onboarded the Chainlink CCIP. In addition, these companies are now using its services to bridge traditional systems and decentralized systems. The LINK token has managed to recover from its June lows and is currently trading around the $19.40 mark with price targets of $24–$26 in the near term. On-chain data indicates big holders are sending coins to cold wallets, which means long-term accumulation. The next CCIP integrations, which some believe could onboard Tier 1 banks, can see much greater upside as real-world assets begin to pick up. Ethereum also had a record-breaking week as institutional capital of $663 million flowed into spot ETH ETFs, thanks to BlackRock, Fidelity and Bitwise. These funds currently hold more than 25 billion worth of ETH. This has further restricted supply on exchanges. ETH’s positive price action appears to be reinforced by ETF flows, while its exchange balance continues to decline, staking continues to grow, and burn via EIP-1559 continues. All together, these fundamentals point to a supply squeeze that can send Ethereum to new heights. ETH price is currently above $4,300, with technical setups targeting $4,700 and $5,000 in the near term. MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver a staggering 43x ROI as whale accumulation hits peak levels, signaling powerful momentum for early investors. Top analysts are tracking unprecedented buying activity from crypto whales, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most-watched coins in the market. With entry windows still open and smart money flowing in, this high-conviction play offers strategic upside before upcoming exchange listings and platform enhancements drive the next wave of demand. As accumulation surges and market positioning strengthens, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands ready to reward investors with exponential growth potential. Whales are likely preparing for what they view as the next altcoin breakout cycle. Chainlink and Ethereum may be attracting billions in capital, but smaller-cap, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is revealing the early signs of something bigger. For investors in search of outsized returns in a crowded space, here lies that opportunity – one of the last before the crowd.

Title: Our corporate leadership class

Some readers may disagree, but I get the sense that corporations, especially large bureaucratic ones, foster leaders who do not possess strong opinions about anything. The leaders that do emerge seem to be pliant creatures who practice a repugnant form of leadership through consensus, continually testing the waters to determine the least offensive position that they might take for the moment. Granted, there are exceptions to this rule like Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, who Trump tapped for Energy Secretary, and even Elon Musk, who despite his dumb-headed notion of an E.V. future for all has strong opinions about where things should head. Why are there so many servile nullities pervading our corporate leadership class? The most prominent case in point, are the CEOs of the oil majors. They spend half their time walking around with their head down and the other half apologizing for the perceived ills their product may have inflicted upon society. I was recently struck by the following passage from an article in The Economist: That includes the oil-and-gas industry, which is struggling to find a way to decarbonise profitably. Murray Auchincloss, bp’s boss, announced a shift away from renewable energy and back to fossil fuels in a ‘fundamental reset’ earlier this year. On July 22nd news broke that Shell, Enbridge and Aker bp, three oil companies, had quit the SBTi’s advisory group set up to define what ‘net zero’ means for oil companies. They are said to have left because they were told achieving it would mean not developing new oil- and gas-fields. For those that have not read The Economist, this is standard fare from a magazine that whole-heartedly embraces the platform of the World Economic Forum. However, my point is that the passage unwittingly reflects poorly on the forward-thinking ability of the CEOs of the three oil companies. They join an advisory group set up to define what “net zero” means for oil companies, only to be told later that achieving it would mean not developing new oil and gas fields. In the words of Homer Simpson, “D’oh!” What explains such cluelessness? One explanation might be the degree to which they are beholden to institutional investors. CEOs cravenly seek the approval of institutional investors who have the power to sink their stock price by selling a large number of shares if they don’t like what they see or hear coming from a CEO. As a class, institutional investors are even worse than CEOs. They are conditioned to rationalize anything. They embrace new (corporate) fashions as enthusiastically as any New York City socialite shopping at Bergdorf Goodman. In the same article referenced earlier, another passage gives one a feel for the mindset of institutional investors: Financial institutions are also backsliding. Along with hsbc, big American banks including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have dropped out of the nzba [Net-Zero Banking Alliance], as have some from Japan and Canada. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a think-tank, estimates that the leavers account for two-fifths of the group’s total assets. The same problems are afflicting similar organisations, such as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. This year Wells Fargo, another American bank, scrapped some of its emissions-reduction plans and in March Switzerland’s ubs pushed back its climate targets after acquiring Credit Suisse. Part of the problem for financial institutions is politics, which was shifting even before Donald Trump returned to the White House. In America Republican senators have suggested that joining a green alliance could breach antitrust rules. Since Mr. Trump’s re-election the pressure has been cranked up. In January ten state attorneys-general wrote to America’s biggest financial firms, including BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, threatening legal action if the companies did not change their climate and diversity policies. What can we infer from the passage about institutional investors? It is not a flattering picture. After years of burdening corporate leaders with having to reach arbitrary net zero metrics, institutional investors are scrapping it as they sense that the public is not buying into the woke agenda. It is a sad indictment of corporate America that CEOs are so cringingly servile and institutional investors so vacuous. Image generated by AI.

Title: Bitcoin hits new all-time high as Fed easing bets and favorable US policy align

Bitcoin blasted through to a new all-time high on Thursday, as a perfect storm of roaring optimism over Federal Reserve policy and a series of powerful pro-crypto reforms converged to send the digital asset into uncharted territory. The move signals a dramatic new phase for a market that has been supercharged by a seismic shift in the US political and regulatory landscape. In early Asian trading, the world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed as much as 0.9% to touch $124,002.49, decisively surpassing the previous peak it set in July. The tidal wave of buying lifted the broader market, with the second−largest token, Ether, surging to 4,780.04—its highest level since the bull market of late 2021. This record-setting rally isn’t a random surge; it’s being powered by a clear confluence of forces. According to IG market analyst Tony Sycamore, Bitcoin’s momentum is a direct result of “increasing certainty of Fed rate cuts, sustained institutional buying and moves by the Trump administration to ease investment in crypto assets.” The technical picture is now just as bullish, with Sycamore noting that a decisive move could open the floodgates for a much larger run. “Technically a sustained break above $125k could propel BTC to $150,000,” he wrote in a note. Since President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, the regulatory environment in the United States has transformed from hostile to overtly favorable. Trump has proudly labeled himself the “crypto president,” and a series of long-sought regulatory wins for the industry have followed throughout 2025, from the passage of landmark stablecoin regulations to a broader overhaul by the securities regulator to accommodate digital assets. The market impact of this policy pivot has been staggering. Bitcoin itself has risen nearly 32% so far in 2025. More broadly, the entire crypto sector’s market capitalization has ballooned from about $2.5 trillion in November 2024, when Trump won the election, to over $4.18 trillion today, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The latest and perhaps most significant tailwind came from an executive order signed last week on Thursday. The order paved the way for crypto assets to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts, a move that could unlock a colossal new wave of mainstream capital for the asset class. This is not just a win for investors; it’s a potential boon for asset management giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, whose crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could become staples of American retirement planning. However, this push into long-term savings is not without its perils. The very volatility that creates spectacular rallies also poses significant risks, especially for retirement accounts that have historically relied on the relative stability of stocks and bonds. For now, though, the market is firmly focused on the upside, celebrating a new era of legitimacy that has sent its leading asset to heights once thought unreachable.

Nothing screams bull market more than an influx of institutional investors and a growing risk appetite from traditional enterprises in crypto assets and the crypto market. We are now seeing this phenomenon play out in real time in the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, such as Ethereum. The second-largest altcoin by market cap has increased by 17% in the past week and is now edging ever so closer to breaching the psychological $5000 barrier for the first time. While this is obviously bullish for Ethereum, it also spells good news for other altcoins in the market, as some of this liquidity and capital are bound to flow into the most hyped tokens at some point as investors look to diversify their portfolios. Analysts believe these three tokens, ENA, ETHFI, and RTX, could benefit from this liquidity spread as the bull market intensifies. There has been a phenomenal increase in the Ethereum price over the past week, with the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap surging by 17%. This is thanks to an influx of liquidity in the token and its various crypto investment products, such as Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts estimate that around $1 billion in liquidity has gone into Ethereum in the past week as investor confidence increases as the bull market intensifies. This means several things. One is that Ethereum could finally breach past the psychological $5000 barrier for the first time since it launched in 2015. It also means that ETH-based tokens could enjoy a price surge shortly, as some of the Ethereum liquidity trickles down into other assets as investors look to diversify their portfolios. Analysts have tipped ENA and ETHFI as possible winners from the scenario, but they’ve also tipped their weight behind RTX, an upcoming native token in the fast-growing PayFi scene. Crypto analysts are throwing all their weight behind Remittix, an upcoming PayFi project with impressive fundamentals, as the bull market intensifies. With the recent Ethereum price boost, analysts believe Remittix’s native token, RTX, could benefit massively from the trickle-down liquidity, causing a price spike when it eventually launches. Remittix has caught the eye of the crypto industry recently, thanks to its impressive and innovative features, most of which are expected to transform the global payments experience.

Shares of crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) soared as high as $102 in initial trades on Wednesday, their first day of action on the New York Stock Exchange before closing at $68. The company priced its initial public offering (IPO) at $37 per share, above the expected $32 to $33 range. That price valued the Cayman Island-based crypto exchange at a total market value of $5.4 billion. Bullish, which is the owner of CoinDesk, earlier this week expanded the amount of shares it sold in its IPO to 20.3 million as investor appetite turned out to be larger than anticipated. Both BlackRock and Ark Investment Management had expressed interest to buy up to $200 million worth of shares. “The last leg of growth in crypto in the last 10 years was basically all retail and if you look now, the institutional wave has begun, it’s here, it’s a question of how big it will be,” Bullish CEO Tom Farley said in an interview with CNBC. Unlike retail-focused exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken, Bullish targets institutional investors seeking exposure to digital assets while relying on the oversight and safeguards of a centralized platform. The exchange saw trading volume of over $1.25 trillion as of March 31, since its launch in 2021, according to a filing. “Bullish's $1.1 billion IPO raise reflects growing institutional confidence in the crypto exchange sector, driven by a favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration and Bitcoin's surge past $100,000,” said Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research. “This success, alongside Circle's strong IPO performance, signals that institutional investors are increasingly viewing centralized exchanges as viable long-term investments. However, sustained confidence will depend on regulatory clarity and market stability,” he said. The company’s debut comes at a time of booming interest in crypto-related projects, specifically from Wall Street, as U.S. regulators are getting close to a regulatory framework for the space, allowing participants to engage in a safe way.
