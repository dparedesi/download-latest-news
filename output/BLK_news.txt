While bitcoin (BTC) proponents commonly view the largest cryptocurrency as a digital version of gold, a new report from global bank Standard Chartered argued investors should see it more like a tech stock with some extra benefits. Led by Geoff Kendrick, the StanChart team said bitcoin's correlation with the Nasdaq has "almost always" been stronger than with gold, the old-school safe haven asset. While BTC may have a role as a place to hide in instances of financial instability like the 2023 regional banking crisis or what might be the unsustainable U.S. debt trajectory, the report said, the reality is that there's rarely a need for such hedges, thus its increasing behavior as more like a traditional tech stock. "Investors can view BTC as both a hedge against traditional finance and as part of their tech allocation," said Kendrick. But, at least "in the short term, BTC may be better viewed as a tech stock than as a hedge against TradFi issues," he added. Playing with the idea of bitcoin as part of a tech portfolio, the report proposed a remodel of the index of the so-called Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) stocks — the mega-cap tech names that have driven overall market returns of late, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta and Tesla (TSLA). This new "Mag 7B" would swap out Tesla for bitcoin. The result? The Mag7B produced consistently higher risk-adjusted returns than the original group over the past seven years, reinforcing BTC's role in a tech-focused portfolio, said Kendrick. The Mag7B outperformed the Mag7 on average by around 1% with nearly 2% lower volatility on an annual basis, a key benefit to institutional investors and large asset allocators, he continued. "BTC should be seen as serving multiple purposes in investor portfolios. This would open up the possibility of even more institutional buying," Kendrick noted. Asset managers have been advocating for including bitcoin in investment portfolios for diversification purposes. For example, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, recommended considering an up to 2% BTC allocation in traditional stock and bond portfolios. Meanwhile, asset managers like 21Shares and Bitwise have launched exchange-traded funds (ETFs) combining gold and bitcoin as complementary assets.

Editor Crypto Aaron Day, Brownstone Institute The walls are closing in on your financial freedom—but not in the way most Americans believe. While the debate rages over the future threat of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), a far more insidious reality has already taken hold: our existing financial system already functions as a digital control grid, monitoring transactions, restricting choices, and enforcing compliance through programmable money. For over two years, my wife and I have traveled across 22 states warning about the rapid expansion of financial surveillance. What began as research into cryptocurrency crackdowns revealed something far more alarming: the United States already operates under what amounts to a CBDC. The Federal Reserve processes over $4 trillion daily through its Oracle database system, while commercial banks impose programmable restrictions on what you can buy and how you can spend your own money. The IRS, NSA, and Treasury Department collect and analyze financial data without meaningful oversight, weaponizing money as a tool of control. This isn’t speculation—it’s documented reality. Now, as President Trump’s Executive Order 14178 ostensibly “bans” CBDCs, his administration is quietly advancing stablecoin legislation that would hand digital currency control to the same banking cartel that owns the Federal Reserve. The STABLE Act and GENIUS Act don’t protect financial privacy—they enshrine financial surveillance into law, requiring strict KYC tracking on every transaction. This isn’t defeating digital tyranny—it’s rebranding it. This article cuts through the distractions to expose a sobering truth: the battle isn’t about stopping a future CBDC—it’s about recognizing the financial surveillance system that already exists. Your financial sovereignty is already under attack, and the last off-ramps are disappearing. The time for complacency has passed. The surveillance state isn’t coming—it’s here. To fully grasp how deeply financial surveillance has already penetrated our lives, we must first understand the terminology being used—and often deliberately obscured—by government officials, central bankers, and financial institutions. The following key definitions will serve as a foundation for our discussion, cutting through the technical jargon to reveal the true nature of what’s at stake: Before diving deeper into the financial surveillance system we face today, let’s establish clear definitions for the key concepts discussed throughout this article: A digital form of central bank money, issued and controlled by a nation’s monetary authority. While often portrayed as a future innovation, I argue in “Fifty Shades of Central Bank Tyranny” that the US dollar already functions as a CBDC, with over 92% existing only as digital entries in Federal Reserve and commercial bank databases. A type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by pegging to an external asset, typically the US dollar. Major examples include: The process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain or database. This applies to both currencies and other assets like real estate, stocks, or commodities. Tokenization enables: A proposed financial infrastructure that would connect central banks, commercial banks, and tokenized assets on a unified digital platform, enabling comprehensive tracking and potential control of all financial assets. Cryptocurrencies specifically designed to preserve transaction privacy and resist surveillance: Currency that contains embedded rules controlling how, when, where, and by whom it can be used. Examples already exist in: Regulatory frameworks require financial institutions to verify customer identities and report suspicious transactions. While ostensibly aimed at preventing crime, these regulations have expanded to create comprehensive financial surveillance with minimal oversight. US laws mandate financial surveillance, eliminate transaction privacy, and grant government agencies broad powers to monitor financial activity without warrants. These laws form the legislative foundation of the current financial control system. Proposed legislation would restrict stablecoin issuance to banks and regulated entities, requiring comprehensive KYC/AML compliance and effectively bringing stablecoins under the same surveillance framework as traditional banking. Understanding these terms is essential for recognizing how our existing financial system already functions as a mechanism of digital control, despite the absence of an officially designated “CBDC.” The greatest sleight of hand in modern finance isn’t cryptocurrency or complex derivatives—it’s convincing Americans they don’t already live under a Central Bank Digital Currency system. Let’s dismantle this illusion by examining how our current dollar already functions as a fully operational CBDC. When most Americans picture money, they imagine physical cash changing hands. Yet this mental image is profoundly outdated—92% of all US currency exists solely as digital entries in databases, with no physical form whatsoever. The Federal Reserve, our central bank, doesn’t create most new money by printing bills; it generates it by adding numbers to an Oracle database. This process begins when the government sells Treasury securities (IOUs) to the Federal Reserve. Where does the Fed get money to buy these securities? It simply adds digits to its database—creating money from nothing. The government then pays its bills through its account at the Fed, transferring these digital dollars to vendors, employees, and benefit recipients. The Fed’s digital infrastructure processes over $4 trillion in transactions daily, all without a single physical dollar changing hands. This isn’t some small experimental system—it’s the backbone of our entire economy. Commercial banks extend this digital system. When you deposit money, the bank records it in their Microsoft or Oracle database. Through fractional reserve banking, they then create additional digital money—up to 9 times your deposit—to loan to others. This multiplication happens entirely in databases, with no new physical currency involved. Until recently, banks were required to keep 10% of deposits as reserves at the Federal Reserve. Covid-19 legislation removed even this minimal requirement, though most banks still maintain similar levels for operational reasons. The key point remains: the dollar predominantly exists as entries in a network of databases controlled by the Fed and commercial banks. Those who fear a future CBDC’s ability to program and restrict money use miss a crucial reality: our current digital dollars already have these capabilities built in. Consider these existing examples: These aren’t theoretical capabilities—they’re operational today, using the exact same digital dollar infrastructure we already have. The surveillance apparatus for our digital dollars is equally established. The Bank Secrecy Act mandates that financial institutions report “suspicious” transactions, while the Patriot Act expanded these monitoring requirements dramatically. The IRS uses artificial intelligence to scrutinize spending patterns across millions of accounts, while the NSA bulk collects financial data through programs revealed by Edward Snowden. This surveillance enables active censorship, as demonstrated during Canada’s trucker protests in 2022, when banks froze accounts of donors without judicial review. Similar account freezes have targeted individuals ranging from Kanye West to Dr. Joseph Mercola—all using the existing digital dollar system. In March 2025, the Treasury intensified this framework, lowering the cash transaction reporting threshold from $10,000 to $200 across 30 ZIP codes near the southwest border, subjecting over a million Americans to heightened scrutiny under the guise of curbing illicit activity. When politicians and central bankers claim we don’t have a CBDC, they’re playing a game of definitions. The substantive elements that define a CBDC—digital creation, central bank issuance, programmability, surveillance, and censorship capability—are all present in our current system. The debate over implementing a “new” CBDC is largely a distraction. We’re not discussing whether to create a digital dollar—we’re discussing whether to acknowledge the one we already have and how to modify its architecture to further enhance surveillance and control. Understanding this reality is the first step toward recognizing that the battle for financial privacy and autonomy isn’t about stopping some future implementation—it’s about confronting and reforming a system already firmly in place. The government justifies financial surveillance under the guise of fighting terrorism, money laundering, and organized crime, but the data tells a different story. Since the passage of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) in 1970 and the Patriot Act in 2001, the US government has accumulated trillions of financial records on ordinary Americans, yet these laws have failed to curb financial crime. Instead, they have been used to target political dissidents, seize assets without due process, and criminalize cash transactions. These financial laws were never about stopping crime—they were about controlling the people. Meanwhile, the same government that demands total visibility over our money has lost track of trillions and even funneled taxpayer dollars directly to terrorist groups. If financial transparency is so important, perhaps the US Treasury should be the first to comply. Before we delve deeper, let’s cut through the noise and define the true stakes—because the focus on banning a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and vilifying the Federal Reserve misses the bigger picture. President Trump and others have zeroed in on the Federal Reserve as the architect of digital tyranny, with a public blame game unfolding as the Fed, federal government, and commercial banks point fingers at each other like squabbling overlords. But this distraction obscures the real enemy: a government surveillance apparatus that already tracks, programs, and censors our money, paving the way for digital tyranny—social credit systems, digital IDs, vaccine passports, and more. The Federal Reserve is just one cog; the government’s machinery, backed by the banks that own the Fed, is the true enforcer. My two-year crusade against Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) stems from a chilling realization: the endgame isn’t just controlling our money—it’s digitizing all our assets—money, stocks, bonds, real estate, and more—under a global ledger with the same tracking and programmability as CBDCs. As I detail in my book The Final Countdown, this vision involves CBDCs paired with Regulated Liability Networks (RLNs), systems designed to tokenize every financial instrument—stocks, bonds, and beyond—settling only in CBDCs. Countries like the US, those in Europe, the UK, and Japan are developing their own RLNs, engineered to interoperate, creating a seamless global ledger. The ultimate aim, rooted in the technocracy movement since the 1930s, is a single digital currency backed by energy credits, tying our wealth to resource consumption and a social credit system. This isn’t speculation—it’s a deliberate blueprint. RLNs enable central banks and governments to monitor and program every asset, ensuring compliance with policies like carbon limits or social scores. The technocracy movement, founded by figures like Howard Scott in the 1930s, envisioned energy as the basis of economic value, a concept now resurfacing in digital form. This global ledger threatens to erase ownership and freedom, a reality already taking shape as governments and banks tighten their grip. This sets the stage to uncover how the US government’s surveillance machine, already in motion, accelerates this dystopian future. The US government has perfected financial surveillance long before any CBDC label was applied, as I detailed in my Brownstone Institute article “Fifty Shades of Central Bank Tyranny.” The National Security Agency (NSA) bulk collects financial data on domestic and international transactions, a revelation from Edward Snowden exposing its access to phone calls, internet communications, and undersea cable intercepts—turning your bank account into a government peephole. The IRS, wielding artificial intelligence, scrutinizes spending patterns with chilling precision, as seen in Rebecca Brown’s 2015 case, where $91,800 was seized via civil asset forfeiture for no crime, or the IRS’s recent mandate forcing Venmo and PayPal to report transactions over $600, ensnaring even the smallest earners. These AI tools transform every purchase into a potential target for government scrutiny. The Patriot Act amplifies this overreach, authorizing warrantless wiretapping and data collection, while National Security Letters (NSLs)—like the one silencing Nick Merrill in 2004, gagging him from consulting a lawyer about FBI demands—ensure silence under threat of law. The Bank Secrecy Act compels banks to report “suspicious” activity, fueling Operation Chokepoint 2.0, where commercial banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America froze accounts of dissenters—Kanye West, Melania and Barron Trump, Dr. Joseph Mercola—often exceeding federal directives. Congress, not the Fed, drives this surveillance juggernaut, embedding it through bipartisan laws like the Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, CARES Act, and the addition of 87,000 armed IRS agents poised to audit the average citizen. Focusing solely on the Federal Reserve as the villain is a distinction without a difference. The Fed, a private entity veiled in secrecy, is owned by the largest commercial banks—JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and others—forming a cartel that profits from the system, as G. Edward Griffin’s The Creature from Jekyll Island exposes. Its digital money creation feeds these banks, which multiply it through fractional reserves. Eliminating the Fed and letting the government issue currency directly, as Senator Ron Wyden advocates—a stance I challenged at a conference where he opposed CBDCs but endorsed government control—wouldn’t end surveillance; it would intensify it. Wyden’s vision centralizes power further, removing the Fed’s buffer and amplifying government oversight with no accountability. The real threat lies in the system’s design: digital money is already tracked and censored by government decree. Whether it’s the Fed’s Oracle databases or banks’ Microsoft systems, the infrastructure is programmable, enabling control without new laws—just new rules, crafted daily in backrooms. This surveillance machine, not the Fed alone, drives us toward a dystopian future where every transaction fuels tyranny. With this system already entrenched in the US, the global race for CBDCs—and the US’s pivot to stablecoins under the STABLE and GENIUS Acts—only accelerates the spread of this control, amplifying the threat both abroad and at home. We must confront this escalating reality head-on to grasp the full scope of the battle for our financial freedom. Even with President Trump’s Executive Order (EO) 14178, signed on January 23, 2025, banning the Federal Reserve and other US agencies from pursuing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the global race to develop CBDCs has not slowed down—it’s actually speeding up. Before the EO, 134 countries and currency unions, representing 98% of global GDP, were actively exploring CBDCs, according to the Atlantic Council’s Central Bank Digital Currency Tracker. With the US stepping back from explicit CBDC work, that number drops to 133 countries. The US accounts for approximately 26% of global GDP (based on 2024 World Bank estimates of a $105 trillion global GDP, with the US contributing $27 trillion). Subtracting the US share, the remaining 133 countries still represent about 72% of global GDP—a massive portion of the world economy—continuing their CBDC efforts. Meanwhile, the US has shifted its focus to a backdoor approach through stablecoins, empowering commercial banks and the Federal Reserve to extend digital control at the expense of privacy and decentralized finance (DeFi). The US pivot isn’t just about stablecoins like Tether and USDC—it’s a broader strategy codified in two legislative proposals: the STABLE Act (House, February 6, 2025) and the GENIUS Act (Senate, February 4, 2025). These bills restrict stablecoin issuance to insured depository institutions, federal nonbanks, and state-regulated entities, effectively handing the reins to big banks like JPMorgan Chase and the Federal Reserve’s network of member banks. The STABLE Act bans unauthorized issuers, while the GENIUS Act prohibits unapproved payment stablecoins, ensuring only the financial elite can play. Both mandate strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, turning every transaction into a surveillance opportunity. Algorithmic stablecoins used in DeFi platforms, which thrive on anonymity and decentralization, are effectively sidelined, as banks and the Fed tighten their grip on the digital dollar ecosystem. This isn’t innovation—it’s a power grab, cloaked as financial stability. The pace of global CBDC development remains striking. In May 2020, only 35 countries were exploring CBDCs. By early 2025, that number had ballooned to 134 before the US exit, with 65 in advanced stages—development, pilot, or launch. Every G20 country except the US is now involved, with 19 in advanced stages and 13 running pilots, including Brazil, Japan, India, Australia, Russia, and Turkey. Three countries—the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria—have fully launched retail CBDCs, and 44 pilots are ongoing worldwide. This momentum persists despite Trump’s ban, as other nations see CBDCs as a way to modernize payments, enhance financial inclusion, and compete geopolitically, especially with China’s digital yuan (e-CNY) pilot, the largest globally, reaching 260 million people. Recent developments underscore this acceleration. In Israel, the Bank of Israel released a 110-page design document in early March 2025, detailing plans for a Digital Shekel. This follows years of research and aligns with Israel’s participation in a 2022 project with the Bank for International Settlements to test international retail and remittance payments using CBDCs. The Digital Shekel aims to improve transaction efficiency and financial access across its tech-savvy population, marking a significant step toward implementation. In the European Union, the European Central Bank (ECB) is pressing forward with its digital euro, targeting a rollout by October 2025. ECB President Christine Lagarde has been vocal about this timeline, stating in a recent address, “We are on track to introduce the digital euro by October this year, offering a secure and programmable complement to cash that ensures financial inclusion while maintaining privacy standards.” This follows the ECB’s October 2023 decision to enter the preparation phase for a digital retail euro, with a focus on both retail and wholesale applications. The EU’s push reflects a broader European trend, with countries like Sweden and the UK also advancing CBDC pilots, aiming to reduce reliance on US-dominated payment networks like Visa and Mastercard. Across the Atlantic, Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, who assumed office in March 2025, brings a pro-CBDC stance to the table. Carney, a former Governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020, has long advocated for digital currencies as a tool for financial innovation. During his tenure at the Bank of England, he oversaw early CBDC research, including the July 2019 CBDC Technology Forum, which laid the groundwork for the digital pound. Carney’s alignment with the World Economic Forum (WEF), where he has been a prominent figure pushing for sustainable finance and digital transformation, further underscores his support for CBDCs. The WEF has been a strong advocate for CBDCs, hosting roundtables through 2023 to promote interoperable designs. Under Carney’s leadership, Canada is likely to accelerate its CBDC efforts, building on the Bank of Canada’s 2023 analytical note emphasizing offline payment functionality—a move that could deepen digital control over Canadian finances. Despite Trump’s EO, the global CBDC train is charging ahead, with the US taking a detour through stablecoins that empower banks and the Fed while stifling privacy and DeFi. The Digital Shekel, the EU’s October rollout, and Canada’s new leadership under Carney show that the world isn’t waiting for the US to catch up—it’s forging a digital future where control, not freedom, may be the ultimate prize. The STABLE Act and GENIUS Act, introduced in early 2025, represent a significant pivot in US financial policy. Rather than directly pursuing a CBDC, these bills create a framework for privately issued digital dollars that would achieve the same surveillance and control objectives while appearing to maintain separation between government and the digital currency system. While President Trump’s Executive Order 14178 explicitly banned the Federal Reserve from developing a CBDC, his administration has simultaneously championed these stablecoin bills. This isn’t a contradiction—it’s a calculated strategy to implement the same control mechanisms through different channels. Under both bills, if you bought a stablecoin through an exchange like Coinbase, your transaction would be: 1) tied to your verified identity, 2) reported to the Treasury Department’s FinCEN database, 3) subject to freezing if flagged by surveillance algorithms, and 4) potentially programmable to restrict certain purchases. This mirrors the control mechanisms of a CBDC but through private intermediaries. The distinction between the bills is largely one of scope and timing. The STABLE Act, sponsored by Representatives French Hill (R-AR) and Bryan Steil (R-WI), takes a more comprehensive approach, covering all stablecoins and giving the Federal Reserve primary authority. The GENIUS Act, introduced by Senators Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), focuses specifically on payment stablecoins and preserves some role for state regulators. What neither bill does is protect financial privacy or enable true peer-to-peer transactions. Both require strict Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, ensuring every digital dollar is tied to a verified identity. Both mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, guaranteeing ongoing surveillance of transactions. And neither contains provisions preventing the implementation of programmable restrictions on how these digital dollars can be used. These bills would fundamentally transform existing stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC): Tether (USDT), currently the largest stablecoin with a $140 billion market cap as of early 2025, would face significant challenges under both bills. Based outside the US in the British Virgin Islands, Tether would likely be forced to either register as a US entity (bringing it under direct regulatory control) or potentially lose access to the US market altogether under the STABLE Act. The GENIUS Act might allow continued operation with strict compliance requirements. USD Coin (USDC), the second-largest stablecoin ($25 billion market cap), is better positioned for compliance given its US-based issuer, Circle, and its backing from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. However, even USDC would face enhanced surveillance requirements, likely resulting in more transaction reporting and potential restrictions on transfers to non-KYC addresses. The likely outcome is a stablecoin ecosystem dominated by large financial institutions—the same banks that own the Federal Reserve—with comprehensive tracking of all transactions and programmable controls available to government agencies. The GENIUS Act is more likely to pass, given its bipartisan Senate support and alignment with the Trump administration’s priorities. With backing from influential figures like David Sacks (Trump’s Crypto/AI Czar) and Howard Lutnick (Commerce Secretary), the bill has momentum for passage before April 2025—well within Trump’s first 100 days. The Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the bill (18-6) on March 13, 2025. While proponents frame these bills as innovative alternatives to CBDCs, the reality is they implement the same surveillance capabilities through private intermediaries. In some ways, this approach could be even more dangerous than a direct CBDC, as it creates the illusion of market-driven money while embedding government control mechanisms throughout the system. Understanding these bills reveals why Trump’s Executive Order banning CBDCs while promoting stablecoins isn’t the victory for financial freedom it appears to be. The same surveillance infrastructure is being built—just with different logos on the digital dollars controlling your financial life. At first glance, the STABLE and GENIUS Acts appear to simply regulate stablecoins. But in reality, they are part of a coordinated effort to centralize financial control under a permissioned, government-approved digital system. This system is designed to: This isn’t just speculation. The foundation for this system is already being built: Together, these initiatives lay the groundwork for a fully digitized, permissioned economy where financial freedom is an illusion. Stablecoins, far from being an alternative to CBDCs, are simply the stepping stones to the exact same outcome—one where every transaction is monitored, every asset is controlled, and dissent can be silenced with a keystroke. This is no different from past government moves to strip financial autonomy from the people. In 1933, Executive Order 6102 made it illegal for Americans to own gold, forcing citizens to turn in their gold in exchange for rapidly devaluing paper money. Today, stablecoins serve the same purpose: they lure users into digital systems that the government and banks can easily control—until the day they decide to seize or restrict access to funds, just like they did with gold. The history of government intervention in money should serve as a stark warning: whatever financial tool the state encourages is likely designed for its benefit, not yours. Government financial control is not just a historical pattern—it is happening in real time. The same tactics used to demonetize gold in 1933 and remove cash from circulation today are being deployed through digital assets. The following case studies prove that stablecoins are already being used as tools for financial censorship—demonstrating exactly why privacy-preserving alternatives are necessary. Stablecoins are often marketed as a decentralized, private alternative to fiat currency—but real-world examples prove that they are not censorship-resistant and can be frozen at any time by issuers or regulators. In August 2022, the US Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, a privacy protocol used on the Ethereum blockchain. This led to immediate censorship by stablecoin issuers: This demonstrated that stablecoins are not censorship-resistant and can be weaponized just as easily as bank accounts. When FTX imploded in late 2022, authorities quickly pressured stablecoin issuers to freeze assets tied to the platform. This proves that stablecoins are not self-sovereign money—they are corporate-controlled assets that can be frozen, blacklisted, or seized at any moment. Trump’s executive order sounds like a win for liberty. It bans the Fed from creating or promoting a new CBDC, citing risks to privacy and financial stability. It even revokes Obama-era plans for digital dollar experiments. But dig deeper, and it’s not so simple. The order doesn’t touch the Fed’s existing digital system—because it’s not seen as a “new” CBDC. So, the control we already have stays intact. Worse, the order cheers on “dollar-backed stablecoins” like Tether and USDC, private digital currencies pegged to the dollar, as a means to maintain global financial dominance. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a vocal advocate for Trump’s tech-driven agenda, has been clear about the administration’s enthusiasm. At the White House Digital Assets Summit, he stated, “Technology is at the foundation of the Trump presidency. He understands technology, he embraces technology, and he’s going to use technology to drive America forward.” Specifically on stablecoins, Lutnick added, “The blockchain and Bitcoin technology are a key part of that thinking and embracing that.” The message is unmistakable: stablecoins are a strategic tool to extend the dollar’s global reach, but they come with significant risks to privacy and autonomy. David Sacks, Trump’s Crypto/AI Czar and chair of the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, is overseeing this regulatory push. While he hasn’t directly commented on these bills, his focus on balancing innovation with oversight suggests support for a controlled stablecoin ecosystem. Sacks’ role implies a stance like, “We’ll foster stablecoins, but only under strict rules.” Both bills mandate stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, meaning every transaction is tracked and monitored. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a Wall Street veteran, reinforces this approach. Though Bessent has been reserved in public statements, his alignment with financial stability suggests he’d back these measures, likely echoing the administration’s line: “Stablecoins must be secure and compliant to protect the dollar’s global standing.” The administration’s support is unequivocal. Lutnick has emphasized the strategic importance of stablecoins, stating, “We’re going to use digital assets to pound forward, and Donald Trump is leading the way.” He’s also targeted offshore issuers like Tether, noting, “America will set the standards, and the world will follow.” The GENIUS Act reflects this by allowing offshore stablecoins to operate in the US only if they comply with American regulations, while the STABLE Act takes a harder line, likely restricting their use entirely. This isn’t just about competition—it’s about control. Here’s the rub: Tether and USDC aren’t saints. Tether’s reserves are murky—some say it’s not fully backed by dollars, just a mix of assets. USDC is clearer, but it’s still Circle’s word, not the Fed’s guarantee. If these become our digital money, we’re trading central bank control for corporate control—or both, if banks and the Fed team up. The Fed, after all, is owned by its member banks—think JPMorgan Chase and Citibank—blurring the line between public and private power. Whether it’s Fed Chair Jerome Powell or JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon issuing a digital dollar, the result is the same: pervasive tracking and control. The STABLE and GENIUS Acts amplify this risk by enforcing KYC/AML compliance, effectively killing algorithmic stablecoins, and stifling decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that thrive on anonymity. Innovation is curtailed, as only bank-approved stablecoins can flourish. The order’s push for “open access” to blockchain sounds promising, but stablecoins can freeze funds just as easily. In 2022, USDC blacklisted wallets tied to sanctions. Programmable? Check. Censorable? Check. It’s the same beast, a different logo. My article flagged CBDCs as tools for “technocratic control”—tracking us, nudging behavior with coded rules. Stablecoins do that already, and Trump’s order, backed by these bills, could supercharge them. The Fed’s digital reserves are at least predictable; private stablecoins add a wild card. If they dominate, we’re not dodging tyranny—we’re outsourcing it to corporate interests under the guise of innovation. The Trump administration’s embrace of stablecoins as a key element of its financial strategy, formalized in Executive Order 14178 (signed January 23, 2025), leverages the expertise of figures tied to USDC and Tether, marking a stark contrast to the Biden administration’s less decisive approach. Unlike Biden’s team, which struggled to advance coherent stablecoin regulation despite years of discussion, Trump’s administration draws on a network of current and former officials with deep fintech experience, capable of shaping and executing a robust stablecoin framework. Both USDC and Tether, dominant stablecoins with billions in circulation, have established operational ties to this administration, equipping it with the technical and financial know-how to integrate these assets into broader economic policy, far beyond what Biden’s tenure achieved. David Sacks, appointed as Trump’s Crypto/AI Czar and chair of the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, has ties to USD Coin (USDC) through its issuer, Circle Internet Financial. A former PayPal executive, Sacks shares a history with Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire as part of the “PayPal Mafia,” a network of early PayPal leaders who have shaped fintech. Sacks served as PayPal’s COO until 2002, while Allaire joined briefly via the 2000 X.com merger, though no direct collaboration between them is documented. Circle’s $1 million USDC donation to Trump’s Inauguration Committee on January 9, 2025, aligns with this network, with Allaire stating, “We are excited to be building a great American company, and the fact that the Committee took payment in USDC is an indicator of…the potential and power of digital dollars.” Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s Treasury Secretary from 2017 to 2021, deepens the USDC connection through his extensive ties to Goldman Sachs and fintech networks. Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs, leaving in 2002 as a partner and executive, years before the firm invested $50 million in Circle in 2018 and additional funds in 2022. While he had no direct role in those investments, Goldman’s backing of Circle—confirmed by Circle’s Series E funding announcement—links Mnuchin’s Wall Street orbit to USDC’s growth. Circle’s other major investor, BlackRock, contributed $8 million in April 2022 and manages a portion of USDC’s reserves, further tying the stablecoin to Trump’s financial sphere, where BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has served as an informal advisor since the 2024 election. Mnuchin’s ties to USDC extend through his collaboration with Brian Brooks at OneWest Bank, where Mnuchin was chairman and Brooks served as chairman from 2014 to 2015, per corporate records. Brooks later became Coinbase’s chief legal officer from 2018 to 2020, during which he worked with Circle on USDC’s development as co-founder of the Centre Consortium, which managed the stablecoin until its dissolution in 2023. Brooks’ advocacy for private-sector digital currencies—articulated in a July 2020 Yahoo Finance article where he argued the private sector should lead US digital dollar efforts—directly supported USDC’s rise. Appointed Acting Comptroller of the Currency under Mnuchin in May 2020, Brooks issued guidance (e.g., OCC Interpretive Letter 1174) allowing national banks to hold stablecoin reserves, a move that benefited Circle’s operations. This interplay between Mnuchin’s Treasury tenure, his prior Goldman Sachs network, and Brooks’ regulatory actions illustrates a revolving door between government and fintech that bolstered USDC. Lutnick’s ties to Tether are even more direct and controversial. Cantor Fitzgerald, under Lutnick’s leadership, has been Tether’s primary US banking partner since 2021, managing billions in US Treasury bills that allegedly back USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin with a $140 billion market cap as of early 2025. Cantor earns tens of millions annually in fees for this role and, according to a November 2024 Wall Street Journal report, acquired a 5% stake in Tether for $600 million last year. Lutnick’s firm also agreed to collaborate with Tether on a $2 billion Bitcoin-backed lending program, announced in November 2024, further entwining their interests. His vocal defense of Tether—claiming at the 2024 World Economic Forum, “From what we’ve seen…they have the money they say they have”—has drawn scrutiny, especially given Tether’s history of opacity. Investigative journalist Whitney Webb and YouTuber Coffeezilla have raised questions about Tether’s solvency and financial transparency. Webb, in her 2022 book One Nation Under Blackmail, critiques Tether’s opaque reserve practices, while Coffeezilla, in his 2023 video “Tether: The Stablecoin Scandal,” highlights its reliance on attestations rather than independent audits. He points to Tether’s reserves including non-Treasury assets like gold and Bitcoin, as well as loans to third parties, raising doubts about its ability to maintain a 1:1 dollar peg under stress. Both note Tether’s partnership with Cantor Fitzgerald, which has managed its US Treasury holdings since 2021, though the firm’s role doesn’t fully resolve concerns about the stablecoin’s backing Lutnick’s influence extends beyond finance. Tether’s $775 million investment in Rumble, a conservative streaming platform, in December 2024—reportedly facilitated by Lutnick’s ties to the Trump camp—illustrates how stablecoin profits intersect with political agendas. Rumble, previously taken public by Lutnick’s associate and Trump ally Peter Thiel, benefits from Tether’s capital, further aligning crypto with Trump’s political network. The STABLE Act (House, February 6, 2025) and GENIUS Act (Senate, February 4, 2025) exacerbate this control, restricting stablecoin issuance to banks and Fed-aligned entities, with KYC/AML mandates ensuring pervasive tracking. This benefits Circle and Tether, whose investors—like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock for Circle, and Cantor Fitzgerald for Tether—profit while the Fed extends its influence. DeFi platforms are sidelined, as Lutnick pushes the agenda: “We’re going to use digital assets to pound forward, and Donald Trump is leading the way.” The ties to USDC and Tether—from Sacks, Lutnick, Mnuchin, and Brooks—illustrate a pattern of cronyism. These stablecoins, already used for surveillance and censorship, enable the same control a CBDC would, but under a private label, cloaking digital tyranny in innovation while consolidating power for banks and the Fed at the public’s expense. Fiat currencies are not designed to last. Their very structure—money created from debt, backed by trust rather than tangible assets—ensures an eventual collapse. Governments exploit fiat to expand their power, printing limitless money to fund wars, social programs, and bailouts, all while devaluing the savings of everyday citizens. This isn’t speculation; it’s historical fact. Across centuries, fiat systems have crumbled under their own weight. Whether through hyperinflation, political mismanagement, or shifts in global influence, fiat currencies inevitably deteriorate. The only question is how long before the breaking point is reached. The US dollar, despite its dominance, is following the same trajectory. The following table outlines the recurring patterns of fiat currency collapse, offering a roadmap for what awaits the dollar: While the dollar remains the world’s reserve currency, its long-term survival is far from guaranteed. The same forces that have toppled past fiat systems—debt expansion, declining trust, and technological disruption—are accelerating. Below is a snapshot of the dollar’s mounting vulnerabilities: The US government and financial institutions are building a system where transactions can be monitored and controlled, using tools like stablecoins and digital IDs. Privacy coins offer a way out. Monero (XMR), Zano (ZANO), and Kaurma aren’t just for extreme cases—they’re for anyone who values financial independence. Without them, every payment and asset risks being tracked or restricted. “Privacy isn’t a luxury—it’s a tool for self-reliance.” Using these coins means choosing economic freedom in a world leaning toward centralized control. Financial surveillance is advancing, even without central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Stablecoins, backed by laws like the STABLE Act and GENIUS Act, require identity tracking. Decades-old rules—like the Bank Secrecy Act and Patriot Act—already monitor transactions, while the Treasury flags small payments like $600. This isn’t hypothetical—it’s active policy. Privacy coins provide an alternative to a system where money is permission-based. Reforming this from within isn’t an option. State-linked money—be it CBDCs, stablecoins, or bank deposits—comes with oversight. True sovereignty lies in decentralized, private systems: These aren’t theories—they’re working solutions for trading and storing value without interference. That’s why they’re under pressure from regulators. Cash is increasingly suspect. Stablecoins can be frozen instantly. Privacy coins like Monero and Zano face scrutiny—not for flaws, but for restoring confidentiality lost to modern finance. The choice is clear: full surveillance or real autonomy. In a world where money shapes power, this is about practical survival. Picture your accounts locked—not for fraud, but for a flagged donation. Your stablecoins are useless, cards declined. Only the Monero or Zano you secured earlier remains. This has happened globally—thousands have lost access overnight. As surveillance tightens, exiting gets harder. Act while the path is open. The stakes are real, and the time is now.

(Bloomberg) -- Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab Corp. are prohibiting clients from investing in money-market ETFs on their trading platforms, an unusual move for the financial powerhouses who typically permit easy access to funds that already trade on an exchange. The two firms are blocking purchases of three exchange-traded funds offered by BlackRock Inc. and Texas Capital, the first to track money—market securities such as Treasury bills and other government-backed debt in an ETF structure. The new funds serve as a direct challenge to mutual-fund providers, who have long been big, established players in money-market products. Fidelity and Schwab alone manage trillions of dollars in money-market assets, and just last week, Schwab filed plans to launch its own government money-market ETF. A Schwab spokesperson said its decision is consistent with the firm’s “long-standing approach” of only making available Schwab affiliate money-market mutual funds, while a Fidelity spokesperson said this is an extension of the company’s policy to “generally restrict” third-party money-market mutual funds. Yet, the move stands out because trading platforms like Schwab and Fidelity typically don’t restrict exchange-traded funds, even if those funds are in competition with existing in-house offerings. “I’ve never seen this with any other ETFs,” said Mike Younkman, CIO at Ankerstar Wealth, a firm with roughly $110 million in assets under management, who had been investing in Texas Capital’s MMKT for his advisory clients, and was “disappointed that earlier this year, it went into a sell-only mode with Schwab, likely because they’re having a competitor product.” Younkman’s firm sold out of his MMKT position due to the platform ban, and instead shifted client assets back into the short-term bond ETF he held before money-market ETFs began trading. He said the move caused some operational headaches but shouldn’t ultimately weigh on investor returns. The restriction underscores how the growth of the ETF and race to put even more novel strategies into the fund is creating more competition throughout the asset management world and introducing wrinkles for issuers seeking to distribute funds. Under the banner of democratizing access to strategies through the tax-efficient vehicle, ETF issuers have managed to list their offerings with relative ease on both Fidelity and Schwab, which are two of the largest brokerage firms in the US. The ease of listing is changing, though, as ETFs grow. Last year, Fidelity imposed new fees on some ETF firms, in return for listing and maintaining the products on its massive platform. The latest move has taken some investors by surprise. “It was pretty shocking to have them come out and say you can’t buy this anymore,” said Jeremy Ingram, CEO and CIO at Beacon Harbor Wealth Advisors, who had invested in MMKT for his advisory clients. “It’s not like some exotic investment — it’s a money market.” Texas Capital in a statement said “it is unfortunate and surprising that Schwab and Fidelity would restrict their clients’ ability to purchase MMKT,” adding the fund “remains an important tool for investors to manage their cash, one we believe should be available in the same way that investors can purchase any NYSE-listed security.” A BlackRock spokesperson noted that the firm’s iShares money-market ETFs “unlock access to professional grade cash management strategies in the convenience of the ETF wrapper, providing additional choice and flexibility for investors.” Investors have flocked to money markets over the last several years, in large part due to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate-hiking cycle that sent short-term rates above 5%. While the US central bank has begun to ease monetary policy, these rates are still high enough to keep pulling cash toward money-market funds, which saw their assets rise to an all-time high of more than $7 trillion recently. Fidelity has roughly $1.5 trillion in registered money-market fund assets under management, while Schwab is home to about $650 billion. Texas Capital’s fund was the first ETF to follow the so-called Rule 2a-7 — a provision of a 1940s Securities and Exchange Commission law that governs money-market funds. In February, BlackRock followed up by launching its Government Money Market ETF and Prime Money Market ETF. The ETFs aren’t required to maintain a stable net asset value of $1, meaning investors can be exposed to some downside risk. Texas Capital’s fund has seen relatively little inflows this year, after pulling in about $40 million last year. BlackRock’s prime money-market fund has taken in roughly $43 million in inflows since launching in February. Its government offering has taken in a net $8 million.

Title: Is The AI Boom Headed For Its ‘Dark Fiber’ Moment?

ByDan Runkevicius ByDan Runkevicius , Senior Contributor. LAS VEGAS, USA - JANUARY 06: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addresses participants at the keynote of CES ... More 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 6, 2025. During the presentation, Huang unveiled a range of new chips, software, and services, reinforcing Nvidia's leadership in artificial intelligence computing and its continued innovation across industries. (Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The late ’90s internet gold rush wasn’t just one giant bubble of flashy startups; it was an intertwined cluster of smaller bubbles that fed off each other. The poster children of the dot-com bust were household names like Pets.com and eToys.com — early e-commerce pioneers. Beneath them were telecoms that burned through hundreds of billions to provide internet access. But peel back another layer, and you’ll find a little-known frenzy that fizzled a few years after the dot-com crash — fiber optic companies that promised to build the rails for telecoms. Fiber optic cables weren’t a new invention in the 1990s. They’ve been around since the 1970s, but earlier-generation fiber could transmit only a fraction of the bandwidth they can today. The breakthrough was a technology called Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), which allowed multiple wavelengths — or data streams — to travel through a single fiber instead of just one. That dramatically increased the bandwidth and cost-efficiency of fiber optic infrastructure. Ciena was the first company to commercially deploy WDM. In 1996, it landed a massive $200 million contract with Sprint — then America’s third-largest carrier — to upgrade its fiber network to carry 16 wavelengths instead of one. Kevin Kimberlin, co-founder of Ciena, called it “the real dawn of the internet.” The advances in fiber optics marked a turning point, convincing investors the internet was real — and that its applications could scale far faster than previously imagined. After Ciena’s IPO in 1997, the stock surged 10x in a few years on projections that pointed to an explosion in internet bandwidth. At the time, Forbes reported, “the total bandwidth of communications systems will triple every year for the next 25 years.” Meanwhile, fiber optics conferences — once-niche engineering gatherings — became must-attend events for the tech world. In the lead-up to the dot-com bust, attendance at the Optical Fiber Communications (OFC) conference — the world’s largest optics event — grew more than fivefold in just a few years. Excitement over WDM’s potential helped usher in a massive infrastructure boom in the late '90s. In the five years following the Telecommunications Act of 1996, telecoms poured over $500 billion — mostly financed with debt — into laying fiber optic cables, adding switches, and building wireless networks. Not only was most of that spending debt-financed, it was also frontloaded, meaning demand hadn’t caught up yet. After the dot-com bust, dreams of internet bandwidth tripling every few months quickly unraveled, exposing massive overinvestment in fiber. As demand for fiber collapsed, so did the companies that built it. Many fiber firms went bankrupt. Those that survived shed nearly all their pre-dot-com value. Corning — then the world’s largest producer of optical fiber — saw its stock crash from nearly $100 in 2000 to around $1 by 2002. Meanwhile, Ciena’s revenue fell from $1.6 billion to $300 million almost overnight, and its stock plunged 98% from its peak. Both companies are still around today. Although not a household name, Ciena’s fiber optics hardware and software remain one of the main building blocks powering the modern internet. But even two decades later, its value hasn’t come close to its dot-com peak. The crash also left behind a glut of unused fiber that was latter dubbed “dark fiber.” By various estimates, 85% to 95% of fiber laid in the '90s sat unused after the bubble burst. The dot-com bubble burst, dragging down companies like Ciena, not because the internet was a fad. The internet did change the world. It just didn’t happen as fast as its early pioneers promised it would. Fast forward 25 years, another multi-hundred-billion-dollar infrastructure boom is underway — this time to power AI, a technology once again promised to change the world for good. Over the past year, Big Tech has gone full throttle on capital expenditures (capex) — much of it aimed at building massive data centers packed with specialized AI chips known as “AI accelerators.” America’s hyperscalers — Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft — have pledged to spend a record $320 billion on capex this year alone, a massive 40% jump from last year’s record-setting $230 billion. For perspective, that’s roughly two-thirds of all inflation-adjusted capital spent on telecom fiber optics during the entire 1990s — over a single year and driven by just four companies. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg threw down his own marker this year. On the company’s most recent earnings call, he unveiled plans for Meta’s largest AI data center yet the size of Manhattan. “I announced last week that we expect to bring online almost 1GW of capacity this year, and we're building a 2GW — and potentially bigger — AI data center so large it could cover a significant part of Manhattan,” he said. But it’s not just the hyperscalers racing to build AI factories. The Stargate Project — a $500 billion initiative first proposed during the Trump administration and now backed by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX — aims to develop a nationwide network of AI data centers and energy facilities. Then there’s the United Arab Emirates with a recently unveiled plan to invest $1.4 trillion in U.S. AI infrastructure in partnership with BlackRock, Nvidia, and Microsoft. At the core of all this multi-trillion-dollar spending is one single goal: build as many AI-ready data centers as possible before the competition beats you to it. As Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during his 2025 GTC keynote, hand-coded software running on general-purpose CPUs is giving way to machine learning models powered by data centers filled with GPUs and AI accelerators — or as Huang calls them, “AI factories.” This paradigm shift, according to Huang and many experts, will demand orders of magnitude more computing power. But just like in the 1990s — when no one could accurately predict how fast the internet would grow — no one really knows how fast AI will be adopted. And much like the fiber buildout of that era, today’s multi-trillion-dollar AI spending is FOMO-driven and frontloaded on the assumption that AI’s exponential growth curve will hold. Even Big Tech execs admit as much. No line captures this “blank check” AI spending better than Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s remark during Alphabet’s earnings call last August: “When you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting.” Nvidia isn’t the only company developing AI-specific hardware and software, but it’s by far the biggest — thanks to its near-impenetrable moat in GPUs and AI accelerators. By various estimates, including from Mizuho Securities, Nvidia holds between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market. That dominance is reflected in Nvidia’s market cap. Since the release of ChatGPT — when the world suddenly realized AI is real — Nvidia’s value has ballooned from $400 billion to $2.8 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world. But this isn’t just about hype. Nvidia’s sales exploded from $27 billion in 2022 to $130 billion in 2024, while profits rose from $9.8 billion to $72.9 billion over the same period. At the 2025 GTC event, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia shipped 1.3 million Hopper GPUs during peak sales to top cloud providers — AWS, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle. For comparison, Nvidia’s next-gen Blackwell chips already hit 3.6 million units in their first year. And just like Hopper, Blackwell is already sold out until October, according to the company’s Q3 2024 earnings. Wall Street doesn’t expect the sales to stop here. Nvidia’s current valuation is pricing in 56.7% revenue growth this year, pushing projected sales to just over $200 billion. In 2026, Wall Street analysts expect another $50 billion on top of that. That’s a lot of chips to sell, but Huang says we haven’t even hit peak data center spending yet. According to Dell’Oro Group — a market research firm Huang cited at GTC 2025 — annual data center capex could top $1 trillion within five years, largely driven by U.S. hyperscalers. “We project that data center infrastructure spending could surpass $1 trillion annually within five years. While AI spending has yet to meet desired returns and efficiency improvements, long-term growth remains assured, driven by hyperscalers’ multi-year capex cycles and government initiatives such as the $500 billion Stargate Project,” said Baron Fung, Senior Research Director at Dell’Oro Group. Why do we need so much computing power, considering AI — like any technology — should become more efficient over time? After all, 400 million people use ChatGPT, and it works just fine on legacy data centers. It’s because AI is getting smarter. We’ve entered what Huang calls the “agentic AI” era — where models reason, plan, verify results, and solve problems step by step. That means burning through way more tokens. To illustrate, Huang showed two models solving the same task: creating a wedding seating arrangement for 300 guests, factoring in tradition, photogenic angles, and family tensions. A traditional LLM (Llama 3 in this case) solved it in under 500 tokens but missed key social dynamics. DeepSeek’s R1, a Chinese “budget” reasoning model, nailed the task after a multi-step analysis but used 8,859 tokens. “Now we have AIs that can reason step by step by step using a technology called chain of thought, best of end, consistency checking, a variety of different path planning, a variety of different techniques, we now have AI’s that can reason,” Huang said. Ironically, it was DeepSeek R1 that sowed fears AI might require less compute, but Huang believe those fears were overblown. “Last year, this is where almost the entire world got it wrong,” Huang said, referring to the DeepSeek scare. He argued that AI now requires 100 times more compute than it did a year ago, largely due to reasoning models like DeepSeek R1. “The computation requirement, the scaling law of AI is more resilient and, in fact, hyperaccelerated. The amount of computation we need at this point as a result of agentic AI, as a result of reasoning, is easily a hundred times more than we thought we needed this time last year.” Some industry insiders go as far as saying AI is moving so fast it might break Moore’s Law. “The amount of compute AI needs is doubling every three months,” said Nick Harris, CEO of Lightmatter, a $4.4 billion chipmaker. “That’s far faster than Moore’s Law. It’s going to break companies and economies.” Ross Sandler, who leads internet sector research at Barclays, thinks current capex spending may fall short of what compute-hungry models will need. “Consensus estimates currently call for a little over $300 billion in total capex for these hyperscalers, about $100 billion of which is going into the AI semiconductor portion of that capex… that’s probably not enough to satisfy the overall compute required.” Sandler’s team projects AI workloads could quadruple between 2025 and 2028. By then, inference — or AI reasoning — might make up more than half of all industry compute. There’s just one catch: that projection assumes AI models will continue burning through tokens like they do today. On January 20, a then-obscure Chinese AI company released DeepSeek R1 — an open-source AI model that could reason on par with what was previously considered incomparable to OpenAI’s models. National news spun it as a Sputnik moment for America — a global superpower beating the U.S. in the next frontier of technology — but Wall Street got spooked by something else. In the released paper, DeepSeek showed how it trained models at a fraction of OpenAI’s costs — and using old-generation chips at that. That was a wake-up call that the economics of AI training might be overblown. What followed was what Wall Street dubbed AI’s “Black Monday” — a $600 billion sell-off in Nvidia, marking the biggest single-day crash for a U.S. company in history. At the core of the DeepSeek scare are reasoning AI models — the kind Nvidia spotlighted at the last GTC conference. Although they use more tokens, as Huang noted, these models are often much easier to train. What DeepSeek showed is that AI models like R1 don’t rely on brute-force scale. Instead, they learn how to think and know where to look for data rather than memorizing everything. That can drastically reduce the cost of AI training. “The idea of spending $10 billion on a pre-training run on the next base model, to achieve very little incremental performance, would likely change,” Sandler’s Barclays analysts wrote in a recent note. Not only that, new AI models are becoming more efficient. Gil Luria, Davidson’s head of technology research, told me that DeepSeek — while handling up to one-third of OpenAI’s queries — can squeeze much more out of older-generation Nvidia chips. “On the final day of releases, DeepSeek disclosed that its inference stack, running on just 2,224 H800s, is serving 608B tokens per day, ~1/3 of what OpenAI is doing, but on a small fraction of the infrastructure. The number of tokens they are able to squeeze out of each H800 is roughly an order-of-magnitude improvement over leading open-source models running on H100s, and it highlights this emerging reality that algorithmic/architecture-level optimizations are now an equally critical frontier of development,” his analysts wrote in a note. These efficiencies, while good for the advancement of AI technology and its adoption, aren’t what chipmakers like Nvidia want to see because a lot of its growth is banking on continuous investment in capex by major tech players. UBS estimates that nearly all of Nvidia’s data center revenue growth this year and next is tied to hyperscaler capex spending. Then there’s the question of ROI because the economics of AI still don’t quite add up. Even OpenAI isn’t breaking even on compute costs, according to CEO Sam Altman, despite charging $200 a month for its pro-tier plan. By Luria’s estimates, America’s largest software companies — including OpenAI, Salesforce and Adobe — have only generated $10–20 billion in revenue from their AI products this year. “The reality is that the revenue from selling actual AI products to a customer is still minuscule compared to the magnitude of the capex invested… We have invested almost half a trillion dollars and are still only getting around $10–20 billion of actual product sales off of that investment,” Luria told me. Meanwhile, MIT Institute Professor and Nobel Laureate Daron Acemoglu predicts that AI will add just 1% to GDP growth and affect only 5% of jobs in the U.S. over the next 10 years. He’s not saying the technology lacks potential. In fact, he thinks it can replace 20% of jobs in the U.S. workforce — assuming replacement costs are excluded. But once you factor in those costs, only 5% of tasks can be profitably automated in the next decade. Not only that, he notes that those profitably replaceable tasks are mostly concentrated in small and mid-sized businesses — not in Big Tech plowing hundreds of billions into AI. Nobody doubts AI will change the world. The real question isn’t whether it’s a fad, but whether it can grow fast enough to close the gigantic mismatch between capex spending and revenue. After all, the poster children of the dot-com crash weren’t wrong. We do buy pet food and toys online — and much more. They were just too early. Chipmakers powering AI aren’t fiber-optic companies, and the AI revolution isn’t the internet revolution. As Mark Twain said, history doesn’t repeat itself; it rhymes. But the semantics that have driven both spending sprees bear a striking resemblance.

Title: Best Presales to Buy as BlackRock’s Ethereum Holdings Cross Record $1B

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum is currently in a major support zone. It’s trading around the $2K level, which happens to be the bottom of a prominent trendline. If the scenario repeats this time around, we can expect $ETH to reach $3.5K in the next few weeks. In addition to the upward trendline, $ETH currently happens to be between its strongest support and resistance zones – highlighted in the image by the blue rectangle. Read on as we’ll discuss which institutional investors see this as a ripe opportunity to add $ETH to their portfolios and how you can match their ROI by buying the best presales. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) added $155M in $ETH investments over the last week, taking its total $ETH holdings to more than $1.145B. Although BUIDL has a diversified portfolio across various chains, such as Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Aptos, Ethereum is still one of its major bets in this dicey crypto market. This vote of confidence from institutional investors is surely a positive sign for $ETH in the long term. Speaking of the long haul, our detailed $ETH price prediction for 2025 laid out why the token can reach $6K before the end of the year. Although investing directly into $ETH is the simplest way to capitalize on the crypto’s upcoming bull run, it’s not necessarily the very best. The best cryptos on presale could be more profitable due to their current low capitalization. New cryptocurrency typically follows the larger crypto trend but can potentially make you more money than $ETH (or $BTC). If you don’t know which meme coins on presale to consider, here are our top three suggestions. After a long-drawn consolidation, $BTC is finally showing signs that it wants to rally higher. If you wish to make the most of $BTC’s growth, consider investing in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). It’s worth noting that even though $BTCBULL follows the coattails of $BTC, it’s based on the Ethereum blockchain thanks to the network’s large liquidity pool. By directly linking its $BTC giveaways to the actual King Crypto’s price, BTC Bull Token has ensured the price of its own token, $BTCBULL, will also keep rising. Another reason why BTC Bull Token can be the next crypto to explode is its token burn mechanism. Essentially, the developers will shave off a part of the total $BTCBULL supply every time $BTC’s price rises by $50K. With one token currently available for just $0.002425, $BTCBULL’s presale is ongoing and has raised over $4M. Here’s how to buy BTC Bull Token. Built to unleash the true potential of Solana, Solaxy ($SOLX) will be the first-ever Layer-2 solution on the memecoin-friendly blockchain. Solana has been battling with network congestion and scalability issues ever since its popularity among investors skyrocketed thanks to $TRUMP and no-code launchpad Pump.fun. Solaxy will reduce the burden on Solana by processing a sizable portion of the network’s total transactions on its sidechain. Additionally, Solaxy will jack up Solana’s affordability, seeing as it will process transactions in bulk and not one by one. Given that Solaxy could be one of the biggest catalysts behind Solana’s rise to new all-time highs, it could easily be among the top trending cryptos once it launches. The token is currently in presale, which is why it’s available for just $0.001672. Speaking of Solaxy’s presale, it’s comfortably one of the hottest new cryptos on the market right now – over $27.7M in funding is nothing to sniff at, after all. For more info on Solaxy’s purchase process, check out our detailed guide on how to buy Solaxy. Lightchain AI is a fantastic crypto project built on Ethereum, which is why it enjoys industry-leading efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, like $BTCBULL and $SOLX, $LCAI, is currently in presale – where it has already amassed a whopping $18M in funding. What’s so special about $LCAI, you ask? Well, it’s a much anticipated AI-crypto partnership. For those unaware, investments in AI+crypto projects (as well as AI agent coins) have skyrocketed in recent times thanks to this niche’s unprecedented potential. Lightchain AI, for example, plans to combine AI and blockchain technologies to build more user-friendly and secure blockchain networks. Furthermore, its whitepaper suggests that it’ll reward users who make meaningful contributions to AI development while keeping the network’s security intact. If you wish to benefit from $LCAI’s growth, consider becoming an early investor in the project. As mentioned earlier, the token is currently in presale, where it’s available for a low price of $0.007125. $ETH will be right alongside $BTC when the next crypto rally gains steam. Although the above-mentioned tokens could make you a lot of money, don’t dive into crypto headfirst. Always have strong risk management in place. This means investing only a sensible portion of your total net worth and taking crypto’s volatility into account. Last but not least, you must always do your own research before investing.

Title: ONDO forms ‘strong low’ at $0.58 – Mapping its road to $1.20

ONDO’s price action signals a potential trend reversal as it forms a higher low. Backed by strong fundamentals and strategic partnerships, its market sentiment suggests… The Ondo [ONDO] daily chart indicates a potential higher low forming around the $0.6500 level, a key accumulation zone. After rallying to a peak near $1.4000 in late 2024, ONDO underwent a correction, falling to $0.83216, at press time. A crypto analyst highlights a “Strong Low” at $0.5800, with the price now testing support between $0.6500 and $0.83216. Source: x The formation of a higher low indicates weakening selling pressure and suggests a potential trend reversal. If ONDO surpasses the $0.9500 resistance level, bullish momentum could propel its price toward $1.20. This pattern mirrors ONDO’s previous rebounds from accumulation zones, further supporting its potential for upward movement if market sentiment strengthens. ONDO’s partnership with BlackRock to tokenize U.S. Treasury assets underscores its strength as a leading crypto project. Tokenization enables fractional ownership and improves liquidity, effectively bridging traditional finance and blockchain. BlackRock’s involvement adds significant credibility, drawing institutional interest and bolstering ONDO’s role in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. By offering on-chain access to stable, yield-generating assets, ONDO addresses the growing demand for DeFi solutions that integrate traditional financial instruments. Its regulatory compliance and institutional-grade infrastructure further enhance its appeal. As RWA adoption grows and DeFi evolves, the altcoin is well-positioned for sustainable long-term growth. ONDO’s Long/Short Ratio revealed balanced sentiment among investors. At the time of writing, the ratio stood at 0.90 on Binance, with perpetual contracts slightly higher at 1.00. The past week saw fluctuations between 0.70 and 1.15, reflecting market indecision as ONDO consolidates near its accumulation zone. Source: Coinglass A slight increase in long positions reflects cautious optimism, aligning with the higher low formation on the price chart. However, the lack of a clear directional bias indicates that traders are waiting for confirmation of a reversal before committing to significant positions. This mirrors the broader market’s consolidation phase, highlighting the importance of clear breakout signals for a decisive trend to emerge. Overall, ONDO’s price movement, strong fundamentals, and investor positioning suggest the project is at a critical juncture. The formation of a higher low points to a potential trend reversal, while its partnership with BlackRock reinforces its long-term viability. If ONDO maintains support and breaks resistance, it could gain renewed momentum, consistent with historical trends and broader market dynamics.

Title: Female executives are fighting back against alpha male CEOs

Good morning. Baby boomers' hopes for a comfortable retirement could be at risk if the stock market keeps falling. Financial experts shared key strategies with BI to help protect their savings. In today's big story, female executives are fed up with alpha male CEOs acting like "billionaire boys in the sandbox." Now, they're fighting back. What's on deck Markets: Faith-based investing is having a moment. (And we don't mean confidence.) Tech: Cybersecurity researchers are role-playing with ChatGPT. Business: The rich are taking to the skies for their commutes — Ubers be damned. But first, deprogramming the bro-code. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Lately, boardrooms are brimming with the bro-ish bravado you'd expect to find in a locker room. A buff Mark Zuckerberg wants Meta to celebrate a culture of "aggression." He also likes martial arts and butchering his own meat. 200 push-ups while wearing a weighted vest? No problem. Jeff Bezos (also now buff) laid down the hammer at The Washington Post, demanding editors give him a "hell yes" to affirm they're all in on "personal liberties and free markets." Let's not forget Elon Musk, who over the last several years, has been challenging anyone from Zuckerberg to Vladimir Putin to single combat. Not in the least surprised by all this chest-thumping: women in business. The return of the alpha male CEO has engendered a new opponent, BI's Amanda Hoover writes. Female executives are fed up with the "billionaire boys in the sandbox," as one sociologist put it — and instead of waiting to be let in, some are building their own arenas. Fabrik founder Jaclyn Pascocello told BI that she is seeing a collective of women coming together and starting to build companies to address issues sometimes ignored by men. When companies won't offer the flexibility that working parents need, it can embolden people to become more entrepreneurial and build under their own terms. "Oftentimes the easiest way to find that is to build it yourself," Pascocello said. Amanda spoke with female founders, psychologists, and sociologists about the resurgent machoism in corporate America — and how female executives are fighting back. 1. Praying for returns? Look no further than religious ETFs. Faith-based investments are a small part of the ETF world, but rising religious fervor and President Trump's leadership are driving interest. However, these funds can be picky about what to include. 2. President Trump could be making the same mistake as Biden. Trump's economic policies have some worried about a potential recession, and the stock market has taken a hit. With the 2026 midterms not far off, Trump risks political damage by continuing to ignore the elephant in the room. 3. Has bitcoin already peaked this year? Betting markets seem to think so. They expect the cryptocurrency to reach $110,000, barely above its record price. Wall Street bulls beg to differ. 1. Jensen made a joke, but who's laughing? At Nvidia's big AI conference, CEO Jensen Huang joked that new Blackwell GPUs would render the company's older chip models obsolete. Its cloud giant customers might not find that very funny, though, since it would cost them billions. 2. You can get ChatGPT to make password-stealing malware. Just play pretend. Researchers cracked some LLMs' security features to generate code that could breach Google's password manager. The key? Make the chatbot pretend to be a superhero. 3. A former Point72 exec's new data startup wants to level the playing field. Kirk McKeown's Carbon Arc allows small funds and businesses to purchase private data by the megabyte — sometimes for less than $1. The startup's goal is to make it more accessible for anyone looking to trade or feed AI models. 1. Out: Ubering. In: Blading. The wealthy are ditching hired cars for helicopter services like Blade, where a nine-minute ride from Manhattan to JFK airport starts at $95. When a rush-hour Uber in the city can cost more than $100, that sounds like a deal. 2. Law firms split over Trump's attack. Elias Law Group rebuked Trump's Friday memo that warned firms against "frivolous" suits against his administration. Marc Elias said in a statement on Saturday that there would be "no negotiation" about the clients his firm represents. Meanwhile, after Paul Weiss struck a deal with Trump on Friday, its chairman, Brad Karp, sent an email to staff addressing their unease over the decision. 3. Freebies for federal workers. DC businesses are offering perks like free workout classes and financial planning sessions to federal employees as they navigate the uncertainty around their jobs. BI heard from five businesses on why they're stepping up. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave). Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Title: The manager of a $41 billion BlackRock bond fund yielding 6.4% shares where investors can get max returns for the least risk

With stocks down to start 2025, the consistent and relatively strong returns you can find in the fixed-income market may look attractive right about now. Cash equivalents like 3-month Treasury bills still offer yields above 4% as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates elevated. But the best place to be sitting at the moment is a bit further up in duration, according to Russ Brownback, the global head of macro positioning for fixed income and a co-portfolio manager of the $41 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BSIIX). Brownback's fund currently yields 6.4% if held to maturity and is overweight short-to-medium-term securities. With a flat yield curve, this approach locks in income a bit longer than cash equivalents but saves investors from the volatility that the potential for rising inflation or a recession could bring to longer-duration assets, he said. While the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index has a duration of about 6.5 years, Brownback's fund has about 3.5. "We hold about 70% of our duration five years and shorter," he told BI. But it's not just a matter of duration. To generate the 6.4% yield, Brownback tries to mix up the perfect cocktail of riskier assets with safer ones. Around 28% of the fund is in commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, and non-agency mortgages, he said. By diversifying these riskier assets with higher-quality AAA securitized products, as well as with both higher- and lower-quality corporate credit, you get a robust return, Brownback said. AAA-rated credit is the highest class of investment-grade bonds, meaning the assets have the lowest risk levels. "That is the real sweet spot," Brownback said of the mix. "As long as we're owning that in a diversified way, that's about the highest Sharpe Ratio that exists in markets today," he added, referencing the risk-to-reward ratio. Despite the emphasis on diversification, Brownback said he's not worried about an impending economic downturn — a fear that has roiled markets lately as President Donald Trump implements sweeping tariff policies. "There's a lot of hyperbole around 'Oh my gosh, we're going to have a recession,' but that's been the narrative for the last two years, whether it was the regional banking crisis in '23 or last year thinking the central banks were staying too tight," he said. "It feels like conventional wisdom has been looking for a hard landing around every corner for three years. We just don't see that." Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kept interest rates steady on at the central bank's March meeting, a signal that the economy may be stable enough not to need precautionary policy measures. But the decision to pause rate cuts was also a nod to the potential for inflation to flare up again amid tariffs, a reason Brownback is largely staying away from the long-end of the yield curve. "The Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks," Powell said at a March 19 press conference. "We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity." Jump to

Title: Top Fund Managers Ask Federal Court to Dismiss Climate-Related Antitrust Lawsuit

BlackRoc, Vanguard and State Street have asked a federal court in Texas to dismiss a state lawsuit accusing the top fund managers of conspiring through climate activism to discourage coal output, with the firms saying the allegations rest on “half-baked and untested” legal theories. “To find that Plaintiffs have stated an antitrust claim on these alleged facts requires contorting the law in a way that would hurt both coal companies and individual investors,” the asset managers told the judge, asking the court to reject this “adventurous attempt to rewrite antitrust law.” The closely watched case, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, offers no examples of the companies ever telling a coal company to reduce output, the fund managers said. Industry analysts have been watching to see how strongly the companies would push back on what the defendants called a first of its kind suit filed by Texas and other Republican-led states. There are now 13 plaintiffs. “This is a hard-hitting response that levels some strong rebuttals of the complaint” said Michael Carrier, a Rutgers Law School professor, via e-mail. Among other things, the companies show a lack of communication and differences in proxy voting that will make it hard for the plaintiffs to show they made agreements among themselves, Carrier said. Paxton’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The suit is part of a wave of pressure on the firms from conservative U.S. politicians, many from energy-producing states. Among other things, they have alleged that the firms’ cooperation in industry net-zero groups amounts to collusion. With more than $26 trillion in assets, the three firms through influential proxy votes have become major voices in how U.S. companies pay executives, elect directors and set environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies. Lately they have been in retreat under Republican pressure, withdrawing from industry climate efforts and cutting diversity goals. The suit marks the first time they have faced significant antitrust claims tied to their ESG efforts. In Monday night’s joint motion they formed a united front against the idea and called their activities “commonplace” ones for products like index funds that are “the core ingredients allowing asset managers to provide the low-cost funds that millions of Americans rely on to save for retirement and other purposes.” For instance, the companies said that while BlackRock and State Street voted against reelecting a few coal company directors, they never voted as a block and said the directors were reelected anyway. Vanguard never voted against coal company management or directors. The companies also wrote that coal output actually rose since 2021 according to the complaint’s details, and that their proxy votes did not correlate with production trends. “There is not the slightest indication that any Defendant was prodding the coal companies to reduce output, much less that all of them were doing so in collaboration,” the motion states. The case is Texas et al v BlackRock Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, No. 24-00437. Topics Lawsuits

This writer watched the presentations of Sen. “Boynee” Sanders and Rep. Alexandria “Covetous” Cortez in Colorado. The latter’s speech revealed her deeply Marxist commitments as she referred over and over again to the working class as a mantra intended to evoke class resentment. This is a centerpiece of communist rhetoric since the publication of the Communist Manifesto in 1848. Not only was she replaying the communist mantra of the working class (“the proletariat”) being abused by “the bourgeoisie” (the capitalist overlords), which has been used in American political life since the International Workers of the World were active in the 1880s, but she also kept repeating the clichéd communist word “solidarity.” Yet this term, “working class” — so popular with communists in the Democrat party (now a sizeable number since the 110-page pact between Sanders and Biden was signed in 2020) — now includes the homeless, the extremely indigent, and the millions of illegal migrants who were admitted during the Biden years. “Working class” is a catch-all term for anyone who is having a struggle living within their means or find themselves living on the streets or on the dole. Workers are offended by being lumped together with these other groups and do not believe that their desire for their “rightful share” of American prosperity is in the same category as illegals or the dispossessed. Bernie especially hammered home the divide between the poor and the working class (again, lumped together) and the richest of the rich. It was a negative rant of abuse, as was Rep. Ocasio-Cortez’s speech. Sanders spoke after Ocasio-Cortez. He tried to arouse envy and disgust as he pointed out the economic power of certain high-level billionaires working with Trump and Elon Musk in our new Executive Branch administration. He lambasted our society because fewer and fewer people can aspire to homeownership, and because credit card debt is skyrocketing in order for the citizenry to make ends meet. He lambasted Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street because they are three investment companies that own more than 50% of 95% of our corporations. However, other sources dispute the percentage of companies owned. He also did not comment on the extraordinary inflation during the Biden presidency that has devastated many households during just the past four years, nor the extraordinary public debt of our national government (and many state governments) from wasteful and leftist-driven spending literally for many decades. He did not mention that the top 1% of earners pay 40% of the taxes in the U.S. He also did not mention the astronomical waste and extravagance evident in federal expenditures. None of these realities fits into the reality he was attempting to depict. He did not express gratitude for the hundreds of millions of dollars of waste and fraud now being uncovered and remedied by DOGE. Trillions in unnecessary and immoral expenditures — much of it certainly being graft, although this is never said publicly — is being revealed as part of healing our broken and distorted economy. However, in his blowhard remarks, Sen. “Boynee” failed to give any credit to the Trump administration for resisting this decades-old trending of extensive imbalance in the federal balance sheet. When my father was active in forming the Transit Workers Union chapter for public trolley car employees (motormen, conductors, and repair units) in Philadelphia in the early 1940s, there were quite a few communist activists in the start-up. However, since most of the unionists were Irish or Italian Catholics, they forced out the communist faction because of the communist rejection of belief in the Christian God, sometimes resorting to force to do so. Other aspects of their identity as workers came into play in deciding what it meant to be “working class.” For one thing, the working class had to work. There were no food stamps, welfare payments, free cell phones, or first-class hotel rooms for the indigent at that time. Incredibly, though more than 100 years have passed, the language of the speeches by Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders is very much the same as that used more than one hundred years ago by Eugene V. Debs, three-time Socialist candidate for president of the USA. He lost each time and was eventually imprisoned for opposing our entry into WWI. He also considered it of utmost importance to promote solidarity with the working class, and he explicitly stated that the term “working class” is to be identified with the Marxist term “proletariat.” Debs’s depiction of the systematic conspiracy of the rich against the rest of society was stated here, here, and here. One commentator wrote about Debs, “Debs feared the rise of the monolithic corporate state. He foresaw that corporations, unchecked, would expand to ‘continental proportions and swallow up the national resources and the means of production and distribution.’” Sanders’s rant at the Colorado rally continues to echo that same view. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez hold these views, which are the same as those of Debs, even though unions have been recognized in the USA and there has been a vast leftward move of our politics since the administrations of Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Further, since Debs, communism came into Russia, which became the USSR and eventually collapsed. Later, after WWII, the revolution in China led by Mao established the PRC. This communist PRC was modified to allow capitalist activity by Western corporations in empowerment zones beginning in the late 1980s, which must have been disappointing to the hardcore Sanders. In short, it is this writer’s view that their “tour” of speech-making is a deranged flight into a political mindset from more than 100 years ago — a mindset that failed then and is even more irrelevant today. They are suffering from a politically motivated delusion. Image: Bernie Sanders. Credit: AFGE via Flickr, CC BY 2.0. This writer watched the presentations of Sen. “Boynee” Sanders and Rep.

He foresaw that corporations, unchecked, would expand to ‘continental proportions and swallow up the national resources and the means of production and distribution.’” Sanders’s rant at the Colorado rally continues to echo that same view. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez hold these views, which are the same as those of Debs, even though unions have been recognized in the USA and there has been a vast leftward move of our politics since the administrations of Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Further, since Debs, communism came into Russia, which became the USSR and eventually collapsed. Later, after WWII, the revolution in China led by Mao established the PRC. This communist PRC was modified to allow capitalist activity by Western corporations in empowerment zones beginning in the late 1980s, which must have been disappointing to the hardcore Sanders. In short, it is this writer’s view that their “tour” of speech-making is a deranged flight into a political mindset from more than 100 years ago — a mindset that failed then and is even more irrelevant today. They are suffering from a politically motivated delusion. Image: Bernie Sanders. Credit: AFGE via Flickr, CC BY 2.0.

Title: Fidelity Files for Ethereum US Treasury Fund 'OnChain'

Fidelity Investments has submitted a filing to register a tokenized version of its US dollar money market fund on Ethereum, joining companies like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton in the blockchain tokenization space. The filing, submitted on March 21 to the US securities regulator, said that "OnChain" will help track transactions for the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), an $80 million fund consisting almost entirely of US Treasury bills. Although OnChain is still awaiting regulatory approval, Fidelity expects it to become operational on May 30. Source: Securities and Exchange Commission The OnChain share class aims to provide investors with transparency and verifiable tracking of FYHXX share transactions, although Fidelity will continue to use traditional book-entry records as the official ownership ledger. “Even though the secondary recording of the OnChain class on a blockchain will not serve as the official ownership record, the transfer agent will reconcile blockchain transactions with the official records of the OnChain class daily,” Fidelity explained. The $5.8 trillion asset manager also mentioned the possibility of expanding OnChain to other blockchains in the future. In recent years, asset managers have increasingly looked to blockchain technology to tokenize Treasury bills, bonds, and private credit. The RWA tokenization market for Treasury products is currently valued at $4.78 billion, with BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) leading at $1.46 billion, according to rwa.xyz. Source: rwa.xyz Over $3.3 billion worth of RWAs have been tokenized on Ethereum, followed by Stellar at $465.6 million. BlackRock’s crypto head, Robbie Mitchnick, recently said that Ethereum remains the "natural default answer" for traditional finance firms looking to tokenize RWAs on-chain. "There was no question that Ethereum would be the blockchain on which we would begin tokenization, and that's not just a BlackRock thing; that's the obvious default answer." “Clients clearly value decentralization, credibility, and security, which gives Ethereum a distinct advantage,” he remarked during the Digital Asset Summit in New York on March 20.

Title: Analysts Eye Shiba Inu’s Potential: Could Trump’s Crypto Reserve and ETF Catapult SHIB to $0.0001?

Shiba Inu Approaches a Key Breakout Zone, Thanks to the Formation of a Falling Wedge As Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to stay above the critical support zone of $0.0000115, the second-largest meme coin paints a bullish picture. According to renowned market analyst Ali Martinez, “Key Shiba Inu (SHIB) support levels! $0.0000115 and $0.00000815 in focus.” Martinez’s analysis shows that the meme coin is out of the woods, with Shiba Inu’s price currently sitting at $0.0000128. Having witnessed a bearish momentum that sent its price below the psychological threshold of $0.000010, Shiba Inu can feel relieved. As a result, Crypto Sat believes that SHIB might be eyeing a bullish reversal pattern. The market insights provider acknowledged, “The 1-hour chart for $SHIB is showing a Falling Wedge, a bullish reversal pattern. Bullish Case: A breakout above 1260 could trigger a rally toward 1280 – 1320. SHIB is approaching a key breakout zone. If bulls take charge, we could see a strong upside move.” A falling wedge is deemed a bullish reversal pattern because it depicts a potential change from a downtrend to an uptrend. As the wedge narrows, volume decreases because it shows the absence of strong selling momentum, as bears are throwing in the towel. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu might be eyeing the $0.0001 zone if the meme coin is included in President Donald Trump’s crypto reserve. Additionally, the Shiba Inu community is ramping up efforts to advocate for a SHIB-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF), calling on major asset management firms like BlackRock and Grayscale Investments to take action.

Title: If Trump Destroys Inflation Reduction Act, Economic Fallout May Come

ByKen Silverstein ByKen Silverstein , Senior Contributor. Block Island, R.I: Deepwater Wind installing the first offshore wind farm at Block Island, Rhode ... More Island, August 14, 2016. (Photo by Mark Harrington/Newsday RM via Getty Images) Louisiana may be known as an oil and gas state, but it is now getting its feet wet by trying to build offshore wind energy developments in the Gulf of Mexico. Even though the deal has bipartisan support, the Trump Administration is trying to block all such wind projects in federal waters. President Trump signed an executive order that stopped all offshore wind energy projects. Trump doesn’t believe in climate change and thinks fossil fuels are the way to go. What makes him tick? The administration said this strategy will lower energy costs, create more jobs, and meet the growing energy demand. However, look to ruby-red Louisiana, which views offshore wind as a job creator and a vehicle to reduce electricity price volatility. “We are at an inflection point now on the way energy economics works,” says Fox Swim, a senior solar researcher for Aurora Solar, in a Zoom interview. “This administration is willing to break the law and norms. It is willing to inflict economic damage on the rest of the country to fulfill its vision. The renewable energy industry must lean hard on state governments. If states value stability in our grid and renewable energies, then these jurisdictions must do the right thing.” The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is in danger now. It passed in 2022, creating green energy programs nationwide. But if the projects die, economic stimulation does as well. If the Trump Administration gets rid of the IRA, then Energy Innovation said it would cost consumers $32 billion in energy bills, while gross domestic product falls by $190 billion by 2035. We lose hundreds of thousands of jobs too. Trump cannot simply eliminate the law, but he can gradually dismantle it. He could slow the rollout or make fossil fuel investments more valuable than those in renewable energy. So even if the law is still on the books, it might not have much of an effect. Swim points to the Endangerment Finding, the scientific and legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases that cause climate change. In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency started overseeing those emissions under the Clean Air Act. She thinks the administration will rewrite the law to say, “climate is not a problem.” She also believes the administration will revise the IRA to say which technologies qualify for tax credits. So, here’s the scoop: Aurora’s new survey revealed that 57% of business owners favor keeping the IRA, while only 29% want it gone. And guess what? A whopping 78% of business owners want to make the most of their IRA benefits. Now, let’s talk about homeowners. Awareness of the IRA has skyrocketed from 51% in 2024 to a colossal 77% in 2025. Interestingly, 48% of solar installers believe that a reduction in funding from the IRA would negatively impact their business. “Joe Biden created the IRA, and he fundamentally shifted the way we do clean energy in the U.S. Trump could just as easily shift the needle in the opposite direction,” says Swim. “The government uses subsidies to promote technologies and industrial policy. The subsidies must exist to bring renewables to the level where they can compete with extremely subsidized petroleum industries.” GULF OF MEXICO - JUNE 25: The Transocean Discoverer Enterprise drillship burns off gas collected at ... More the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana on June 25, 2010. An approaching tropical disturbance may force collecting operations involving ships and other siphoning equipment to be temporarily halted. This may cause oil to flow unchecked from the well until the weather improves and siphoning operations can be restored. (Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images) New York State planned to transform one of its largest fossil fuel plants into a renewable energy powerhouse. It would’ve used offshore wind energy, battery storage, and geothermal power to make clean energy. But guess what? Those plans are on hold because of Trump’s executive order that put a stop to all offshore wind projects. This deal would’ve been a game-changer, providing power to 2 million homes and generating a massive 2.6 gigawatts of electricity. The Trump administration has started undoing over 30 environmental rules that were put in place by the previous administration. They’re eliminating caps on power plant emissions, reducing protections for rivers and streams, and making it easier for cars to pollute. The president has given his EPA the green light to keep some coal plants running. That’s on top of the plans to weaken rules for monitoring pollution from power plants. For instance, he’s targeting the mercury rules and those that regulate coal ash, which is the waste left behind when coal is burned and caused widespread damage in the Tennessee Valley Authority’s areas. Trump has called the IRA the “Green New Scam.” Trump has also withdrawn from the voluntary Paris Agreement that tries to limit temperature increases to 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit by mid century. “We’re not going to do the wind thing,” Trump told rallygoers. “Big, ugly windmills, they ruin your neighborhood.” He later wrote on social media, “After years of being held captive by Environmental Extremists, Lunatics, Radicals, and Thugs, allowing other Countries, in particular China, to gain tremendous Economic advantage over us by opening up hundreds of all Coal Fire Power Plants, I am authorizing my Administration to immediately begin producing Energy with BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL.” Have we become immune to this language? The madman theory applies to the idea that foreign foes shouldn’t tempt a leader because they are too unpredictable. Trump, though, is driven by vindictiveness and the desire to undo the successes of his predecessors, and not by the greater good. WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 12: Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) (L) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) arrive for ... More a news conference with fellow members of the House Progressive Caucus ahead of the vote on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 outside the U.S. Capitol on August 12, 2022 in Washington, DC. Despite not achieving everything the House liberals wanted, the $737 billion act will focus on slowing climate change, lower health care costs, and creating clean energy jobs by enacting a 15% corporate minimum tax, and a 1% fee on stock buybacks, and enhancing IRS enforcement. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) The real checks and balances might not come from the legislative branch, which seems scared of him, but from American businesses, which might actually have more power than the president. Market powers trump presidential levers. Companies have gone beyond just focusing on shareholders. They now include communities and employees in their mission. This strategy is called the “triple bottom line,” which considers the planet, people, and profits. Ignoring this can hurt a company’s well-being. Cisco, Oracle, and IBM are among the many companies that are leading the sustainability challenge. America’s energy picture illustrates the point: Coal has fallen from 50% of the electricity mix in 2008 to 16% today, while renewables keep blossoming, now at 20%. That’s a market choice. No U.S. utility company has any plans to build coal-fired power, including the two biggest, American Electric Power and Southern Company, which are trying to ditch their coal plants. Aurora’s Swim worries that corporations will reverse their net-zero goals, although that is a gamble—one that could bring lawsuits, lose customers, and damage their brands. That said, Earth.org listed a series of "backtracking companies:" Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citi Bank, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan pulled out of a industry climate alliance. Meanwhile, Blackrock withdrew from the Net-Zero Asset Managers, and American Airlines removed a reference to its "urgent" climate actions. "Trump is here for four years," says Swim. "There will be a midterm, and political gravity will catch up with his actions. But this administration is willing to inflict economic damage —even incurring a recession.” Witness the tariffs and the whirlwind they have taken this country. "There are strong conservative and economic cases for renewables," she continues. "Supporters must push legislators to say these policies make sense for your state and bring tangible benefits to your community. Maybe their leaders don't care about climate change, but they do care about power outages and recovery costs.” If Trump destroys the IRA, economic fallout could follow. While the president may be bound to the past and blinded to the country’s future promise, he knows how to read the political landscape—the best hope of staving off a free fall and even more environmental problems.

Lansdowne moved into the top four in Division 1A of the All-Ireland League for the first time this season with one of the campaign’s statement wins when beating Terenure 32-0 on the Aviva back pitch last Saturday. Declan Fassbender’s side appear to have timed their run perfectly and with remaining games against UCD and Garryowen look well placed to make the play-offs. This sixth win in seven was never really in doubt. The 21-year-old Leinster academy flanker set the tone in a dominant defensive display. After tries by Hardus van Eeden and Rob Hedderman, who opened his account in an injury-affected season with a brace, Jerry Cahir and Jack Cooke completed a bleak day for Terenure, who were feeling the scars of their defeat at home to Clontarf. Trailing 3-0 after 25 minutes, it looked like Terenure were about to go ahead when outhalf Conor McKeon put centre Ethan Reilly through under the posts. Alas, not alone was the pass forward, but the outhalf suffered a broken leg when tackled as he passed. This compounded the recent loss of Harrison Brewer, Chris Cosgrave and Conor Phillips, while Henry McErlean, Caspar Gabriel and Fintan Gunne are on Leinster duty in South Africa. Lansdowne, now fourth on 51 points, face relegation-threatened UCD next week before entertaining bottom-placed Garryowen in a fortnight. Terenure, in fifth on 48 points, host Young Munster before a last day trek to Cork Con (third on 52). Con had a hard-fought 30-23 win away to Young Munster which ended the latter’s slim play-off hopes, as the sides traded three tries apiece, with James Taylor kicking 15 points. However, after the game there were some unseemly scenes involving virtually all the players from both teams, and some supporters. In a statement, Cork Con said they are aware of an incident after the full-time whistle and “the club is currently conducting a full internal review into the incident. We are committed to upholding the highest standards of conduct, and will take appropriate action in line with our disciplinary procedures. “We wish to acknowledge the strong relationship between Cork Constitution and Young Munster, and we remain in contact with their representatives as we address this matter. As this is an ongoing review, we will not be making any further comment at this time.” Clontarf stayed top on 60 points thanks to another brace of tries from hooker Dylan Donnellan in an 18-5 win at home to UCD. ‘Tarf will travel to Garryowen before hosting St Mary’s on the last day. The St Mary’s fullback Conor Hayes scored their first try in his 19-point haul and former Munster centre Dan Goggin, playing at number eight, completed their 12th attacking bonus point of the campaign in a 32-21 home win over Ballynahinch. St Mary’s sit second on 58 points and will host City of Armagh before that last day trek to Clontarf. Although it will only be a stay of execution, Garryowen ended their 14-match losing streak with a surprise 26-17 win at City of Armagh, which keeps the latter just two points ahead of UCD in the relegation play-off place. In 1B, Nenagh Ormond took a significant step toward a home semi-final in those play-offs thanks to a 34-20 win over Old Wesley. Bottom placed Shannon kept their hopes of avoiding relegation alive with a gutsy 15-10 win at Naas to move within five points of Trinity and Highfield after the latter’s 28-23 win at College Park. Instonians, a junior club three seasons ago, will play in 1B next season after securing their fourth successive promotion with a 38-22 win at home to Greystones.

Title: US Bitcoin ETFs End Outflow Streak With $744 Million Weekly Influx — Details

The US-based Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have been on a negative streak of capital outflows in the past few weeks, reflecting dwindling appetite and worsening sentiment amongst investors. However, the latest daily performances of these crypto-based financial products suggest that fresh demand might be growing among investors. According to the latest market data, the Bitcoin ETFs in the United States continued their hot streak of capital influx, registering a daily total net inflow of $83.09 million on Friday, March 21. This fresh capital inflow marked the sixth consecutive day of net daily inflows for the crypto products. On Friday, only two of the Bitcoin ETFs witnessed any form of investor activity. BlackRock saw the highest amount of value ($104.99 million) added to its exchange-traded fund iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT); while Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) posted a daily net outflow of $21.9 million to close the week. Nevertheless, this $83.09 million performance brought the Bitcoin ETFs’ weekly record to a staggering $744.35 million weekly total net inflow. Interestingly, this previous week’s record put an end to five consecutive weeks of total net outflows from the exchange-traded funds. Data from SoSoValue shows that the US Bitcoin ETF market witnessed a total withdrawal of $5.39 billion over those five weeks of negative outflows. Specifically, the crypto-based financial products witnessed a daily total net outflow of over $1.14 billion on February 25. The magnitude of outflows witnessed by the Bitcoin ETFs has been associated with the uncertain climate of the US financial markets. Since the United States President Donald Trump resumed office, the markets have been plagued with fears of a global trade war, interest rate decisions, and so on. Since their launch, there has been a discussion around the impact of US Bitcoin ETFs’ performance on the price of the flagship cryptocurrency. As seen in the recent consecutive weeks of net outflows, the Bitcoin price tends to struggle whenever ETF investors are leaving the market. However, the premier cryptocurrency seems stuck in a consolidation range despite the fresh demand for the US Bitcoin ETFs. However, a sustained demand for its exchange-traded funds might be the positive catalyst for the Bitcoin price to resume its upward trend. As of this writing, the price of BTC is hovering around the $84,000 mark, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the market leader has barely recorded any notable movements in the past week. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: The New Sustainability Playbook: 10 Questions For Business Leaders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/pklein/2025/03/23/the-new-sustainability-playbook-10-questions-for-business-leaders/
Time Published: 2025-03-23T15:15:54Z
Full Content:
ByPaul Klein ByPaul Klein , Contributor. Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer Microsoft, at talking about "Accelerating climate ... More solutions with AI" on November 16, 2023 in Lisbon, Portugal. The negative impacts of the Trump administration’s tariffs are already taking effect and are projected to be even more consequential. Prices are projected to rise. At the same time, output and employment will be reduced, resulting in a net negative impact on the U.S. economy. In this context, every business with a global supply chain is facing an existential crisis: reduce investments in sustainability to save money in the short term, or stay the course and preserve long-term value? As costs rise from higher tariffs, business leaders need to understand the consequences of reducing investments in sustainability. Cutting costs will jeopardize business relationships with global supply chain partners that require compliance with sustainability standards including GRI, ISSB, and SASB. Downsizing investments in sustainability will also alienate employees, consumers, and communities who reward businesses that reduce environmental impact, enhance social equity, and improve long-term resilience. Every business leader will need to decide whether to maintain investments in sustainability that come with a cost but also deliver immense value. This new playbook will help leaders make the best choices for their companies. Short-term cost savings can lead to long-term vulnerability. Cutting back on emissions reductions, renewable energy, or supply chain resilience might lower costs now. But it also raises the risk of climate impacts, harm to reputation, and fines from regulations. PG&E’s failure to upgrade grid infrastructure to prevent wildfires resulted in the company facing an estimated $30 billion liability for damages from the two years of wildfires, according to the New York Times. Many multinational clients and procurement partners now mandate sustainability metrics. Preferred supplier lists may remove companies that fail to align with frameworks like GRI, ISSB, or SASB may be removed from preferred supplier lists. This is especially true in sectors such as apparel, electronics, automotive, and food. If you are part of a global value chain, slashing ESG investments could mean losing business. Walmart requires key suppliers to report emissions and energy use. Suppliers that don’t comply may be delisted. Employees want to work for companies with purpose, consumers reward brands that do good, and communities are more supportive of responsible corporations. Scaling back ESG efforts to offset tariff-related costs could result in lower morale, higher turnover, customer churn, and social license to operate issues—intangibles that can rapidly transform into significant concerns. Patagonia’s sustained customer loyalty and employee retention are closely linked to its genuine ESG commitments. Institutional investors are placing greater emphasis on sustainability as a proxy for governance and future-readiness. While some shareholder segments may support short-term margin improvements, others—like pension funds and ESG-focused funds—may divest from companies seen as backtracking on sustainability. Before you cut ESG budgets, consider how it might change your investor profile. BlackRock has flagged companies with weak ESG disclosures as riskier and redirected capital toward ESG-aligned portfolios, according to ESG Today. Sustainability efforts can benefit your company in the long run. You will save energy with efficient operations. Proactive compliance will cut regulatory costs. Plus, responsible sourcing will help your brand stand out. These investments may not appear on this quarter’s balance sheet, but they build competitive advantage over time. What will you lose if you abandon what you’ve already built? Unilever’s Sustainable Living Brands grew 69% faster than the rest of its portfolio, demonstrating tangible ROI. The green transition is not a trend—it’s an economic transformation. Companies in many fields are investing in sustainable innovation. They focus on electric fleets, biodegradable packaging, zero-waste operations, and inclusive hiring practices. If your rivals are pushing hard while you pull back, your market relevance could drop significantly. Ørsted shifted from relying on fossil fuels to becoming a top player in offshore wind. They moved faster than European energy giants who took longer to adapt. Before making cuts, get insights from boards, investors, employees, NGOs, and community leaders. They likely have strong views on your sustainability goals. Often, stakeholders will advocate for re-prioritizing—not abandoning—ESG commitments. Transparency can protect your brand and build credibility, even in times of retrenchment. Interface, the carpet maker, teamed up with NGOs, suppliers, and customers for its sustainability plan. This likely helped maintain its brand trust during tough times. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and state-led green grants offer billions to companies investing in sustainability. Cutting ESG funding now could mean missing out on tax credits, rebates, and partnerships that offset costs and de-risk long-term investments. Have you explored every opportunity to turn sustainability into a net gain? First Solar secured over $700 million in federal tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act for U.S. manufacturing. Sustainability and profitability should co-exist. ESG investments boost efficiency, cut waste, and make resource use better. They also reveal new business models. Leaders who see sustainability as central to performance, not just an extra, are most likely to succeed. IKEA’s focus on circular practices and renewable energy cuts waste and saves money worldwide. Will people remember you as the company that pivoted toward the future—or as the one that retreated when pressure mounted? Leadership is not just about getting through this quarter. It’s about creating a story that builds confidence, pride, and progress. The choices you make today will shape your company’s legacy. This is especially true during times of climate change and economic uncertainty. Microsoft’s pledge is to become carbon negative by 2030. This makes it a leader for the future, even in tough economic times. Tariffs and inflationary pressure are forcing difficult decisions. But cutting sustainability investments will likely be a costly mistake. Business leaders need a new approach. This should balance short-term costs with long-term stakeholder value, regulatory risks, and market expectations. Sustainability is not a corporate responsibility—it’s a strategic advantage. In the current environment, reducing investments in this area may seem like a sensible decision, but it can ultimately lead to weakened supply chain relationships, investor skepticism, employee disengagement, and lost consumer trust. As tariffs increase and economic strain grows, the most resilient and respected companies will be those that continue to be leaders by maintaining investments in sustainability.

Climate activists flocked to Houston to challenge the energy conference and its reckless promotion of fossil fuels.

Last week, thousands of people gathered in Houston, Texas for CERAWeek 2025, perhaps the most significant annual meet-up of the network of oil executives, investors, consultants, government officials, and more, that make up and support the fossil fuel industry. Inside the gathering, oil, finance, and tech executives joined a slew of panels discussing a range of energy industry topics. Top Trump officials spoke, including US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and US Interior secretary Doug Burgum. According to Guardian climate reporter Dharna Noor, “Wright said global warming was merely a needed “side-effect” of modernization, while Burgum called to “take our natural resources and turn them into natural assets.” Meanwhile, outside CERAWeek, hundreds of climate activists protested the conference’s display of billionaire power and celebration of fossil fuels, with several activists arrested. What is CERAWeek, anyways? Who or what is the power behind CERAWeek? What functions does CERAWeek perform for the fossil fuel industry power structure? Who were some of the key billionaires at CERAWeek? This primer will address these questions. What is CERAWeek? CERAWeek is a massive, transnational gathering of powerful people tied to the energy industry, including top fossil fuel executives, big financial investors, and high-level government officials and regulators. The Houston Chronicle — newspaper of the fossil fuel capital of the US, where CERAWeek is held — has labelled the event the “Super Bowl of energy,” awash with “energy insiders.” Climate activist Bill McKibben has referred to it as “the hydrocarbon world’s biggest festival, a Davos for carbon.” CERAWeek performs several functions for the energy industry. These include serving as a space to discuss and debate industry trends; engage in networking and dealmaking; hold high-level conversations between executives, investors and regulators; and broadly, to promote and legitimize the industry with a high-profile event. Thousands of participants attend CERAWeek. In 2023, around 7,200 people from 90 countries flocked to the event. It claims to be rated among the top five “corporate leader conferences” worldwide. Leaders from the highest heights of politics and industry attend CERAWeek. Past speakers have included Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Justin Trudeau, Narendra Modi, Henry Kissinger to Bill Gates. This year, new Trump Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum were speakers, along with CEOs or other top executives of fossil fuel companies that span the gamut of the industry, from Big Oil giants to LNG export companies, oil pipeline corporations to utilities. Some of these include ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Oxy, BP, Cheniere, Pioneer, Enbridge, NRG, EQT, Baker Hughes, Hunt Energy, Williams Companies, Hess, NextEra, National Grid, and Freeport LNG — just to name a few. Harold Hamm of Continental Resources — maybe the industry’s closest ally to Donald Trump — was a speaker. Top leaders from industry groups like American Petroleum Institute, American Gas Association and Edison International attended. Critically, major Wall Street investors and tech giants also attended CERAWeek. These include asset managers like BlackRock, private equity firms like Carlyle, Apollo, and Blackstone, and tech corporations like Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet (the parent company of Google). Nor is CERAWeek a solely U.S. affair. Government and corporate representatives from countries all over the world — Saudi Arabia to Canada, Turkey to Nigeria, South Korea to Kuwait — attended as well. Who Rules CERAWeek? While CERAWeek is filled with industry representatives, it’s dominated by major corporate players. Different “Partners” sponsor the conference, presumably through hefty fees, and the biggest sponsors gain the most access and power in shaping the event’s tone and content. For example, according to the sponsorship brochure from the 2024 CERAWeek conference, the highest level of sponsorship, which is limited to just a few corporations and firms, is “Foundational.” These sponsors “benefit from the highest levels of access, visibility, and executive support” and “play a leadership role within the CERAWeek community and are provided premier engagement and contribution.” Foundational Partners also “may collaborate with CERAWeek to develop a customized Special Program or community aligned with specific objectives.” This year’s Foundational Partners were Chevron, Amazon, and BlackRock, as well as professional services firm Marsh McLennan and the coal company Xcoal. The next level of Partners are “Strategic,” which “supports active engagement and access across a wide range of the CERAWeek community.” Among other things, Strategic Partners’ “objectives are supported by the CERAWeek Steering Committee,” and these Partners “receive priority consideration to contribute content and access to CERAWeek Private Communities. Strategic Partners for CERAWeek 2025 included ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, EQT, Freeport LNG, NextEra, Carlyle Group, Microsoft, and dozens more. Notably, a major power player behind CERAWeek is Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer-prize winning author who helped found the conference over four decades ago and serves as chairman of CERAWeek and Vice Chairman of S&P Global, the well-known financial services company that runs CERAWeek (read more on Yergin below). The Fossil Fuel Industry, the Houston Power Elite & the Houston Police Foundation The power elite of Houston is deeply intertwined with the fossil fuel industry. Energy companies dominate the board of the city’s main chamber of commerce, the Greater Houston Partnership, making up around a quarter of its membership. Houston is one of the fossil fuel corporate headquarters of the world, home to key global and regional offices of many numerous companies including ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, Occidental, and many others. The fossil fuel industry also has a close relationship with the Houston Police Department through the Houston Police Foundation, a non-profit that channels corporate donations to city police. Oil billionaires like Jeffery Hildebrand sit on the Houston Police Foundation board, and the foundation helps fund police programs, including the Mounted Patrol that aided attacks on climate activists during CERAWeek. The Houston Police Department used horses to try to disperse activists peacefully protesting CERAWeek, injuring and nearly trampling people in the process. Several fossil fuel corporations sponsor the Houston Police Department’s Mounted Patrol horses through the Adopt-A-Horse program. Credit: Luigi Morris. In fact, oil companies like Chevron, Shell and Valero sponsor individual Mounted Patrol horses. (For more on police foundations and their ties to the fossil fuel industry, check out our 2020 story and our 2021 report coauthored with Color of Change). CERAWeek and the Fossil Fuel Industry Power Structure CERAWeek performs several roles within the fossil fuel industry and wider energy power structure. Legitimizing the Fossil Fuel Industry While CERAWeek ultimately functions as a show of force for the fossil fuel industry and a space for it to hash things out, it has a veneer of legitimizing wonkiness and expertise. CERAWeek was founded by Daniel Yergin in the early 1980s, a decorated author who has carved out a space as a benign interlocutor between the fossil fuel industry and civil society — an author with intellectual bona fides who has deep and direct personal ties to the corporate energy world. Yergin has numerous influential ties to academic institutions, like MIT and Columbia University, and government-aligned think tanks like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institution. He has authored several well-known books about the fossil fuel industry — most notably his award-winning The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power — while also serving on advisory boards and boards of directors of key industry groups and think tanks worldwide. Over his career, Yergin has run high-profile energy consulting firms and serves as a Senior Advisor with private equity giant Carlyle Group (a “Strategic Partner” of CERAWeek that is also a major fossil fuel investor). All told, the spectacle of a massive, public-facing conference, well covered by the media, celebrating and discussing the energy industry and its fossil fuel giants, all given a wonkish gloss by analysts, academics and consultants, provides cover for an industry whose core operations are widely known to be driving climate chaos. Networking, Schmoozing, Dealmaking Gatherings like CERAWeek are critical sites for industry networking. CERAWeeks says it convenes “over 450 C-Suite executives, 80 ministers and top officials, and 325 media representatives.” Participants chat, schmooze and socialize behind closed doors or at any number of extended Happy Hours. This helps build and cultivate relationships and allows for conversations that lead to new contracts, deals, positions, and so on. At CERAWeek, this networking is all the more important because many high-level representatives of government and international companies are attending. The energy priorities that are hashed out through these conversations — the formal panels, and also the backroom discussion — can have deep implications for global energy policy and geopolitics (one of the event’s themes). Taking Stock of Industry Trends and Fractions CERAWeek’s huge numbers and ambitious agenda also present a moment for taking stock of the energy industry’s present and its future. Conference themes explore the gamut of areas within the corporate energy world. This year’s themes included Policy and Regulation, Oil and Gas, Power, Grid and Electrification, Trade and Supply Chains, Business Strategies, Minerals and Mining, Technology and Innovation, and more. Different fractions of the energy industry, some aspiring, can also use CERAWeek to make their case. “AI and Digital,” for example, is a conference theme this year. The rise of data centers needed to power AI has strengthened the nexus between the fossil fuel industry, Big Tech, and financial investors, at the expense of a green energy transition. The event is also filled with the world’s top private equity firms and asset managers, who remain not only wedded to fossil fuels but retreated from previous net zero commitments – indeed, Finance (“The Capital Transition”) was a theme of CERAWeek this year. Greenwashing CERAWeek is also a performance in greenwashing. The fossil fuel industry today is simultaneously doubling down on its core business of oil and gas extraction and production while also giving lip service to concerns over carbon emissions and seeking to capture and profit from false solutions like carbon capture and hydrogen. CERAWeek allows the fossil fuel industry to do both these things. The conference is dominated by fossil fuel giants who are currently racing to drill and burn more oil and gas, but also to gobble up subsidies and produce hydrogen plants — falsely promoting hydrogen as a climate “solution.” Indeed, CERAWeek 2025 included themes like “Managing Emissions,” “Climate and Sustainability,” and “Hydrogen and Low-Carbon Fuels.” But as Kate Aronoff reported on a previous CERAWeek: “There’s some people involved with copper and lithium and various things, but the main focus is oil and gas, and with a pretty specific focus within oil and gas on some of the bigger companies.” CERAWeek’s Billionaires Among the most powerful people at CERAWeek are a slew of oil billionaires, tech titans, and fossil fuel financiers who, whether they show up in person, stand to benefit from the discussions and deal-making that occur at the gathering. Among these are: Hundreds of Climate Activists Protest CERAWeek Recognizing the opportunity to disrupt mainstream messaging about CERAWeek, and to confront the fossil fuel industry and lift up the stories of frontline communities fighting fossil fuel infrastructure, dozens of climate justice groups participated in coordinated days of actions protesting CERAWeek. Hundreds of elders, young people, and residents of rural areas and cities, marched to demand an end to fossil fuels and accountability of wealthy polluters. Hundreds of climate activists marched in downtown Houston to protest CERAWeek. Credit: Lauren Parker. Activists specifically focused on the build out of methane gas (also known by euphemism “liquified natural gas”) export terminals along the Gulf South. These export terminals rely on transporting fracked gas via pipelines and have notoriously imperiled local communities due to toxic air releases, overdrawing water resources, and destroying precious marine habitats. In June of 2022, the Freeport LNG terminal actually exploded, sending a 450-foot ball of fire and pollutants into the air, shaking the houses of nearby residents. Freeport LNG’s CEO, billionaire Michael Smith, was a featured speaker at CERAWeek, stating that methane gas was “necessary”, echoing other speakers’ sentiments which downplayed the urgent need for renewable energy sources. At the culmination of the march, eight frontline and Indigenous activists and allies sat in the intersection in front of the CERAWeek conference. The Houston Police Department violently attacked these activists with Mounted Patrol horses before conducting arrests. As noted above, major oil and gas corporations sponsor these horses, underscoring the tight and varied relationships between policing and the energy industry to suppress struggles against fossil fuels. CERAWeek, an extravagant display of billionaire power and the convergence of the fossil fuel industry, government, tech and finance, stood in stark contrast to those in the march – everyday people fighting for clean water and air in their hometowns, sovereignty for Indigenous communities, an end to extractive energy systems, and a liveable future for generations to come.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough , Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have dropped after surging in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s election victory (though a White House official has just revealed how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has fallen to around $85,000 per bitcoin, down from a peak of $110,000 per bitcoin in January, as traders scramble to protect their bitcoin from a new, mystery threat. Now, after the Federal Reserve confirmed expectations it could be about to open the “floodgates," Fed chair Jerome Powell has warned the risk of recession is rising—something BlackRock’s head of bitcoin and crypto has predicted could be a “big catalyst” for the bitcoin price. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has said the risk of recession has ticked up—something ... More BlackRock's head of bitcoin and crypto thinks could fuel a bitcoin price boom. “I don’t know if we’ll have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for bitcoin,” Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, told Yahoo Finance in an interview, pointing to how recession responses such as increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, lower interest rates and monetary stimulus have historically boosted the bitcoin price. "And it’s catalyzed to some extent over fears of general social disorder,” Mitchnick said. “And that, too, unfortunately, is something that can happen in a recession.” This week, the Fed downgraded its economic growth outlook while raising its inflation projection while leaving interest rates on hold. "If you look at outside forecasts, forecasters have generally raised … their possibility of a recession somewhat, but still at relatively moderate level … [it] has moved up, but it’s not high,” Fed chair Jerome Powell said during his post-interest rate decision press conference. Ahead of Powell’s comments, Moody’s Analytics’ chief economist Mark Zandi told CNN it “feels like we’re being pushed into recession” by Donald Trump’s international trade tariffs. “The recession risks are uncomfortably high and they’re rising,” Zandi said. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen back in recent weeks but remains far higher than before Donald Trump's ... More election victory despite the Federal Reserve warning recession risks are rising. Meanwhile, UCLA Anderson School of Management has published an official “Recession Watch” for the first time in its 73 years of economic forecasts, with its chief economist Clement Bohr predicting Trump “could very well be the author of a deep recession.” Earlier this month, BlackRock’s chief executive Larry Fink warned Trump’s trade policies will stoke inflation—dampening expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025 and invoking the specter of “stagflation”—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises. Fink, who has become one of the most bullish voices supporting bitcoin on Wall Street, led BlackRock in its campaign to get a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved in the U.S. through 2023, with a fleet of bitcoin funds making their debut in January 2024 before surging to become some of the fastest growing ETFs of all time. U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs broke $100 billion in net assets for the first time in November, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now boasting around $50 billion in assets under management.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Iconic ice-cream company Ben & Jerry’s (B&J), founded by two hippies based on knowledge gained through a $5-correspondence-course, is taking on the might of its parent, the Anglo-Dutch multinational Unilever. The issue: Unilever has sacked B&J’s chief executive, ostensibly for the ice-cream company’s public support for Palestinian refugees, in alleged contravention of their merger agreement of 2000 that B&J’s board would retain its independence. It’s a classic David-versus-Goliath spectator sport. But the essence of this spat between the owners of dominant brands—a popular ice-cream maker (this columnist’s preferred flavour remains Cherry Garcia, launched in 1985 as homage to Grateful Dead lead guitarist and vocalist Jerry Garcia) and a consumer goods conglomerate—is the influence that geopolitics can have on brands. Or, conversely, how brands influence geopolitics. Also Read: AI agents want to take over marketing but humans must stay in chargeBrands have always been influential in changing the course of geopolitics. Go back 110 years to 1914, the eve of World War I. The ensuing war sounded a death knell for the Ottoman Empire, with the 1916 Anglo-French Sykes-Picot agreement signed to divide the area between two colonial powers. The US and Russia also wanted in on the carve-up. By 1923, arbitrary lines were drawn in the sand and from the West Asian desert sprang new nation-states: Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan. Anthony Sampson’s book, The Seven Sisters (1975), documents how seven multinational oil companies—Shell, BP, Standard Oil, Texaco, Mobil, Chevron and Gulf Oil—influenced the foreign policies of the UK, US and France and manipulated the drawing of borders to secure oil concessions. Oil and geopolitics have always made for torrid bedfellows and the continuing Middle East strife bears testimony to that. Cast your mind back to 1973 when Chile’s democratically elected president Salvador Allende was killed in a bloody coup mounted by military general Augusto Pinochet, with some covert assistance from US intelligence corps. Declassified documents have also revealed the smudged fingerprints of US multinationals—IT&T, Pepsi, IBM, Kennecott Copper and Anaconda Copper. Costa-Gavras’s award-winning 1982 movie Missing fictionalized the Nixon administration’s assistance for the repressive dictator, which included a refusal to even help US citizens tortured and killed by the brutal regime.

But then, there are Mondelez and Procter & Gamble (P&G) which decided to stick around, displaying a different geopolitical belief system. In a March 2022 letter to employees, P&G’s chief executive Jon Moeller said the company was scaling down its product portfolio and halting capital investments, but would continue to “focus on basic health, hygiene and personal care items needed by the many Russian families who depend on them in their daily lives." Also Read: Brands often get lost looking for gold at the end of a rainbowHowever, aligning brand values with geopolitics can be tricky, especially if customers discover dishonesty in the process. McDonald’s asymmetric response to geopolitics—quitting Russia over the Ukraine invasion but continuing to remain open in Israel despite Gaza atrocities—has consumers across North Africa,West Asia, Malaysia, Indonesia and parts of India boycotting the brand. This is hurting where it hurts the most: a drop in sales has resulted in net income erosion and earnings per share (EPS) shaved off. The same holds true for Starbucks, which has also seen chunks lopped off its net income and EPS. Donald Trump’s second term in office has triggered a fresh bout of geopolitical churn, with US companies falling over themselves to align with the emerging policy regime. Blackrock, for example, has bought two ports on either side of the Panama Canal, Meta has reversed its content moderation policy, BP has shelved renewable energy investment plans and Accenture has scaled back its celebrated DEI policy. Elon Musk has added a new dimension to the blend. He has sued large advertisers, such as Disney, who pulled their advertising from the X platform after Musk acquired it in 2022.

Some companies abandoned their assets on the ground, some handed over the keys to senior managers, some found local Russian buyers and some companies were forcibly taken over. Starbucks, for example, became Stars Coffee and the mermaid in its logo has morphed into a Russian swan princess. McDonald’s in Russia also sports a new name and a changed logo. But then, there are Mondelez and Procter & Gamble (P&G) which decided to stick around, displaying a different geopolitical belief system. In a March 2022 letter to employees, P&G’s chief executive Jon Moeller said the company was scaling down its product portfolio and halting capital investments, but would continue to “focus on basic health, hygiene and personal care items needed by the many Russian families who depend on them in their daily lives."

Title: Trump’s Policy Toward Latin America: Crippling Sanctions against Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/trump-policy-toward-latin-america/5882481
Time Published: 2025-03-23T10:14:12Z
Full Content:
During his first term, President Donald Trump exerted a “maximum pressure” campaign against perceived U.S. adversaries in Latin America and elsewhere. Among other hardline policies, he levelled crippling sanctions against Venezuela—leading, ironically, to a mass exodus of Venezuelans to the United States—and reversed former President Barack Obama’s rapprochement with Cuba. But just how committed is Trump to fighting communism in Latin America at this particular moment—in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua? Today, it’s anyone’s guess. Trump’s recent threats against Panama, Canada, and Greenland, on top of his clash with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, take the spotlight off the “real enemies,” as usually defined by Washington. In that sense, Trump’s foreign policy actions in the first two months of his second administration are a far cry from his first, when regime change was the unmistakable goal. In sharp contrast to the rhetoric of his first administration, in his March 4 address to the Joint Session of Congress Trump made no reference to Nicolás Maduro, Miguel Díaz-Canel, or Daniel Ortega. It’s even unclear whether Trump will pursue the use of international sanctions, which he ratcheted up against Venezuela and Cuba in his first government. So far, Trump has indicated that his use of “tariffs as punishment” may be preferable to international sanctions, which, as one insider stated, the president “worries are causing countries to move away from the U.S. dollar.” Unlike Trump’s policies on immigration, trans rights, and taxation, his Latin American policy is plagued by vacillations and uncertainties, a sign of his deepening reliance on a transactional approach to foreign policy. The anti-communist hardliners in and outside of the Republican party are not pleased. Take Venezuela as an example. The Venezuelan opposition led by María Corina Machado had all the reason to be upbeat when Trump won in November and then chose Latin America hawk Marco Rubio as Secretary of State. “Sadly, Venezuela is governed by a narco-trafficking organization,” Rubio declared at his confirmation hearing, in which his appointment was unanimously ratified. He then said that “the Biden administration got played” when it negotiated with Maduro in late- 2022 and issued a license to Chevron, which is “providing billions of dollars into the regimes’ coffers.” With regard to Cuba, Rubio issued an ominous warning: “The moment of truth is arriving, Cuba is literally collapsing.” Events in Syria added to the euphoria on the right. Just days before Trump’s inauguration, Machado told the Financial Times, “Don’t you think [the generals supporting Maduro] look in the mirror and see the generals which Assad left behind?” But then came the friendly encounter between Trump’s envoy for special missions Richard Grenell and Maduro in Caracas in late January, when Maduro agreed to turn over six U.S. prisoners in Venezuela and facilitate the return of Venezuelan immigrants from the United States. Days later, the Biden-approved license with Chevron for exploiting Venezuelan oil, constituting a quarter of the nation’s total oil production, was allowed to roll over. At the same time, Grenell declared that Trump “does not want to make changes to the [Maduro] regime.” To complicate matters further, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it would cancel Biden’s extension of Temporary Protected Status for over 300,000 Venezuelan immigrants, on grounds that “there are notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime that allow for these nationals to be safely returned to their home country.” These developments did not sit well with the Miami hawks and the Venezuelan opposition. Notorious Miami Herald journalist Andres Oppenheimer put it forcefully: “The handshake of Grenell and Maduro fell like a bucket of cold water on many sectors of the Venezuelan opposition… and was like a legitimation of the Maduro government.” Oppenheimer went on to point out that although the Trump government denied it had cut a deal with Maduro, “many suspicions have been raised and will not dissipate until Trump clarifies the matter.” After Grenell’s trip to Venezuela, the issue of the renewal of Chevron’s license took surprising twists and turns. In a video conversation on February 26, Donald Trump Jr. told María Corina Machado that just an hour before, his father had tweeted that Chevron’s license would be discontinued. Following a burst of laughter, a delighted Machado directed remarks at Trump Sr.: “Look, Mr. President, Venezuela is the biggest opportunity in this continent, for you, for the American people, and for all the people in our continent.” . Watch on X . Machado appeared to be attempting to replicate the deal between Zelensky and Trump involving Ukraine’s mineral resources. But simultaneously, Mauricio Claver-Carone, the State’s Department’s Special Envoy for Latin America, told Oppenheimer that the license granted Chevron was “permanent” and automatically renewed every six months. Then, just one week later, Trump reversed his position again. Axios reported that the latest decision was due to pressure from three Florida GOP House members who threatened to withhold votes for Trump’s budget deal. Trump allegedly acknowledged this privately, telling insiders: “They’re going crazy and I need their votes.” Trump’s threats against world leaders come straight out of his 1987 book The Art of the Deal. For some loyalists, the strategy is working like magic. Trump’s approach can be summarized as “attack and negotiate.” “My style of deal-making is quite simple,” he states in the book. “I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing… to get what I’m after.” This is precisely what happened when Trump announced plans to “reclaim” the Panama Canal, prompting a Hong Kong-based firm to reveal plans to sell the operation of two Panamanian ports to a consortium that includes BlackRock. Not surprisingly, Trump took credit for the deal. A similar scenario played out in the case of Colombia, in which President Gustavo Petro yielded on U.S. deportation flights to avert trade retaliations. For the same reasons, Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum began sending 10,000 troops to the northern border to combat irregular crossings and then, on March 6, asked Trump by phone: “’How can we continue to collaborate if the U.S. is doing something that hurts the Mexican people?” In response, Trump temporarily suspended the implementation of 25 percent tariffs on Mexican goods. In The Art of the Deal, Trump boasts about this strategy of bluffing, such as when he told the New Jersey Licensing Commission that he was “more than willing to walk away from Atlantic City if the regulatory process proved to be too difficult or too time-consuming.” Similarly, Trump has repeatedly stated that the United States does not need Venezuelan oil. In fact, global oil volatility and the possibility that other nations will gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves are matters of great concern to Washington. The “Art of the Deal” approach to foreign policy exemplifies Trump’s pragmatic tendency. The Maduro government and some on the left welcome the pragmatism because it leaves open the possibility of concessions by Venezuela in return for the lifting of sanctions. Venezuelan government spokespeople, at least publicly, give Trump the benefit of the doubt by attributing his annulment of Chevron’s license and other adverse decisions to pressure from Miami’s far right. The Wall Street Journal reported that several U.S. businesspeople who traveled to Caracas and “met with Maduro and his inner circle say the Venezuelans were convinced that Trump would… engage with Maduro much like he had with the leaders of North Korea and Russia.” But this optimism overlooks the contrasting currents within Trumpism. Although the convergences are currently greater than the differences, priorities within the MAGA movement sometimes clash. On the one hand, right-wing populism spotlights the issue of immigration, anti-“wokism,” and opposition to foreign aid, all designed to appeal beyond the Republican Party’s traditional upper and upper-middle class base of support. On the other hand, the conventional far right calls for nothing short of regime change and destabilization actions against Venezuela and Cuba. While progressives have sharply different views on Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, the far-right hawks currently define all three governments as “leftist” and, in the recent words of Rubio, “enemies of humanity.” Maduro’s agreement to collaborate on the repatriation of immigrants in return for the renewal of the Chevron license exemplifies the conflicting priorities within Trumpism. For the anti-left far right, the alleged deal was a “betrayal” of principles by Washington, while for the right-wing populists it was a victory for Trump, especially given the enormity of Venezuela’s immigrant population. Another example of clashing priorities upheld by the two currents is the Trump administration’s decision to cut foreign aid programs to a bare minimum. In his recent address to Congress, Trump denounced an $8 million allotment to an LGBTQ+ program in an African nation “nobody has heard of,” and other alleged woke programs. Even Florida’s hawk senator Rick Scott has questioned the effectiveness of foreign aid, saying: “Let’s see: the Castro regime still controls Cuba, Venezuela just stole another election, Ortega is getting stronger in Nicaragua.” Scott’s statement reflects Trump’s transactional thinking regarding the Venezuelan opposition: too many dollars for regime-change attempts that turned out to be fiascos. In contrast, hawk champion Oppenheimer published an opinion piece in the Miami Herald titled “Trump’s Foreign Aid Cuts are a Boon for Dictators in China, Venezuela and Cuba.” The issue of U.S. aid has also produced infighting from an unexpected source: within the Venezuelan right-wing opposition. Miami-based investigative journalist Patricia Poleo, a long-time opponent of Hugo Chávez and Maduro, has accused Juan Guaidó and his interim government of pocketing millions, if not billions, granted them by the U.S. government. Poleo, now a U.S. citizen, claims that the FBI is investigating Guaidó for mishandling the money. The influence of the anti-leftist component of Trumpism can’t be overstated. Trump has become the leading inspiration of what has been called the new “Reactionary International,” which is committed to combatting the Left around the world. Furthermore, the hawks who have expressed interest in toppling the Maduro government (which the populist current is not at all opposed to either)—including Rubio, Elon Musk, Claver-Carone, and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz—populate Trump’s circle of advisors. It is not surprising that during the honeymoon phase of Trump’s presidency, a populist wish list would receive considerable attention. But the annexation of the Panama Canal, Canada, and Greenland is unrealizable, as is the conversion of Gaza into a Riviera of the Middle East. His tariff scheme is not far behind. Furthermore, while his use of intimidation has helped him gain concessions, the effectiveness of this bargaining tactic is limited—threats lose power when endlessly repeated. Finally, Trump’s unfulfilled promises to lower food prices and achieve other economic feats will inevitably add to the disillusionment of his supporters. Trump loathes losing and, in the face of declining popularity, he is likely to turn to more realistic goals that can count on bipartisan support in addition to endorsement from the commercial media. In this scenario, the three governments in the hemisphere perceived to be U.S. adversaries are likely targets. Short of U.S. boots on the ground—which would not garner popular support—military or non-military action cannot be discarded against Venezuela, Cuba, or Nicaragua, or, perhaps, Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: RWA News: Fidelity Files for OnChain U.S. Treasury Fund, Joining the Asset Tokenization Race

Asset manager Fidelity Investments has filed paperwork to register a blockchain-based, tokenized version of its U.S. dollar money market fund, aiming to join the tokenized asset race. According to a Friday filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company seeks to register an "OnChain" share class of its Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX) and use blockchains as transfer agent. FYHXX holds cash and U.S. Treasury securities and was launched late last year. The Onchain class of the fund currently uses the Ethereum (ETH) network, and the firm may expand to other blockchains in the future, the filing said. The registration is subject to regulatory approval, with the product expected to become effective on May 30. The filing happened as global banks and asset managers increasingly put traditional financial instruments such as government bonds, credit, and funds on blockchain rails, a process often referred to as tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). They do so to pursue operational and efficiency gains and faster, around-the-clock settlements. Fidelity, with $5.8 trillion in assets under management, is the latest traditional financial heavyweight seeking to enter the fast-growing tokenized U.S. Treasuries space. BlackRock (BLK), in partnership with digital asset firm Securitize, launched a similar tokenized T-bill fund last March called BUIDL and has become the market leader with nearly $1.5 billion of assets, rwa.xyz data shows. Franklin Templeton's fund, which was the first on-chain money market product, gathered $689 million in assets since its 2021 debut. The entire tokenized U.S. Treasury market is currently worth $4.77 billion, growing almost 500% over the past year, per rwa.xyz. Fidelity is also one of the largest issuers of spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the U.S., with its $16.5 billion FBTC and $780 million FETH, per SoSoValue data.

Title: Thrifted gifts: ‘If you’re worried about the environment, it’s conscience-free shopping’

“When somebody has gifted you something that has been thrifted, they put a huge amount of effort into it,” says vintage enthusiast Naomi Fitzgibbon. As owner of her own online boutique Vintage Finds You, Fitzgibbon specialises in second-hand fashion – “Irish vintage is the holy grail for me” – but she has a knack for unearthing all sorts of rare goods, and is passionate about thrifted gifting as a more sustainable alternative to buying something new. Gift-giving is one of five “love languages” coined by American author and radio host Gary Chapman in his 1992 book, which have since entered the cultural lexicon. If, like Fitzgibbon, you find joy in gift-giving, then opting to seek out thrifted gifts for your special someone might elicit an even greater sense of fulfilment. The appeal of giving or receiving thrifted presents is the fact that they are “so different, and they’re never going to find them anywhere else,” says Fitzgibbon. “They’re unique and special.” When on the hunt for gifts for family and friends at markets, in charity shops and online, she puts “a lot of thought into trying to find something they want, but that they’re not going to find anywhere else”. The item will hopefully be “a one-off thing” that can be treasured for years to come. If you are unsure whether a second-hand gift is right for someone, “test the water and see what they say,” she says. “You can always ask” for their opinion, by saying something like: “What would you think about that, would you wear it?” You’ll soon know whether the water is hot or cold. “If you’re into vintage yourself and people ask ‘Where did you get that’ and you go, ‘Oh, it’s vintage’ and they’re turning their nose up, you know it’s not going to work for them,” says Fitzgibbon. “Most of my friends and family appreciate vintage pieces, but there’s no point in buying [second-hand] for [for some people] because it’s just not their thing.” You could consider a piece of jewellery like a bracelet or necklace if second-hand clothes aren’t their cup of tea, she adds. “Ask the vendor as well, because they’re probably used to dealing with people who might be a little unsure.” Approaching your gift shopping with “an idea of what their likes and dislikes are, and what they are into” helps narrow the focus. “Homeware? Glassware? You can find some incredible vintage books in some of the Oxfams,” says Fitzgibbon, showing off a Japanese hand-lacquered jewellery box she found in Blackrock Market in Dublin. She is a regular visitor to Dublin’s various flea markets, and mentions Thomas Street as one hub. “There’s the Milk Market in Limerick, and some really good ones in Belfast as well,” she says. One of the most cherished thrifted gifts Fitzgibbon has received is a vintage silk Chinese hand-embroidered jacket. “It was a gift from my husband as he knows I’m fascinated by oriental vintage silks like this. He got it in Naples.” She wore the piece to a recent school reunion. Delphine Velut and Richard Harte run Le Zeitgeist Bohemia Flea Market in Phibsborough, north Dublin. Every second Sunday of the month, about 100 traders gather at the venue tucked behind Phibsborough Shopping centre. Some 60 stalls, featuring everything from leather goods, antiques, prints, vintage toys and clothes to mid-century furniture, handmade jewellery, candles and crafts can fit inside, sheltered from the elements. Another 40 stalls, full of fashion and bric-a-brac, occupy the outdoor area. The market has become immensely popular among the local community. “We have thousands of people coming through our door on a given Sunday,” says Harte. “For us it’s about [offering] a wide variety of quality things and also keeping an eye on what’s happening in the community. There are some lovely stories about traders testing their product and using us for a platform and then they’ve gone on to much bigger things, maybe opening shops in the city.” They both particularly enjoy the eclectic selection of trinkets on offer from “the bric-a-brac guys”. “We just love the outside area,” says Harte. “Although we do have some art and craft stalls, the emphasis is on creating a dirty free market, for want of a better word ... It’s so real.” The pair are proud to have created “a place where people can go and rummage and just not know what they’re going to find”. Like Fitzgibbon, Harte is a big fan of thrifted gifting. “If you’re conscious about the environment, it’s conscience-free shopping.” “All my gifts around Christmas time, I’d get them in the market. No matter who [the potential recipients] are or what they’re into, you’re going to find something there that’s going to tick the boxes.” It is important to keep an open mind and embrace the unexpected when on a thrifting mission for a gift. “Have something in mind but be prepared to go home with something completely different,” Harte advises. As a trader himself, he suggests customers bringing cash – “because it’s harder to haggle with a credit card”. “The first price is not necessarily the end price. They’re expecting a haggle. There’s always a bit of movement on the price.” Come prepared to root around. “It’s not the high street. Not everything is going to be laid out. You need to be in that mode, prepared to rummage through and seek out the bargains.” Market prices range broadly, so there’s something for every budget. “You could buy something for 50 cents, or a sideboard off the mid-century furniture guy for €1,500.” “If you have something in mind, just speak to [the traders] and tell them what you’re looking for. They could have something to bring you next month. That’s my advice on looking for the perfect gift.” Robert Reddin, one of the organisers of The Fairyhouse Market in Ratoath in Co Meath, echoes Harte’s advice over haggling. “If I was going for the first time I’d make sure I had small denominations. You are expected to do a bit of haggling.” The car boot sale, founded in 1991, operates every Sunday from the grounds of the Fairyhouse Race Course, except for race days. “My father started the market over 30 years ago with a partner and myself, and then other partners soon took over,” says Reddin says. The market has a selection of traders offering a mix of brand new goods, second-hand items and food stalls. “You never know what you’re going to find. As they say, one man’s junk is another man’s treasure. There are things that you don’t see in the average shop or shopping centre.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Her mother gave her 20 reasons not to buy – but she went sale agreed anyway

For Gráinne Wynne, owner of Beautiful South, a fashion boutique in Rathmines, 2020 was a difficult year. It started with her father having to go into a nursing home. Then the pandemic happened and then she separated from her husband. Divorced and with two children to house, and a finite amount of money with which to do so, she had to box clever to find them a new home. Like many of us, she was looking for something a bit special that she could make her own. She wanted a contemporary look, and had a penchant for poured concrete – as anyone who has popped into her shop on Castlewood Avenue in the Swan Centre, Rathmines, and coveted the brands on the hangers there will know. The place looks cool, but the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. It’s not the kind of place to sniffily look you up and down for daring to cross its threshold. She wanted a home that looked and felt similarly, and viewed about 100 properties in her attempt to find it. She even got as far as going sale agreed on a small house in Killiney. It had a big back garden with the potential to extend into it – subject of course to having the money to do so. Building costs put her off. And while she thought she wanted a garden, she realised that she didn’t have the time to attend to it. These combined reasons meant she didn’t go through with the sale. Instead, she followed her heart. Discreetly hidden off Main Street in Blackrock village, Co Dublin, she found a mews of about 118sq m. Originally configured as a commercial office, it had come to the market with residential planning permission. When she saw the space, her heart missed a beat. “My friends thought I was crazy,” she recalls. So did her mother. So much so that she wrote her a letter listing some 20 reasons not to buy it. She was in favour of her buying something more conventional, she recalls. Wynne understood her concerns. “Working in retail is a massive struggle. I had a finite amount of money and no pension,” she explains. “I went with her the first day she visited it,” her 88-year-old mother Marie Wynne says. “When you want something, you look at the plusses. You don’t see the minuses.” For the matriarch, one of the minuses was the number of stairs in the property. It didn’t have a garden either, she recalls, and her daughter Gráinne had wanted an outdoor green space. “If you’re a mother it’s your job to point out snags. Once it’s done, it’s done.” Laid out over four floors, with one room on each, the property’s layout meant Wynne could easily get her 10,000 steps a day in ascending and descending the spiral staircase that forms the spine of the building. Her mother had also flagged this issue. “She might need a pulley to get up the stairs in the future,” she laughs. Mother and daughter toured the area after that first viewing, walking down by the sea, and she realised all the village had to offer, including a wide expanse of Dublin Bay in lieu of a green space. The 88-year-old viewed the refurbishment for the first time only on Christmas Day. “It’s terrific,” she says, having now climbed up to the second floor on both December 25th and again on December 31st. “It’s definitely right for her.” She was over the moon, says Gráinne. “She came back on New Year’s Eve for a party and loved the vibe.” Friends who were equally sceptical were “blown away” by the refurbishment, Gráinne recalls. Fees on commercial buildings Change of use planning permission had already been granted thanks to a design submitted by Node Architects on behalf of the vendor before they brought the unit to market. In the application letter, available to view on the planning website of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the practice noted “that with the increase of opportunities for people to work from home came a decrease for demand for small office buildings such as this one”. Constructed in 2000 with ocean-liner-like oval windows and slightly curved walls, the four-story cedar-clad space had been vacant, the firm pointed out. In an acute housing shortage, a conversion to residential would create a new dwelling unit in the centre of Blackrock village, contributing to its vibrancy. As it was unoccupied, Wynne didn’t have to pay any rates. But commercial stamp duty was an issue. A good conveyancing solicitor was essential, Wynne says, when buying this type of property. Based in Carrick-on-Shannon, Carol McCormack Solicitors pointed out that while the planning had been applied for it hadn’t yet been acted on. The works and changes to the property would commence only once Wynne was the owner. “So legally, it was still viewed as a commercial unit, which had Revenue implications,” McCormack, explains. “Commercial stamp duty is at a rate of 7.5 per cent, rather than the residential 1 per cent rate.” Once planning is acted on there is a possibility of a rebate, she adds. With house-hunters casting their eyes wider to try to buy alternative options to the restricted stock levels of more traditional residential homes, McCormack feels we’re going to see more of this. The home is accessed through a vehicular arch and while the office had the rights to parking outside, the change-of-use application made the point that this space could be used as an outdoor terrace, In the same application Node Architects’ rationale was that “given the location of the building with easy access to many public transport modes, it is proposed to convert this parking space to an outdoor terrace serving the new dwelling. This will contribute to the open space requirements for the new house and there are additional balconies and terraces on each of the upper levels of the building which also add to this.” But, having committed to the purchase and the additional stamp duty fees, Wynne was left with a really tight budget to do all the works. It needed plumbing throughout, to fit the principal bathroom on the first-floor level, a shower en suite in one of the two bedrooms and a guest wc off her room. These have been fitted with black sanitary ware from the Bathroom Boutique. The electrics also needed attention. The bathrooms were originally server rooms and all their fuseboards had to be relocated, explains Greg Murray of Carne Electrical. “There was also much rerouting of data cables.” The property has two bedrooms and a mezzanine level. There is a charcoal and an off-white palette throughout, with microcement floors and on some walls, supplied by Stone Seal. There is a tiny terrace on each floor which gives access to outside space. Each room is a long rectangle shape that suits contemporary living, especially when zoning an open-plan kitchen diner. While Node Architects had suggested installing it on the mezzanine top floor, she opted for the floor below, because it had the largest footprint. The mezzanine level has been glassed in to dim down sound and heat transference. She retained all the fire doors, made by O’Carroll Joinery when the property was constructed. Greenery from Urban Plant Life, Howbert & Mays, Diarmuid Gavin at Dunnes Stores and Windy Ridge populates each floor. “I could see the potential. I believe in taking something simple and making it beautiful,” she says. She had a lot of help from Irish Conservatories and Building Services, and from her best friend Rod Hayden, who most recently helped her char her timber stair treads. “I’ve learned a lot in the last four years and would feel absolutely confident doing another refurbishment,” she concludes. So much so that she’s named the property Athena, after the Greek goddess of wisdom. There are still some minor elements to tease out. Living so centrally and beside food businesses means that the commercial bins are being fenced in, and an industrial ventilator that is making more noise than she’d like is being sorted, she says. “The place had never been residential before and we’re working together to remedy it.” irishconservatories.com; beautiful.south; © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

And we've basically landed right back where we started. Right now, Bitcoin's price now stands at $84,150 per coin after not budging over a seven-day period, according to CoinGecko data. It's up 0.2% on the day, but totally flat on the week. The asset jumped briefly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters Wednesday that everything was under control and that President Trump's tariffs would have a "transitory" effect on inflation. Bitcoin had been dipping—just like stocks—whenever President Trump abruptly announced tariffs over the past month. But investors seemed to like the news from Powell. American Bitcoin investors had been fast cashing out of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this month, but that all changed this week, Farside Investors data shows. Every day this week, money has flooded back into the new vehicles, with over half a billion entering the funds by Wednesday. About $734 million worth of funds reentered Bitcoin ETFs this week as investor sentiment has changed as speculators expect interest rates to lower this year. Note that the positive sentiment hasn't extended to all crypto ETFs, as Ethereum funds are collectively nursing a now 13-day losing streak (including Friday's fresh data)—even as Bitcoin funds show green over the last six days. Still, investors could still be in for a bumpy ride as data shows that Bitcoin's volatility is at a six-month high due, as worries about the U.S. economy and geopolitical tensions push people to adopt a more "risk-off" mindset. Amberdata Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt that volatility—in the short-term, at least—was likely here to stay. And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which said it would put right the previous administration's "mess" by being clearer on rules for the digital asset industry, made a statement that applies to Bitcoin mining: proof-of-work mining operations do not need to register their actions as they "do not involve the offer and sale of securities." According to the regulator, as a miner's "expectation to receive rewards is not derived from any third party's managerial or entrepreneurial efforts upon which the network's success depends," the activity does not come under the SEC's jurisdiction. Under crypto-friendly President Donald Trump, the regulator appears to be adopting a more relaxed approach to the space, and and has already scrapped a number of lawsuits and investigations targeting firms in the space. Meanwhile, BlackRock—the world's biggest asset manager—has tried to clear the air about Bitcoin... again. In an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box, the firm's Digital Asset Head Robert Mitchnick said that calling the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap a "risk-on" asset was not exactly accurate. "What we've seen lately seems to be self-fulfilling and actually a self-inflicted wound by some of the research and commentary that the industry does, leaning into this idea of it as a risk-on asset at times," Mitchnick said. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust has been one of the most successful BTC ETFs since its launch last January. Is the Wall Street giant trying to get more clients for its fund?

The White House said the investments would be in AI infrastructure, semiconductors, energy, American manufacturing and more. The White House said in a press release that the UAE agreed to the framework after President Donald Trump hosted the UAE National Security Advisor, HH Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, for a meeting in the Oval Office.

"The UAE remains committed to strengthening its economic ties with the U.S. by accelerating investments in artificial intelligence, advanced technology, infrastructure, energy, and healthcare – key pillars for sustainable growth and development," Sheikh Tahnoon added. According to the White House, investments in the framework include Abu Dhabi-based MGX, BlackRock, Microsoft and Global Infrastructure Partners working with NVIDIA and xAI to support "U.S. AI leadership." The group will mobilize up to $100 billion to support the build-out. Additionally, Emirates Global Aluminum is expected to invest in America’s first new aluminum smelter in 35 years.

Title: How Binance holds over two-thirds of the Stablecoin market

With huge stablecoin reserves and Futures trading volumes, there seems to be no competition at all. Binance has consistently maintained a dominant position in the crypto exchange landscape, with recent data highlighting its significant edge over competitors. From holding a commanding share of stablecoin reserves to leading the pack in Futures trading volumes, the exchange’s market presence continues to outpace other exchanges, Needless to say, these findings have simply reinforced Binance’s role as a key player in the crypto space. In today’s market, stablecoins remain the backbone of on-chain liquidity and trading efficiency – Providing price stability, reducing friction in capital movement, and serving as the default unit of account for traders worldwide. As of March 2025, Binance holds a staggering 66% share of stablecoin reserves among major exchanges, far outpacing rivals like OKX, Bitget, and Bybit. In fact, according to CryptoQuant data, Binance’s reserve-to-market cap ratio has climbed steadily since late 2023, while competitors have seen their shares stagnate or decline. Source: CryptoQuant The data underlined this growing gap – Binance and Binance.US dominate over two-thirds of the stablecoin ecosystem on centralized exchanges, bolstering the exchange’s deep liquidity and investor confidence. With $31 billion in reserves, Binance benefits from strong user inflows and a robust institutional presence. Meanwhile, new stablecoin projects in 2025 – across Layer 1s, fintech startups, and even potential government initiatives – only deepen the exchange’s strategic grip on this rapidly expanding asset class. Binance remains the undisputed leader in stablecoin reserves, holding approximately $31 billion – More than double the combined reserves of OKX, Bybit, and Coinbase. The data revealed a dramatic hike in Binance’s stablecoin holdings since late 2024. This coincided with renewed retail inflows, ETF-driven market optimism, and USDC’s resurgence after Circle’s January deal with BlackRock to expand tokenized treasuries. Source: Cryptoquant While Binance.US also saw some steady growth, competitors like Bitget and Kraken may appear dwarfed in comparison. Binance’s dominance stems from its deep liquidity pools, low-fee structure, and aggressive market-making programs that attract both institutional and retail users. Additionally, its early integration of stablecoins like FDUSD and TUSD as zero-fee trading pairs has kept volumes high. With new Layer 1 ecosystems launching stablecoins, Binance continues to capture most of those inflows. In January 2025, Binance blew past competitors with a staggering $1.08 trillion in monthly Futures trading volume – Nearly doubling Bybit ($509 billion) and eclipsing Coinbase and OKX. While February and March saw a pullback to $717 billion and $498 billion, respectively, Binance still commands the Futures arena. Its lead stems from an unmatched combination of deep liquidity, product breadth, and accessibility for retail and institutional users alike. Source: Cryptoquant The exchange benefits from an intuitive interface, low trading fees, and advanced risk-management tools that cater to high-volume futures traders. In mid-January, Binance also delisted a series of cross and isolated margin pairs, a move that may have streamlined capital allocation and improved trading efficiency for institutional accounts. To put it simply, despite regulatory overhang in some regions, Binance’s global reach keeps it ahead of the curve in this high-stakes derivatives market.

Title: Ireland look to show strides they have made by upsetting France in Six Nations opener

Time Published: 2025-03-22T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
It is a measure of the huge strides made by the Irish team compared to the corresponding first round game 12 months ago in Le Havre that Scott Bemand and his players are embracing much higher expectations of themselves. A year ago the Irish head coach spoke of firing a few shots at the French in that opening game, and succeeded to some extent with two tries in the last 10 minutes. Out of little acorns and all that. Now, having won five of their last seven games, including victories over Australia and New Zealand this season, they expect to be competitive against France and believe they can beat opponents whom Ireland have only overcome three times in 32 previous meetings. Bemand accepts that this year is the tougher schedule, with the big two of France and England (who have finished first and second since 2017) at home whereas they are away to their Celtic and Italian rivals. Yet in insisting they have to move their game further forward in this 2025 Six Nations, Bemand went so far as to say: “We’re hungry to close the gap on the monopoly held by England and France to a degree. They’ve always been the top two in the Six Nations for a good while.” Recalling last year’s Six Nations, Bemand said: “We were able to spend time developing our game, becoming harder to beat, sorting our set-piece out, getting more tries on the board, scoring against France for the first time in three years, scoring against England for the first time in I don’t know how long. “There’s little moments in games that we’ve been able to build. When we went to WXV1, we got more of those moments. We were more in games to the point that we beat a Tier One nation and secondly we were disappointed to lose to Canada. “France are no mugs. France are a very good team, incredibly talented group. Last World Cup they were a kick away from being in the final against the Red Roses. They’re a good group but we believe we’re going to cause more problems this time. We’re going to be a harder team to beat. “Coming out of this fixture on the weekend, this could very well be a quarter-final in a World Cup. So we want to come out of this knowing we can beat them, whether that means beating them or whether that means we’ve got the game to beat them. And by the time we get to a World Cup hopefully, it’s the next step on from whatever we achieve in this Six Nations.” Ireland retain only seven of the starting XV from last year’s 38-17 defeat to the French, while Les Bleus also retain just seven as Gaelle Mignot and David Ortiz make six changes to the French side compared to their last outing, a 39-14 defeat to a New Zealand side which Ireland had beaten 29-17 in the WXV1 last autumn, which suggests the gap has closed further this season. “They’ve had a relatively tough WXV1, and they said they’re reviewed hard,” said Bemand. “Bringing them to our shores gives us a great opportunity to test ourselves.” Still, the centre partnership of Gabrielle Vernier and Nassira Konde remains intact, while inside them Carla Arbez will make her first appearance for France since November 2023 and alongside the heartbeat of their team, the 61-times capped Toulouse scrumhalf Pauline Bourdon Sansus. Ireland perhaps exceeded expectations slightly last season with a third-place finish to secure qualification for both the WXV1 and the World Cup later this year. Although results and the schedule fell their way, they made the most of their luck and have benefited from competing against more elite teams in WXV1. “Getting the same position again is harder to do this year,” admitted Bemand. “So, if we came third, and we win three games, we’ve done better than we did this year. We also want to stretch ourselves. We’re targeting trying to close that gap on the top two, we want to become World Cup contenders. At some point, we got to take some chunks out of a Tier One nation and for us that’s doing something against a France or an England. With the successful reintroduction of the Sevens players, this Irish team has more firepower and more of a cutting edge than the side which lost to France a year ago. Brittany Hogan, Erin King and Aoife Wafer give them more go-forward carrying, Dannah O’Brien brings a strong kicking game and with Stacey Flood hitting the line, Amee-Leigh Costigan’s head-to-head with her French counterpart as captain and winger, Marine Menager, could be worth the admission money alone. France have usually brought more power and pace to this fixture but Bemand is an astute user of his replacements, and has opted for a 6-2 split in the belief that the benches will go some way toward determining the outcome. If Ireland are still in the mix at that stage, then anything is possible. Ireland: Stacey Flood (Railway Union RFC); Anna McGann (Railway Union RFC), Aoife Dalton (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Eve Higgins (Railway Union RFC), Amee-Leigh Costigan (Railway Union RFC/Munster, capt) Dannah O’Brien (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Emily Lane (Blackrock College RFC); Niamh O’Dowd (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Neve Jones (Gloucester-Hartpury), Linda Djougang (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Ruth Campbell (Old Belvedere RFC/Leinster), Dorothy Wall (Exeter Chiefs/Munster), Brittany Hogan (Old Belvedere RFC/Ulster), Erin King (Old Belvedere RFC), Aoife Wafer (Blackrock College RFC/Leinster).

Title: Dollar-pegged stablecoins are a hedge against volatility

Institutional interests soar as market uncertainty highlights the role of stablecoins in navigating economic pressures. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post from Maksym Sakharov, Co-Founder & Group CEO of WeFi. The current markets are experiencing tailwinds due to the tariffs imposed by the U.S. administration and retaliatory measures from trading partners. So far, however, the market proponents are saying that Trump’s tariffs are primarily a negotiation strategy, and their effect on businesses and consumers will remain manageable. Adding to uncertainty are the inflationary pressures that could challenge the Federal Reserve’s rate-cutting outlook as inflation is still stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. Besides that, an impending fiscal debate in Washington over the federal budget is also causing jitters in the market. Resolving the debt ceiling remains a pressing issue, as the Treasury is currently relying on “extraordinary measures” to meet U.S. financial obligations. The exact timeline for when these measures will be exhausted is unclear, but analysts anticipate they may run out after the first quarter. While the administration has proposed eliminating the debt ceiling, this could face resistance from fiscal conservatives in Congress. Despite these macroeconomic uncertainty, one sector that is experiencing steady growth is stablecoins, according to a recent report. Much of the volume is driven by flows in USDT and USDC. Stablecoins started as an experiment – a programmable digital currency that would make it easier for users to enter the crypto market and trade different digital assets. A decade later, they are a critical part of the wider digital financial infrastructure. At present, the stablecoin market cap stands at a record $226 billion and continues to expand. Demand in emerging markets drives this growth. According to a recent Ark Invest report, Dollar-pegged stablecoins are dominating the market. They account for over 98% of the stablecoin supply, with Gold and Euro-backed stablecoins only sharing a small portion of the market. In addition to this, Tether’s USDT accounts for over 60% of the total market. ARK’s research suggests that the market will expand and include Asian currency-backed stablecoins. Besides that, digital assets are going through a shift marked by “stablecoinization” and “dollarization.” Asian nations like China and Japan have offloaded record amounts of US Treasuries. Saudi Arabia has ended its 45-year petrodollar agreement, and BRICS nations are increasingly bypassing the SWIFT network to reduce reliance on the US dollar. Traditionally, Bitcoin and Ether served as the primary entry points into the digital asset ecosystem. However, over the past two years, stablecoins have taken the lead, now representing 35% to 50% of on-chain transaction volumes. Despite global regulatory headwinds, emerging markets have been adopting stablecoins. In Brazil, 90% of crypto transactions are done via stablecoins, primarily used for international purchases. A Visa report ranks Nigeria, India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil as the most active stablecoin markets, and Argentina ranks second in stablecoin holdings. Additionally, 6 out of every 10 purchases in the country were made using stablecoins pegged to the dollar, with near parity between USDC and USDT. This shift towards stablecoins in Argentina is driven by high inflation and the need to protect against the devaluation of the Argentine Peso. Clearly, in countries with unstable currencies, people turn to stablecoins such as USDT to safeguard their wealth. In addition to making cross-border transactions easier, this adoption offers a hedge against local currency volatility. This signals a serious challenge to outdated financial systems. Analysts predict that the 2025 stablecoin boom will push market capitalization to $400 billion or more. Projections suggest that stablecoins could reach a market cap of $3 trillion over the next five years. Most importantly, financial institutions are joining this trend. Stripe recently completed a $1 billion acquisition of Bridge, a startup that builds stablecoin infrastructure. Traditional banks such as BBVA plan to launch their own stablecoins by the end of 2025. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller described stablecoins as an important innovation. He stated that digital currencies can cut reliance on payment intermediaries, lower global costs, and improve efficiency. Last year, commerce nominee Howard Lutnick said stablecoins help support the dollar. Major Wall Street players like Bank of America, BlackRock, BNY Mellon, CBOE, Charles Schwab, and Citi are investing in the sector. Their participation signals that stablecoins are set to transform global payments. The trend is clear: stablecoins are no longer a crypto experiment — they are becoming a core part of financial infrastructure in emerging markets to move money globally. As adoption accelerates, the question is not if stablecoins will transform payments but how quickly they will stand alongside — or even replace — outdated financial systems.
