Title: Meesho IPO: Samir Arora Calls For Regulator Intervention On Fairness Amid Anchor Allotment Row

India’s red-hot IPO market has been jolted by a rare backlash after several major global investors reportedly pulled out of Meesho Ltd.’s anchor book, prompting Helios Capital founder Samir Arora to call for urgent regulatory intervention to make the process “more fair.” Arora criticised the current structure of anchor allocations in high-demand IPOs, describing them as “a valuable gift to be given to big funds by brokers and their investment banking arms.” Regulator must intervene to make this process more fair. Right now allocations in hot IPOs are just a valuable gift to be given to big funds by brokers and their investment banking arms. pic.twitter.com/IFjGHDD9H3 His comments followed a Bloomberg report that Meesho allocated nearly a quarter of its anchor tranche to SBI Funds Management Pvt., India’s largest asset manager a move that triggered pushback from other institutional investors. In a clarification posted later, Arora stressed that his criticism was not directed at SBI MF. “They are genuine anchors who do help in setting the price and commit very early,” he said. The issue, he insisted, lies with funds that inflate orders at the last minute to secure allocations without truly participating in price discovery. “Then what anchor,” he wrote, arguing that many so-called anchors simply “pile on” because the IPO is hot. My tweet is not against SBI MF for they are genuine anchors who do help in setting the price and commit very early. My point is against all these funds who inflate their orders at the last moment and do not really "anchor" any deal but pile on. Then what anchor.May be one ideaâ¦ https://t.co/FmCBITtB0W Arora floated a potential solution: anchor lists should be finalised and announced 30 days before an IPO opens, ensuring that institutions engage meaningfully in negotiating and setting valuations instead of swooping in based on the momentum of the deal. The current process, he said, encourages opportunistic bidding driven by commissions and size rather than long-term commitment. According to a report by Bloomberg, Meesho’s anchor book faced withdrawals from several prominent investors after the disproportionate allocation to SBI Funds. Those who pulled out included Capital Group, Aberdeen Group Plc, Norges Bank Investment Management, ICICI Prudential AMC, Nippon India Life Asset Management, and Nomura Asset Management. Many of these funds, according to the report, had sought allocations similar to SBI Funds and opted out in protest when their expectations were not met. The anchor tranche is a crucial signalling mechanism for market confidence, typically drawing long-only global investors who help set the tone for pricing. Meesho, however, received strong institutional participation in its pre-IPO anchor round, raising Rs 2,440 crore on Tuesday. Marque foreign entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, Government of Singapore, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Schroder Group, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were allotted shares.

Melligeri, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Aequs Limited | Photo Credit: TH Aequs, a contract manufacturing firm specialising in consumer durable goods and aerospace parts, on Tuesday said it has garnered ₹414 crore from anchor investors, ahead of its initial public offering (IPO). The anchor book saw participation from domestic and global institutional investors, including SBI Mutual Fund (MF), HDFC MF, ICICI Prudential MF, Axis MF, Motilal Oswal MF, BlackRock Global Funds, Steadview Capital, and Citigroup, according to a circular uploaded on BSE's website. As per the circular, Aequs has allotted around 3.34 crore equity shares to 33 funds at ₹124 apiece, raising ₹413.92 crore. The initial share sale will open for subscription on December 3 and close on December 5. The price band has been set at ₹118-124 per share for the issue, valuing Aequs at over ₹8,300 crore. The IPO comprises a fresh issue of shares worth ₹670 crore, along with an offer for sale (OFS) of 2.03 crore shares valued at ₹252 crore by promoters and existing investors, taking the total issue size to ₹922 crore. Funds raised from the fresh issue would be used for repaying loans taken by the company and its two subsidiaries -- AeroStructures Manufacturing India and Aequs Consumer Products; purchasing machinery and equipment for the company and AeroStructures; and supporting future growth through potential acquisitions, other strategic initiatives, and for general corporate needs. Last month, Aequs raised around ₹144 crore from SBI Funds Management, DSP India Fund and Think India Opportunities Fund as a part of a pre-IPO funding round. Aequs initially filed confidential draft papers with Sebi in June and secured approval in September to launch the IPO. By opting for the confidential pre-filing route, the company could delay public disclosure of IPO details until later stages, a strategy increasingly adopted by Indian firms seeking flexibility in their IPO planning. Aequs primarily operates in the aerospace segment, but over the years, it has expanded its product portfolio to include consumer electronics, plastics, and consumer durables. Its consumer products include cookware and small home appliances, while its plastics offerings include outdoor toys, figurines, toy vehicles, and components for consumer electronics such as portable computers and smart devices. The company is backed by prominent investors, including Amicus Capital, Amansa Capital, Steadview Capital, Catamaran -- the family office of Infosys founder N R Narayana Murthy --, and Sparta Group. Its key clients are Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Collins Aerospace, Spirit AeroSystems Inc., Safran, GKN Aerospace, Mubea Aerostructures, Honeywell, Eaton, and Sabca in aerospace, and Hasbro, Spinmaster, Wonderchef, and Tramontina in consumer products. It operates manufacturing facilities across India, France, and the USA. In India, the company runs three manufacturing clusters in Belagavi, Hubballi, and Koppal in Karnataka. Founded by Aravind Melligeri, who has decades of experience in the aerospace sector and was a co-founder of Quest Global Engineering. As per the company, 75 per cent of the issue size has been reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 15 per cent for non-institutional investors and the remaining 10 per cent for retail investors. The company will make its debut on the stock market on December 10. Published on December 3, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

The Softbank-backed firm Meesho’s IPO remained modest, with the issue subscribed 0.56 times so far on the first day of bidding. Retail investors drove most of the early traction, while institutional participation remained absent in the initial hours. Two other mainboard IPOs, which opened today, Aequs and Vidya Wires were fully subscribed by mid-day. “We believe Aequs Ltd IPO brings investors an opportunity to invest in a one of India’s most advanced and fully integrated aerospace precision-manufacturing platforms. We think with a unique position as the only Indian manufacturer operating from a single SEZ with end to end aerospace capabilities that is spanning machining, forging, surface treatment and assembly, company offers high entry-barrier exposure to a globally outsourced industry. We also think company’s global manufacturing footprint across India, the U.S. and France enhances customer proximity and collaboration, enabling it to win and retain long-term contracts with global OEMs such as Airbus, Boeing, Safran Collins and Spirit AeroSystems, many of whom have relationships exceeding 15 years. By looking at the financials, While the company reported muted financial performance the revenue from operations growth of 18.8% in FY24 followed by a 4.2% decline in FY25, with losses driven largely by a slowdown in the consumer division and strategic business transitions. While the core aerospace segment continues to demonstrate strong and structural momentum. On valuation parse at the upper price band of Rs. 124/-, the issue is asking for a Market cap of Rs. 8316/- cr. Based on FY2026 annualised earning company is asking for price to book value of 5.7x which seems reasonable compare to its listed peer trading at an average of ~10x. Given the strong customer stickiness, a diversified portfolio and JVs with global leaders like Magellan Aerospace, Aubert & Duval and Tramontina, we believe Aequs is well-positioned to capture the rising outsourcing trend in aerospace precision components. Its ability to leverage aerospace capabilities into high-volume consumer products further strengthens utilisation and margins. Hence, considering its strong competitive moat, global customer base, and alignment with the rising aerospace manufacturing opportunity in India, we recommend investors to “SUBSCRIBE” the Aequs Ltd IPO for a long-term perspective.” Contrary to manufacturing, services in the private sector showed an improvement in November, a survey by S&P Global, released on Wednesday, showed.

India’s metals sector is riding a wave of optimism after a strong second-quarter performance in FY26, with brokerages projecting robust growth through the remainder of the year even as corporate capex slows. The rupee on Wednesday breached the psychologically crucial 90 per US dollar mark, weighed down by factors such as continued FPI outflows from the equity markets, lack of clarity on a trade deal with the US, widening trade deficit, and restrained RBI intervention, among others. The rupee falls below 90/USD amid FPI outflows and trade deal uncertainties, raising concerns over currency stability. Silver rose to a record, as traders laid speculative bets on continued supply tightness and lower borrowing costs in the US. Gold also gained. Silver reaches a record high of $58.94 amid supply tightness and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intelegain.rb Recent Interview...

Meanwhile he provided a hint pointing to Kevin Hassett as the “potential” next Federal Reserve chair during a White House event Meanwhile, Switzerland signalled that it may need to adjust to ongoing US tariffs despite securing parity with the EU in a recent tariff deal. SECO chief Helene Budliger Artieda noted that a return to earlier tariff levels appears unlikely in the near term. On the domestic front The government clarified that it is not considering a proposal to raise the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in public sector banks to 49% from the current 20%. At present, the FDI cap stands at 20% for PSBs and 74% for private banks, with automatic approval permitted up to 49% and the government route required beyond that. Separately, the Cabinet Secretariat has asked state governments to flag any pending issues they face with central government departments in connection with its ongoing deregulation exercise, multiple senior government officials said, ahead of a meeting of chief secretaries later this month to review the reforms. In the commodities segment, India’s palm oil imports inched up 4.6% month-on-month in November to 630,000 metric tons, as refiners capitalised on lower prices and trimmed purchases of costlier soyoil and sunflower oil. Energy flows saw a sharp adjustment as India’s imports of Russian crude declined following stricter US sanctions implemented on November 21. While November arrivals averaged 1.8 million bpd—boosted by pre-sanction stocking—post-deadline shipments dropped to 1.27 million bpd. December imports are projected at around 1.0 million bpd, with a potential temporary dip toward 800,000 bpd before stabilising. On the macro outlook, the OECD maintained its FY26 growth forecast for India at 6.7%, supported by monetary easing and GST reforms, and kept the FY27 projection unchanged at 6.2%. It noted that a successful rollback of US tariffs could lift confidence and boost manufacturing exports, while elevated oil prices remain a key downside risk for inflation and consumption. Meanwhile, under the Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment (SASCI) scheme, just over one-third of the FY26 allocation—₹56,826 crore—has been released for 4,106 approved projects as of November 27. Uttar Pradesh leads with 482 projects worth ₹8,465 crore, followed by Maharashtra (331) and Odisha (288), with the top 10 states accounting for about 65% of total sanctioned projects.

Title: Marvell Rallies After Upbeat CEO Remarks, Celestial AI Deal

(Bloomberg) -- Marvell Technology Inc. rallied in late trading after reassuring investors that its custom chip-design unit is winning repeat orders, signaling continued growth as the company benefits from runaway spending on AI computing. On a post-earnings conference call with analysts, Marvell said it’s now more bullish about revenue growth next year and predicted that custom chip sales will increase 20%. Large customers have renewed orders, and Marvell said there won’t be a repeat of previous “air pockets,” when sales in that unit have declined. The company also announced plans to acquire startup Celestial AI for at least $3.25 billion, a move it said would bolster the artificial intelligence push. On the call, Chief Executive Officer Matt Murphy indicated that Marvell revenue could reach $10 billion in the next fiscal year, well above the $9.47 billion predicted by analysts. “We’re very optimistic about our outlook over the next couple of years,” he said. The remarks sent the shares up more than 15% in late trading, reversing earlier declines. The stock had been down 16% this year through Tuesday’s close. Marvell has tried to position itself to benefit from the AI spending boom — with mixed success. Though it’s helping cloud-computing companies like Amazon.com Inc. design custom chips to handle AI, those products aren’t as widespread as Nvidia Corp. processors. The latest commentary suggests that Marvell is making some headway. On the call, the company said it expected “accelerated growth” in its custom chip business. Recent customer wins include an “emerging hyperscaler” — an industry term that describes a large data-center operator. Marvell also forecast revenue of roughly $2.2 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, which runs through January, in line with the average Wall Street projection. Adjusted gross margin will be about 59% in the period, the company said, compared with an average prediction of 59.5%. Marvell forecast earnings of 79 cents a share, matching the estimate. In the Celestial AI deal, Marvell is offering $1 billion in cash and stock valued at $2.25 billion, according to a separate statement. Under the agreement, Celestial AI investors stand to be paid as much as $2.25 billion in additional Marvell shares if the business hits certain revenue targets. Celestial AI, a Santa Clara, California-based startup founded in 2020, offers a technology called photonic fabric that connects components within AI infrastructure. It relies on light to more efficiently move data, helping artificial intelligence systems run more quickly. The startup, which completed a $255 million funding round in August, was backed by Fidelity Management & Research Co., BlackRock Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Lip-Bu Tan also was an investor, and he joined the company’s board earlier this year. The takeover is slated to close in the first calendar quarter of 2026. The additional payouts begin to take effect if Celestial AI reaches cumulative revenue of at least $500 million by the end of Marvell’s fiscal 2029. The full amount will be paid if the cumulative revenue tops $2 billion by that point. The Information previously reported that Marvell was in talks to acquire Celestial AI.

Title: Private Equity Circles Big Oil’s Pipelines as Majors Hunt for Cash

More Info The world’s biggest private equity groups are investing in infrastructure assets of the national oil companies of the Middle East as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) opened their pipeline networks to foreign capital. Private equity giants are now seeking a slice of the infrastructure assets of the international majors in deals that would give Big Oil funds to reinvest in oil and gas production. These days, amid lower oil prices and continued reluctance of public-market investors despite the dramatic shift in the ESG narrative, private equity money could be an opportunity for the top Western majors to raise cash by selling parts of their pipeline and storage assets. The infrastructure deals in the oil and gas sector began from the Middle East, but these could spread to the international majors, which need capital to sustain dividends and buybacks at $60 oil and have enough to invest in boosting oil and gas production. Investors Eye Big Oil’s Infrastructure Assets Investors have recently urged top executives from ExxonMobil, BP, TotalEnergies, and Eni to consider selling stakes in pipeline and storage assets to private equity groups in what would be a new way for Big Oil to monetize their infrastructure assets and one that doesn’t involve equity-market investors. Ahead of ADIPEC, one of the energy industry’s top gatherings, private equity teams sat down at a closed-door meeting with Exxon, BP, TotalEnergies, and Eni and told their executives that they could offload more of their infrastructure assets, the Financial Times reports. “You guys need to rethink how you think about capital,” one participant at the meeting told the majors, the FT says. Right now, private equity giants are more inclined to invest in Big Oil than the equity markets that are “not as receptive” to the oil and gas industry, the participant told FT. Related: U.S. Sanctions Force Serbia's Only Refinery to Shut Down “Take the cheap capital and reinvest it in your core business,” the person added, referring to Big Oil’s opportunities to attract funds from the infrastructure arms of the biggest investment firms. Some deals have been made this year. For example, Apollo-managed funds in March signed a deal with BP to invest about $1 billion to purchase a 25% non-controlling stake in BP Pipelines (TANAP) Ltd, the BP subsidiary that holds BP’s 12% interest in TANAP, owner and operator of the pipeline that carries natural gas from Azerbaijan across Turkey. While the deal enables BP to monetise its interest in TANAP, BP will remain the controlling shareholder of BP TANAP and retain a long-term commercial and strategic interest, including governance rights, in the pipeline - a vital part of the gas value chain for the BP-operated Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan. Prior to that, Apollo and BP signed an agreement for Apollo to buy a non-controlling stake in BP Pipelines TAP Limited, which holds a 20% share in Trans Adriatic Pipeline AG (TAP) in a transaction valued at about $1 billion. “BP and Apollo continue to explore opportunities for further cooperation, including in infrastructure, gas and low carbon energy assets,” the UK-based supermajor said in March 2025, just as it had unveiled its strategic reset to shift focus back to oil and gas. This summer, Shell completed the sale of its 16.125% interest in the company owning the Colonial Pipeline in the U.S. to Colossus AcquireCo LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. and its institutional partners. Other supermajors have yet to announce major deals in the trend that the Middle East’s national oil companies kicked off. Investors Flock to Middle East Energy Infrastructure As early as in 2020, Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC struck a $20.7-billion deal with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) and Brookfield, among other investors, to sell a 49% stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets LLC. This year, global investment firm KKR bought a minority stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets. KKR was part of the first-ever energy infrastructure deal for a Middle Eastern NOC when it bought in 2019 a minority stake in ADNOC’s oil pipelines business. The 2019 acquisition of 40% in ADNOC Oil Pipelines by KKR and BlackRock was the first-ever investment of foreign asset managers in infrastructure of a state-owned energy firm in the Gulf. Last year, KKR and BlackRock sold the 40% stake in ADNOC Oil Pipelines to Abu Dhabi-based alternative investment manager Lunate. Saudi Arabia is also looking for opportunities to monetize Aramco’s infrastructure with deals with global funds. Earlier this year, Saudi Aramco signed an $11 billion lease and leaseback deal involving its Jafurah gas processing facilities with a consortium of international investors, led by funds managed by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a part of BlackRock. Jafurah, the largest non-associated gas development in Saudi Arabia, is a key part of Aramco’s plans to increase gas production capacity by 60% between 2021 and 2030, to meet rising demand. Infrastructure deals have flourished in the Middle East in recent months. Last year, Bapco Energies of Bahrain sold to a BlackRock fund a minority ownership stake in the Saudi Bahrain Pipeline Company (SBPC). Kuwait’s state firm Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) is looking to raise up to $7 billion from leasing part of its pipeline network in a transaction that would be similar to Aramco’s deal, Bloomberg reported in September. The trend of global infrastructure funds buying into energy infrastructure started in the Middle East but is already expanding to Big Oil, as evidenced in the recent Shell and BP pipeline deals. Private equity money would be a win-win for the participants in transactions—the international majors will get capital outside of their traditional (and drying) public-markets base, while infrastructure funds will get long-term reliable returns on their investment.

Cheyenne, Wyoming-based Kraken said the transaction for the provider of services bridging equities to decentralized finance would "accelerate the global adoption of xStocks"—securities that already trade on markets made available on blockchains. Kraken this year has been working with Backed to offer tokenized stocks and ETFs to its clients using crypto networks like Ethereum and Solana. Tokenization refers to the process of taking real-world assets and representing them on-chain using digital assets. "Integrating Backed into Kraken strengthens the core architecture required for open and programmable capital markets," Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi said in a statement. "Unifying issuance, trading and settlement under one framework ensures the infrastructure for tokenized assets remains transparent, reliable and globally accessible. This is foundational work for the next era of market structure." Kraken would not reveal the size of the transaction to Decrypt. The company has made a number of acquisitions this year as it prepares for a public offering. In September, the exchange bought proprietary trading platform Breakout for an undisclosed amount, and earlier this year snapped up futures trading platform NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion. Sethi has previously said that "traditional markets run on post-WWII, 1950s banking systems," and the company was aiming to become an "institutional-grade trading platform where any asset can be traded, anytime." He added on Tuesday that the latest acquisition was "bigger than giving people exposure to U.S. equities, it's about redefining what it means to own assets in the digital era." Traditional finance firms' interest in tokenization has risen in recent years. BlackRock boss Larry Fink has frequently spoken about how it will change capital markets and now has a tokenized money-market fund. And Wall Street giant Franklin Templeton has been tokenizing assets on a number of blockchains for years.

Title: IBIT Among Most-Traded ETFs as Bitcoin Surges; Mining Stocks Sink

Bitcoin BTC$93.317,39 bounced back on Tuesday, gaining about 6% over the last 24 hours after a sharp sell-off to start the week. The rebound helped drive heavy activity in crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which was among the most-traded ETFs in the U.S. for the day. IBIT saw around $3.7 billion in trading volume Tuesday, surpassing the S&P 500 ETF from Vanguard (VOO), which recorded $3.28 billion, according to data from Barchart. That puts BlackRock’s bitcoin fund in rare company, alongside some of the most liquid and widely held ETFs in the market. The spike in volume may be tied to bitcoin’s price recovery, but it also came a day after Vanguard, which had long been resistant to crypto, said it would begin allowing bitcoin ETFs and crypto mutual funds to trade on its brokerage platform. BlackRock’s bitcoin funds have quickly become a cornerstone of the firm’s product lineup, despite launching less than two years ago. IBIT alone now holds $66.3 billion in net assets and has become the firm’s top revenue-generating ETF. That’s notable considering BlackRock manages over 1,400 ETFs and has $13.4 trillion in total assets under management. Cryptos across the board also traded higher on Tuesday, with ether ETH$3194,04, XRP and DOGE$0.1510 all gaining around 7% over the past 24 hours. Cardano’s native token, ADA, led the race with 14%. Chainlink’s token, LINK, was also 11% higher after Grayscale debuted a new ETF tied to the token on NYSE Arca on Tuesday. The bounce in bitcoin prices Tuesday rippled through crypto-related stocks. Shares of Strategy (MSTR), which holds more than 174,000 BTC on its balance sheet, rose 6%. Trading platform Robinhood (HOOD), which offers crypto services alongside stocks, gained 2%. Bullish (BLSH), the parent company of CoinDesk, climbed 5%, and Circle (CRLC), the firm behind the USDC stablecoin, added 4%. Coinbase (COIN) moved in the opposite direction. Its shares fell 5% after a group of shareholders filed a lawsuit Monday accusing company executives of engaging in a yearslong scheme to unload billions of dollars in stock while misleading investors. The suit claims insiders took advantage of inflated valuations following Coinbase’s 2021 public listing to cash out at the expense of long-term shareholders. The picture in bitcoin mining stocks looked less rosy. Despite the broader crypto market’s rebound, most miners traded in the red on Tuesday. Shares of Iren (IREN) led the declines with a 15% drop, followed by Cipher Mining (CIFR), which fell 10%, and TeraWulf (WULF), down 7%.

Title: The World’s Second Biggest Bank Recommends Up To 4% Bitcoin Allocation In Portfolios
URL: https://zycrypto.com/the-worlds-second-biggest-bank-recommends-up-to-4-bitcoin-allocation-in-portfolios/
Time Published: 2025-12-02T21:06:05Z

Bank of America, the second-largest bank in the world by market cap, has become the latest Wall Street titan to join the crypto rush. The bank says wealth clients should consider allocating up to 4% of their portfolios to crypto. Beginning Jan. 5, 2026, the bank’s wealth management advisors will be allowed to recommend a 1%-4% allocation to cryptocurrencies through the Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank, and Merrill Edge platforms, according to a report from Yahoo Finance. Bank of America’s chief investment office will also begin coverage of four Bitcoin ETFs — BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), Bitwise’s BITB, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC). “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, said in a statement. “The lower end of this range may be more appropriate for those with a conservative risk profile, while the higher end may suit investors with greater tolerance for overall portfolio risk,” Hyzy added. The development reverses Bank of America’s prior policy, which barred advisers from endorsing crypto unless a client explicitly requested access. That restriction effectively sidelined over 15,000 advisers during a period when institutional interest in regulated digital asset products was soaring. It comes a day after Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset management company, approved crypto ETF trading for its clients, marking a U-turn from its previous stance on digital asset ETFs. For many in the crypto industry, that major financial institutions such as Bank of America and Vanguard allow their clients to dabble in crypto is a sign of how far the nascent asset class has come since the days when certain banking execs labeled it a “fraud.” Notably, BlackRock was the first renowned Wall Street institution to advise interested investors to allocate as much as 2% of their portfolio to Bitcoin, the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency. Back in June, asset management firm Fidelity also backed a 2% to 5% Bitcoin allocation, which was small enough to minimize the risk of a BTC crash, but big enough to enjoy any upside from the asset’s inflationary hedge. Morgan Stanley then issued a 2%–4% recommendation for “opportunistic portfolios” in October.

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitocin treasury companies continue to accumulate a significant amount of BTC despite current market conditions and now control around 5% of the total BTC supply. These companies are led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Metaplanet, which have recently raised fresh capital to buy the dip. Bitcoin Treasuries data shows that the top 100 public Bitcoin treasury companies currently hold 1,058,929 BTC, while all public companies combined hold 1,061,697. Notably, Strategy is the largest public Bitcoin holder with 650,000 BTC. Michael Saylor’s company yesterday announced another 130 BTC purchase for $11.7 million. Meanwhile, the second-largest Bitcoin treasury company is BTC miner MARA holdings, which holds 53,250 BTC. Tether-backed Twenty One Capital, Metaplanet, and Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company complete the top 5, with 43,514, 30,823, and 30,021 BTC, respectively. Meanwhile, companies like Coinbase, Bullish, and Trump Media are among the top 10 largest BTC treasury companies. It is worth noting that these public companies account for only a part of the Bitcoin treasuries. Further data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that there is currently 4 million BTC in treasuries as a whole, including the coins held by governments, private companies, exchanges, DeFi platforms, and ETFs. BlackRock is currently the second-largest Bitcoin holder, only behind Satoshi Nakamoto. Strategy is third on the list, while Binance and the U.S. government complete the top 5, with BTC holdings of 628,868 and 323,588, respectively. The 4 million BTC held by these treasury companies as a group accounts for 19% of the total Bitcoin supply. Bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy and Metaplanet have raised new capital amid the recent crash to buy more BTC. Saylor’s company recently raised $836 million from its STRE offering, which it used to buy 8,178 BTC. Meanwhile, Metaplanet raised $130 million to expand its BTC treasury. More Bitcoin treasury companies are set to emerge as $10 trillion asset manager, Vanguard, will start offering BTC ETFs from today. Notably, some companies gain BTC exposure through these ETFs rather than buying Bitcoin directly. On-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan, holds $300 million worth of BlackRock’s BTC ETF. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin treasuries such as Strategy are coming under immense pressure amid the current market downtrend. Strategy’s CEO, Phong Le, admitted that they might have to sell Bitcoin as a last resort to fund dividend payments if their mNAV drops below 1x and they can no longer raise capital. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,000, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Starting next year, investment strategies at Bank of America’s Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank, and Merrill Edge platforms will support clients who want to allocate up to 4% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, the outlet reported. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” Chris Hyzy, Bank of America Private Bank’s chief investment officer, reportedly said in a statement. Hyzy reportedly described “the lower end of this range” as suitable for investors with a conservative risk profile, with 4% being appropriate for those with high risk tolerances. On Jan. 5, Bank of America’s wealth management clients will also initiate coverage of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds from Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, and BlackRock, according to Yahoo Finance. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a Decrypt request for comment. Yahoo Finance reported that, historically, Bank of America’s wealth management clients were only able to access crypto-related products upon request. Previously, that left over 15,000 wealth advisors at the firm unable to make crypto-related recommendations. The shift comes as Bitcoin’s price jumped to near $91,600 at one point Tuesday. BTC was currently up 7.6% over the past 24 hours, although the largest cryptocurrency by market value is off about 30% since hitting a record high above $126,000 in early October, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest investment companies, will soon begin letting people on its platform access crypto-focused ETFs and mutual funds, Bloomberg reported on Monday. A Bitcoin-friendly CEO was appointed to the world’s second-largest asset manager in May. Last year, Fidelity suggested that people allocate between 2% and 5% to Bitcoin, with up to 7.5% being worth for young investors. Describing the asset as “unique,” the institution has explored allocations in hypothetical scenarios as early as 2020.

A FORMER SCHOOL teacher will be sentenced next week for the indecent assault of eight boys over 30 years ago at a private Dublin school. Peter Kelly (73) of Booterstown Park, Booterstown was convicted by a Dublin Circuit Criminal Court jury following a two week trial in November. He pleaded not guilty to 28 counts of indecently assaulting the boys at Willow Park School, Rock Road, Blackrock, Dublin on dates in the 70s and 80s. The school is run by the Spiritan order of priests Kelly was convicted on all charges. The eight victims are now all aged in their early 50s. Judge Elma Sheahan heard the victim impact statements of each of the men that had been abused by Kelly. Some of the men took the stand to read their own statements while Inspector Rachael Kilpatrick read others into the record. The men spoke of the various ways Kelly’s actions impacted their life, speaking of addictions, inabilities to deal with relationships, inabilities to express their emotions and inabilities to reach their full potential in adult life. Some of the men have spent time in psychiatric hospitals, others have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), many of them are on medication for anxiety and depression. The men spoke of the loss of their education and suffering from insomnia, night terrors and panic attacks. One victim spoke of an occasion as a child when he deliberately crashed his bike on the way to school. He was later treated in hospital because he had pretended he had injured his leg. He said in his victim impact statement that he did this so he could get out of school for some time and be away from Kelly. Many of the victims spoke of how their life could have been so different had they not been abused by Kelly and how as young children they never stood a chance against him. One of the victims spoke about how Kelly was “one cog in a machine of systematic abuse”. He said the school “tolerated widespread sexual abuse” and how “37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools” between both Willow Park and its feeder school Blackrock College. He said as children they had “no chance”. One of the victims told Kelly that he hopes he is made “confront the harm you have done”. This man also stated in his victim impact statement that he hopes “the court understands how you have not only violated the law but the life of a child and everything that he might have become”. Advertisement Another victim said he was “already vulnerable, already broken” when Kelly abused him as he had been the victim of “multiple sexual crimes committed by Kelly’s colleagues”. He said he was not abused “because I was chosen or groomed but because I was there in his classroom completely unable to protect myself”. “He used his position, he took advantage of my vulnerability and added to my pain,” the man continued. Kilpatrick outlined the incidences of abuse committed on each of the boys, who were mostly aged between 11 and 13 years old at the time. She said most of the abuse occurred in the classroom when Kelly would hold the child on his lap and molest them under the guise of tickling them. The victims said he would restrain them on his lap and bounce them up and down. He also played a game called ‘The Muppet Show’ during which he would take the child under the cloak he wore as a school teacher and again tickle them and then molest them. One of the victims was abused in the school’s rugby changing room. He described being laid across Kelly’s lap before he was abused. Others were abused in the school gym. Andrew Sexton SC, defending, told the judge that “there is not an acceptance of the verdict” before he added that Kelly never owned a passport. He said Kelly’s “entire life centred around the school and his home”, with his home being right beside the school. Counsel said the school implemented its own disciplinary regime following an initial complaint in the early 2000s, which was followed by a series of suspensions and which ultimately led to the end of Kelly’s career at the school with Kelly resigning his post in 2004. The Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to prosecute the allegations that had been made in the early 2000s. “He suffered the cessation of his life as a teacher and it was not replaced by anything else,” Sexton told the court. The judge said it was “very important to acknowledge that it had been a very difficult morning” for the six victims who were present in court. She pointed out that due to the law that existed at the time of Kelly’s offending the maximum penalty available to the court in most of the charges was ten years, while two of the offences allowed a penalty of up to two years in prison. The judge revoked Kelly’s bail and remanded him in custody pending sentence next Monday 8 December. She said he was to be given the medical attention he required having been informed that he has a number of medical conditions. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Who will be the next Fed chair?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Kevin Hassett appears to be Trump’s pick President Donald Trump says he has chosen the next chair of the Federal Reserve, but he is not yet naming names publicly. Current National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett is widely expected to be the nominee, said Axios. Trump is not saying. “I’m not telling you, we’ll be announcing it,” he said to reporters. The next chair will replace Jerome Powell, who has “faced months of complaints and demands” from Trump to bring interest rates down more quickly, said Axios. Powell’s term does not end until May, so he may have to spend the final months of his term with a “shadow chair” peering over his shoulder, said Fortune. Trump officials have signaled their desire to undercut Powell even if he remains in his position. With a shadow chair in place, “no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to Barron’s last year. The question for Wall Street, then, is “will Powell or his successor hold more sway with the markets?” said Fortune. Escape your echo chamber.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. The likely choice of Hassett “appears to be about loyalty” to Trump, said John Authers at Bloomberg. Other possible nominees — including Bessent, as well as current Fed governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder — might feel compelled to “establish themselves as independent from the administration.” But being seen as a Trump loyalist could also force Hassett to prove his independence to “win the confidence of markets.” For now, though, “markets aren’t freaking out at the prospect of a Hassett chairmanship.” “Thank heavens” for Powell, said Brett Arends at MarketWatch. The latest numbers suggest the U.S. economy is “much stronger than people realized” even with the Fed chairman resisting Trump’s demanded rate cuts. If the president had gotten his way, the “likeliest scenario would be that inflation would be rocketing higher again.” Instead, the Federal Reserve has cut rates just twice this year and indicated another rate cut is unlikely in December. Americans should be grateful the current Fed chair has proven his independence and “refused to be intimidated” by Trump. Hassett would have “closer ties to the sitting president” than any modern Fed chair, said Axios. That might mean a quick drop in short-term rates, but long-term rates may stay high if Wall Street comes to believe he is “simply doing Trump’s bidding, with little regard for inflation.” That notion “might be difficult for a pick like Hassett to shake.” The next chair will face an unusually divided Fed board, said The Wall Street Journal. Fed chairs have ordinarily sought the “broadest possible consensus around rate decisions” and split votes have been rare. No longer. There is a “real prospect of three or more dissenting votes” at December’s meeting, whether Powell decides to pause rate cuts or continue them. “It’s not a slam dunk” that Trump’s choice will dictate policy as much as his predecessors, said Krishna Guha, a former New York Fed executive.

Title: Bank of America says clients can allocate up to 4% to crypto

Bank of America’s new guidance lets advisers actively recommend Bitcoin ETFs, signaling rising institutional confidence despite the market pullback. Bank of America has officially opened the door for its wealth management clients to include crypto in their portfolios. They are recommending a 1%–4% allocation through regulated Bitcoin ETFs beginning 5 January 5. However, beyond the headline, what stands out is the timing of this shift — it arrives during a broad market pullback, not at a cycle peak. The global crypto market cap currently sits at $3.09 trillion, according to new data (from CoinMarketCap. That’s down sharply from $3.71T last month, yet still well above the $2.42T yearly low. Source: CoinMarketCap This paints a very different backdrop from the euphoric rallies that typically precede new institutional endorsements. Instead, BofA’s guidance lands during a corrective phase, suggesting the bank views crypto as a long-term asset class rather than short-term speculation. According to reports, beginning 5 January, Bank of America’s CIO office will formally cover and recommend four spot Bitcoin ETFs: This is the first time advisors on Merrill, Private Bank, and Merrill Edge can proactively recommend crypto exposure — a major shift from the previous “request-only” framework that kept many clients from accessing the asset class. CIO Chris Hyzy framed the allocation as appropriate for investors “with interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility,” emphasizing regulated products and risk-aligned sizing [1–4%]. Crypto’s market cap has cooled from its late-summer highs, mirroring Bitcoin’s fall from above $126,000 to the mid-$80,000 range. Yet institutions are increasing, not decreasing, their engagement: The trend shows that Wall Street wants regulated crypto exposure integrated into traditional portfolios, even during downturns. This suggests a growing institutional consensus that crypto markets have matured sufficiently to withstand — and potentially benefit from — cyclical volatility. By allowing crypto allocations at a moment when the total market cap has dipped nearly $600 billion in a month, Bank of America is signaling: It’s a different kind of institutional endorsement — one that doesn’t chase hype but leans into market structure, regulation, and portfolio construction.

December 2, 2025 (Bloomberg) -- Wealthfront Corp. and some of its shareholders are seeking to raise $485 million as the robo-advisory firm seeks to go public.

Title: Former teacher Kelly was 'one cog in machine of abuse'

Órla O\u0027Donnell Legal Affairs Correspondent A former maths teacher at a private primary school run by the Spiritan order of priests in South Dublin will be sentenced next week for indecently assaulting eight young boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Peter Kelly who is 73 and was a maths teacher at Willow Park school in Blackrock for almost thirty years, was found guilty by a jury earlier this year of 28 counts of indecent assault. One victim told the court, Kelly was "one cog in a machine of systematic abuse" at Willow Park, and secondary school, Blackrock College. Peter Kelly began teaching at Willow Park Primary school in 1977. He resigned in 2004 after an investigation following a complaint made in 2001. The DPP decided not to prosecute him at that stage. Earlier this year however, he went on trial at the Circuit Criminal Court, charged with 28 counts of indecent assault against eight boys. All the boys were aged between around 10 and 13 years old when the assaults took place. Some of the offences took place in the classroom, some in changing rooms. Kelly denied the charges but was found guilty by a jury last month. The court heard he doesn't accept the jury's verdicts. Many of the boys gave evidence that Kelly wore a black gown and would put boys under his gown and cuddle and fondle them - something he referred to as "the Muppet show". He would also tickle boys, calling it "death by tickles", slap them, bounce them on his crotch and touch their genital areas or make them touch his. The boys also gave evidence of physical punishment, although this did not form part of the charges against Kelly. However the prosecution case was that he used physical and sexual violence to demean the boys in his class. The boys are now men in their fifties and the court heard emotional and moving victim impact statements from all eight of them. Some of the men read their own statements, some were read by investigating garda inspector Rachel Kilpatrick. Most of the men described suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. Some had struggled with addiction and lived with self doubt, fear, depression and anxiety. The first man to give his victim impact statement told the court he had been a normal child who enjoyed life to the full and had lots of friends. He said he had loved sports and loved playing marbles and he remembered laughing with friends and laughing with his mother. But he said all that disappeared the moment Kelly touched him for the first time. The man said Kelly eroded his normal life into doubt and fear. He said his whole life became insufferable. He said he knew it was wrong and knew he didn't want Kelly near him, but he couldn't get away from him. The man described turning in on himself, he said he was terrified and Kelly made it impossible to be normal. He learned how to exist rather than how to live. From the moment he opened his eyes in the morning until he went to sleep at night, he said he was constantly wondering what he could do make sure Kelly wouldn't notice him so he wouldn't touch him. Although he tried to be good, silent and quiet and do his homework, he said Kelly always got him in the end. On one occasion, he described faking a serious accident so he wouldn't have to go to school and his relief when he was taken to hospital. The man described the damage done to him as irreparable and said his life would have been completely different if the abuse hadn't happened. He gave up sports and dropped out of school early. He said he was floored when he found out others had been abused but he always felt it couldn't just have been him. The man told the court he had always hated himself for letting Kelly beat him mentally but only now could he see that he never stood a chance at 11 years old. Another man described the severe impact the abuse had had on his physical and mental health. He said his health had deteriorated and his ability to work had been affected. He too had been diagnosed with PTSD and he said his symptoms had placed a tremendous strain on his family and on his marriage. This man told the prosecuting counsel, John Griffin, that Kelly had worked in an institution which "tolerated widespread physical and mental abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College". He said 37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools and Kelly was just "one cog in a machine of systematic abuse". "We as children, had no chance," he said. A third victim of Kelly's abuse told the court he had already been broken by abuse carried out against him by another teacher, Edward Baylor, who has since died. He said Kelly, instead of supporting him as a vulnerable person, took advantage of his vulnerability and added to his pain. He said Kelly's abuse reinforced his shame and intensified his sense that there was no escape. This man told the court he had lived with pain and damage ever since, and the loss of what his life should have been. He said he was desperate to be invisible at school, his grades plummeted and his future changed course. He left Ireland as a young man, he told the court, and now feels he needs to leave again as it is too painful to stay here. This man broke down as he told the court he felt useless and that he was "never getting out of this". He said it had taken him years to be able to speak about it and that he was "so very, very tired". He told Kelly he hoped he was being made to confront what he had done. Other victims also wrote of feeling terrified of Kelly and of suffering from depression and anxiety later in life. Defence counsel, Andrew Sexton told the court Kelly's entire life had centred around Willow Park and Blackrock College until he resigned in 2004. He said he had medical and physical issues of significance and his health was deteriorating. He has no other convictions. Judge Elma Sheahan said it had been a very difficult morning for victims and she needed time to consider all she had heard. She said she would sentence Kelly next week and remanded him in custody in the meantime. Legal Affairs Correspondent Follow@Orlaodo © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Former Willow Park primary school teacher to be sentenced over abuse of eight boys

A former teacher at Willow Park primary school in south Dublin will be sentenced next week for the indecent assault of eight boys more than 30 years ago. The school, located on the grounds of Blackrock College, was run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, now the Spiritans. One survivor of the abuse inflicted by Peter Kelly told Dublin Circuit Criminal Court that his former teacher had worked for an institution “that tolerated widespread sexual abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College”. “Thirty-seven abusers were identified in this, he was a mere cog in a machine of systematic abuse. We as children had no chance.” Kelly (73), who grew up in Booterstown and taught maths at the school from 1977 until 2004, had pleaded not guilty to 28 counts of indecently assaulting eight boys in the 1970s and the 1980s at Willow Park primary school. He was convicted last month of all 28 counts after a trial before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court. The jury returned majority verdicts, following more than seven hours of deliberation. The matter was adjourned for a sentencing hearing before Judge Elma Sheahan, who on Tuesday heard victim impact statements from all eight complainants who were aged between 10 and 13 at the time of the offences. Having also heard submissions on behalf of barrister John Griffin, for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), and Andrew Sexton SC, Kelly’s barrister, the judge said she had a lot to consider and would pass sentence on December 8th. Because of different legislation applying in different years to the offences, the maximum penalties are two years in some cases and 10 years in others. In mitigation submissions, Mr Sexton said his client has spent his entire life around his home in Booterstown and the school, and prison would be difficult for a man of his age. There was no acceptance by Kelly of the jury’s verdict, counsel also said. A complaint against Kelly was made in 2001 and a decision was made by the DPP not to prosecute, counsel also said. Six complainants were in court to read their statements while statements from the remaining two were read by Insp Rachel Kilpatrick, who was involved from 2021 in a large scale Garda investigation into allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College and Willow Park primary school. Insp Kilpatrick said Kelly had made no admissions during two interviews with gardaí before his being charged with the offences. A number of complainants referred to Kelly engaging in what was known as the “Muppet Show” in the classroom, in which he would take a boy under his black cloak and, under the guise of tickling them, would run his hands up and down their torsos and buttocks. Kelly had also pulled some complainants on to his lap and bounced them aggressively up and down in front of the class while pushing his body against their backs. The judge was also told Kelly had brought some boys to stand in front of the class, stood behind them and took hold of their hands and moved their hands up and down all over their bodies while standing close behind them and pushing his body into theirs. One complainant described this as akin to “a humiliation ritual”. Many of the offences took place in the classroom but one complainant was assaulted on four occasions by Kelly in a rugby changing room, including being held face down across Kelly’s knee while the teacher slapped his bottom and pushed him up towards his penis. Another complainant was assaulted where gym equipment was stored, involving being made bend over a gym horse and having his buttocks rubbed and slapped. One complainant had alleged, during an occasion when he was held back at school by Kelly, the teacher had put his hands inside his underpants and digitally penetrated his anus. All eight statements outlined serious adverse impacts of the abuse by Kelly. Some suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and some spoke of experiencing suicidal ideation. One complainant said he always had a sense of “danger and dread” around Kelly. Not only had the teacher abused him, he “controlled me mentally”, the man said. As a result of Kelly’s abuse, he hated everything to do with school, stopped all sports and gave up his goals, he said. In adult life, he could never face situations without severe anger, trauma and anxiety, he said. It was only after he underwent counselling that he saw he never had a chance. Another complainant said that, as a result of Kelly’s abuse, he did not like it when his father hugged him after he did well at school or sports. He had never had any counselling but intended to when the criminal process was over, the man said. A third complainant said he spent long periods in psychiatric hospitals due to the abuse and was diagnosed with PTSD. His personal and professional life were very seriously affected, he said. Another man said he suffered depression, social anxiety and PTSD, as well as trust issues. Only when he began therapy in his 40s had his situation started to improve, he said. Another said he became a “hollow shell of a human” and was unable to cry as a child and into later life, either for himself or others. He had used alcohol and drugs for a long time in an effort to stop negative thoughts. Insomnia and addiction issues were cited by another survivor who said he contacted gardaí after seeing RTÉ’s Late Late Show address issues about abuse in schools run by the Spiritans. Another survivor said, when Kelly abused him, he was already vulnerable and broken as a result of “multiple sexual crimes” by another person. He continues to experience serious difficulties daily as a result of the abuse, he said. Another survivor said he became withdrawn and “dark and brooding” following the abuse and did not speak out because he felt there was an air of “don’t speak, don’t tell”. The “sense of being alone” might sum it up best, he said.

Title: Meesho Faces Investor Protest Over Anchor Allotment To SBI Funds

Meesho Ltd.’s anchor book faced a setback after several major investors pulled out when the Indian e-commerce firm was said to have allocated about a quarter of the shares in this tranche to SBI Funds Management Pvt., the country’s largest asset manager, according to people familiar with the matter. That decision triggered a pushback from other large funds, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Meesho is set to open its anchor book — a portion of shares reserved for institutional investors — on Tuesday ahead of its initial public offering that launches on Wednesday. Among those who withdrew were Capital Group, Aberdeen Group Plc, Norges Bank Investment Management, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co., Nippon India Life Asset Management Ltd. and Nomura Asset Management, the people said. Many had sought allocations on par with those of SBI Funds and opted out in what was viewed as a protest, they added. Even so, Meesho’s anchor lineup features several global investors, including sovereign wealth funds such as GIC Pte and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, alongside major long-only investors like Fidelity International, BlackRock Inc., Baillie Gifford, as well as global firms like WCM Investment Management and Dragoneer Investment Group LLC, the people said. To be sure, the anchor allotment process is still ongoing, and the final investor lineup may change. The episode underscores the intense demand for India’s tech startups as they move toward public listings. Recent IPOs from digital platforms including Urban Co. and Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd. — the parent of discount broker Groww — have drawn heavy demand, reflecting consumers’ rapid shift toward online services and commerce. Representatives for Capital Group and Aberdeen declined to comment. Spokespersons at Meesho, SBI Funds and the other investors didn’t respond to requests for comment. The Bengaluru-based marketplace, which links small manufacturers with price-sensitive consumers in smaller Indian cities, aims to raise as much as 54.2 billion rupees ($603 million). The shares are priced in a range of 105 rupees to 111 rupees apiece, according to a newspaper advertisement published Friday. Existing shareholders, including Elevation Capital V Ltd., Peak XV Partners Investments V and Meesho’s founders will sell shares in the offering.

Title: Bank of America Greenlights Wealth Advisers to Recommend Up to 4% Bitcoin Allocation

Bank of America, one of the U.S.’s largest financial institutions, has become the latest Wall Street giant to warm up to bitcoin BTC$93,317.39. Beginning in January, the bank's wealth management advisers will be allowed to recommend a 1%-4% allocation to crypto assets, according to Yahoo Finance. Initially, the BofA/Merrill Lynch thundering herd will focus on four spot bitcoin ETFs — BlackRock's IBIT, Fidelity's FBTC, Bitwise's BITB and Grayscale's BTC. It's a major change for the bank, which previously allowed its clientele to invest as they wish, but did not allow its advisors to recommend crypto exposure. The news comes just hours after asset management titan Vanguard reversed its long-standing policy and will now allow its clients access to crypto ETFs. The move also brings BofA in line with the wealth management platforms of other major institutions like BlackRock and Morgan Stanley. The action also likely ups the pressure on the dwindling number of holdouts, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and UBS among them. "For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate," Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, said in a statement. "The lower end of this range may be more appropriate for those with a conservative risk profile, while the higher end may suit investors with greater tolerance for overall portfolio risk," Hyzy added.

Business CEO of Dell Technologies Michael Dell participates an Invest America Roundtable in the State Dining room, at the White House, in Washington, U.S., June 9, 2025. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein WASHINGTON, Dec 2 : Entrepreneur Michael Dell and his wife, Susan, will deposit $250 in the individual investment accounts of 25 million American children in a $6.25 billion philanthropic pledge as part of the Trump administration's Invest America initiative. The initiative, known as "Trump accounts", was created this year under President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and has sparked a scramble by financial firms looking to participate. The U.S. Treasury will deposit $1,000 into investment accounts for all children born between 2025 and 2028. The Invest America accounts are expected to open on July 4 next year, but details about how they will work are still unknown. The funds - required to be invested in an index fund that mirrors the performance of the broader stock market - become available at the age of 18 for education, job training, a first home or starting a business. "We believe the smartest investment that we can make is an investment in children," Michael Dell said at a White House event announcing the donation.

Title: Cardano’s Hoskinson Reveals the Way Forward for Crypto Market, Shares Optimistic Expectations

Time Published: 2025-12-02T13:34:24Z

Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson believes the current crypto market downturn is unlikely to persist, arguing that the market has shifted far beyond the retail-driven cycles of previous years. Speaking in a recent interview, Hoskinson noted that the arrival of major financial institutions and the U.S. government has fundamentally changed the market’s structure and its long-term trajectory. Responding to a question about whether a more crypto-friendly U.S. administration could soften the impact of the current drawdown, Hoskinson said this cycle stands apart from earlier ones. “The last three times it was retail-led,” he explained. “But this time around, you have BlackRock and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and the U.S. government, all others coming in.” The Cardano co-founder added that a growing portion of crypto now represents real-world assets, pointing to the rapid expansion of stablecoins, which have surpassed $250 billion in issuance and could exceed $1 trillion by 2030. Hoskinson also highlighted projections that between $10 trillion worth of equities and other traditional assets could move on-chain by the mid-2030s. Combined with a potential rise in global crypto users from 550 million today to nearly one billion, the sector’s foundation is stronger than short-term sentiment suggests. “There’s no way for these markets to stay depressed forever,” Hoskinson said, framing current prices as a reflection of macro uncertainty rather than deteriorating fundamentals. That uncertainty is visible on market dashboards. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index recently plunged to 6, one of its lowest readings ever. Meanwhile, analysts noted that short-term profit-and-loss metrics have fallen even more sharply than during the COVID-19 and FTX crashes. Nevertheless, some analysts are calling the downturn an opportunity, urging traders to “buy the dip.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum are flashing mixed signals. Bitcoin wavers between institutional outflows, renewed whale accumulation, and questions surrounding its upcoming quantum-resistant upgrade. Ethereum faces regulatory delays, proposed staking reward cuts, and persistent whale buying even as retail holders exit. At the time of writing, the crypto market stands at a total valuation of $2.96 trillion.

Title: Bank of America backs 1–4% crypto allocation, opens gates to Bitcoin ETFs

Bank of America’s wealthiest clients will gain access to Bitcoin ETFs, while its network of over 15,000 wealth advisers can recommend crypto exposure for the first time, Yahoo reported. More big-name financial institutions are opening the door to Bitcoin exposure, signaling a growing institutional appetite for regulated digital asset products. Bank of America, the second-largest US bank, reportedly recommended a 1%–4% cryptocurrency allocation to its wealth management clients through the Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank and Merrill Edge platforms, according to a statement shared with Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” said Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, in the statement shared with Yahoo. Starting Jan. 5, the bank will enable its clients to gain access to four new Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The development will enable the bank’s wealthiest clients to gain exposure to Bitcoin ETFs, which were previously only available upon request. The bank’s over 15,000 wealth advisers were unable to recommend any cryptocurrency investment products. “Our guidance emphasizes regulated vehicles, thoughtful allocation, and a clear understanding of both the opportunities and risks,” added the bank’s chief investment officer. The bank’s Bitcoin allocation recommendation is signaling a wider institutional appetite for regulated cryptocurrency investment products. It comes a day after Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, enabled crypto ETF trading for its clients, reversing its previous stance on digital asset ETFs. Cointelegraph has contacted Bank of America for more details on its crypto allocation recommendations. Bank of America is the second-largest bank in the US with about $2.67 trillion in consolidated assets and over 3,600 branches, according to Forbes. Related: Bitcoin to end four-year cycle, break out to new highs in 2026: Grayscale BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, was the first big institution to recommend an up to 2% Bitcoin allocation to its clients, Cointelegraph reported in December 2024. Around 1%–2% is a “reasonable range for Bitcoin exposure,” which poses the “same share of overall portfolio risk” as a typical allocation to “the ‘magnificent 7’ group of mostly mega-cap tech stocks,” wrote BlackRock in a report at the time. The “magnificent 7” refers to Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia.

Earlier in October, Morgan Stanley also suggested a 2% to 4% allocation to crypto portfolios for investors and financial advisers, further signaling that large financial institutions are moving toward a shared playbook of modest, risk-managed exposure to digital assets.

Title: Vanguard caves on crypto to retain clients as rivals win flows — opens $9.3T platform to crypto ETFs

With $9.3 trillion under management, Vanguard’s entry into crypto ETFs could usher tens of billions in new demand despite modest initial allocations. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. On Dec. 2, Vanguard will reportedly open its massive brokerage platform to spot Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This strategic volte-face ends the asset manager’s steadfast isolation from the $3 trillion digital asset market. For years, Vanguard stood as the most prominent holdout of the crypto space, driven by a philosophy that viewed the high volatility of digital assets as fundamentally incompatible with the principles of long-term, diversified portfolio construction. This reversal, therefore, represents one of the most significant capitulations in the traditional finance sector’s gradual embrace of the crypto economy. Crucially, Vanguard said it is not deviating from its core manufacturing philosophy. So, it would not be launching its own proprietary crypto funds. Instead, it will serve as a critical gateway, allowing its conservative client base to access regulated products managed by rival issuers such as BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, and Bitwise Asset Management. Speaking on the broader significance of the move, Hunter Horsley, Bitwise CEO, noted the stark contrast between the magnitude of the policy shift and the market’s muted reaction, a sign of the asset class’s maturity. He noted: “The 2nd largest brokerage in America flips its policy from sell-only to allowing crypto ETF purchases. And no one is fired up. Whether people are stoked right now or not — crypto is rapidly entering the mainstream.” The firm’s restrictions on crypto ETFs had remained firmly in place even after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot Bitcoin funds in early 2024 and the first Ethereum products later that year. Notably, Vanguard’s internal client guidelines and platform eligibility rules kept those ETFs from its self-directed brokerage system, citing regulatory ambiguity and investor protection concerns. However, the calculus changed following a sweeping shift in the regulatory environment under the current US administration. The SEC’s pivot toward a pro-innovation stance, combined with years of court decisions, effectively evaporated the regulatory uncertainty that Vanguard had long cited as a barrier. Indeed, the approvals of spot crypto ETFs were underpinned by robust frameworks that establish how surveillance-sharing agreements, custody arrangements, and disclosure standards apply to digital assets. These frameworks, first battle-tested with Bitcoin ETFs, became the template for subsequent products, significantly reducing the operational risk for brokers offering access through retail platforms. Furthermore, the move is an acknowledgment of irrefutable market realities. A recent study found that 35% of younger, wealthy Americans have left their financial advisors because they do not allow access to crypto. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become one of the fastest-growing ETFs in US history, demonstrating that demand for crypto exposure had decisively shifted from niche trading platforms to mainstream asset managers. Today, spot Bitcoin funds manage approximately $120 billion in assets across issuers, while Ethereum ETFs collectively hold nearly $20 billion. At the same time, newer products tracking Solana and XRP are succeeding, thanks to strong market demand. Beyond regulation, the absence of crypto access had become a burgeoning competitive liability for Vanguard. Notably, many clients already held crypto ETFs in accounts outside Vanguard while maintaining traditional holdings on the platform. This bifurcation forced advisors to route trades through separate institutions, complicating processes such as tax-loss harvesting and model portfolio management. So, this decision acknowledges that clients seeking exposure through regulated ETFs should be able to execute those trades within their primary Vanguard accounts rather than migrating capital to outside brokers. Andrew Kadjeski, head of brokerage and investments at Vanguard, reportedly said: “Cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity. The administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured, and investor preferences continue to evolve.” The direct impact on ETF flows will depend on how Vanguard’s unique client base responds. Vanguard manages more than $9.3 trillion in assets, but the addressable market for these products is narrower because only self-directed brokerage and IRA accounts are authorized to trade them. Institutional mandates, defined benefit plans, and other pooled vehicles generally remain restricted from such allocations. Moreover, Vanguard clients exhibit behavior distinct from the active traders who drove early crypto ETF inflows. This demographic favors passive, long-dated index products over thematic or tactical funds. As a result, initial allocations are expected to be modest. Still, a penetration rate of roughly 0.1% to 0.2% of eligible brokerage assets would imply early flows in the low-single-digit billions, spread across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP funds. Meanwhile, the significance of Vanguard’s entry lies not in the velocity of the flows, but in the stickiness of the capital. Unlike the “mercenary capital” of hedge funds or the reactive flows of retail day traders, Vanguard inflows tend to be price-agnostic and permanent. So, in a standard “60/40/1” portfolio—allocated to equities, bonds, and crypto respectively—automated systems maintain target weightings by selling outperforming assets and buying underperforming ones. If the price of Bitcoin or Solana drops, the portfolio algorithmically buys more to restore the 1% weighting. This creates a structural “buy the dip” mechanism that could dampen volatility and raise floor prices over a full market cycle. Moreover, broader distribution typically improves liquidity. The influx of Vanguard’s diversified volume is expected to narrow bid-ask spreads and reduce execution costs for all investors, further tightening the efficiency of ETF arbitrage mechanisms and the responsiveness of pricing to underlying market movements. As a result, even a conservative adoption curve could have outsized impacts. So, if only a fraction of Vanguard’s client base allocates a standard 1% to 2% “satellite” position to crypto ETFs, it represents tens of billions of dollars in net new demand.

Title: 11 Trillion Asset Management Giant Vanguard To Allow Bitcoin, Ether, And XRP ETF Trading In Stunning About-Turn

Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, is set to allow its clients to start trading crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds on its platform, abandoning its previous anti-crypto stance that had kept digital-asset offerings off its shelves for years. Starting Tuesday, Vanguard will allow trading in funds that hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple’s XRP, and Solana (SOL), similar to how the firm treats gold, according to a Monday report from Bloomberg. “Cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” Andrew Kadjeski, Vanguard’s head of brokerage and investments, told Bloomberg. “The administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured; and investor preferences continue to evolve.” Notably, funds linked to memecoins or those not supported by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will remain barred. Moreover, Vanguard has no immediate plans to create its own crypto products. The pivot provides more than 50 million Vanguard brokerage customers with access to regulated crypto funds, including those from rival asset manager BlackRock. Nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs that launched early last year attracted impressive inflows, pushing their combined assets to nearly $120 billion, while ETH products grew to around $20 billion, per SoSoValue data. Still, Vanguard astutely indicated that it would steer clear of such crypto-related investment products, citing volatility and the speculative nature of assets. As recently as August 2024, iShares veteran and current CEO Salim Ramji had ruled out any plans to offer crypto ETFs. According to Bloomberg, the Wall Street behemoth’s decision to embrace crypto assets is a response to strong demand from retail and institutional clients despite a sharp market pullback. Some crypto commentators believe Vanguard’s change of heart could lead to a deluge of crypto ETF customers and act as a catalyst for crypto prices. Vanguard is second only to BlackRock as an asset manager, with roughly $11 trillion in global assets under management. Crypto strategist Nilesh Rohilla noted on X that he would be shocked if the BTC price doesn’t “jump 5% in this news in the next 24 hrs.” Vivek Sen, the founder of Bitcoin public relations company Bitgrow Lab, also forecasted that there are “trillions incoming.” Meanwhile, X user BankXRP observed: “This is another massive signal that traditional finance is fully stepping into digital assets. The wall of money is lining up.”

Title: Bank of America Backs 4% Crypto Allocation as Retail Takes Losses
URL: https://beincrypto.com/bank-of-america-crypto-allocatio/
Time Published: 2025-12-02T12:57:33Z

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Bank of America (BofA) has officially endorsed a 1%–4% allocation to crypto for its wealth management clients, marking a landmark shift in how Wall Street approaches digital assets. However, the move arrives at a challenging time for retail investors, who now hold the majority of Bitcoin ETF supply and are absorbing significant market losses. Yahoo Finance reported on Tuesday that Bank of America will begin CIO coverage of four Bitcoin ETFs, including BITB, FBTC, Grayscale Mini Trust, and IBIT, starting January 5, 2026. It would enable more than 15,000 advisers across Merrill, the Private Bank, and Merrill Edge to recommend regulated crypto products for the first time proactively. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” said Chris Hyzy, CIO of Bank of America Private Bank. He added that guidance emphasizes “regulated vehicles, thoughtful allocation, and a clear understanding of both the opportunities and risks.” Previously, clients could access crypto ETFs only by request, a barrier that left many retail investors searching for exposure elsewhere. The update “reflects growing client demand for access to digital assets,” said Nancy Fahmy, head of BofA’s investment solutions group. BofA’s guidance follows a broader institutional shift: These changes align with a sweeping policy reversal under the Trump administration, which dismantled several constraints imposed by the Biden administration on banks engaging with digital assets. Many firms now await Congressional clarity on custody, direct trading, and broader on-platform crypto services. The timing of Wall Street’s adoption is striking. Bitcoin has dropped nearly 33% from its $126,000 peak, and is down about 10% YTD, even as the S&P 500 climbs 15%. According to Bernstein, retail investors hold approximately 75% of spot Bitcoin ETF assets, making them the most exposed to price volatility. Meanwhile, institutional ownership has increased from 20% to 28%, reflecting a strategic rotation into Bitcoin and Ethereum as retail investors capitulate. The recent wave of altcoin-heavy ETFs has fared even worse: Against this backdrop, concerns linger about how the prospective LINK ETF could fare. “This appears to be a combination of retail traders getting burned and issuers mistiming their entry,” Bloomberg reported, citing Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, warning that ETF wrappers can give smaller investors “a false sense of security.” BofA’s move signals that the institutional era of crypto is accelerating, bringing regulated exposure to millions of mainstream clients. However, with retail still absorbing the sharpest losses and ownership quickly shifting toward ETF-based holders, market volatility may remain elevated. The next catalyst is likely to come from Washington, where pending legislation could determine how deeply banks can integrate cryptocurrency into their core services.

Share this article Bank of America, one of the nation’s largest financial institutions, has advised its wealth management clients to consider allocating 1% to 4% of their portfolios to digital assets through regulated investment vehicles, Yahoo Finance reported on Tuesday. The bank’s investment strategists will begin providing research coverage on four Bitcoin ETFs in January, allowing its 15,000 advisers to formally recommend them. The covered funds include products from Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, and BlackRock. The recommendation is consistent with the ongoing adoption of digital assets within traditional finance. Major financial institutions have increasingly embraced crypto assets as portfolio components. Banks are adjusting their wealth management strategies to include digital assets as potential thematic investments, moving beyond previous skepticism. Bitcoin has gained acceptance among institutional players as a hedge against economic uncertainties. The digital asset is viewed as both a store of value and a medium of exchange within decentralized financial systems. Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee is recommending 2%–4% crypto allocations for suitable clients, calling Bitcoin “digital gold” and viewing crypto as a speculative but maturing asset class. The guidance favors ETF-based exposure with regular rebalancing. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account? Sign In Forgot your password?

Title: Meesho faces investor protest over anchor allotment to SBI Funds

(Bloomberg) -- Meesho Ltd.’s anchor book faced a setback after several major investors pulled out when the Indian e-commerce firm was said to have allocated about a quarter of the shares in this tranche to SBI Funds Management Pvt., the country’s largest asset manager, according to people familiar with the matter. That decision triggered a pushback from other large funds, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Meesho is set to open its anchor book — a portion of shares reserved for institutional investors — on Tuesday ahead of its initial public offering that launches on Wednesday. Among those who withdrew were Capital Group, Aberdeen Group Plc, Norges Bank Investment Management, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co., Nippon India Life Asset Management Ltd. and Nomura Asset Management, the people said. Many had sought allocations on par with those of SBI Funds and opted out in what was viewed as a protest, they added. Even so, Meesho’s anchor lineup features several global investors, including sovereign wealth funds such as GIC Pte and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, alongside major long-only investors like Fidelity International, BlackRock Inc., Baillie Gifford, as well as global firms like WCM Investment Management and Dragoneer Investment Group LLC, the people said. To be sure, the anchor allotment process is still ongoing, and the final investor lineup may change. The episode underscores the intense demand for India’s tech startups as they move toward public listings. Recent IPOs from digital platforms including Urban Co. and Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd. — the parent of discount broker Groww — have drawn heavy demand, reflecting consumers’ rapid shift toward online services and commerce. Representatives for Capital Group and Aberdeen declined to comment. Spokespersons at Meesho, SBI Funds and the other investors didn’t respond to requests for comment. The Bengaluru-based marketplace, which links small manufacturers with price-sensitive consumers in smaller Indian cities, aims to raise as much as 54.2 billion rupees ($603 million). The shares are priced in a range of 105 rupees to 111 rupees apiece, according to a newspaper advertisement published Friday. Existing shareholders, including Elevation Capital V Ltd., Peak XV Partners Investments V and Meesho’s founders will sell shares in the offering.

Title: Goldman Goes All In on Buffer ETFs with $2B Innovator Deal

The company, which is still new to the category, sees the case for buffer and defined-outcome ETFs growing as more people near retirement. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Less than a year after starting to dabble in buffered ETFs, Goldman Sachs is about to become one of the biggest names in the game. The Wall Street giant has agreed to buy defined-outcome ETF firm Innovator Capital Management for $2 billion, it announced Monday. Expected to close during the second quarter of 2026, the purchase will catapult Goldman from its status as a newcomer to the second-largest asset manager in the category, adding $28 billion in assets and putting it just behind First Trust, which manages about $33 billion in its target-outcome products. The three buffer ETFs Goldman Sachs Asset Management offers have been on the market for less than a year and represent about $36 million. Innovator’s growth “is super impressive,” said Bryon Lake, global head of third party wealth at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “Us bringing the Goldman reach, scope and capabilities to create some tailwinds on that business — we got excited about that.” When Innovator added its first ETFs in 2018, the Covid-19 pandemic was still a couple of years away, but that event ended up supercharging the defined-outcome category. It fits a need for investors who want market exposure but, faced with volatility, want some cushion from losses. The current US market for such products sits at about $69 billion, though it is expected to grow. Cerulli anticipates it will cross $334 billion by 2030. Obviously, Goldman sees potential there as well. The company “has refocused its ETF efforts in 2025 and seen strong growth in part from their options-based ETF strategies like GPIQ and GPIX,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research and editorial at TMX VettaFi. The Innovator acquisition is “a key catalyst,” he added. The company has yet to decide whether to keep the Innovator brand or fold it into Goldman’s branding, though it will have an answer for that before the deal closes, Lake said. Innovator’s more than 60 employees are expected to join Goldman. It’s a market that is growing quickly: The Story’s Getting Old. Though defined-outcome ETFs have strong selling points for risk-averse investors during volatility (like that seen earlier this year around tariffs), the case for them may be stronger for retirees and near-retirees. With an estimated 10,000 people reaching retirement age every day, there will be more and more potential investors. Innovator has “an incredible distribution team that is expert on selling sophisticated products and working with clients,” Lake said. “They are obsessed with clients in the way that Goldman is … This one made a ton of sense to us.” New tax laws including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act present novel risks and opportunities when filing next year’s tax returns. Financial advisors learn to love the turnkey solutions with customizable options. Crypto’s exclusion further highlights the complete 180 Paul Atkins’s SEC has done on multiple issues from the previous administration. Thin margins are one reason, but the shutdowns don’t necessarily spell the end of automated advice. The recordkeeper said third-party fintech platforms used by advisors to access clients’ 401(k)s create security risks. The company’s chief investment strategist warned policy moves can take months or years to ripple through the broader economy. Investors have bought and sold more than $17 billion in private company shares using the platform. The move comes before the bank’s full rollout of its tokenization platform next year. US annuity sales reached nearly $120 billion in the third quarter, according to industry trade group LIMRA. The 10 most valuable US companies had a market capitalization of nearly $24.4 trillion as of October The investment bank has acquired EquityZen, giving Morgan Stanley clients greater access to private company investments. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Goldman's $2B ETF Issuer Takeover Is Both a Blessing and a Curse for Crypto

Goldman Sachs (GS) buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer for about $2 billion doesn't seem like it has much to do with crypto at first. However, the Wall Street banking giant's purchase of Innovator Capital has implications that can shake up the entire crypto industry, primarily the ETF sector. That market today is worth $190 billion, but the spot bitcoin BTC$93,317.39 ETF market alone is projected to grow to $3 trillion by 2033. When the deal was announced, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in a statement that “Active ETFs are dynamic, transformative, and one of the fastest-growing segments in today’s public investment landscape,” and “by acquiring Innovator, Goldman Sachs will expand access to modern, world-class investment products.” Bruce Bond, CEO of Innovator, said: “Goldman Sachs has a long history of discerning emerging trends and important directional shifts within the asset management industry." The statements speak volumes about how Goldman sees the ETF industry evolving: building a truly "modern" platform that will invest in emerging trends, based on investor demand. This could eventually include digital assets. Why? Just ask BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, which has more than $13.4 trillion in assets under management. The firm manages over 1,400 different ETFs globally, and out of all these funds, according to one of its executives, bitcoin ETFs have become the firm’s most profitable product line. As a reminder, Goldman Sachs already serves as an Authorized Participant for major spot bitcoin ETFs, including those from BlackRock and Grayscale, facilitating their daily trading. And while Innovator primarily focuses on defined outcome ETFs, it has responded to the increasing demand for crypto exposure with structured ETFs such as the Innovator Uncapped Bitcoin 20 Floor ETF (QBF), which provides investors with exposure to bitcoin through a risk-managed strategy. “Not only does this give them an ETF manufacturing scale in one shot, but it also opens up a pre-engineered, compliant channel for pushing buffered bitcoin exposure through private banks, RIAs and wealth platforms that crypto-native issuers struggle to access,” Anna Tutova, AI Crypto Minds founder and family offices’ advisor told CoinDesk. Simply put, crypto is becoming another Wall Street product that traditional financial institutions want to get exposure to as investors demand new, innovative products and asset classes. ETFs are becoming the distribution channel for that demand. This raises a long-standing debate about why cryptocurrency was created: to provide an alternative financial system that addresses the problems of legacy financial systems. However, crypto needs mass adoption if it is to stand toe-to-toe with traditional finance and government oversight. And to do that, it needs the very institutions, such as BlackRock, Goldman and even the governments it meant to rival. “This deal pretty much sums up 2025 as the year when the legitimacy of crypto has been validated by governments and big players," said Anastasiia Bobeshko, an independent strategic Web3 adviser. And this is where many industry participants sound the alarm. “Crypto is becoming just another Wall Street investment tool, not the alternative system it set out to be," said AI Crypto Minds' Tutova. Trevor Koverko, a co-founder of Sapien and Polymath, echoed the sentiment, saying that Goldman Sachs’ potential crypto ETF move is “good for adoption, dangerous for the ethos." Wall Street ETFs bring scale plus liquidity, but if we stop at ‘number go up in brokerage accounts,’ we’ve just rebuilt the old system on new assets. ETFs should be the on-ramp, not the destination,” he told CoinDesk. So while Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs are pushing further into crypto, legitimizing the industry and preparing it for further adoption, it might fail to uphold the original vision of the cypherpunks and even Bitcoin's mysterious founder (or founders), Satoshi Nakamoto. “Satoshi positioned Bitcoin against corrupt systems like the banking system,” said Kadan Stadelmann, Komodo Platform CTO. “Now massive corporations like BlackRock and Fidelity have become dominant crypto players, changing Bitcoin inherently. It is no longer a political tool based on self-custody, but, rather, a financial tool for wealth preservation and diversification.” More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You Coinbase CEO Armstrong Says Banks That Don't Adapt Stablecoin Will be 'Left Behind' CEO Brian Armstrong said top banks are "leaning into this as an opportunity," signaling Wall Street’s quiet embrace of crypto infrastructure.

Title: Vanguard reverses course, opens door to Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana ETFs

In a dramatic shift that signals growing acceptance of digital assets by mainstream finance, Vanguard has opened its brokerage platform to regulated crypto ETFs. Starting this week, US investors can access exchange-traded funds tied to Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, marking a major reversal from the firm’s long-held resistance to cryptocurrency. 🚨 Just found this on Vanguard’s official website 👀 Multiple XRP ETFs (Franklin, Canary, REX-Osprey, ProShares…) are now showing under « Non-Vanguard Funds » in the Digital Assets category. Looks like access is finally opening up for crypto ETFs pic.twitter.com/Y08IgtAybg — Arthur (@XrpArthur) December 2, 2025 Notably, the move comes amid surging client demand and increasing institutional interest in digital assets, reshaping Vanguard’s traditional investment philosophy. For years, Vanguard maintained a cautious stance toward cryptocurrencies, with former CEO Tim Buckley publicly dismissing BTC and other digital assets as too speculative and unsuitable for long-term portfolios. The firm consistently refused to offer crypto ETFs, emphasising stability and low-risk investments for retirement-focused clients. However, leadership changes paved the way for a rethink. Salim Ramji, formerly the global head of ETFs at BlackRock, assumed the CEO role and gradually steered Vanguard toward regulated crypto offerings. While the firm still will not create its own crypto ETFs or mutual funds, it now supports third-party products that meet regulatory standards, providing clients with access to digital assets while maintaining compliance. The platform expansion enables more than 50 million US brokerage clients to trade crypto ETFs alongside other non-core assets like gold. This could significantly increase market participation, with some predicting near-term price boosts in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Among the new offerings, XRP-based ETFs have generated particular excitement. In just 11 trading days, spot XRP ETFs have recorded net inflows exceeding $756 million, with total assets under management reaching $723 million. Remarkably, there have been no outflows, and major inflow events include $243 million during Canary Capital’s launch, $164 million tied to Grayscale and Franklin Templeton ETFs, and $89.65 million in the most recent session. This rapid accumulation is reducing the liquid XRP supply on exchanges, potentially creating a supply shock that could influence pricing. Vanguard’s pivot reflects a broader trend among traditional financial institutions embracing crypto. Goldman Sachs, for example, is deepening its exposure through a $2 billion acquisition of Innovator Capital Management, which issues defined-outcome ETFs, including Bitcoin-linked structured funds. The bank has rapidly increased its holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, totalling billions in assets, while also developing infrastructure for tokenised financial products. Industry observers view these moves as part of a gradual yet significant integration of digital assets into mainstream portfolios, indicating that regulated, institutionally backed crypto investment is shifting from a niche to a standard. The implications of Vanguard’s decision extend beyond immediate market activity. By allowing access to regulated crypto ETFs, the firm is providing a channel for both retail and institutional investors to participate in digital asset markets within a familiar, compliant framework. This could draw additional inflows, potentially reshaping liquidity dynamics and market sentiment across Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana. For Vanguard, the shift represents not only a strategic response to client demand but also an acknowledgement that digital assets have become a permanent fixture in the global financial landscape.

Ether ETH $3 161 24h volatility: 5.0% Market cap: $381.36 B Vol. 24h: $29.17 B is back under pressure with the recent sharp pullback from the $3,000 zone. The US spot ETFs recorded $79 million in outflows on Dec. 1 as the price briefly lost the $2,800-$2,850 support level. At the time of writing, ETH is trading around $2,800 with a market cap of $337.7 billion. According to popular crypto analyst Ted, if the leading altcoin loses this key level, it could drop towards the $2,500 level. However, he added that a reclaim of the $2,800 level will send ETH above $3,000. $ETH has lost the $2,800-$2,850 support level.

In just three months, roughly $6.4 billion in derivative positions disappeared, bringing the OI 51% down to $6.2 billion. Ethereum open interest by exchange | Source: CryptoQuant ETH itself has dropped from its $4,830 peak to about $2,800, a decline of around 43%. While this drop in OI looks dramatic, it has only dropped below the previous peak of $7.7 billion. Traders seem hesitant to jump back in with liquidations stacking up. According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the scale of this reduction could help clear excess leverage and form a strong price bottom once the dust settles. While Ether ETFs saw an outflow with fear among retail traders, institutions are buying the ETH price dip. BlackRock recently purchased about $26.7 million worth of ETH, which suggests that long-term buyers are not backing away. $ETH ETF outflow of $79,000,000 🔴 yesterday.

Trader pension-usdt.eth opened a 2x short on 6,358 $ETH($18M) an hour ago — right before the market dropped — now sitting on an unrealized profit of $1M.https://t.co/wWuCTPFTHx pic.twitter.com/RuuVZ5ztlC — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 1, 2025 This came shortly after the trader earned roughly $1 million in one hour by taking a 2x short on 6,358 ETH right before prices dropped on Dec. 1. This optimism comes as Ethereum awaits its Fusaka upgrade, scheduled for Dec. 3. The upgrade aims to increase the network’s blob space capacity and reduce transaction costs across Ethereum Layer 2 networks.

That decision triggered a pushback from other large funds, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Meesho is set to open its anchor book — a portion of shares reserved for institutional investors — on Tuesday ahead of its initial public offering that launches on Wednesday.
