US stock futures inched higher on Wednesday ahead of crucial consumer inflation data that could reset interest-rate bets, while investors waited to find out whether big bank earnings will live up to high hopes. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) rose roughly 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) nudged 0.1% higher. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) added about 0.2%, on the heels of a mixed day on Wall Street. The markets are bracing for Wednesday's report on the consumer price index for December, seen as potential pivot point for stocks after wholesale inflation for the month came in cool.

Title: The Right-Wing Judge on a Mission to Destroy ESG Retirement Planning
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/190212/reed-oconnor-esg-investment-blackrock
Time Published: 2025-01-15T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
There are more than 800 federal judges in the United States. None of them create as much work for their colleagues as Reed O’Connor, a federal judge who serves in the northern district of Texas. For nearly two decades, O’Connor has delivered one ideologically driven ruling after another. No matter how many times those decisions are overturned by the appellate courts and the Supreme Court itself, he persists. In his latest haphazard ruling, O’Connor held last week that American Airlines violated its legal obligations to employees by allowing BlackRock, the company’s 401(k) manager, to consider “environmental, societal, and governance” factors when making investment decisions and casting proxy votes. If upheld on appeal, the ruling threatens to upend the entire retirement plan industry by opening 401(k) managers to litigation and penalties for using ESG factors as part of their investment strategies—something that nearly every manager has done in recent years. At issue in the case is whether the airline violated its legal obligations to employees by investing their 401(k) plans with BlackRock, one of the nation’s three largest investment managers, while the investment firm pursued environmentally and socially conscious goals. The class-action plaintiffs claimed that the airline financially harmed its 401(k) participants by not sufficiently scrutinizing BlackRock’s ESG principles when investing and casting proxy votes in shareholder meetings. BlackRock currently manages more than $10 trillion in retirement funds. Like nearly all such managers, it adopted a series of ESG policies over the last decade. Those policies led it to use its proxy voting powers on behalf of shareholders to encourage companies to adopt more socially and environmentally conscious policies. In perhaps the most famous episode, it sided with a group of activist investors in a 2021 proxy vote to put three members on ExxonMobil’s board who would push for investments in renewable energy. The plaintiffs claimed that this approach violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, also known as ERISA. The law sets basic standards for pensions and employee benefit and retirement plans offered by employers. Those employers have a fiduciary requirement to administer their plans on behalf of their employees to minimize risk, avoid conflicts of interest, and so on. Two of these obligations are known as the “duty of prudence” and the “duty of loyalty.” In the plaintiff’s telling, considering ESG issues when making investment decisions violates these duties because they inherently reduce the fund’s performance. “[American Airlines and its subsidiaries] have violated ERISA by selecting and retaining ESG funds that pursue nonfinancial or nonpecuniary objectives like ESG social policy objectives, rather than investment funds that have the exclusive purpose of maximizing financial returns for investors,” they argued in their complaint. American Airlines rejected that assertion and noted that it followed industry standards when offering investment products to employees via BlackRock and reviewing the managers’ actions, which it deemed to be prudent. It also denied that it acted disloyally to its employees by using BlackRock, even though it (and most other investment managers) is a shareholder in American Airlines itself, based on existing precedent. The airline further warned that adopting the plaintiffs’ approach could itself be illegal. “Acceptance of Plaintiff’s theory would compel ERISA fiduciaries to ignore actual investment performance and instead screen out investment options ‘based on non-pecuniary factors’ (i.e., the manager’s proxy voting record when the rationale for such votes is speculative at best), potentially harming participants by depriving them of access to some of the best performing, most popular, and highest rated funds in the market,” the company wrote. “Ironically, this is the exact practice that Plaintiff insists is forbidden by ERISA.” O’Connor ultimately accepted the plaintiffs’ assumption that ESG principles inherently reduced shareholder returns and sided with them. But he struggled to separate out ESG investing, which he found to be unlawful, with investment managers such as BlackRock considering environmental and social factors when deciding how to invest funds, which he found to be acceptable. “If the reason for investing in the company is because these social expenditures are viewed as reasonably reducing, for example, the material risk of government expropriation of the oil fields or mitigating against other types of impactful labor strife, this is not ESG investing because the focus is fundamentally fixed on maximizing a financial benefit,” O’Connor wrote as part of a hypothetical scenario. “But if the reason is due to the belief that the company has a responsibility to improve the society in which it operates notwithstanding the lack of or reduced economic benefit to the company,” the judge continued, “such a non-pecuniary consideration would qualify investments based on these social expenditures as a form of ESG investing.” Even accepting some of O’Connor’s assumptions, his reasoning would require litigants and judges to engage in some casual telepathy to determine a fund manager’s motives. Suppose, for example, BlackRock said that it would draw down its investments in oil and gas companies because of the risk that future climate-minded regulations would impact profits. Is that an unreasonable assumption? Or could it be attacked as a pretext to adopt ESG principles by other means? O’Connor complicated matters by only giving the plaintiffs half of what they wanted. While he ruled that American Airlines had violated its duty of loyalty by not spurning or challenging BlackRock for its ESG initiatives, he rejected the plaintiffs’ assertion that the company had violated the duty of prudence along the way. O’Connor complained that the airline had not acted imprudently when supervising employees’ retirement plans, namely by “selecting and retaining investment managers, overseeing proxy voting, and not intervening in the Exxon proxy vote.” He held that the plaintiffs had offered no evidence that the airline had gone against the industry’s best practices by continuing to rely on BlackRock, noting that no one else had removed the firm after the ExxonMobil vote, either. And while the plaintiffs pointed to the Texas legislature’s recent divestiture from BlackRock over its ESG policies, O’Connor admitted that the lawmakers’ moves, while “based on their sound view of the public interest,” weren’t bound by ERISA’s requirement to follow prevailing industry standards. The split ruling leads to a paradoxical result: In its telling, American Airlines violated ERISA by not challenging BlackRock’s ESG efforts in general and the ExxonMobil vote in particular, but would have also violated ERISA if it had imprudently dropped the management firm after the ExxonMobil vote. O’Connor tried to square the circle by describing the retirement plan industry as “oligopolist” and “cartel-like,” and claiming that “industry norms are not enough to safeguard against breaches of loyalty,” but the paradox remained. This mishmash of a ruling is par for the course with O’Connor. The judge became famous in the 2010s for habitually ruling that the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional. In 2018, he ruled that the entire law was unconstitutional because a Republican-led Congress had zeroed out the individual mandate’s penalty. The decision was widely condemned as lawless, even by some of the ACA’s critics. In 2021, the Supreme Court nixed the lawsuit on standing grounds in a 7–2 ruling, with even Justice Clarence Thomas voting to uphold the ACA. More recently, O’Connor butchered the Indian Child Welfare Act through a series of profound misreadings of Indian law and precedent, again leading to a 7–2 reversal by the justices. O’Connor is also widely seen as an extremely friendly judge to conservative legal interests. Right-wing plaintiffs routinely file lawsuits in his division in hopes of getting them assigned to him. Elon Musk, the far-right CEO of X, updated the company’s terms of service last fall to require that any user lawsuit brought against X be filed in O’Connor’s division in Texas, even though the company is headquartered in California. It is unsurprising that the plaintiffs chose his court to file an anti-ESG lawsuit in, or that he might be interested in enforcing right-wing policy goals. Last December, for example, O’Connor threw out a proposed plea deal between the Justice Department and Boeing over its 737 MAX crashes because of a provision that would have required a federal monitor to be selected “in keeping with the [Justice] Department’s commitment to diversity and inclusion.” The judge claimed that “the parties’ DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the government and Boeing’s ethics and anti-fraud efforts.” The Supreme Court is already hearing two cases this term derived from O’Connor’s trial-court rulings. In one of them, Garland v. VanDerStok, the justices appeared poised to uphold a ghost-gun regulation that the judge had previously struck down. And the court agreed last week to review the lower court rulings in Becerra v. Braidwood Management Inc. In that case, O’Connor struck down an ACA mandate that required companies to provide coverage for preventative-care services, siding with a group of Texas employers who wanted to deny coverage for anti-HIV medications for their workers on religious grounds. If neither the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals nor the high court reverses O’Connor in the American Airlines case, it could potentially reshape how the 401(k) management industry considers risks when making investments in general, as well as severely damage ESG efforts in particular. More litigation will follow, as well as potential financial hits to major American companies themselves—O’Connor has yet to rule on the penalty for American Airlines in this case. It is usually hard to predict whether the Supreme Court will take up a particular case at this stage in the proceedings. With O’Connor, however, we can assume that the court’s intervention is more likely than not. Matt Ford is a staff writer at The New Republic.

Title: US stock futures drift higher ahead of CPI release, bank earnings on tap

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed sharply higher Wednesday as cooling inflation and strong quarterly earnings from Wall Street banks stoked bullish sentiment on stocks. At 4:00 p.m. ET (21:00 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 703 points, or 1.7%, the S&P 500 index added 1.8%, and the NASDAQ Composite climbed 2.5%. Sentiment has been boosted Wednesday after data showed the headline consumer price index increased by 0.4% month-on-month in December, slightly faster than a pace of 0.3% in the prior month. Compared to a year earlier, CPI gained 2.9%, up from 2.7% in November. However, the surprise came with the so-called “core” figure, which strips out volatile components like fuel and food. This rose 0.2% on a monthly basis and 3.2% year-on-year, below expectations for 0.3% and 3.3%, respectively. Still, some on Wall Street continue to see risks for inflation and reiterate expectations for just one cut this year. "Our baseline remains for just one further 25 bps cut from the FOMC, with the most likely timing being March or May. Risks remain skewed to a later date," Macquarie said in a note. Heading into the report, concerns had been swirled around nagging inflation, particularly after last week’s blockbuster employment data. President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to impose strict tariffs on allies and adversaries alike have also fueled the worries around price pressures. Markets are positioning for a much slower pace of interest rate cuts in 2025, with the Federal Reserve forecasting just two rate cuts - a trend that could bode poorly for risk-driven assets. There had been fears before this release that the Fed may actually be forced by sticky inflation to raise rates this year. In the corporate sector, a number of major banks impressed with their latest quarterly returns on Wednesday, offering a boost to the waning post-election stock market rally. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 2% after the investment banking giant posted record annual profit as its dealmakers and traders reaped a windfall from rebounding markets in the fourth quarter. The Wall Street bank also touted increased share buybacks. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) stock soared 6% after the investment bank’s profit more than doubled in the fourth quarter, driven by strong reading results. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) stock gained nearly 7% after the lender reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter, buoyed by stronger investment banking earnings. BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), meanwhile, climbed 5% after reporting a beat on both the top and bottom lines as its assets hit a record high in Q4. Beacon Roofing Supply Inc (NASDAQ:BECN) rose more than 7% after the building products distributor said QXO had made an deal worth $11 billion to buy the company. President Joe Biden confirmed Wednesday that Israel and Hamas reached ceasefire and hostage deal to end 15 months of war on the Gaza strip. (Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)

Title: Futures muted with CPI, bank earnings ahead - what's moving markets
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/futures-muted-with-cpi-bank-earnings-ahead--whats-moving-markets-3813384

Investing.com - US stock futures are steady ahead of the publication of a crucial US inflation report and the release of quarterly earnings from several banking giants. Economists predict that a gauge of consumer price growth that could play into the outlook for Federal Reserve monetary policy accelerated slightly in December. Meanwhile, with a post-election stock market surge possibly easing, investors are looking to the results from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and other lenders to help reignite the rally. 1. Futures steady US stock futures hovered around the flatline on Wednesday, as investors prepared for the release of key US inflation data and a slew of earnings from major Wall Street lenders. By 03:29 ET (08:29 GMT), the Dow futures contract, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were mostly unchanged. The main averages logged a mixed close following a choppy session on Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipping and the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average and benchmark S&P 500 ending higher. A softer-than-expected reading of US producer price growth fueled an initial rise in equities, but the report was not enough to materially impact the outlook for the Federal Reserve's interest rate path. Traders were paying particularly close attention to a jump in airfare prices, which contribute to a crucial measure of inflation favored by Fed rate-setters. 2. CPI ahead Attention now turns to the release of a gauge of consumer prices, which could provide further clarity around the state of inflation. Economists estimate that the headline consumer price index increased by 0.4% month-on-month in December, slightly faster than a pace of 0.3% in the prior month. Compared to a year earlier, CPI is seen at 2.9%, up from 2.7% in November. Stripping out items like food and fuel, the so-called “core” figure is projected to come in at 0.3% on a monthly basis and 3.3% year-on-year, matching November. Heading into the report, concerns have swirled around nagging inflation, particularly after last week’s blockbuster employment data. President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to impose strict tariffs on allies and adversaries alike have also fueled the worries around price pressures. US government bond yields have touched multi-month highs in recent days, weighing on the attractiveness of stocks, as investors have dialed back bets that the Fed will roll out interest rate cuts this year. The central bank slashed borrowing costs by a full percentage point in 2024. While bond investors may have been encouraged by the soft producer prices print, some analysts have flagged that even a CPI number in line with forecasts may not be enough to stem the bearish sentiment. 3. Bank earnings Several major lenders are due to report their latest quarterly returns on Wednesday, with investors eyeing them as a potential source of life for a waning post-election stock market rally. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup (NYSE:C), as well as asset management giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), are set to announce their numbers prior to the opening bell on Wednesday. Investment banking and trading revenues will likely be a focal point, especially following a surge in stocks after Trump's election victory that was fueled by hopes on Wall Street for a new era of looser regulations and lower taxes. A dip in corporate borrowing costs could buoy top-line results as well. Analysts have also predicted that the Fed's rate cuts may have bolstered net interest margins, or the difference between what a lender pays out for deposits and makes from borrowing. 4. US to push TSMC, Samsung to tighten China chip supplies - Bloomberg The US is planning more regulations aimed at limiting the flow of advanced chips made by TSMC and its peers into China, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, adding to a flurry of restrictions imposed by the Biden administration. The proposed measures will encourage manufacturers such as TSMC (TW:2330), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930), and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) to more carefully scrutinize their customers for ties to blacklisted Chinese organizations, Bloomberg said. The report comes just days after the US introduced additional restrictions on the export of cutting-edge artificial intelligence chips, in a continued effort to cut China off from advances in the fast-growing technology. 5. Crude gains Oil prices advanced Wednesday, helped by a drop in US crude stockpiles as well as fears that new sanctions on Russian oil exports will disrupt global supplies. By 03:30 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) rose by 0.5% to $76.75 a barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.4% to $80.27 per barrel. Prices slipped on Tuesday after the US Energy Information Administration predicted oil would come under pressure over the next two years as supply would outpace demand. That said, the market has found some support from a report from the American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday that showed a decline in crude stockpiles in the US, the world's biggest oil consumer. Traders also continue to focus on the Russian oil sanctions, amid uncertainty around how much Russian supply will be lost in the global market and whether alternative measures can offset the shortfall.

Title: Globalists embrace depopulation and automation: A new economic paradigm?

Global elites suggest declining populations could accelerate AI and robotics adoption, offering economic advantages by replacing human labor with machines, particularly in developed nations. Critics warn of deepening global inequality, as nations with strong infrastructure and education may thrive in an automated economy, while others risk being left behind. AI and robotics are rapidly replacing both white-collar and blue-collar jobs, with no profession immune, raising alarms about widespread unemployment and societal disruption. Individuals must elevate their roles to stay relevant, as automation reshapes the workforce, with those unable to adapt potentially marginalized in a depopulated future. The debate centers on whether technological advancement should take precedence over preserving human labor, with fears of a dystopian future where inequality and joblessness escalate.

The debate centers on whether technological advancement should take precedence over preserving human labor, with fears of a dystopian future where inequality and joblessness escalate. The debate centers on whether technological advancement should take precedence over preserving human labor, with fears of a dystopian future where inequality and joblessness escalate. In a startling revelation that has sparked widespread debate, global elites are openly discussing the potential benefits of depopulation as a catalyst for the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. This controversial perspective, highlighted in a recent Brighteon Broadcast News segment by Mike Adams, suggests that countries with declining populations may have a strategic advantage in transitioning to an automated workforce. However, the ethical and social implications of this shift are raising alarms among critics, who warn of a deepening global divide between nations equipped to embrace automation and those left behind. The conversation was ignited by comments from a BlackRock executive, who argued that shrinking populations in developed countries could accelerate the replacement of human labor with machines. "Countries that have shrinking demographics will rapidly develop robotics and AI technology," the executive stated. "If the promise of these technologies transforms productivity, as most of us believe it will, it could elevate the standard of living even with declining populations." This perspective challenges the traditional view that population decline is inherently negative, instead framing it as an opportunity for economic transformation. The executive further explained that nations with restrictive immigration policies and declining birth rates would find it easier to substitute human workers with machines, avoiding the social complexities of integrating a growing labor force. "The paradigm of negative population growth is going to change," he asserted. "The social problems of replacing humans with machines will be far easier in countries with declining populations." However, this optimistic outlook is not without its critics. Opponents argue that this vision of the future risks exacerbating global inequality. Countries with robust education systems, infrastructure, and rule of law may thrive in an automated economy, while those lacking these foundations could be left further behind. "For countries with rising populations, the answer will be education and rapid development," the executive acknowledged. "But for those without a foundation of rule of law or education, they're going to be left. That's where the divide is going to get more pronounced." The debate underscores a broader ethical dilemma: should humanity prioritize technological advancement over the preservation of human labor? As AI and robotics continue to advance, the potential for job displacement across industries is becoming increasingly apparent. Mike Adams, in his broadcast, emphasized that no profession is immune. "Much of humanity is being replaced by AI systems," he warned. "AI software is replacing white-collar jobs, and AI robots are replacing blue-collar jobs, including in agriculture." Adams recounted conversations with individuals in creative fields, such as graphic design, journalism, and law, who remain skeptical about the threat of automation. "They don't get it," he said. "They describe their job processes, and I tell them, 'You just described exactly what an AI agent can do right now.'" He pointed to the rapid evolution of AI tools, which can now perform tasks like photo editing, video production, and even creative writing with minimal human input. "It's not a question of if AI will make your job obsolete," Adams asserted. "The answer for almost everybody is yes, it will." The implications of this shift are profound. As automation reshapes the workforce, individuals and societies must grapple with how to adapt. Adams urged listeners to consider how they can elevate their roles to stay relevant in an AI-driven world. "The real question is how you can position yourself to stay on top of AI automation," he said. "Otherwise, you risk being thrown into the depopulation category, which is what the globalists are doing." This provocative discussion raises critical questions about the future of work, economic equity, and the role of humanity in an increasingly automated world. While some see depopulation and automation as a pathway to prosperity, others fear it could lead to a dystopian future where human labor is rendered obsolete and global inequality reaches unprecedented levels. As the debate continues, one thing is clear: the choices made today will shape the trajectory of societies for generations to come.

Title: Eyes on the prize with history to be made by two of the four clubs in novel All-Ireland finale

Time Published: 2025-01-15T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
For a change, next Sunday’s All-Ireland club finals bring a high degree of novelty. The championship has been through many changes, particularly in more recent years, but the trend towards serial success has at least temporarily come to a halt. Pre-pandemic, Corofin became in 2020 the first club to win three successive All-Irelands and, but for the pandemic, Ballyhale Shamrocks might well have emulated them in the abandoned year that followed, in 2021. This weekend, for the first time in 32 years, all four clubs are appearing at this stage for the first time. You could argue that both the Cuala footballers and Na Fianna hurlers are simply following in the footsteps of the “other code” within their clubs. The Dalkey team won back-to-back All-Ireland hurling titles in 2017 and 2018, whereas Na Fianna were football finalists in 2000. To hold that against the current teams would be nit-picking, as they will be representing the historically less-fashionable side of their respective houses. Cuala’s defeat of Kilmacud in the county final was their first football title, just as Na Fianna, who skinned the same opponents with a dying-seconds goal in their final, were collecting only a second Dublin hurling championship. Their respective opponents in Croke Park, Errigal Ciarán and Sarsfields, are uncomplicatedly first-timers. Errigal are actually Tyrone’s first contestants in the senior club final, maybe surprisingly given their success at intercounty level in the past two decades as well as the strike rate of their junior and intermediate clubs – 11 finals and four titles – at national level in the same time frame. Sarsfields didn’t even emerge from Cork as champions, having lost comprehensively to Imokilly in the final. But their opponents’ status as a divisional side – barred from provincial competition – cleared the way for them to contest Munster. Their performances stunned observers, especially in the final when they burned off regular champions Ballygunner in the early stages and maintained the heat as the match progressed. A Cork side had reached the Munster final just once in the previous 14 years and you had to go back a further seven seasons for the once-dominant county’s most recent title, Newtownshandrum in 2009. It had been eight seasons since a club from the county had even won a single match in Munster. Theirs has been a story of triumph in adversity and not just on the field. In 2023, Storm Babet brought floods that destroyed their pitch in Riverstown. For a year they had to couch-surf in neighbouring clubs, their facilities restored only a few months ago. [ Con O’Callaghan inspires Cuala to reach Croke Park deciderOpens in new window ] Should Cuala win on Sunday, they will become only the second club after St Finbarr’s to have lifted both All-Ireland trophies. Their success has been seen as the gauge of Dublin GAA’s reach into the southside suburbs in the 50 years since Kevin Heffernan revived the county as an All-Ireland force. On the eve of a first four-in-a-row in 2018, former captain and manager Tony Hanahoe made the point. “Now that Dublin have arrived and are there, there are two or three generations who won’t ever understand how far down we had gone at that stage. For one who remembers these things, the rise in the interest in the game and the success rate has been astounding. “The greatest example of that is Cuala. If, 30 or 40 years ago, you had attempted to convince me that there would be an All-Ireland winning club from out around Killiney, I’d have laughed in your face.” Na Fianna are based in more traditional territory but both come into the “super club” category, with 3,000 or more members – a reflection on how hard it is to establish a club in Dublin, which fosters outsize catchments. [ Na Fianna of Dublin and Sarsfields of Cork secure first All-Ireland club hurling final appearanceOpens in new window ] The county could become the third to win both club All-Irelands in the same year, following Cork in 1973 (Glen Rovers and Nemo Rangers) and 1979 (Blackrock and Nemo) and Galway in 2006 (Salthill and Portumna). Pride of place in the history of dual All-Ireland challenges has to go, however, to Cork’s St Finbarr’s, who in 1981 reached both finals, beating Walterstown in the football but losing the hurling to Ballyhale. It is now five years since the traditional St Patrick’s Day date went by the board for the club finals. For all the grumbling about how this calendar switch to January has undermined attendances, there were signs that the public were losing interest in the regular March fixture. Fewer than 18,000 attended in the last year of the Patrick’s Day finals and 12 months previously – not helped by arctic weather and Ireland’s rugby Grand Slam decider with England being on television at the same time – just 15,000 made their way down Jones’s Road. It was a far cry from peak crowds at the turn of the century. In 1999 for the Crossmaglen v Ballina and St Joseph’s Doora-Barefield v Rathnure double bill, a record 40,106 turned up. But with the exception of 2004′s Caltra v An Gaeltacht and Newtownshandrum v Dunloy pairing, which drew 38,500, attendances settled in the low 30,000s. The new split season has created pressures for top intercounty players, obliged to go around the clock if their clubs do well. Christmas has always been affected in successful clubs, making a calendar year attractive but, in the consensus view, impractical. On the Irish Independent sports podcast, Birr’s Michael Verney – for all of us, that most dignifying combination of All-Ireland finalist and reporter – gave the hardship argument short shrift. “You hear, isn’t it terrible that players are missing out on Christmas. I can tell you that the players who have to – in inverted commas – ‘sacrifice’ Christmas are the envy of every other club in the country. That is a fact.” By Sunday evening, that process will intensify as two of the weekend’s clubs create history. sean.moran@irishtimes.com Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: New Ireland U-20 head coach Neil Doak looking to build on recent success

Head coach Neil Doak poses for a portrait during the Ireland U-20 squad announcement at PwC HQ in Spencer Dock, Dublin. Photo: Ben McShane/Sportsfile Neil Doak Ireland U-20 head coach Neil Doak has vowed to play rugby that “excites players and spectators” after he named his squad for the Six Nations today. Doak (right), who is coaching his first Six Nations, aims to build on Ireland’s extraordinary run in the competition after back-to-back Grand Slams followed by a second-place finish last year – despite winning four games and drawing one against England, losing out on bonus points. “Ultimately as a coach you have to understand the players. There is no point asking players to do things that they’re not really comfortable with and so we’ll adjust as we go along,” he said. "We'll obviously look at the other teams and see where we can exploit some avenues but from my point of view, I want to play a brand of rugby that excites the players and excites spectators. “We also know that we want to be successful as well. And what we’re got to try and do as coaching staff and as management is help the players be really good problem solvers, give them scenarios, give them a framework that they can sort build things off, make good decisions.” Ireland host England in Cork on Thursday, January 30 and Doak is not worried about the short turnaround, with just over two weeks until the opening game. “It's a short window to try and prepare a team and put it together, so there’s a decent bit of work that has to go into it beforehand. Hugely positive win against Italy pre-Christmas and played Leinster [development XV] last Saturday. "The boys did well with the chopping and changing, which is always difficult and trying to get those combinations and sort of get everybody on the same page, but the players have done very well over the three camps. "I think in the Italy game we scored two or three tries in a short window which took us away from them, but I was hugely impressed with the way that the second-half team in the Leinster development match, dealt with it. “Difficult conditions, a bit of drizzle, it wasn’t as fluid as we had hoped it would be and I thought we showed great character, got into the right areas of the field and we delivered a few times and sort of just kept us in front. It stands us in good stead, especially the back end of the games, that we can deliver points. I was hugely pleased with that 40-minutes.” Connacht academy player Éanna McCarthy was named captain and the Cork-born back-row, along with five returning players from last year’s competition, gives Doak a great leadership group for the tournament. “When we put the squad together and the management together, and tried to build what we were about, for me I’m a bit more action-orientated. I want to get in the middle. "Last week, Éanna was physical, he was direct and we’re going to need that in abundance against England first up. If he can lead from the front, we can get the rest of the squad in behind him and we’ll be in a good spot. “I think if you look at the England squad, I think they’ve maybe nine or 10 back from that World Cup winning squad. For us, that exposure and experience, I think that was good leading into the World Cup last year.

Students used the University of Otago's Bloomberg terminals to research stocks to invest in. Photo / Alex Robertson A trio of finance students at the University of Otago’s Business School technically made a profit of $101,110 from virtual share trading over a five-week period as part of a global competition. Shenjian Li, Mingxuan Yu and Junxiu Lyu invested $1 million of imaginary capital into 55 United States and Canadian listed companies, including BlackRock, Trump Media and Technology Group and an array of finance, technology, commodity and pharmaceutical-related companies. They followed an earnings-based investment strategy, holding no more than five stocks at a time and selling them for a gain or loss after those companies released their financial reports. The total payoff was equal to an annualised return of about 162%, putting them in the top 11% of the Bloomberg market trading challenge in which they competed against more than 2000 teams from universities across 46 countries. “It’s the sort of [investment] performance that professional hedge fund managers would like to obtain in their funds,” Otago Professor Emeritus of finance Timothy Falcon Crack said. The students used the University of Otago’s Bloomberg terminals to research their investments through company earnings reports, financial analyst reports and news articles. “Even though it wasn’t real money, we still had to make decisions based on real-world data and could only buy and sell stocks in the Bloomberg Lab,” student Junxiu Lyu said. Their investment returns dropped 10% in the second week of the challenge but they still held their stock positions. “Sometimes I’d wake up in the middle of the night to check [our investments], and one day I saw 15% losses,” student Shenjian Li said. They were the only New Zealand team to enter the competition and beat all the Australian teams. The team, called Otago Alpha, placed 262nd overall among 2453 teams from 383 universities. They were mentored by senior finance lecturer Dr Olena Onishchenko. Plus: The hottest stocks investors are buying.

The rupee extended its recovery for the second straight session and settled with a gain of 13 paise at 86.40 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, tracking favourable cues from domestic equity markets and softening crude oil prices. - PTI WhatsApp Image 2025-01-15 at 15.38.55.jpeg According to Motilal Oswal Private Wealth (MOPW), Indian markets are expected to remain volatile in the first half of 2025 due to several global and domestic events, including the new Trump administration’s policies, China’s measures to counter trade tariffs and its possible implications for EM currencies, and the upcoming Indian Union budget. These events are anticipated to create uncertainty in the near term. However, as these events unfold and greater clarity emerges, market volatility is expected to subside in the latter half of the year. Despite the recent slowdown in GDP, MOPW remains optimistic about India’s growth due to its macroeconomic stability, supported by significant foreign exchange reserves and a regulated twin deficit. It expects GDP growth to improve compared to the modest growth reported in Q2 FY25. Ashish Shanker, MD & CEO of MOPW says, “The post covid period has been extremely rewarding to equity investors driven by earnings growth, improving macros and domestic inflows into equities. The year 2024 has been no different with broader markets doing extremely well. The mid cap and small cap segment have outperformed the large caps. Gold has also done well as an asset class. The year 2025 will bring its share of uncertainty as the new US president gets sworn in. After years of good performance the US markets also looks tired. This calls for moderation in expectations and a sharp focus on risk management through asset allocation” After tepid corporate earnings and slow GDP growth in Q2FY25, MOPW recommends closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season and GDP growth trajectory.. We expect this trend to reverse and expect large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort. In the longer term, earning growth and stock returns should converge. Considering this, it seems small cap stocks have run up way ahead of earnings growth in most of the segments. MOPW expects this trend to reverse and large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort.

Read more Gold prices steadied in yesterday’s session, as market participants digested latest US inflation data as well as a report on President-elect Donald Trump’s planned trade tariffs. US producer prices rose at a slower-than-anticipated rate in December, increasing by 0.2% on a month-on-month basis, below 0.4% pace seen in November. Sticky inflation and strength in the labor market could provide the Federal Reserve more headroom to keep interest rates high. Trump’s team is preparing a plan for a gradual imposition of trade tariffs in the coming months, although it was unclear whether the President-elect will follow through on the plan. The plan will involve tariff increases of between 2% to 5% every month, and will give Washington more leverage in trade negotiations, while also preventing a sudden spike in inflation due to the duties. Despite lower PPi, dollar index continues to hold its strength hovering around its two year highs, market participants will keep an eye on the US CPI data scheduled later today. Updates regarding a ceasefire deal yesterday between Israel and Hamas capped some gains for precious metal, any further updates on the same could weigh on prices. Perspective by Ravi Hirwani, Senior Vice-President, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, on expectations from the upcoming Union Budget “The Indian healthcare sector is at a pivotal junction of growth. Certain measures announced by the government can further amplify it. The ecosystem needs to be re-engineered to empower rural counterparts with robust, tech-forward healthcare and medical solutions. Complex ailments like cancer and heart issues burden the ecosystem. There is a shortage of medical specialists, and the need for healthcare infrastructure development in the country’s rural counterpart. The sector needs strategic reforms from both operational and financial perspectives. We request the honorable Finance Minister to increase the allocation by 3% spending of the total GDP to the healthcare sector. Further, the removal or reduction of customs duties on medical devices and cancer-related drugs & devices. The government must consider giving the healthcare sector an infrastructure status that will help private players to reap the benefit and expand operations, especially in smaller cities. An incentivization scheme for expansion in Tier-2 and below cities and the adoption of technology will help the sector flourish in the long run. Hospitals must be allowed to avail the benefits of input tax credit that will help bring a control on treatment costs effectively, thus creating a win-win situation for both industry players and residents alike. The country must aim for dual-dimensional growth by catering for the residents as well as foreign nationals and to address this, we request the government to introduce special packages and measures for foreign nationals seeking to take treatment in India. This will further accentuate the positioning of India as one of the most sought-after destinations for medical tourism.” Smartlink Holdings Ltd has informed the exchange about sanction of the amalgamation scheme between Smartlink Holdings and Synegra EMS Ltd by the National Company Law Tribunal.

Key Highlights: 1. EU plans to ban Russian primary aluminium imports in new sanctions. 2. The sanctions mark the third anniversary of the Ukraine war. 3. Aluminium imports from Russia to the EU dropped to 6% in 2024. 4. Alternative supplies from UAE and Bahrain gain attention. 5. LME aluminium prices reached $2,602 before settling at $2,576.50. The European Union is set to propose a ban on Russian primary aluminium imports in its 16th sanctions package, marking the third anniversary of the Ukraine war. This measure follows reduced Russian aluminium imports, which fell to 6% of total EU aluminium demand in 2024. While U.S. and UK bans have intensified the supply shift, the EU seeks alternatives from Middle Eastern producers like the UAE and Bahrain. The news initially pushed LME aluminium prices to a one-month high of $2,602 before settling at $2,576.50, reflecting market uncertainties. * AARTIIND * ANGELONE * BANDHANBANK * HINDCOPPER * LTFIN * RBLBANK Optiemus: Company partners Taiwan-based KunWay Technology to Drive Drone Manufacturing Localization in India.

In the US, Producer prices increased 0.2% mom (+3.3% YoY) in Dec-24, below 0.4% in November which was the biggest gain in five months, and compared to forecasts of 0.3% (+3.4% YoY). Meanwhile, the core PPI was unchanged, following a 0.2% rise (+3.5%YoY) in Nov and compared to forecasts of 0.3% (+3.8%YoY). On the fiscal front in the U.S. government posted an $87 billion budget deficit in December, reduced partly by a shift of benefit payments into November but capping a record $711 billion deficit for the first three months of the 2025 fiscal year, On the domestic front, India’s wholesale prices increased by 2.37% yoy in December 2024, accelerating from a 1.89% rise in November, slightly above forecasts of a 2.30% gain. This was due to faster rises in manufacturing prices amid a softer fall in fuel prices. Primary articles saw faster growth (6.02% vs 5.49% in Nov), and manufacturing prices accelerated to a 23-month high (2.14% vs 2.00%). In view of ongoing political crisis in Bangladesh, India aims to boost its textile and garments industry in next month’s budget with financial support, tariff cuts on key inputs and incentives to produce locally, two government sources said. The government may also raise the allocation for production-linked incentives for the textile sector to around 600 million rupees from 450 million rupees for the current fiscal year, the source said. Moreover the government is likely to forecast nominal economic growth of 10.3 per cent-10.5 per cent, according to one of the officials. That’s higher than the forecast of 9.7 per cent for the current year to end-March given by the government’s statistical department this month.

The IPO that comes out with a price band of ₹407-428 a share saw a tremendous response from non-institutional investors including retail by subscribing 16 times. The minimum lot size is 33 shares. Equity markets are expected to sustain their gains at open. Gift Nifty at 23,310 signals a marginal gain of about 50 points at open. However, analysts expect the market to remain volatile and remain under pressure given the unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said: positive domestic factors include a decline in retail inflation to a four-month low of 5.2 per cent, IIP growth improving in November 2024 to 5.17 per cent and the RBI Governor’s indication of a more flexible rupee policy, contributing to improved market sentiment. “While there is short-term relief in the market, overall weak global cues, a fall in the rupee, low earnings growth and FII outflows continue to weigh on sentiment, keeping the overall outlook cautious,” he added. Read more The last month of the year 2024 was quite eventful even though Indian bond yields continued to trade in a narrow range. INR was the centre of attention as it come under increasing pressure in the latter part of December on back of continuous rise in the dollar index as it surged 2.60% during the month. INR depreciated by 1.32% against the US dollar, touching a lifetime low of 85.82 on an intraday basis before a marginal pullback on RBI intervention led to monthly and yearly closing at 85.61. The dollar index climbed above 108, ending the month at 108.49. December started on an optimistic note for the bond markets as markets started to factor in a higher probability of a policy rate cut in the December 6th Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting after the much slower-than-expected Q2 FY25 GDP growth data released on 29th Nov 2024. The MPC kept all the policy rates on hold while RBI reduced the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 50bps. The reduction in CRR released Rs. 1.16 lac cr of liquidity in the banking system, which was struggling with tight liquidity on account of heavy RBI intervention in the FX markets along with advance tax and GST outflows. The MPC decision’s to hold policy rates was taken with a 4-2 majority with Dr. Nagesh Kumar and Professor Ram Singh voting for a 25bps cut in the policy repo rate. The monetary policy stance of “Neutral” was retained unanimously. The MPC revised both its Inflation and Growth forecast for FY25, pegging down the GDP forecast at 6.60% from 7.20% earlier and increasing the Inflation forecast to 4.80% for FY25 from 4.50% earlier. RBI remains optimistic on GDP growth in H2FY25 after the negative surprise of Q2. The tone of the policy was balanced with emphasis on durable price stability. There was change of guard at the RBI as Sanjay Malhotra, the incumbent revenue secretary took over as the 26th Governor of RBI replacing Shaktikanta Das who was at the helm for six years. CPI Inflation came in line with expectations at 5.48% with core inflation remaining stead at 3.70%. Food Inflation moderated but remained high at 8.2% YOY. WPI Inflation cooled to 1.90% in November compared to 2.40% in October led by moderation in food prices. WPI has averaged 2.10% so far in this fiscal, compared to a corresponding period average of -1.30% in FY2023. WPI “core” Inflation came in at 0.50% compared to 0.30% in October, though remined below 1% for the fourth consecutive month. Trade deficit hit an all-time high of USD 37.9 bn for November as imports led by gold imports hitting an all-time high of USD 70 bn. Couple of days after the release of the trade data , there were news reports of some error in the data and the government thinking about setting up a team to double check on the data. The current account deficit came in steady at 1.20% of GDP for QE September 24, compared to 1.10% of GDP in the quarter ending June 24. Capital account remained in surplus at USD 30 bn and the overall BOP surplus came in at USD 18.60 bn in QE September from USD 5.20 bn in the previous quarter. The current account deficit is likely to expand in the December quarter. Tax collections remains robust with the third quarter advance tax payment at Rs 3.15 lakh crore, compared with Rs 2.7 lakh crore a year ago. Net direct tax collections (net of refunds) rose 16.45% YOY to INR 15.82 lac crore, which consisted of INR 7.42 lac crore of corporate tax and INR 7.97 lac crore of non-corporate tax collection with STT collections at INR 40,000 crore. The finance ministry, in its economic review for November, expressed optimism regarding a growth rebound in H2 of FY25 by projecting a GDP growth of 6.50% for FY25. The report also mentioned that the “combination of monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures by the central bank may have contributed to the demand slowdown”. This is being seen as putting some pressure on RBI to support growth by reducing rates. Interbank liquidity remained pretty tight even after the reduction in CRR, leading to sharp uptick in money market yields of up to 1 Yr maturity. 3 month maturity CD yields were trading close to 7.40%-7.45% levels, higher by 20-25 bps, compared to the September quarter and the 1 Yr maturity CD’s were trading at 7.65%-7.70%. Bond yields inched higher by 2-3 bps across the curve, with the benchmark 10 Yr bond yield ending the month at 6.76%, up by 2 bps compared to last month’s closing of 6.74%. OIS curve steepened as the 5 Yr OIS yield was higher by 16 bps, ending the month at 6.20%. 1 Yr OIS ended the month at 6.51%, up by 10 bps on the month. FPI flows revived in December with debt flows at USD 1.40 bn, taking the total FPI flows into debt for CY2024 to USD 18 bn. Banking deposit growth has exceeded the credit growth this fiscal with the banking system deposits growing by 7.80%, compared to the credit growth of 7.00% in FY25 so far. Globally, bond remined under pressure with the US Fed delivering a hawkish rate cut as it reduced its forecast of rate cuts for 2025. The US Fed lowered its rate cut forecast for 2025 to 2 rate cuts from 4 earlier and also raised the inflation and the neutral rate forecast. BOJ stood pat on rates but it is expected that they will increase their policy rates twice in 2025. A hawkish Fed coupled with the challenging debt situation in US, sticky inflation amidst robust GDP growth has led to a sharp rise in US bond yields in the last quarter. The benchmark US 10 Yr Bond yield ended the year at 4.57%, up by almost 90 bps over the last three months. The elevated US and global bond yields along with the rise in the dollar index has put pressure on emerging market currencies and bond yields. The dollar index has surged by 6.15% in CY2024 and the INR has depreciated by 2.88% in CY2024. RBI has intervened quite aggressively to contain INR depreciation and RBI is short almost USD 60 bn in the NDF market. India’s foreign currency reserves are down by USD 43 bn from its peak. The pressure on INR due to a strengthening US dollar and expectations of a rebound in the GDP growth in H2FY25 has reduced expectations of policy rate cut from RBI but we continue to expect RBI to cut policy rates starting from February 2025 onwards as Inflation is likely to moderate further. We also expect the external situation to stabilise gradually as markets seems to have factored in a lot of negatives. Bonds will continue to be supported on expectations of monetary easing and we expect yields to continue to drift lower gradually. Retracement in yields from current levels will offer a good opportunity to investors to increase their allocation to fixed income. PGIM India MF Outlook While there are some headwinds in terms of slowing earnings growth, lacklustre capex, INR depreciation and subdued consumption, we reckon some of the above may be transient and will resolve over time. Importantly, corporate debt/GDP are at lows, banks are well capitalised, capital markets are strong and hence there is enough fuel available for long-term productive asset creation which keeps India’s growth story intact. We are mindful of geopolitical actions in terms of tariffs and rate cuts which could result in measures being taken by impacted countries and that needs to be closely monitored. We believe that despite global challenges, India continues to be the fastest-growing economy among major nations, reflecting its resilience. Factors such as sustained domestic economic growth, political stability, prudent reforms, infrastructure investment, healthy corporate finances, ample foreign reserves, controlled twin deficits, stable crude prices, and lower commodity inflation protect India from external shocks and position it for future growth. We are optimistic on investments in high-growth and good-quality companies with a medium to long-term investment horizon. The Market that was The NIFTY 50 declined 2% in December after a flattish November, but gained 8.8% in CY2024. Mid Cap and Small Cap indices outperformed the Large Cap index and were up 1.4% and 0.6% in December and 23.9% each (both Mid Cap and Small Cap indices) in CY2024. Sector-wise, healthcare and realty were the best-performing sectors in the month of December and in 2024. Power, metals and PSU indices declined 7%, 5.4% and 5.2% in December. Rupee was down 1.3% at INR 85.6 vs USD and India 10 Yr yields rose by 6 bps during the month to 6.81%. FPIs bought USD 59 mn of Indian equities in the secondary market, whereas DIIs bought USD 4 bn. FIIs net sold USD 170mn in CY24. On the other hand, DIIs have continued to remain net buyers to the tune of USD 62 bn in CY24. Within DIIs, mutual funds have been the key buyers, contributing to USD 50bn buying. On the economy front, November CPI decelerated to 5.5% YoY from 6.2% in October and back to September levels of 5.5% due to correction in food prices. Sequentially, inflation eased by -15 bps vs. 134 bps hike in the previous month. Core CPI (ex-food and fuel) remained stable at 3.8% as in the last month with sequential pace slowing to 20 bps vs. 59 bps in the last month. WPI also eased to 1.9% in November, compared to 2.4% in October. The index of industrial production (IIP) marginally improved and grew by 3.5% YoY in October vs. growth of 3.1% in September, buoyed by festival-driven demand, reversing a 0.1% contraction in August. Manufacturing/Electricity/Mining registered 4%/2%/1% YoY growth. 18/23 industries advanced YoY. Trade deficit in November further expanded to USD 38 bn (versus USD 27 bn in October and USD 20 bn in September), almost entirely led by a jump in gold imports from USD 7 bn in October to USD 16 bn in November. FY25 April-Nov’24 fiscal deficit touched 52.5% of budgeted estimates (BE) vs. 50.1% of the budgeted estimates same time last year. Direct tax collections are 12% higher YoY with personal income taxes higher by 24% YoY while corporate taxes are down 1% YoY. On the indirect tax side, collections are higher 9% YoY with higher customs growth offsetting weaker GST collections. YTD capex is only 46% of BE and -12% lower than last year. So far, capex has been concentrated in railways (67% of BE and -1% YoY), roads and transport (54% of BE and -16% YoY) while the other primary focus defence is lagging (42% of BE and -16% YoY). A monthly run rate of INR 642 bn so far and with four months to go gives a steep rate of INR 1494 bn (more than double of what has been clocked so far to achieve the budgeted estimates). System credit growth remained weak for the month of November at 10.6% YoY (Oct’24: 11.5% YoY) due to weak retail credit growth of 13.3% YoY (Oct’24: 12.9% YoY) and weak services credit growth of 13% YoY (Oct’24: 12.7% YoY). The weakness in growth is mainly due to stress in unsecured credit. Credit growth has largely converged with deposit growth which stood at 10.7% YoY driven by tightening of risk weights on unsecured loans and NBFC credit. INR4.5t Equity net inflows at record high in CY24 INR264.6b Amount garnered through SIPs at a new high INR66.9t MF industry’s AUM jumps 32% YoY According to Motilal Oswal Fund Folio Report, domestic MFs saw their equity AUM rise for the 11th consecutive year to INR33.4t (+40% YoY) in CY24.

However, redemptions also rose 40% YoY to INR4,645b, leading to a rise in net inflows (more than double YoY) to INR4,475b in CY24 (all-time high) from INR2,063b in CY23. The MF industry’s total AUM increased 32% YoY (INR16.1t) to INR66.9t in CY24, propelled by the growth in equity funds (INR9,537b), liquid funds (INR1,727b), balanced funds (INR1,533b), other ETFs funds (INR1,424b), and income funds (INR954b). Investors continued to park their money in mutual funds, with inflows and contributions in systematic investment plans (SIPs) reaching a new high of INR264.6b in Dec’24 (up 4.5% MoM and 50.2% YoY).

The uptick was led by the fuel and power and primary non-food articles, which together accounted for as much as 42 bps of the 48 bps increase in the headline print between these months. The WPI food inflation remained unchanged at 8.9% in December 2024 vis-à-vis November 2024. Among food items, the inflation in vegetables and edible oils remained elevated, printing above the 25% mark in the month. The core (non-food manufacturing) WPI inflation inched up slightly to a five-month high of 0.7% in December 2024 from 0.5% in November 2024, while remaining below the 1.0%-mark for the fifth consecutive month. The prices of major vegetables, such as tomato, onion and potato, have declined quite sharply on a sequential basis in January 2025 so far. However, the relatively lower weight of vegetables in the WPI vis-à-vis the CPI, would limit the benefits on this account to the headline WPI inflation in the month. Moreover, the import duty hikes on most varieties of edible oil that were undertaken in mid-September 2024, are expected to continue to weigh on the year-on-year (YoY) WPI-food inflation print in January 2025. Consistently outperform Sensex over the past five fiscals1 New Delhi, January 14 2025: The benchmark of equity alternative investment funds (AIFs) investing in unlisted securities achieved a remarkable pooled internal rate of return (IRR) of 21.5% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, according to the second edition of the Crisil-Oister report, ‘No ifs about AIFs 2.0’. Across the past five fiscals, the benchmark outpaced the BSE Sensex Total Return Index (TRI), reaffirming the resilience and importance of private markets in India’s investment landscape. Stage-wise, the benchmark of early-stage funds generated a pooled IRR of 26.9% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, outperforming the BSE 250 Smallcap TRI by 4.29%. Similarly, the benchmark of growth and late-stage funds delivered a robust pooled IRR of 23.6% between fiscals 2015 and 2024, surpassing the BSE 200 TRI by 5.97%. IRR captures both realised and unrealised gains. The distribution to paid-in (DPI) capital ratio shows the realised gains for an investor. The benchmark belonging to the earliest vintage — fiscal 2014 — had a DPI ratio of 1.56, meaning investors received 56% more than their initial investment as of March 2024. Says Sandeep Sinha, Co-CEO, Oister, “This year’s Crisil-Oister report reinforces our long-held belief that private capital is not only participating in India’s growth story but also shaping it. In fiscal 2024, private markets once again demonstrated their ability to outperform and lead through long-term growth and sectoral innovation, setting a benchmark for resilience, scale and innovation.” Shanti Gold International Limited, a Mumbai-based manufacturer of 22kt CZ casting gold jewellery, based on installed production capacity (Source: CARE Report).

Title: Will There Be A DeFi Cycle In This Crypto Bull Run?

Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images As the crypto market enters a new phase of bullish momentum, the question on everyone's mind is whether Decentralized Finance (DeFi) will once again take center stage. While the DeFi boom of 2020 catalyzed the broader blockchain ecosystem, this cycle may take a more evolved and measured approach, emphasizing utility and long-term sustainability. DeFi has transcended its experimental origins to become a cornerstone of blockchain innovation. By leveraging smart contracts and decentralized infrastructure, it has democratized access to financial services for millions of people worldwide. DeFi isn’t a fringe experiment anymore, but a proven disruptor. In 2021, an estimated 1.4 billion people were unbanked, and another billion were underbanked. DeFi offered a pathway to financial inclusion, enabling users to bypass traditional gatekeepers. Today, stablecoins anchor the market, and DeFi lending platforms, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and staking protocols have changed how capital flows for good. To evaluate the possibility of a DeFi cycle, we need to examine the current market dynamics. The ongoing bull run has seen a resurgence in Bitcoin and large cap asset prices, with total market capitalization exceeding $3 trillion USD. However, DeFi’s growth hinges on more than just market optimism. The rise in DeFi TVL has brought on several new innovative solutions in the market. Among the emerging players shaping this next phase is Nudge, a company introducing a new primitive in the DeFi ecosystem: programmable incentive payments called “nudges.” According to Markus Maier, co-founder of Nudge, “Nudges are programmable incentive payments that allow protocols to pay users for reallocating assets, liquidity, or activity on-chain. Think of it as getting paid—or ‘nudged’—to shift your assets, change to a staking provider, or start using a new Layer 2 solution.” Nudge’s approach, termed “reallocation primitives,” represents a shift in how resources are utilized across DeFi platforms. Users can earn rewards for reallocating their assets while protocols gain measurable and scalable tools for user acquisition and retention. This concept moves beyond traditional token rewards, offering a more targeted and efficient mechanism for ecosystem growth. “The inspiration behind nudges,” Maier adds, “was the crowded landscape of protocols competing for the same pool of users and capital. By enabling users to earn from reallocating their resources, we create new incentives that align their actions with the broader ecosystem’s success.” Other rising players include Convex Finance and Tokemak. Convex Finance, built on top of Curve Finance, enhances yield opportunities for liquidity providers and Curve stakers by streamlining rewards and boosting incentives. Tokemak, on the other hand, serves as a decentralized liquidity provider, optimizing capital deployment across the ecosystem with its unique liquidity reactors. While retail-centric DeFi solutions like Nudge aim to make financial tools more accessible to individual users, there is another category of DeFi applications that focuses on institutional utilities, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. For example, Singapore's Project Guardian explores institutional DeFi by experimenting with tokenized bonds and deposits to assess the potential of decentralized financial infrastructures. Backed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), it aims to integrate tokenized assets with permissioned liquidity pools, providing a secure and scalable blueprint for institutional adoption. One of the critical factors influencing the future of DeFi is regulation. As governments worldwide grapple with the challenges of overseeing decentralized systems, the impact of new policies on DeFi cannot be overstated. Regulatory clarity could either propel DeFi into mainstream adoption or stifle its growth. Recent developments suggest a mixed bag for the industry. The European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)regulation aims to create a comprehensive framework for crypto assets, including DeFi protocols. While this offers a path toward legitimacy, critics argue that overly stringent requirements could hinder innovation. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has ramped up its scrutiny of DeFi platforms, emphasizing the need for compliance with existing securities laws. This has prompted many projects to consider decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structures to navigate regulatory hurdles. "While regulation is necessary, it must be balanced to foster innovation," says Maier. For a more in-depth look at regulatory considerations, I recommend reviewing the Key Elements of an Effective DeFi Framework, published by the Crypto Council of Innovation in which I was a co-author. Here, we have outlined the principles for crafting policies that encourage innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. Several factors could reignite a DeFi cycle in this bull run: “The next DeFi cycle will prioritize utility over hype,” added Maier. While uncertainties around regulation and market sentiment persist, the fundamentals of DeFi remain strong. With innovative platforms like Nudge leading the way and continued advancements in blockchain technology, the stage is set for a potential DeFi resurgence in this bull run. The next few months will be crucial in determining whether DeFi can overcome its challenges and reclaim its position as a driving force in the crypto ecosystem. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: U.S. stocks close mixed as PPI data eases inflation concerns

Wednesday, 15 Jan 2025 NEW YORK, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, after the lower-than-expected U.S. producer price index (PPI) data offered temporary relief to investors concerned about persistent inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 221.16 points, or 0.52 percent, to 42,518.28. The S&P 500 added 6.69 points, or 0.11 percent, to 5,842.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 43.71 points, or 0.23 percent, to 19,044.39. Seven of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with utilities and financials leading the gainers by adding 1.30 percent and 1.28 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, communication services and health led the laggards by dropping 0.97 percent and 0.94 percent, respectively. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' PPI for December 2024 showed a 3.3 percent year-over-year increase, up from November's 3.0 percent but below economists' projections of 3.5 percent. On a monthly basis, PPI rose 0.2 percent, coming in under the forecasted 0.4 percent gain. The core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.5 percent year over year, edging up from November's 3.4 percent but below expectations of a 3.8 percent increase. Month over month, core prices were flat, a marked slowdown from the anticipated 0.3 percent rise and November's 0.2 percent gain. Capital Economics North America economist Thomas Ryan noted the release "seems encouraging" but it also "masks some price jumps in a few of the key components which feed directly into the Fed's preferred core PCE inflation gauge." Notably, domestic and international airfare prices -- which feed into the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index -- jumped in December. Major technology stocks continued their decline on Tuesday, with Nvidia losing 1.1 percent and Apple falling 0.5 percent. Both companies have had a sluggish start to 2025 after the significant gains in 2024. On the bond market front, the U.S. Treasury yields initially dropped following the PPI report. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield on Tuesday settled at 4.793 percent, up 0.6 basis points. Still, markets remain cautious as they await further confirmation from the consumer price index (CPI) report for December 2024, set for release Wednesday morning. Attention is also turning to the start of the fourth-quarter earnings season, with major financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and BlackRock scheduled to release their results on Wednesday.

Title: The Great Retreat: A Eulogy for the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/01/14/the-great-retreat-a-eulogy-for-the-net-zero-asset-managers-initiative/
Time Published: 2025-01-14T22:00:00Z
Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Ladies and gentlemen, gather round for a moment of silence—or perhaps a loud guffaw—for the untimely suspension of the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. Once the darling of “woke capitalism” and self-proclaimed savior of the planet, this alliance of investment giants has decided to fold its tent, apparently under the weight of its own contradictions and a little nudge from reality. An alliance of investment giants-turned-self-styled climate change crusaders looks to be in tatters after it suspended its activities on Monday amid a backlash against “woke” capitalism. The Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative was rocked last week by the exit of BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, as The Post exclusively reported. https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/climate-group-net-zero-asset-managers-suspends-activities-days-after-blackrock-quits/ar-BB1ro5bQ?ocid=msedgntp&pc=U531&cvid=bf7c5905139e48f18d996522bfb69b44&ei=10 NZAM was touted as a coalition of climate-conscious asset managers promising to steer trillions of dollars into sustainable investments. It had all the buzzwords: net zero, decarbonization, stakeholder capitalism. But as we now see, when rhetoric meets resistance, even the mightiest of “green” alliances can crumble. Larry Fink’s BlackRock, managing a modest $11.5 trillion, was the largest player in NZAM. But last week, BlackRock bolted, citing “confusion” over the initiative’s goals and the growing heat from legal and political scrutiny​. Confusion? For a group that allegedly led the charge on climate finance, confusion is an odd defense. But let’s not kid ourselves. The real story here isn’t confusion; it’s the political backlash. Republican lawmakers had been turning up the heat, questioning NZAM’s anti-fossil fuel stance and labeling it as a threat to free-market principles. For a firm like BlackRock, whose fiduciary duty is to maximize returns, the last thing it needed was to be dragged into a legal and political firestorm​. This retreat is about more than one firm’s exit. NZAM’s decision to suspend activities is a tacit admission that its grand vision of global decarbonization through financial engineering was built on a house of cards. It turns out that arm-twisting investors into abandoning fossil fuels—still the lifeblood of modern economies—isn’t as easy as issuing a press release. What NZAM and its allies failed to grasp is that most of the world isn’t ready to trade reliable energy sources for expensive “green” dreams. They didn’t count on a backlash from those who actually like to keep the lights on without bankrupting their economies. This debacle also lays bare the hollowness of so-called woke capitalism. For all the chest-beating about saving the planet, NZAM and its members were quick to run for the exits when the going got tough. They’ve proven that their commitment to climate goals was conditional, a mere marketing gimmick rather than a principled stand. This is a classic case of virtue signaling gone awry. Companies like BlackRock were happy to bask in the glow of green virtue as long as it was profitable—or, at least, painless. But when real-world pressures mounted, from legal inquiries to political challenges, those lofty ideals were quickly jettisoned. NZAM’s suspension underscores the dangers of pushing aggressive, top-down policies without a clear understanding of economic realities or public sentiment. The truth is, the world runs on fossil fuels, and no amount of corporate virtue signaling can change that overnight. Initiatives like NZAM ignore the complexities of global energy needs and the fact that renewables, aren’t ready to replace hydrocarbons on a large scale. Even more damning is how NZAM’s failure exposes the elitist arrogance of the climate crusade. These financial titans thought they could dictate policy from their boardrooms, ignoring the voices of everyday citizens and lawmakers. That hubris has now come back to bite them. The suspension of NZAM is more than just a setback for one initiative—it’s a symbolic defeat for the entire ideology of climate authoritarianism. It’s a reminder that policies based on coercion and moral grandstanding are bound to fail when confronted with economic and political realities. So, let us raise a toast to NZAM, not in mourning but in mockery. Its collapse is a victory for common sense and a warning to all who would attempt to impose utopian visions on a world that isn’t interested. May its demise serve as a lesson to the climate cartel: the road to net zero is paved with good intentions—and bankrupt ideologies. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

There are 3 USA banks left in the UN NZ alliance: per this list: Amalgamated Bank Areti Bank Climate First Bank https://www.unepfi.org/members/ And anyone in the USA should avoid these remaining woke banks. Your number of 700 surpasses the 538 listed in all counties, all industries in all finance initiatives. 700 is correct for GFANZ, the parent organization for NZAM. There are GFANZ member firms in 50 nations. Major US banks and corporations are increasingly cautious about antagonizing the incoming administration and are withdrawing from climate-focused initiatives. If you read the bank press releases, as I have and you have not, they sound very woke and suggest the banks will continue their alternate anergy lending after they leave the GFANZ coalition. This article is about asset managers in NZAM. There is no indication they have changed their strategies about investing in alternative energy stocks and bonds. RG, dunno where you are coming from but it is nowhere I would want to be. Fact. There are exactly three maJor global asset managers. Two have now left. You count the other about 700 midgets as important, you have already lost. Pathetic. Only one left matters. the only interesting remaining question is what will State Street do? They are based in Boston, so is a big blue state question. I bet you they also fold very soon. You apparently love the article’s Eulogy conclusion so much that you do not care that there is ZERO evidence that any financial firms have changed their policies on alternative energy lending and investments. Their recent actions seem like virtue signaling for Trump. They still say they support Net Zero or the Energy transition. I want logical conclusions backed by data. You prefer conservative wishful thinking These withdrawals are the result of unjustified political pressure by Republicans BlackRock Exits Major Climate Group Amid Wall Street Exodus – Asian Wealth Management and Asian Private Banking NZAM has recently suspende activities bur GFANZ has not. It remains to be seen if NZAM will disband. GFANZ and NZAM seemed like leftist public relations non-profit NGOs. They did not do anything else I can find. Corrections This article was about NZAM with over 325 members as of July 2024 NZAM (Net Zero Asset Managers initiative) is directly related to GFANZ (Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero) as NZAM is one of the several alliances under the GFANZ umbrella, meaning it is a part of a larger group focused on achieving net-zero emissions across the financial sector, with NZAM specifically focusing on asset managers committed to net-zero goals; I had just read another article about the GFANZ. a Net Zero alliance. As of 2024, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) had over 700 members. GFANZ is a coalition of financial institutions that work together to help the world transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. The Global Net Zero Financial Cartel, Falling Apart — Manhattan Contrarian There are no data to know whether being in these voluntary organizations really affected financial decisions concerning alternative energy, or getting out of them changed those policies. “A Eulogy” in the article title is speculation unsupported by any data (aka BS). “ GFANZ is a coalition of financial institutions that work together to help the world transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. ” Well, as THAT will never be achieved, folks should have nothing to do with placing any money there.

The tragedy of the LA fires is a reflection of damage caused by false Climate Change practices. Actually, is it is a clear example of what happens when money that should be devoted to maintaining a safe and secure society, is squandered in pursuit of false goals/ideals based of flawed understanding of reality. The usual candidates are already stepping forward to present themselves as ‘experts’ claiming the LA tragedy of political incompetence, owes its origin to the human impact on climate conditions. Those experts could not be more wrong. Thank you Mr Mann. Today, a group of active political thinkers and activists will be meeting for our monthly review of current activities/events in one of our favourite drinking dens. There, we will be raising our glasses to the news, financial investment businesses have turned the page on ESG and are increasingly recognising their Net Zero folly. The worry for all of us is, how did these mega companies, responsible for guarding and investing our pensions and other investments fall for the Greta based nonsense in the first place? Its Davos next week, there the World’s movers and shakers have got to finally break away from this Climate Crisis nonsense. It is well past time to start back towards sustainable wealth creation rather than wealth destruction. The LA fires are a clear example of the damage caused when those in the highest public office fail to do the job they are in place to do. Those officials that spend their time on virtue signalling, (Gavin) rubbing along with their Hollywood heroes can now walk a mile in their hero’s shoes and smell the acrid smoke of their achievements. With luck, tomorrow they might wake up and smell the coffee. “It’s Davos next week…” It’d be nice if someone posted videos of the talks at Davos, also a list of the attendees. After what I’ve read about the past conferences I’d love to hear what the in-crowd are planning. Until the next ideology comes along and captures their interest.

Title: Is UnitedHealth (UNH) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Safe Dividend Stocks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stands against other best safe dividend stocks for 2025. The year 2024 was exceptional for US stocks, with the broader market climbing over 23% and the tech-focused NASDAQ gaining 29%. These impressive results were driven by the “Magnificent 7” group of stocks, which rose nearly 67%, alongside several other large-cap stocks. It marked the second consecutive year of over 20% gains for the broader market, a feat not seen since the late 1990s. Analysts and investors are optimistic about the market’s future, as 2024 demonstrated remarkable strength, suggesting the positive trend could continue. However, despite the current upbeat outlook, investor sentiment could shift quickly due to factors such as global tensions, economic developments, or unforeseen events. No matter how the market trends, investors tend to gravitate towards safe stocks that offer stability, particularly during challenging times. Among these secure investment choices, dividend stocks are especially favored. These stocks are typically issued by companies with a reliable history of consistent dividend payments, often from well-established sectors such as utilities, consumer goods, or healthcare. READ ALSO: 10 Best Dividend Kings Stocks to Invest in Now Historical analysis consistently shows that dividend stocks tend to outperform other asset classes across various market cycles. A report by T. Rowe Price highlighted that since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns for US stocks. From 1980 to 2019, a period marked by a significant decline in interest rates, dividends contributed to 75% of the returns from the broader market. The report further mentioned that dividends become especially valuable in a low-interest-rate environment, offering a steady cash flow when other fixed-income options are less attractive. Once companies start paying dividends, they rarely stop, and most increase their payouts over time. Paying dividends can make a stock more appealing to investors, potentially boosting its value. Over the last decade, dividends for the benchmark index have grown annually, with an average compound growth rate of just over 7%. In strong markets, dividends have enhanced total returns, while in years with low or negative returns, such as 2020 and 2022, dividends played a larger role in total returns, helping to bolster portfolio resilience. Regarding the safety of dividend stocks, analysts recommend that investors prioritize dividend growth rather than chasing yield traps. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar’s Index team, stressed the importance of focusing on dividend growth, highlighting that it is a distinct strategy from high-dividend investing. He explained that dividend growth reflects a company’s strong competitive position and positive future prospects. A dividend growth portfolio tends to align more closely with the overall market in terms of sector distribution and growth versus value characteristics, such as price-to-earnings ratios. While it has a value-oriented approach, it is more balanced and core-focused compared to a high-dividend portfolio. Companies with a history of consistently raising their dividends have typically outperformed those that don’t pay dividends, all while experiencing less volatility. While dividends are not guaranteed and can fluctuate, especially in the current environment, they have played a substantial role in enhancing overall equity returns over the years. For this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 to find stocks with sustainable payout ratios popular among hedge funds. Our focus was on companies that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders. From this initial selection, we narrowed down the list to include only those companies with a 5-year average payout ratio below 60%, indicating a robust cash position. Subsequently, we identified the top 10 companies meeting these criteria and arranged them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that held stakes in each of them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112 5-Year Average Payout Ratio: 33.15% UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is a Minnesota-based health insurance company. It boasts a solid dividend track record. It began distributing annual dividends in 1990 and transitioned to quarterly payments in 2010. Since that shift, the company has consistently increased its dividend each year, earning it a spot as one of the best dividend stocks on our list. Its quarterly dividend comes in at $2.10 per share for a dividend yield of 1.55%, as of January 13. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) has surged by over 4% in the past 12 months. In the third quarter of 2024, the company delivered strong earnings, with revenue reaching $100.8 billion, a 9.16% increase compared to the same period last year. Its domestic commercial services saw significant growth, gaining 2.4 million new customers this year. For the full year 2024, net earnings are projected to be between $15.50 and $15.75 per share, taking into account the sale of its South American operations earlier in the year and the impact of the Change Healthcare cyberattack. PGIM Jennison Health Sciences Fund highlighted UNH in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is the largest health care services company in the U.S. The company offers healthcare benefits to Americans who receive insurance from employers or government-based programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Half of the company is represented from non-benefits businesses under the Optum umbrella. This includes a technology business that helps hospitals, pharma companies, and other payors. It also includes a fast-growing provider business where Optum owns surgery centers and urgent care centers. The company’s primary care business continues to grow and it’s participating in the emerging trend of primary care taking on risk and acting like an insurance company. Finally, UnitedHealth owns a drug benefits manager. The company continues to have high quality and well-positioned businesses. In the first half of ’24, UnitedHealth has beat earnings expectations and confirmed full year financial guidance. While medical costs have pressured results, the company has cut a lot of spending to support earnings. We have also seen volatility in the stock related to political dynamics; a view that Republicans are better for this group helped support the stock in June and July and a moderation in policy views from the democratic nominee also helped support the stock. Future catalysts for the company and the stock include potentially stabilizing cost trend, a calmer political environment, and visibility into the company’s long-term earnings growth targets.” According to Insider Monkey’s database of Q3 2024, 112 hedge funds owned stakes in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared with 114 in the preceding quarter. These stakes are valued at over $15 billion in total. Overall, UNH ranks 3rd on our list of best safe dividend stocks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential for UNH to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Departure of potential Fink successor creates new CEO drama at BlackRock
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/departure-of-potential-fink-successor-creates-new-ceo-drama-at-blackrock-205206725.html
Time Published: 2025-01-14T20:52:06Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A potential successor to BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink is reportedly leaving, narrowing the list of contenders to become the next boss of the world's largest money manager. Mark Wiedman, who is a head of BlackRock’s global client business and member of the firm’s global executive committee, has chosen to pursue opportunities outside of the firm, according to a report from the Financial Times. For years, investors have been wondering when the 72-year-old Fink is going to step down. He co-founded the firm in 1988 and built it into a financial giant that manages $11 trillion. Wiedman was viewed as among the likely contenders to succeed Fink, along with chief operating officer Rob Goldstein, chief financial officer Martin Small, and BlackRock International head Rachel Lord. Another recent high-profile exit of a potential Fink successor was Salim Ramji, who is now the chief executive of BlackRock rival Vanguard Group. The FT report about Wiedman’s departure comes just ahead of BlackRock's release of fourth quarter 2024 earnings on Wednesday morning. BlackRock is not the only Wall Street giant that generated some new succession drama on Tuesday. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) on Tuesday elevated Jennifer Piepszak to chief operating officer as part of a new management reshuffling, but the nation’s largest bank said that Piepszak doesn’t want to succeed Jamie Dimon as CEO. The shake-up adds new uncertainty to the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO and the only one left who called the shots during the 2008 financial crisis. Piepszak had previously been considered one of the frontrunners to get Dimon’s job eventually. At BlackRock, Wiedman oversaw the money manager’s efforts to assist governments and financial institutions with their troubled assets during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Wiedman also led BlackRock’s iShares ETF business as it grew from $500 billion to $1.7 trillion in assets under management. His exit comes as the money manager makes a deeper push into alternative assets with three recent acquisitions. In December it made a $12 billion bet on HPS Investment Partners, a firm run by three ex-employees of Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) that specializes in lending money to riskier companies. Earlier in 2024 it agreed to buy London data provider Preqin for $3.2 billion and private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners for about $12.5 billion. The purchase of Global Infrastructure Partners, which closed in October, was a bet on growing demand for new energy, transportation, and digital infrastructure projects in the coming years. BlackRock is also trying to stay out of the hot seat in Washington as the GOP takes over the White House and all of Congress. At the end of last week, BlackRock pulled out of a UN-supported climate group known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). It also was granted more time to resolve a standoff with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) over its holdings of US banks, ensuring that the dispute will now play out in the opening months of Trump 2.0.

Title: BlackRock expected to post booming earnings — as Larry Fink’s firm shifts from woke investing of past

If you haven’t noticed, BlackRock — yes, that BlackRock — is going unwoke. It’s also going far from broke, On The Money has learned. Wednesday before the bell, the big-money management firm, the world largest in fact, will report both its fourth quarter earnings and those for the entire year. Both are likely to depict that its business is running at full tilt, my sources on Wall Street tell me. Confluence doesn’t necessarily equate concurrence, of course. But it’s remarkably obvious that at a time when BlackRock has dialed back its overt progressive posturing — leaving, as the Post reported last week, a UN-sponsored group of environmental activists — its financial performance is soaring, at least according to the Wall Street buzz. One major reason: The heat from conservative critics for its so-called ESG investing has waned as it stepped back from being a staunch advocate of the woke investing strategy. Red State treasurers still look at BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink with skepticism, but these days less so, and they’ve largely stopped castigating him as a woke monster. They have also largely stopped pulling money from the firm as he stopped going all in on woke. By focusing less on political issues and more on business, BlackRock is flourishing. Its assets under management are slated to spike to above $11.5 trillion even as recent higher interest rates will hurt its fixed income holdings. Its earnings, analysts say, should be strong despite the rise in rates because of its diversified business. At a time when big asset managers are facing pressure from customers over fees, etc,, and facing customer outflows, BlackRock last year received a ton of new money from a wide diversity of sources, such as pension funds and individuals, sources said. And BlackRock is killing it on crypto. Look at a list of top Bitcoin holders, and in a short period of time, BlackRock – -a symbol of so-called “trad fit” or traditional finance — is at the top, just behind the iconic Satoshi Nakamoto, and crypto exchange Binance. As of January, it holds around 560,000 bitcoins worth around $55 billion in the most popular digital coin because it offers the most popular Bitcoin ETF. The ETF inflows have been steady, as the earnings report will demonstrate, sources said. BlackRock declined to comment for this report because it cannot provide pre-earnings forward guidance, but my sources insist that it will be a hard-earned victory for Fink. Yes, I know, Fink says a lot of stuff — some of which has gotten him in trouble in his advocacy of Environmental Social Governance investing. The investment style, his critics alleged, channeled progressive politics on issues like energy conservation through the investment process. In recent years, he earned the ire of the both Red State GOP-run pension funds, and Republicans in Congress even as he won plaudits from the political left for using BlackRock’s investment might to enact social change. But with the growth of Red State populations and their pension funds, Fink’s ESG posturing was costly; assets declined around $1 trillion in 2022. I know Fink better than his critics, and the caricature of him being an Elizabeth Warren acolyte is simply false. Fink started BlackRock 30 years ago with zero assets and he didn’t build it to $11.5-plus trillion on left wing politics. He’s among the best risk managers on Wall Street, gleaned from years of experience trading bonds, and learning from his losses, as so many in his position haven’t, which is why at 72 he’s still kicking as CEO. I have reported that he went too far out on the limb of ESG because of the money. He was able to get plenty of left-wing pension business in New York and California. But as far back as 2021 he sensed a problem with it and was calling for a sustainability transition or there will be less oil drilling and inflation. He’s been moving away from ESG ever since, degrading its screens in managing non-ESG related assets. As I exclusively reported, he ditched a key UN-backed asset-management group last week dedicated to reducing carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Now here’s something interesting: In Red-State political circles, critics of Fink may still call him. “Mr ESG.” A newer younger generation of investors call him “Mr. Bitcoin” — despite him once calling the digital token an “index of money laundering.” He realized his mistake and launched the Bitcoin ETF almost exactly a year ago in January 2024. It’s up nearly 125% since. So when you wake up Wednesday, I hear BlackRock will be touting its strong results. Fink, I’m sure, will be taking a victory lap on financial TV. He should because there’s no coincidence that as he and the firm went unwoke, they moved about as far from broke as you can imagine. Advertisement

Title: Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg and biz leaders choose Trump inauguration over World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland

Billionaire business leaders who want bragging rights usually flock to the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland — but this year it’s being overshadowed by Donald Trump’s inauguration. The Swiss forum kicks off on the same day the 47th president will be sworn in, Jan. 20, and regulars including Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, and Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi will all be in Washington, DC for Trump, according to insiders. Sources close to the new administration say it’s an indication political events — and President Trump’s actions — are far more significant to US businesses and leaders than anything in the Swiss Alps could be. “It’s unfortunate timing for Davos,” one source said of the event, which runs until Jan. 24. “If you’re a business leader, your time is better spent at the receptions meeting the people who will drive policy in the US, where you are talking about business and trade and ripple effects across the pond.” A well-placed venture capitalist helping craft Trump’s tech policy told NYNext that for the first time in years, “I don’t know anyone going to Davos.” Davos attracts important businesspeople, lawmakers, presidents and policy makers from around the globe to debate the largest problems humanity faces, but it is often labelled elitist, too woke and a place where there is much talk but little action. “Davos is an irrelevant, elitist money grab,” angel investor and co-host of the All-In podcast Jason Calacanis told NYNext. “Builders don’t waste time and money on virtual signaling nonsense like that.” CEOs are instead betting time with Trump, 78, at the inauguration will be better for business. Since Trump’s election last November, CEOs have been falling over themselves to win him over — some even after years of antagonizing the Republican leader. Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai have each donated $1 million to the Inaugural fund in an effort to show new support for Trump and to get themselves plugged into the new administration. So many people are eager to donate the incoming president has raised a record $170 million — almost triple the $62 million Joe Biden raised for his inaugural fund. Many of these companies, including Amazon and Uber, are also hosting parties around Jan. 20th in an effort to reach the rank-and-file staffers on Trump’s team as well. (Tech sources note the most important party for them is Peter Thiel’s party on Saturday night). The split in attendance underscores the larger trend of Silicon Valley embracing Donald Trump, while Wall Street has remained largely quiet. On Wall Street, which has remained a stronghold for Democrats, most bank executives are expected to stick to their usually scheduled programming and spend the entire week in Davos, with world leaders. “They need international friends because they don’t have friends in this government,” a regular at Davos, who is instead attending the Inauguration this year, joked of the Wall Street CEOs headed to Davos. Jamie Dimon — who had been secretly communicating with Trump about economic policy during the campaign and, at one point, was even floated as a possible Treasury Secretary — is headed straight to Davos, NYNext has learned. Other bank CEOs, like Goldman Sachs’ David Solomon, are expected to make a pit stop in DC over the weekend before arriving in Davos by the 20th, sources told NYNext. BlackRock, which has recently moved away from its emphasis on ESG over and even exited a climate initiative with the United Nation, is sending a senior delegation of top executives to the Inauguration led by BlackRock co-founder Rob Kapito, sources told The Post. CEO Larry Fink has yet to decide if he will attend. At least one world leader, Argentina’s President Javier Milei, is expected to attend the Inauguration then jet to Davos the next day – which is turning out to be a popular method. “People are trying to do both,” one Wall Street source explained. “But people can prioritize Inauguration weekend and still get to Davos.” While Davos remains focused on issues like climate and “amplifying perspectives from indigenous communities,” over the last year its programming has also shifted marginally towards the center of the political spectrum. Last year, The Post reported climate activist poster woman Greta Thunberg — a notable fixture at the conference in recent years — did not make an appearance at the event. Instead, panels focused more on technology and the impact of artificial intelligence.

Plus, A Q&A with ‘Inner Excellence’ Author, The Pentagon Is Using AI As Part of Security Clearance Investigations and Top Career Crashes and Comebacks of 2024 in this week’s Careers newsletter. This is a published version of Forbes’ Careers Newsletter. Click here to subscribe and get it in your inbox every Tuesday. Workers in 21 states started the new year with an increase in hourly and salaried wages, thanks in part of inflation raises and successful ballot measures. Is it too late to wish everyone a happy new year? We’re back this week after taking a short holiday vacation and have a newsletter filled with the biggest work-related news to kick off the year. (And if you’re struggling to get back into the flow of work, senior contributor Jack Kelly has some great tips on how to ease back in.) The start of 2025 brings some good news for workers in many U.S. states: Minimum wages rose in 21 states and Washington, D.C. at the start of the year, giving 9.2 million workers $5.7 billion in additional earnings, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. This marks one of the largest-ever state minimum wage increases in recent U.S. history. But while the hikes are a result of successful ballot measures to raise state wage floors, the federal minimum wage remains at $7.25 an hour and has not increased since 2009. Several other cities and municipalities—predominantly in California, Colorado and Washington—are raising their hourly minimums above state floors. Workers in Tukwila, Washington will have the highest minimum hourly wage this year at $21.10 an hour. Other cities, like New York, are raising their minimum overtime exemption pay for salaried employees. The new year also welcomes new pay transparency laws in five states: Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey and Vermont. In total, 14 states, Washington D.C. and several city or county jurisdictions require employers to publish salary ranges with job postings. Pay transparency requirements have gained popularity in recent years and have largely been pushed through by local jurisdictions. A federal bill on the matter was introduced to Congress in 2023.

Watch out for ghost jobs, a lack of feedback and intense competition as you start your job search. If one of your New Year’s resolutions was to read more, you may want to take inspiration from Philadelphia Eagles player A.J. Brown. The wide receiver was photographed reading a book called “Inner Excellence” on the sidelines of Sunday’s playoff game (which the team won). The book, written by Jim Murphy, has topped Amazon’s best seller’s list since Monday. I sat down with Murphy to speak about the new eyes in his book, what inner excellence is really about, and what everyone—from football players to desk workers—can take away from its message. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Jim, let’s start from the top. What is “inner excellence”? Well, it’s really about being clear about what you want most. It’s about asking yourself, “Why am I doing this? Why am I working? Like, what do I really want?” Because especially in America, there is this huge obsession about achievement, getting more financially successful and getting a better house, etc. Or this obsession with making more money and taking more trips to Europe. There’s this obsession with that. But why is it like this? So it’s really about the journey to the destination and not the achievement itself. Yes. Your own personal experience is coming from being and working with professional athletes. How can those who work traditional 9-to-5s also achieve this inner excellence? The thesis of the book really is that self-centeredness is the biggest challenge we face in performance and in life. It leads to fear, because your subconscious knows in your heart it’s what’s running your life. And it knows every weakness, every failure. And so when you think about yourself, it reminds yourself of that. So then you start to compare yourself to others and feel bad, then you get stressed and anxious. Whereas when you’re performing your best at anything, all of us, whether it’s you for a deadline or me coaching, or A.J. Brown catching footballs, we’re our best when there’s no thoughts about self. That’s what inner excellence is about, is how you get to be fully alive and then everything in your life expands and improves. So how do you achieve it? The number one goal every day is to learn and grow. Within that are the four daily goals. Number one is to give your best shot every day. Give a hundred percent of what you have today. It’s also really important to realize you’re not gonna be your best all the time, and that’s okay. That’s life. You don’t need to be at your best. We just want to give the best of what you have. Some days you’re only gonna have 50% give, so give a hundred percent of that 50. Number two is to be present. When you’re fully present, there’s no fear. There’s no past or future. There’s no self concern, no self-protection. So inner excellence is really about mastering the ego, pursuing what you really want and the person you’re meant to become. So you can live a life fully engaged heart, mind, body, independent of your result and circumstances. Number three is gratitude, which is directly linked to inner peace, inner strength and mental toughness. To improve your gratitude, we wanna look for three small moments every day. The smallest moments to train your subconscious to have more gratitude. And number four is to focus on your routines and only what you can control. The book’s latest version was published five years ago. How was it finding out about this viral moment that led to so many people buying a copy this week? So it’s interesting. I’m in downtown Dallas on Sunday, and I don’t know anyone here except for my clients, and I haven’t seen them yet. So I’m looking at this skyscraper and I’m all by myself, kind of lonely, and I look up at it and I was like, “huh, would I trade owning that skyscraper for having understood and written my second book?” And I thought I wouldn’t. So really putting the Inner Excellence thinking into practice. I hadn’t watched the [Eagles versus Packers] game yet, and then all these messages started coming into my phone and then everything unfolded.

Title: The race to succeed Larry Fink just got a little more interesting as a top contender exits BlackRock
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-mark-wiedman-larry-fink-succession-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-14T20:07:56Z
Full Content:
A top BlackRock executive, Mark Wiedman, who was considered a prospective successor to CEO Larry Fink, is leaving the world's largest asset manager, a person familiar with the matter said. Wiedman, who most recently led BlackRock's global client business, was one of two senior executives that insiders at the $11.5 trillion firm considered most likely to replace Fink, Business Insider previously reported. Wiedman, 54, has chosen to pursue opportunities outside the firm and plans to stay on through the spring, the person familiar with the matter said. A veteran of BlackRock who has been with the firm for two decades, Wiedman joined from the US Treasury Department and rose up the ranks. He was responsible for the integration and growth of its exchange-traded-fund business, iShares, and helped establish FMA, the firm's influential consulting arm. The Financial Times earlier reported his planned departure. Fink, who turned 72 in November, had a blockbuster 2024, announcing three big acquisitions in hopes of bringing BlackRock closer to dominating the world of private markets. In December, BlackRock said it was set to buy HPS Investment Partners, a private-credit behemoth managing $148 billion. Fink, who cofounded BlackRock in 1988, has been more vocal over the past year about the firm's growth plans than about whom he plans to pass the business on to. But he previously said that he had "no higher pri­or­ity" than put­ting together a team to replace him­ and Rob Kapito, Black­Rock's pres­id­ent. The news of Wiedman's exit comes a day before BlackRock is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings. Rob Goldstein, the firm's chief operating officer, along with Wiedman, has been named as a prospective successor to Fink. Other names in the mix have included Martin Small, the chief financial officer and global head of corporate strategy, Rachel Lord, the head of international, and Stephen Cohen, who was promoted to chief product officer last year. Last January, Salim Ramji, another executive considered a prospective successor, left and joined Vanguard as its chief executive in July. Wiedman's exit will likely be seen internally as a surprise. Rebecca Ungarino reported for BI in January 2024 that it had "always been Weidman" at the front of the race. A person familiar with the matter told her: "Now, it's hard to predict when a transition may happen. The senior-most officers of the firm thought the transition would have taken place awhile ago. Larry is definitely taking his sweet time." Jump to

(Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s senior executive Mark Wiedman, who was touted to be a potential successor to CEO Larry Fink, is departing the firm, said two sources familiar with the matter. Wiedman will leave in the spring, said the sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity. One of the sources said Wiedman is leaving to pursue other opportunities. The departure is friendly and on good terms, the source said. Wiedman's departure, reported by the Financial Times earlier on Tuesday, comes a year after another executive, Salim Ramji, left BlackRock in January 2024 and went on to become the CEO of asset management company Vanguard Group, which was announced in May 2024. Ramji was also once touted to be a potential successor to Fink. BlackRock declined to comment when asked for more information. Wiedman, who was the head of global client business at BlackRock in his most recent role, held several key positions at the company since he joined in 2004 from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). He was one of the key figures in the asset manager's push towards a low carbon economy, helping sustainable investments grow from $107 billion to $1 trillion, according to the company website. He also acted as the global head of iShares and Index investments, between 2011 and 2019, which grew from $500 billion to $1.7 trillion. The departure comes as the company's assets grew to record highs in 2024 and after large acquisitions last year aimed at increasing BlackRock's footprint in private credit and infrastructure. BlackRock is due to report its 2024 fourth-quarter financial results on Wednesday.

Wiedman, head of the global client business for the past two years, was believed to be a potential successor to Chief Executive Larry Fink. Wiedman was instrumental in driving BlackRock's growth in passive investing. From 2011 to 2019, he led BlackRock's exchange-traded and index strategies while assets under management in the business increased from $500 billion to $1.7 trillion. He joined BlackRock in 2004 to oversee the firm's emergency assistance to governments and financial institutions during the financial crisis. BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager with assets under management hitting a record $11.5 trillion in the fourth quarter. The firm made two big acquisitions last year in a push to expand in private credit and alternatives. In December, the financial firm agreed to buy HPS Investment Partners for $12 billion in stock, as BlackRock looks to grow its presence in the highly popular private credit space. BlackRock also acquired Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure investor, for $12.5 billion last year. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Adebayo “Bayo” Ogunlesi, a senior managing director at BlackRock and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure investing platform, has joined OpenAI’s board, OpenAI announced on Tuesday. In a statement, OpenAI board chairman Bret Taylor said that Ogunlesi has “an exceptional track record of driving success in organizations with global reach, expertly navigating complex, and dynamic commercial landscapes.” Ogunlesi spent 23 years at financial services company Credit Suisse, where he held several positions, including executive vice chairman of Credit Suisse’s investment banking division. Previously, Ogunlesi was an attorney with the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, and served as a law clerk to Thurgood Marshall, the nation’s first Black U.S. Supreme Court Justice. Ogunlesi also sits on the boards of BlackRock, Topgolf Callaway Brands, Kosmos Energy Holdings, and Terminal Investment Limited. “The rapid advancement and development of AI offers a unique opportunity to build a better future. As part of this, thoughtful strategies and investment in infrastructure will be key to unlocking AI’s full potential and delivering its benefits responsibly,” Ogunlesi said in a press release. “I’m excited to contribute to this effort and look forward to being a part of the OpenAI board.” OpenAI’s current board bares little resemblance to its board in late 2023, the members of which fired CEO Sam Altman only to reinstate him days later. As a condition for returning, Altman demanded a remade board — and he eventually got his wish. OpenAI’s board today includes Taylor, Altman, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former NSA director Paul M. Nakasone, former Sony Corporation of America President Nicole Seligman, Instacart CEO Fidji Simo, economist Larry Summers, and Carnegie Mellon computer scientist Zico Kolter.

Title: Jim Cramer on Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR): ‘It Just Gets Better And Better And Butt Better’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 21 Stocks As Bond Yields Soared. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In a recent episode of CNBC's Squawk On The Street, Jim Cramer started out by commenting on quantum computing stocks. These stocks rose to new highs after the announcement of the Willow quantum computing chip by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. He mentioned a quote by AI CEO Jensen Huang about quantum computing. According to Cramer, "The quote previous to that was really enlightening too. I mean just as this. And this [quantum computing] only works for small form factor. And it's used microwave. The large form factor, which by the way is, automatic driving and robots, it doesn't work. So not only is it later, but it's not useful. And, he also said that we work with a CPU, not GPU. That would be like that Intel engine and it's much too slow." Cramer continued to blast quantum computing stocks. According to him, the "QTUM ETF that has almost no quantum computing, it's been bid up. I mean they really are David, I mean, I'm not saying they are necessarily fraudulent. Because Willow, which is a project of Google, is pretty good. And Amazon was working on a program to help quantum developers." Likening the quantum computing stocks to an illusory phenomenon, he commented "But frankly, I'm going to use the word chimerical, in the sense that these companies, none of these companies, have much in terms of revenue. . . .But they're all losing a lot of money, and it was the type of thing you see at the beginning of the year, we're also seeing it in nuclear, another area that's chimerical. And I think that it has to be watched out before we can go higher." As a result, Cramer shared "I think that people should sell those stocks and lock in their gains." Quantum computing isn't the only sector on his radar though. Another sector in Cramer's crosshairs was nuclear power. He believes that firms can't build nuclear power plants "fast enough, and they're very expensive and the overruns are ridiculous. So we have to clear out the nuke and we have to clear out this ridiculous stuff when it comes to quantum." Since treasury yields were rising during the start of the day, they didn't miss Cramer's attention either. He shared the trend of the rising yields and started with the futures. The futures were up during Frank Holland's show. Which is the five o'clock show," he stated. Cramer added "Okay so, then we had the rates right where they are. And then somehow, between four thirty and six, the rates skyrocketed! And then after the ADP they went lower." He believes that excessive attention on the yields is equivalent to being "worse than the analysts that are telling you to sell" the world's leading GPU designer. Another player that has shaped the market for two years now is the Federal Reserve. The Fed caused quite a bit of turmoil in mid-December after its paring back of expected 2025 interest rate cuts to two from four hit stocks hard. Now, with the labor market being as strong as ever, investors are wary of getting even one rate cut in the first half of 2025. Cramer commented on the Fed's Christopher Waller and shared that "He ought to take a vacation. Why do these guys have to talk every minute? I mean what good are they doing to the chairman? The chairman ought to say, hey guys, go speak at the Rotary Club and address what I think is the biggest problem of youth." The CNBC host also mentioned the ongoing and devastating wildfires in California. Cramer stressed that these are not ordinary wildfires. Recalling his days as a news reporter he shared: "When I covered homicides and fires when I was a reporter in LA, I was living in my car so I was kind of uniquely able to cover any fire very quickly. And I was on one side of the interstate five where it's just north of I-10. And it was five lanes, five lanes at the time and I was on the side that was away from Beverly Hills. And the chief at the time said to me, don't worry we're safe here. Because it's never jumped I-5. And then I saw like Santa Anna winds, it jumped I-5, ten lanes at the time, just jumped it. And I looked at him, and I said what do we do? And he said, it's every man for himself. And we tore. . . .I mean it really, it's so frightening. Because it can leap. People think it's static. And when it comes, it explodes, where it's crackling. It does not light up and burn. It explodes! So that's what we're dealing with." He added "I just want people to know that this is not a fire where there's coming down. This is a fire where you don't know where it's gonna go. And it can go a hundred yards." As for the bond yields, Cramer hinted that they might drop in the future. According to him "A lot of the people that I deal with in the bond market are kind of salivating over the idea that maybe we do get a 5% on a ten year.

So if people think that it's just, there's just going to be an overshoot be aware that there will be some real demand." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired last Wednesday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:PLTR) is a data analytics company that has been one of the hottest stocks in 2024. Its shares gained more than 350% in 2024 on the back of several catalysts. These include double-digit revenue growth in several quarters in the US commercial market and investor hopes about Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) being able to provide the US government with AI services. Cramer has been a fan of the stock in his recent appearances, and he has repeatedly talked about CEO Alex Carp. Here's what he said: "Palantir being the nearest one that Cathie Wood's been an aggressive seller at Ark. She'd been a big believer. I got the Alex Carp biography yesterday. It turned out to be 37 pages. I got to get the different one. There's like three of them. Overall PLTR ranks 13th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is JD.com, Inc. (JD) Top Stock Pick in Billionaire George Soros’ Portfolio?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) stands against other top stock picks in Billionaire George Soros' portfolio. When it comes to financial lore, you’d struggle to find an investor who is as controversial as George Soros. With a net worth of $7.2 billion, Soros has made a name for himself by correctly spotting market trends, which has led to millions, if not billions, of dollars in strategic savings or profits. He cemented his reputation in financial legend, for instance, when he famously shorted the British pound in 1992 and made off with $1 billion profit in a single day. Soros is also known for overseeing the Quantum Fund, which from 1970 to 2000 produced an outstanding average yearly return of 30%. Having founded his hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, back in the 1970s, Soros’ investment philosophy is centered around his concept of “reflexivity”. Soros believes that players in the market can influence the market themselves, causing feedback loops that can cause price deviations. The investor makes use of this idea to single out mispricings in the market to create returns. The best application for this concept is during economic bubbles. According to Soros, “When I see a bubble forming, I rush in to buy, adding fuel to the fire”. Of course, that doesn’t mean one can always hit the bullseye; we saw this during the dot-com era almost 25 years ago where Soros admitted to being beaten by billions of dollars in losses. Soros Fund Management’s 13F portfolio contained $6.92 billion in securities as of September 30, up from $5.56 billion a quarter earlier. About 9.8% and 7.4% of those securities were in the technology and services sectors, respectively, down from 11.7% and 10.6% from the quarter prior. Healthcare, basic materials, and financials also constituted a sizable portion of the fund’s portfolio as of the third quarter of 2024. It’s no surprise to anyone who has followed George Soros over the years that the billionaire has a certain disdain for artificial intelligence. Soros claims that the technology poses a significant threat, especially to what he calls “open societies”, simply because AI can not only produce instruments of surveillance, but it can also be liable in its misuse. In Soros’ ideal world, AI regulations would have to be globally enforceable, though he admits that such a dream might not be realized because of the dynamics of governance across the globe. In a MarketWatch article from 2023, Soros outlined some of his thoughts regarding the technology. Here’s what he wrote: “We, human beings, are both participants and observers in the world in which we live. As participants we want to change the world in our favor; as observers we want to understand reality as it is. These two objectives interfere with each other. I regard this as an important insight which allows me to distinguish between right and wrong. For this article we scanned Soros Fund Management’s Q3 portfolio and chose its top 10 stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the fund’s stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide and imposing view of a supply chain distribution center, illustrating the company's technology capabilities. Soros Fund Management’s stake as of Q3: $109.2 million JD.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) is a leading Chinese e-commerce company that specializes in computers and other electronic products, all the while operating as a supply chain-focused tech provider. Making use of its logistics network, JD.com has secured its position as a key player in China’s online retail market. The company’s leadership in China’s 2025 national trade-in program is expected to drive notable growth, with Citi affirming a Buy rating on the JD stock alongside a price target of $51, signaling decent potential upside. The 2025 trade-in initiative, launched on January 1, reaches more than 90% of China’s counties and rural areas. Citi believes that JD’s strong supply chain, omni-channel strategy, and partnerships with provinces like Jiangsu can position the company as a preferred partner for local governments. In the fiscal third-quarter of 2024, JD.com Inc. (NASDAQ:JD) reported a 48% year-over-year surge in net profit to $1.62 billion, driven by a 5.1% revenue increase to $260.39 billion. The company’s largest revenue segment, Retail sales, also grew by 6.1%, while logistics sales jumped by 7.9%. Overall, JD ranks 6th on our list of top stock picks in Billionaire George Soros' portfolio. While we acknowledge the potential of JD, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: What Would Be Worse Than Death To TikTok? Elon Musk Buying It!
URL: https://www.wonkette.com/p/what-would-be-worse-than-death-to
Time Published: 2025-01-14T19:01:23Z
Full Content:
Anybody else sad about a potential TikTok ban? Just me? Love the platform, it brings back memories of having cable television and flipping channels for hours. I downloaded it to make sure the children were not showing too much front or back cleavage on there while they recorded themselves doing the floss-dance, and now I use it more than they do. I’ve discovered artists I never would have (Doechii!), learned to fix food I never would otherwise (cucumber salads!) and there’s good news content on there too (Under The Desk!) Anyway, the TikTok ban from app stores is set to take effect Sunday, and UGH, Bloomberg has reported that no grosser of an oligarch than Elon Musk is wanting to buy it, which would be the only thing worse than it disappearing from app stores on Sunday. Just what the world needs, another platform forcing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and racist Pepes in front of your eyeballs! Bloomberg’s report, based on “people familiar with the matter” seems kind of sus from the jump, though, starting with the first line, “Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok.” 订阅！(Subscribe!) First of all, the Chinese government doesn’t own TikTok, though a Chinese guy founded it, and was never incorporated there. It’s owned by ByteDance Ltd., which is headquartered in the Cayman Islands, and TikTok Inc. is headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore, with servers (where the algorithm happens) in Virginia. Sixty percent of ByteDance is owned by non-Chinese global institutional investors including Susquehanna International Group (majority shareholder Jeff Yass), the Carlyle Group, General Atlantic, KKR, BlackRock, and Tiger Global Management; 20 percent of the firm is owned by Beijing-based founder Zhang Yiming, and 20 percent is owned by employees. Three of the company's five board members are Americans, and the other two are based in Hong Kong and Singapore. Content moderation happens in Ireland. User data is not stored in China. Founder Zhang Yiming is not a Chinese official, and even if he were, how would Chinese officials be able to do shit about shit or sell anything that they do not own? Bloomberg, you are sloppy. TikTok has denied any talks of a sale to Musk. Furthermore, its US operations are worth about $50 billion, so would Elon even have that kind of liquidity to put up 12 percent of his net worth in cash, especially after reportedly promising to use his cash to primary any Republicans who vote against Pete Hegseth’s confirmation? Even for him, that’s kind of a lot. And would board members ever approve such a sale, considering the guy anti-Rumplestiltskinned his $44 billion investment in Twitter to a value of $15 billion because advertisers and users have fled it like a hot turd? Sounds most likely that “people familiar with the matter” was Elon, after smoking a bone in his owl hoodie. (ICYMI) This whole very unprecedented ban is such entire bullshit, nothing more than Trump getting his way, which he openly admits. About 40 percent of people between 18-29 say they get their news from TikTok, and he fucking hated that so many people were talking shit about him on an app with 170 million users that he could not control. So Mike Johnson crammed the ban into the Republicans’ $95 billion foreign aid package. But then Jeff Yass invested in Trump’s shitty media platform, and flew down to Florida to kiss Trump’s ass, and the algorithm started being nice to Trump, and helped him win young voters, so then he liked it again. As you know, I used TikTok very successfully in my campaign. I have a man named TikTok Jack. He was very effective, obviously, because I won youth by 30 percent. All Republicans lose youth. I don't know why. Maybe it's changing. And last time we were down 30 percent with youth. This time we're up 35 percent with youth. And I used TikTok, so I can't really, you know — I can't totally hate it. It was very effective. PREVIOUSLY! The ban was ALL about him opposing the expression of opinions and words, which is as un-First Amendment-y as it gets. Also notable, the end of TikTok will mean the end of income for millions of content creators and revenue for about 7 million small businesses on there, some of whom do quite well. TikTok drove $15 billion in revenue to small businesses in 2023 and contributed $24.2 billion to the US GDP. The Bill was called “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,” and singles out TikTok in particular, even though it is not controlled by a foreign adversary. It is not an app without sin, it must be said; the company has been investigated over its (American) employees tracking multiple journalists covering it, and in 2022 the company fired the chief internal auditor who led the team responsible for them. But there’s no evidence that the Chinese government ever wanted or got the spoils of that snoopery. Also TikTok detractors claim that the algorithm is a “black box,” but so is every social media platform’s feed. And TikTok’s seems more obvious than most: Linger on something longer, you see more of it, skip it and you see less. This is how I wound up with a feed that is mostly men styling their hair into pompadours, and rare Duran Duran performances. Anyway, Trump ran to the Supreme Court and filed a law-free brief about how he alone can save TikTok, and the Supremes are still mulling it over. Also Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey has introduced a bill, “Extend the TikTok Deadline Act,” which would give ByteDance another 270 days to sell the app, and now even Rand Paul is against its shutdown. The ban doesn’t need to be slowed down, it needs to be stopped, because banning shit is not who we are, and all of this sits on a throne of fibs! Meanwhile, the number one download in the Apple Store is Xiaohongshu (Red Note), which is literally the Chinese TikTok. The icon looks like this. And after about 12 hours of trying, I got my number verified on there! And it is delightful, in its own kind way. It’s sort of like being in actual China, but without having to sit on a plane for 12 hours or risk getting giardia from an ice cube. Much of it’s in Chinese, but there’s just enough English so you can get by. The Hongshu-ers seem puzzled by the influx, but friendly, reaching out to TikTok refugees with greetings and content everybody enjoys, such as cat pictures, stir-fry recipes, and Luigi Mangione rendered in cappuccino foam. What a turn of events, a ban meant to drive Americans and Chinese people apart bringing them closer together than ever. Will SCOTUS decide to halt the ban? Will Chinese TikTok take off? We shall see! If the ban passes the app will still exist on your phone, there just won’t be any software updates, and at some point it will break or become obsolete. Until then, get in those cucumber recipes and floss dances and pompadour tips while you still can. [Bloomberg archive link/ CNN/ Forbes archive link/ Oxford Economics ] Follow me on Bluesky! Share Donate one time! I know they're calling it Red Note, but 小红书 is literally "Little Red Book." Mao's last joke from the grave? "with servers (where the algorithm happens) in Virginia" that's AWS us-east-1. They have servers there, sure. You cannot fucking tell me they're not multi region though. TikTok is AWS-based. "User data is not stored in China." Bull fucking shit. https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/about-aws/china/ I will bet you a gentleperson's bet of $1 to wonkette that they are replicating to the AWS China regions, at least one of them.

Title: Jim Cramer on Tapestry, Inc. (TPR) ‘Clearly Didn’t Get Sidetracked’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 21 Stocks As Bond Yields Soared. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In a recent episode of CNBC's Squawk On The Street, Jim Cramer started out by commenting on quantum computing stocks. These stocks rose to new highs after the announcement of the Willow quantum computing chip by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. He mentioned a quote by AI CEO Jensen Huang about quantum computing. According to Cramer, "The quote previous to that was really enlightening too. I mean just as this. And this [quantum computing] only works for small form factor. And it's used microwave. The large form factor, which by the way is, automatic driving and robots, it doesn't work. So not only is it later, but it's not useful. And, he also said that we work with a CPU, not GPU. That would be like that Intel engine and it's much too slow." Cramer continued to blast quantum computing stocks. According to him, the "QTUM ETF that has almost no quantum computing, it's been bid up. I mean they really are David, I mean, I'm not saying they are necessarily fraudulent. Because Willow, which is a project of Google, is pretty good. And Amazon was working on a program to help quantum developers." Likening the quantum computing stocks to an illusory phenomenon, he commented "But frankly, I'm going to use the word chimerical, in the sense that these companies, none of these companies, have much in terms of revenue. . . .But they're all losing a lot of money, and it was the type of thing you see at the beginning of the year, we're also seeing it in nuclear, another area that's chimerical. And I think that it has to be watched out before we can go higher." As a result, Cramer shared "I think that people should sell those stocks and lock in their gains." Quantum computing isn't the only sector on his radar though. Another sector in Cramer's crosshairs was nuclear power. He believes that firms can't build nuclear power plants "fast enough, and they're very expensive and the overruns are ridiculous. So we have to clear out the nuke and we have to clear out this ridiculous stuff when it comes to quantum." Since treasury yields were rising during the start of the day, they didn't miss Cramer's attention either. He shared the trend of the rising yields and started with the futures. The futures were up during Frank Holland's show. Which is the five o'clock show," he stated. Cramer added "Okay so, then we had the rates right where they are. And then somehow, between four thirty and six, the rates skyrocketed! And then after the ADP they went lower." He believes that excessive attention on the yields is equivalent to being "worse than the analysts that are telling you to sell" the world's leading GPU designer. Another player that has shaped the market for two years now is the Federal Reserve. The Fed caused quite a bit of turmoil in mid-December after its paring back of expected 2025 interest rate cuts to two from four hit stocks hard. Now, with the labor market being as strong as ever, investors are wary of getting even one rate cut in the first half of 2025. Cramer commented on the Fed's Christopher Waller and shared that "He ought to take a vacation. Why do these guys have to talk every minute? I mean what good are they doing to the chairman? The chairman ought to say, hey guys, go speak at the Rotary Club and address what I think is the biggest problem of youth." The CNBC host also mentioned the ongoing and devastating wildfires in California. Cramer stressed that these are not ordinary wildfires. Recalling his days as a news reporter he shared: "When I covered homicides and fires when I was a reporter in LA, I was living in my car so I was kind of uniquely able to cover any fire very quickly. And I was on one side of the interstate five where it's just north of I-10. And it was five lanes, five lanes at the time and I was on the side that was away from Beverly Hills. And the chief at the time said to me, don't worry we're safe here. Because it's never jumped I-5. And then I saw like Santa Anna winds, it jumped I-5, ten lanes at the time, just jumped it. And I looked at him, and I said what do we do? And he said, it's every man for himself. And we tore. . . .I mean it really, it's so frightening. Because it can leap. People think it's static. And when it comes, it explodes, where it's crackling. It does not light up and burn. It explodes! So that's what we're dealing with." He added "I just want people to know that this is not a fire where there's coming down. This is a fire where you don't know where it's gonna go. And it can go a hundred yards." As for the bond yields, Cramer hinted that they might drop in the future. According to him "A lot of the people that I deal with in the bond market are kind of salivating over the idea that maybe we do get a 5% on a ten year. It's interesting to hear the perspective of people who cash but who don't own anything. There is money out there waiting for that level. So if people think that it's just, there's just going to be an overshoot be aware that there will be some real demand."

(NYSE:TPR) is a luxury apparel company that has managed to hedge against the storm that's hit its peers. The firm's stock endured in 2024 and ended the year with more than 79% in gains. Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) has endured because the firm's customer base of wealthy individuals is insulated against the broader dip in spending power that has harmed consumers in the US and abroad. Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) beat analyst estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter results, and Cramer commented on Barclays upgrading the stock to Overweight: "And by the way, Tapestry clearly didn't get sidetracked. Well, doing quite well. I don't know. Some of these consumer names are making a little bit of a comeback. Overall TPR ranks 16th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) is an important player in the SaaS-based payroll processing services provider market. Since its performance is dependent to a large extent on small and medium business performance, the shares perform well when investors perceive an easing of monetary policy. As a result, the fact that Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)'s shares are flat year-to-date is unsurprising. In fact, had the firm not announced a deal to expand its operations by acquiring Paycor, the stock might have suffered more. Cramer commented on Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) CEO's astute observation of the US economy: "I had John Gibson on recently. He's the CEO of Paychex. And this is the largest payroll processor for small to medium sized businesses. Here's what the Fed did wrong. They didn't, he just got, a Fed advisor, John. The small business outlook post the election was astonishing. And the amount of hiring post the election was incredible. But that was not in any of the models. What J Powell [inaudible] sit around and say, listen if Trump wins we gotta stop, stop cutting? But that was the key fulcrum. What small business, the backbone of the US economy I may add, and we got that wrong. Everyone got it wrong except for Gibson because he was looking at the Paychex stubs. And he saw the hiring explosion." Overall PAYX ranks 18th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.

Ogunlesi is a founding partner of Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure investing firm that was acquired by BlackRock last year for $12 billion. Before helping to start GIP in 2006, Ogunlesi spent 23 years at Credit Suisse. "The rapid advancement and development of AI offers a unique opportunity to build a better future," Ogunlesi said in OpenAI's announcement Tuesday. "As part of this, thoughtful strategies and investment in infrastructure will be key to unlocking AI's full potential and delivering its benefits responsibly. I'm excited to contribute to this effort and look forward to being a part of the OpenAI Board." For OpenAI, the addition of Ogunlesi to its board marks another step in its dramatic transformation to a for-profit company. The board has been almost entirely revamped since late 2023, when CEO Sam Altman was abruptly ousted before being quickly reinstated. Former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, who was chairman at Twitter before its purchase by Elon Musk, became chair of OpenAI after the Altman ordeal in November 2023. Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, joined at the same time. Last year, the board added several new faces including Instacart CEO Fidji Simo and Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, now known as the Gates Foundation. OpenAI, which was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, said in late December that it will create a public benefit corporation to oversee commercial operations, removing some of its nonprofit restrictions and allowing it to function more like a high-growth startup. Last year, OpenAI was valued at $157 billion as it continued rolling out updated large language models and new tools after kicking off the generative artificial intelligence boom in late 2022. The company said that by transforming into a Delaware PBC "with ordinary shares of stock," it can pursue commercial operations while separately hiring a staff for its nonprofit arm and allowing that wing to take on charitable activities in health care, education and science, OpenAI said in December. Musk, one of OpenAI's co-founders is suing to try and stop OpenAI from converting into a full for-profit business. Ogunlesi's other board positions include BlackRock, Topgolf Callaway Brands, Kosmos Energy Holdings and Terminal Investment Ltd. — CNBC's Hayden Field contributed to this report.
