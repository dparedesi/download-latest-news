ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade May 7, 2025 The much-awaited Pectra upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet arrived on May 7. It will enable enhanced scalability for Layer-2 networks, reduce transaction fees, and increase validator staking limits. Ethereum upgrades are critical for the network to boost scalability and optimize security without compromising decentralization. The Pectra upgrade will better enable traditional financial institutions to deploy capital reserves into native ETH staking for boosted rewards. Since institutional capital has historically preferred Ethereum as a settlement layer, the Pectra upgrade will further enhance the network’s capabilities to cater to institutional capital’s demands. The market has responded favourably to the Pectra upgrade. ETH’s market capitalization was up 42 percent by May 12, just five days following Pectra’s implementation. With a market cap of over $322 billion, Ethereum became the world’s 39th largest asset, in the good company of firms like Coca-Cola and Alibaba’s stocks. The ETH futures market also recorded a rise in open interest from $21.3 billion to $30.4 billion, signalling increased market activity and trader engagement. Unlike most crypto tokens, ETH’s price action is bolstered technical upgrades which help set the stage for further improvements and a sustained growth of the network. The Pectra upgrade provides a new opportunity for institutional investors to enter the Ethereum ecosystem. The Pectra upgrade brings almost a dozen Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) into a single release for an improved Ethereum ecosystem. Thomas Panicker, director of devops at EchoBase, explains “The Pectra upgrade is another critical step forward in Ethereum’s ongoing roadmap, combining both the Prague (execution layer) and Electra (consensus layer) upgrades to improve usability, security, and validator operations. A significant improvement in Ethereum’s Pectra is EIP-7251, which increases the staking limit or maximum validator staking balance from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. Although validators will need 32 ETH to start staking, they’ll be able to earn rewards for up to 2,048 ETH in one validator instead of remaining capped at 32 ETH. Raising the ETH staking limit provides more flexibility to stakers who don’t hold ETH in multiples of 32. For instance, if someone has 50 ETH, they can now stake it under one validator to earn rewards on the full amount. Earlier, out of 50 ETH, they could stake just 32 ETH, and the remaining 18 ETH would remain idle. Bohdan Opryshko, co-founder and chief operating officer of Everstake, a leading institutional-grade non-custodial staking provider says, "The Pectra upgrade marks a major step toward making Ethereum significantly more appealing for institutional players. Most notably, we're seeing a 64x reduction in slashing risk. By consolidating infrastructure and reducing the number of validator nodes needed, institutions can now manage their staking setups with far greater efficiency and security. In practical terms, this means fewer human touchpoints, less room for operational errors, and dramatically easier infrastructure management." Further, the Pectra upgrade implements EIP-7002 for easier validator withdrawals, enabling validators to unstake directly through a simple Ethereum transaction instead of using the Beacon Chain. Subsequently, it makes institutional staking easier, providing stakers flexibility and lowering barriers even for those who aren’t technical experts. Earlier, staking service clients had to compulsorily obtain a signed message from staking service providers to exit their position. Since the message generation took about 13 hours, stakers had to wait till that time to exit. With Pectra, the exit delay is reduced to just 13 minutes, enabling quick staking withdrawals. Artemiy Parshakov, vice president of institutions at P2P.org, says, “The Pectra upgrade is a major unlock for institutional staking, especially with account abstraction paving the way for smarter, automated strategies. One area gaining traction is the automated calculation of the ideal withdrawal time for staked ETH. Instead of relying on static schedules, this approach dynamically evaluates real-time network conditions, like validator exit queues, churn limits, and forecasted reward rates, to identify the most advantageous withdrawal window. Paired with automated execution, it reduces manual overhead and maximizes returns.” Opryshko adds, "Withdrawal times are shrinking from up to 13 hours to as little as 13 minutes in some cases. That brings Ethereum closer to the liquidity expectations of traditional finance, where 2–3 business days is the standard, and even allows it to outperform them. If we can consistently offer liquidity in under a day, it removes a major friction point for large funds exploring on-chain staking. The Pectra upgrade also implements EIP-6110 for faster staking deposits to accelerate validator activation through processing staking deposits directly on Ethereum’s execution layer. This makes staking seamless, reduces wait times, and improves efficiency, enabling validators to earn faster rewards. Simultaneously, EIP-7685 offers enhanced communication between Ethereum’s execution and consensus layers, improving validator actions like deposits and withdrawals, thereby making Ethereum staking much smoother. Whereas EIP-7549 makes Ethereum validator voting more efficient, making its staking system scalable and less resource-intensive. Panicker adds, “One of the most notable enhancements is EIP-3074, which introduces advanced account abstraction capabilities — enabling smart contract-style behavior from externally owned accounts (EOAs). This change could significantly simplify user interactions and improve wallet design, potentially helping with broader adoption.” Regular wallets function like smart contracts through gas fee sponsorship, passkey authentication, and batching transactions, help to reduce friction during transaction processing. The combined benefits of implementing multiple EIPs in the Pectra upgrade make ETH staking conducive for institutional capital. Critics often point out TradFi money doesn’t flow into Ethereum citing ETH ETFs have just over $5 billion in AUM compared to $115 billion for bitcoin ETFs. It is not a fair comparison, more apples and oranges and conflates the fundamentals. BTC is a store of value, ETH is a utility - the Ethereum network has emerged as the preferred base layer for institutions for transacting digital assets. Major financial institutions like BlackRock, the European Investment Bank, Deutsche Bank, and UBS, use Ethereum for deploying their on-chain strategies. The institutional preference for Ethereum comes from its credibility as a decentralized and secure public network. Ethereum controls over 58 percent of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), over 52 percent of DeFi TVL, and 95 percent of stablecoin volume. Wall Street investors prefer Ethereum for its network effects, high liquidity reserves, and composability, unlike other blockchains that have become token islands or private walled gardens, all which fragment liquidity creating inefficiencies and driving usage costs up. Ethereum has also adopted new security token standards like ERC-3643 and ERC-1400 with built-in KYC and AML compliance mechanisms. Subsequently, in March 2025, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the post-trade market infrastructure that processes $3.7 quadrillion in security transactions, now supports the issuance and management of ERC-3643 tokens. Trevor Koverko, Web3 investor and co-founder of Sapien, says, “Ethereum continues to cement its position as the institutional blockchain of choice, and the Pectra upgrade only strengthens that narrative. With native staking yields, deep liquidity, and a maturing regulatory perception, ETH staking has become an increasingly attractive destination for institutional capital seeking low-correlation, yield-generating exposure to crypto. Ethereum’s modular roadmap and protocol-level innovation uniquely position it to absorb this next wave of capital with both scalability and trust.” Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal, elaborated, “Besides security and decentralization, transparency and seamless user experience are key to deploying successful on-chain products. The Pectra upgrade stands out for making ETH staking simple and attractive for institutional investors with more rewards, faster deposits and withdrawals, and enhanced efficiency. So we can expect more institutions to now participate in ETH staking for generating yields.” Ethereum’s native staking yield makes it a lucrative fixed-income instrument within the digital asset space. TradFi players and institutions can leverage the yield from ETH staking to other financial instruments for generating additional income. As Panicker further explains, “For enterprises and protocol developers, it’s a signal that Ethereum is not just evolving technically, but maturing toward a more developer-friendly and scalable base layer. While the Pectra upgrade doesn’t directly impact our business model today, these innovations move the ecosystem toward more modular and abstracted infrastructure — something that can eventually benefit wallet providers, custodial services, and L2 integrations by offering more flexibility, especially around permissions and transaction delegation.” A decade ago, Ethereum transformed the digital asset industry with its smart contract functionalities, making decentralized applications accessible to users. Ten years later, it continues to be the forerunner in technical innovation. The Pectra upgrade will be followed by Fusaka and Glamsterdam upgrades to handle big data and optimize gas. These upgrade will continue to make Ethereum the preferred destination for institutional capital to build products, participate in native ETH staking, and drive future-proof digital RWA and new and innovative product and collateralization use cases.

Title: Trump Smoke and Mirrors on Full Display in Claimed “$142 Billion” Saudi Arms Deal

Given how the spectacle of Trump going to the Middle East and collecting cash and prizes like his much-hyped $142 billion Saudi arms “deal”, part of a purported $600 billion investment package, and his much-criticized Qatari airplane “gift”, Bloomberg has provided a useful service in picking apart the inflated figures in the arms agreement claim. Even though it’s important to understand how great the Trump claim inflation is, so that recipients will hopefully apply a large discount any time Trump makes a grand pronouncement, he persists in this behavior because it is an effective form of cognitive anchoring. The public and press will remember the $142 billion, and not any properly haircut figure. Consider another recent example, Trump’s loud claim that the US acted as a mediator in the India-Pakistan ceasefire talks. Washington Monthly explained how that claim was not only false but actually detrimental: India and Pakistan have reached a ceasefire in their recent conflict, which significantly decreases the risk of a nuclear war this week. However, the amateur-hour way Donald Trump’s administration handled this crisis increased (if only slightly) the chance of a nuclear exchange down the line. It illustrates why Trump’s everything-is-about-me style of governance isn’t just a harmless embarrassment, but a daily disaster…. First, Trump claimed credit for the ceasefire, boasting that the U.S. had “mediated” it. India issued an immediate denial, but the mistake ran deeper than poaching an honor. In diplomacy, words matter. And as everyone in the region knows, the word “mediate” is a diplomatic landmine. Ever since 1947, India has strenuously rejected outside “mediation” of the Kashmir conflict…. Did the U.S. play an intermediary role in helping India and Pakistan reach a ceasefire agreement? Sure—as did Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, and China (none of which rushed to the microphones to seize credit). As India stated in smacking down Trump’s claim, it was the two parties themselves who reached an accord, not any external actor seeking to impose “mediation.” … Second, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a far more substantive negotiation than the one approved. Mindful of his boss’s unquenchable thirst to be seen as a master deal-maker, Rubio posted that the two nations had agreed to “talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.” A “broad set of issues” really means “long-term disposition of Kashmir”— or at least that’s how Pakistan wants (and India fears) these words will be interpreted. Did Modi agree to such negotiations, and in response to a terrorist action? Vanishingly unlikely. Did India agree to any talks on any topic? Unlikely, but not impossible, although India immediately denied this, too. So even if Rubio’s statement contained a kernel of truth, any talks were ones India intended to keep secret. Rubio’s decision to spotlight them (if they even existed) stroked Trump’s ego, but at the expense of progress or U.S. credibility…. Another dangerous result of Trump and Rubio’s statements is that they unwittingly promoted Pakistan’s agenda, thereby encouraging a replay of the same hazardous behavior. There’s more where that came from, but you get the drift of the gist: Trump’s claims were wildly inflated His extreme ego needs are harmful to international security John Helmer has said that the Russians have realized they are negotiating with a cult of personality and have been proceeding accordingly. But there is another implication: look how many words it took to debunk the Trump claim and question the Rubio follow on (as in either its accuracy or its propriety). How many people pay that much attention, let alone have a tolerance for complex arguments? This is the general problem with bullshit. It takes a minimum of 3x the space, and often more than 10x, to disprove it. Similarly, a new article in the Financial Times, What has Elon Musk’s Doge actually achieved?, takes a harsh look at the many promises made, from cost savings to transparency, and finds them sorely wanting. The pink paper, as many others have, documents among other things how DOGE grossly inflated cost cuts and took credit for reductions that were already baked in. It even contends the DOGE approach was destined to do more harm than good: Doge “got off in the wrong direction because it attacked exactly the wrong thing,” says Matt Calkins, chief executive of software company Appian, which powers much of government procurement and has worked with the initiative on some cost-cutting measures. “Of all the things you could do to affect the government, it would have been better to go after regulation. It would have been better to go after entitlements. Just blowing up jobs was a good way to make enemies, a good way to cause more disruption than progress.” But this detailed analysis (the full article is very much worth a read) misses a major, if not the point, of DOGE nevertheless advancing the reactionary libertarian agenda of destroying government services. The Big Lie repetition of “fraud” has been effective. Fraud is a risk in all commercial activity, even one to one dealings. The question for any organization is the cost and effectiveness of fraud prevention and mitigation measures. In just about all instances, having anti-abuse measures that are so stringent as to reduce it to zero is too costly, both in terms of hard outlays like staffing, as well as more complex considerations (for businesses, alienating potential customers; for government, greatly restricting delivering services to target populations). For instance, a long-standing ally of the site casually mentioned of the Trump demolition exercise, that Something (by implication, Something Big) needed to be done. I disputed that contention. With complex systems, like human bodies, even if there is a problem, limited interventions are always preferred to radical ones, so a stent is a better solution (if viable) than a heart replacement. The big reasons include less risk to the patient, lower costs, plus the conservative treatment typically does not preclude more aggressive ones later. But in keeping with the idea that DOGE was at least in part a messaging operation, we’ve had far too many otherwise intelligent readers pump for a teardown…with no real logic as to why, let alone any clue of what comes next. Now to Bloomberg on the Saudi arms deal puffery, politely headlined as US-Saudi $142 Billion Defense Deal Sparks Questions, Few Answers. Key extracts: The Trump administration called its $142 billion defense deal with Saudi Arabia “the largest defense sales agreement in history.” Critics aren’t so sure…. But like the broader $600 billion economic deal that it was a part of, the defense agreement lacked any specifics. And skeptics of the administration immediately pointed to questions around the numbers. One is that Saudi Arabia’s entire defense budget this year is $78 billion, estimated Bruce Riedel, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Yves here. Both the Administration and Congress have a habit of using CBO scoring numbers, which tally total outlays over the next ten years for a particular program or piece of legislation, as the cost, which many news-readers mistakenly treat as expected next-year outlays. But if that was the treatment, there should have been some disclosure, say in a yet-to-be-produced briefing paper. Back to Bloomberg: Democratic and Republican administrations alike have a long history of re-purposing previous deals into sweeping, headline-grabbing agreements for presidents to sign during trips. Trump did it before, during his first-term trip to Saudi Arabia in 2017, when he announced the Saudis would spend $110 billion on US weapons to modernize the kingdom’s military. That package included deals negotiated under the Obama administration and others that were in the initial stages of a lengthy process requiring congressional approval and negotiations between the buyer and defense contractors. To date, the 2017 deal has yielded more than $30 billion in implemented foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia, according to a State Department fact sheet in January…. If deals do eventually emerge from the White House and Saudi Arabia, experts will start sorting through what was new and what was old. Already, there are more than $129 billion in active military sales to Saudi Arabia from the US, according to the State Department fact sheet. Yves again. So perhaps only $13 billion in incremental commitments? To Bloomberg again, which stresses that the hype has commercial value to the US: “A lot of this is about the optics, but the optics matter,” said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. “It’s an attempt to send a message of reassurance after several years of uncertainty in the US-Saudi bilateral relationship on defense cooperation.” The agreement is likely to yield real gains, particularly in the realm of missile defense, where the US has much to offer and Saudi Arabia has significant needs, said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute focusing on defense strategy and budgeting. At a time when some of the US’s traditional allies in Europe may be reluctant to purchase weapons from Washington, Saudi Arabia’s willingness to do so is especially welcome, he said. Regular readers are likely wondering why the Saudis and the Europeans are so keen about US weapons, given not just the way Russian systems have regularly proven to be superior in Ukraine, but even the way the stereotyped sandal-wearing Houthis chased the US out of Middle East waterways. The practical difficulty (aside from the elephant in the room of geopolitics) of integrating disparate systems is large, including training of operators. The Russians make a big point of backwards integration in the operation of major systems like military planes: if a soldier knows an old system, it will be close to trivial for him to learn to manage a new one. By contrast, Ukraine military pilots had grown up flying Soviet planes. Many experts warned that trying to retrain them to operate Western aircraft was an impossible ask. If they had to undertake an action under high pressure, they would default to what amounted to muscle memory in flying the Soviet jets, which would be all wrong for the Western ones. The high level of not-well-explained losses of Ukraine-operated F-16s validates this concern. However, an upside of this Saudi arms buy is that it has the Israels worried. Bloomberg mentions that in passing: Even without specifics, some analysts said the scale and complexity of weapons purchases contemplated by Saudi Arabia could risk compromising Israel’s “qualitative military edge” in the region, which US presidents for decades have committed to maintain…. But Dana Stroul, director of research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that the categories outlined by the White House have long been part of Saudi Arabia’s military modernization plans. Absent more detail about particular weapon systems, they don’t raise alarms about qualitative military edge, said Stroul, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East. A very long article in the Times of Israel, Trump signs deals with Saudis, including biggest-ever $142 billion arms agreement, has a banner above the header laying out a key worry: Expert: Gulf states stronger friends for Trump than Israel? The article weighs heavy on, and is clearly unhappy about, all of the pomp and circumstance during Trump’s visit. There is an absence of substance about the deals, but a lot not-well-coded whining: Biden had decided to pay a visit to Saudi Arabia as he looked to alleviate soaring prices at the pump for motorists at home and around the globe. At the time, Prince Mohammed’s reputation had been badly damaged by a US intelligence determination that found he had ordered the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But that dark moment appeared to be a distant memory for the prince as he rubbed elbows with high-profile business executives — including Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — in front of the cameras and with Trump by his side… Saudi Arabia and fellow OPEC+ nations have already helped their cause with Trump early in his second term by stepping up oil production…. William Wechsler, senior director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, said Trump’s decision to skip Israel on his first Middle East visit was remarkable. “The main message coming out of this, at least as the itinerary stands today, is that the governments of the Gulf … are in fact stronger friends to President Trump than the current government of Israel at this moment,” Wechsler said. Admittedly, the Times does land a blow in its brief mention of corruption: The three countries on Trump’s itinerary — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates — are places where the Trump Organization, run by the president’s two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects. They include a high-rise tower in Jeddah, a luxury hotel in Dubai, and a golf course and villa complex in Qatar. Finally, the apparently big, even if again considerably exaggerated “$600 billion” investment pledge counters the idea that the US is no longer a good place for foreign capital, as demonstrated by exits from US stocks post “Liberation Day” on a scale to seriously weaken the dollar. A final question is what if anything the show of fealty by Middle Eastern states to US means for BRICS. As we have pointed out repeatedly, a big problem for BRICS is the comparative dearth of high GDP per capita states as members. China’s GDP per capita is less than 1/6 that of the US. Even if you use PPP per capita. China’s level is less than 1/3 of that of the US. Lower incomes means less economic surplus. Saudi Arabia’s GDP per capita is roughly 2.5 times that of China’s, so it has the potential to be a powerful addition to BRICS. But if it continues to maintain relations with both the US and what is perceived to be a China-led sphere, as India has said it intends to do, does that limit how much it support BRICS? And let me remind reader, BRICS so far is much less substantive than most readers imagine. It does not even have a budget, unlike the (perceived to be) much less ambitious ASEAN or Shanghai Cooperation Organization. So this is a long-winded way of demonstrating, frustratingly, how effective hype can be. How to counter it well remains an open question. For someone who has such open contempt for the law, Trump is an ardent and abiding follower of Brandolini’s law. Also known as the bullshit assymetry principle. Re: India v. Pakistan. John Helmer has a different take on events, talking to Ray McGovern with Nima. He said that while we know India lost several aircraft, we don’t know about Pakistan’s losses in the air, but we do know about Pakistan’s losses on the ground — loss of command and control (!) — which triggered movement of Pakistan’s nuclear forces, which triggered movement of India’s nuclear forces. Helmer thinks that is when Pakistan called Washington begging for mediation. https://youtu.be/rY_pZu_anJU?t=4440 https://archive.ph/jiC8h NYT would agree. There was no mediation. Please do not use that word. The US freelancing and calling both sides does not amount to mediation. Seems the lie served a purpose: selling out Trump branded luxury apartments. https://theprint.in/india/trump-residences-in-gurugram-sold-out-days-after-us-president-claimed-he-brokered-ceasefire/2627053/ Thanks for this breakdown! As always, laughing out loud at the sheer mendacity of it all! LOL #TheKicker > The three countries on Trump’s itinerary — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates — are places where the Trump Organization, run by the president’s two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects. Bwaaahahahaha! Yes, strike one blow … for corruption. Your comment at the end about BRICS/India/Saudi is something I have thought about a bit. I liken it to API Technology – you know, when you have two disparate systems – like an old mainframe in a datacenter somewhere, and now it has to talk to some dang new-fangled AI thing in “the cloud”? Well, you’re not going to move the mainframe, and it may be too critical/complex to replace/modernize, so you write some code elsewhere to serve as an API that permits your ancient IBM cabinet thingy talk out to modern distributed systems. Well, the US/UK/EU is like that mainframe … the emerging Global South is the future … Countries like Saudi/India/perhaps-even-Turkey are going to be your API-translator layer … ferrying all manner of things between two increasingly different and distant worlds. The “America: For Sale” tour continues. It is very sad that we have to look to Bruce Springsteen to show leadership and call out Orange Julius. https://www.politico.eu/article/corrupt-incompetent-and-treasonous-bruce-springsteen-lashes-donald-trump/ (I give Bruce credit, he’s 75 and still going. But where is AOC?) Yea, to show leadership and join “a long list of American celebrities who voiced support for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris”. It looks more like a setup for next Wrestlemania. Springsteen vs Trump, only on pay-per-view! If ratings are good enough, then plebs could get Madonna vs Melania extravaganza. If Bruce had supported Jill Stein, would he have had more credibility in your view? I get it that we’re a peak cynicism. He would have had more credibility in my view if he did what he is paid for, sing instead of talk. Same apply for most celebrites that are more than happy to be cogs in the machine (instead of raging against it). P.S. Now that I think again, those celebrites are probably paid to talk also, though not by the common people but by the machine. “Same apply for most celebrites that are more than happy to be cogs in the machine (instead of raging against it). It’s kinda funny, that phrase. Because Bruce and Tom Morello are close friends. Morello toured with them for a while.. Ghost of Tom Joad Bruce doesn’t seem to understand all those Blue collars he wrote about voted FOR Trump. And They’re not the ones who are paying $2000 per ticket to see him. I’m familiar with the “shut up and sing” argument. It has merit, however, nature abhors a vacuum. Bruce has been political for a long time, I remember him crying about George W. Bush winning in 2004 … it could be a release valve that serves the Donkeys by giving them an appearance of caring, i.e Donkey-adjacent celebs give actual politicians cover to do nothing. All publicly quoted figures of this type are kidology to some extent. Any defence package of any size is complex, staged over many years and usually includes both immediate purchases and options on future tranches. So I would not be surprised if this figure included everything from options taken up for new tranches from past contracts, new contracts for delivery over 5-10 years, options on further packages, spares, support and training packages extending over 25 years (standard for this sort of thing) and upgrades and weapon packages. Bear in mind that these days, what’s sometimes called Total Cost of Ownership or Through-Life Cost can easily be twice the initial procurement cost. The Saudis will not be greatly concerned about equipment performance as such, and anyway their attempts to use sophisticated weapons have been generally unimpressive. This package is designed to tie the US more closely to them, as has been their policy for decades, by making the US their effective defenders. The package will include lots of US personnel in-country to help with everything from training to operational planning, all of whom will be effectively hostages in the event of a crisis with, say, Iran. Think of the US, if you like, as a giant PMC, providing equipment, training, support and mercenaries to the Saudis. For this reason they are not going for Russian equipment. As you say, there would be great difficulties of integration and operation, and even such basic things as language. The Russians would never agree to the kind of massive presence in the country that really serious arms deliveries would entail, nor could they compete, frankly, with several generations of contact at all levels between US and Saudi officers, together with contacts from other western states, which have produced a military that thinks and fights like the West. I’m sure the Russians would be only too happy to undermine the US position, but this isn’t the way to do it. More widely, this is certainly a political, if not military, snub for Israel, not least because the Israelis have a history of trying to manipulate US arms sales to Saudi Arabia. I don’t think it has much to do with BRICS, which remains, as you’ve often pointed out, a vestigial entity, and one where a defence dimension may well never emerge. In the meantime, the Saudis are playing both sides against the middle, as usual. Government contracting (and accounting) is a very complicated milieu of rules/regs (FAR combined with ASBs) hidden in unnecessary complexity behind ‘security clearances’. During my own career, my ‘rise’ because of the mere questions I asked. The assumption was that I wouldn’t play ball. As I watch the front line on the various telegram/youtube channels, I am not surprised to see the live demonstrations (marketing value) of the clips. Most that I watch do not contain the bloodshed, so they are sanitized for the audience. As a former ‘customer’ (working for the contractor), I was privy to watching the demonstrations of our products in exercises mimicking war games. It was a marketing tool. Watching the next generation products used in real warfare has helped me understand, with great sadness, the smoke and mirrors we in the West project as superior technology. We are completely fake, like Hollywood. The real question for me? How long will the charade continue? Trump was the perfect selection for the neocons (and the tech titans that prepare to tighten the noose) as consummate salesmen. This is my mere opinion and I admit to that. Apologies for typos. So, the US has sold a lot of arms to Saudi Arabia. What, precisely, are the Saudis going to do with those arms? They obviously can’t attack Israel. By the time they have been trained in using the arms, the Iranians will know all about them and using them on Iran would be suicidal, and using them on Iraq would be the equivalent of using them on Iran, i.e. suicidal. Their use of arms against Yemen was notably unsuccessful. It seems to me that the US might just as well have saved diplomatic trouble by dumping all those arms in the Atlantic, for all the value they add to the US agenda. How dare you suggest that! Are you not forgetting the shareholders of the defense contractors? The CEOs and their pay packages, options and bonuses? The revolving door for the current and former Generals and assorted personnel and their ability to go into consulting work when they retire. The lobbying dollars and campaign contributions that are all piggybacked on defense spending? How selfish. LOL (Though it’s not really very funny at all) And I do agree with your comment. Saudi Arabia used those weapons in its long intervention against Yemen (from 2015 onwards). The strong involvement of specialists from the USA, the UK, and France highlighted the fact that the Saudis were not very proficient in the usage of their armament. Knew right off the bat that Trump was lying about how much these deals were worth as, like this post mentions, he did the same exact same thing a coupla years ago when he went to Saudi Arabia and announcing it, had a board or two showing images of the weapons systems that he was selling the Saudis. Only it took time to realize that a lot of this money was already backed into the cake and was part of regular deals. That mention of that Dana Stroul cause me to do a double-take. She’s a real nasty piece of work and Brian Berlectic has mentioned her several times. Here is a video of him showing who she is- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYbGLynvr4A (4:50 mins) In reference to countering bullshit: Eisenhower’s speech nailed it that, “…an alert and knowledgeable citizenry…” is a prerequisite. Our attention span is conditioned by media to validate Occam’s Razor. News-as-entertainment replaced journalism; journalists replaced with Communications Degrees in Mastering Being On TV. The underlying Financial Times article, “What Has Musk’s DOGE Actually Accomplished?,” comes off as the approved analysis of the Uniparty Daily Truth. Much of the color commentary is from rightwingers, who are miffed because DOGE blew their cover. DOGE stepped in it quickly, when they themselves would have been a tad more daintily patient in destroying the social state, or what is left of it , in the U S of A. Quotes from our betters: ‘Calkins, the government contractor (sheesh): “Of all the things you could do to affect the government, it would have been better to go after regulation. It would have been better to go after entitlements. Just blowing up jobs was a good way to make enemies, a good way to cause more disruption than progress.” [Translation: Better office politics, please!] ‘“I think that some people, particularly on the right, felt that maybe Doge would be just kind of a catch-all solution,” says Cato’s Dominik Lett. [Meaning that he wanted DOGE to wreck the agencies so that his peeps won’t have to lift a finger.] ‘But [Lett] adds that “if you want to reassure bond markets, if you want to put the budget on a sustainable path, you need to make spending reductions to Medicare, Medicaid and social security. And for the administration, Doge was never really intended to make significant benefit reductions to those programmes.”’ Then there’s this mindless drivel from on high: ‘Safra Catz, the chief executive of software group Oracle — whose founder Larry Ellison has been a Trump ally — Doge was simply the long overdue introduction of a business mindset to government. “Don’t use things from years ago just because you have always been using them,” she says of the initiative’s approach.’ Catz undoubtedly isn’t aware of the old business axiom: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. I guess that she’s having some problems with her business mindset. Social Security is much on the minds of our betters, as we see, yet Social Security is lean and efficient. The superiors are in a snit because one more manufactured crisis hasn’t done in Social Security. Meanwhile, I note today’s posting here at Naked Capitalism about United Health Care. Financial Times starts off with vox pop: People think that the government is wasteful. Ergo, natch, DOGE. Vox populi, vox dei, vox Silicon Valley. Yet: People know that U.S. health-insurance is a scam and a swamp. Do I see squads of unnamed jamokes showing up to diddle the software of health insurers suspected of gaming the system? Heck, I’m such a naïf. And the upright citizens wonder about the emergence of Saint Luigi Mangione. KSA has been a large user of US high tech gear: E-3 AWACS squadron, F-15 several squadrons, An extensive ground to air surveillance sensor network, Bradleys….. These systems are 40 years old or more. One thing the KSA does not do is logistics support of these systems and in some it needs US techs to operate them…. A lot of so called arms deals include a large part, maybe 70% of the buy price, as logistics support. That said some of the buys systems are not ordered. IIRC the earlier Trump 45 deal included a number of THAAD “batteries”, that to my knowledge were not ordered, even if the US could open the lines to make more. Likely the Saudis are implying they put the money as a wedge in a 10 year plan, starting sometime soon. “John Helmer has said that the Russians have realized they are negotiating with a cult of personality and have been proceeding accordingly.” They remember another cult of personality, namely Stalin. And one wonders if his purges are inspired by Stalin. Someone said that wIth Stalin there was a cult of personality, and also a personality behind it. Don’t forget Jared who also has a company trying to make deals with Arab nations and who apparently seeded the Riviera idea in Trump’s noggin. Meanwhile the Adelson payoff in favor of Israel is fading since Trump can’t run again however much bs he spouts on that topic. Perhaps we’ll have world peace if every country has a Trump resort complex. The Man Who Would Be King needs robes and a camel. He has appetittes and visions of sugarplums and sweetmeats, but….Correct me if I am wrong; 1) isn’t the US on somewhat short supply of military equipment that actually works ( refer to war in Ukraine), 2) Doesn’t all that military equipment require refined rare earth minerals which may be hard to obtain from the Chinese peasants; 3) Mastery of aviation products doesn’t seem to be a DOD forte: three carrier planes lost to the Houthis, a F-35 almost downed, a dozen drones -by-bye the acquisition of a jumbo jet without a plan or budget to retrofit ( and has Boeing changed their management team?) , and now Trump has an aeronautical engineering degree to design combat aircraft. I am soooo..tired of all this winning. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email *

Dubbed the Trillion Dollar Security Initiative, the foundation hopes to make Ethereum robust enough that billions of people could confidently hold over $1,000 onchain. It's also eyeing participation from companies, institutions, or governments who could be "comfortable storing more than 1 trillion dollars of value inside a single contract or application." The initiative will unfold in three phases, starting with a comprehensive assessment of Ethereum’s security across areas such as wallet UX, smart contract tooling, and consensus protocol. The next phase will focus on implementing key improvements, followed by efforts to better communicate Ethereum’s security standards. The Foundation is also soliciting input from users, developers, and institutions to help shape the roadmap. Security luminaries, including research-driven crypto investment firm Paradigm's Samczsun, blockchain security and research firm Sigma Prime co-founder Mehdi Zerouali, and Etherealize co-founder Zach Obront, are set to lead efforts for the new initiative. The Ethereum Foundation said it welcomes community input to ensure diverse views shape its infrastructure development. Ethereum Foundation's protocol security lead, Fredrik Svantes, and Josh Stark from its management team will oversee and co-chair the project. The announcement of the three-phase program comes a week after the rollout of Pectra, sending Ethereum to double-digit highs and sparking renewed interest. Following the upgrade, it became "hard to justify ETH as a relative underperformer," analysts from investment firm Bernstein said last week. But despite the network's latest achievements, Ethereum needs to "keep up with Layer 2 growth," Ulyana Skladchikova, head of product at open-source explorer Blockscout, told Decrypt last week. Layer 2 networks are separate blockchains built on top of Ethereum, which can keep up by upgrading how they handle transactions using the former, making it cheaper and faster by using "blobs" that enhance how data is stored and processed. At the user experience level, Ethereum also needs to enhance "granular control" of its security. "By reducing the need to set up, interact with, and move assets to a smart contract wallet," other use cases could become more viable with Pectra and provide "additional security and flexibility," Skladchikova explained. On the institutional side, Ethereum has also been feeling the pinch among investors, data from CoinGlass shows. Ethereum ETFs have witnessed just three days of positive net inflows in the week since Pectra, driven primarily by BlackRock and Grayscale. Decrypt reached out to the Ethereum Foundation for comment.

Title: Bitwise CIO expects surge in crypto ETP allocations by year-end, foresees 5% portfolio norm

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan foresees a trillion-dollar future for crypto ETPs as institutional interest rises and allocations climb. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan said on May 14 that a “big unlock” is occurring across the financial advisory space regarding crypto investments. After attending a major advisory firm’s conference, Hougan shared his expectations that most major firms will enable crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) access by the end of 2025. He added that interest in crypto exposure is intensifying and predicted that the new measure for inflows into crypto ETPs will be “many billions.” After over one year since their launch, collective daily inflows for US-traded crypto ETPs have surpassed $1 billion in five instances so far, according to Farside Investors data. Hougan also said that portfolio allocation norms for crypto are shifting and “5% is the new 1%.” He further explained that institutions are becoming more comfortable with higher crypto weightings in traditional portfolios. Asset managers have historically advocated modest crypto allocations, citing volatility and risk concentration. In December, BlackRock’s Investment Institute defined a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation as a “reasonable range” for multi-asset portfolios. That recommendation has since translated into practice. BlackRock incorporated Bitcoin (BTC) into its $150 billion model portfolio offerings via the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), assigning a 1% to 2% weight in target allocations. The launch of US spot Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) ETPs in 2024 provided regulatory-compliant exposure mechanisms at scale for institutional clients, prompting many advisors to reevaluate their crypto positioning. Hougan also reported increased advisor inquiries about Ethereum, stating he fielded more questions on the asset “in the past few days than the past six months.” While Bitcoin remains the dominant product by scale, Ethereum has emerged as a key area of curiosity for professionals, according to Hougan. Bitwise shared in April that US spot Bitcoin ETPs held $93.2 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of December 2024, contrasting with spot Ethereum ETPs that totaled $6.3 billion in AUM. Despite the disparity, ownership of both products is dispersed across key institutional categories. In Bitcoin ETPs, hedge funds (36.97%) and investment advisors (33.11%) account for most institutional ownership. On the other hand, Ethereum ETPs show more balanced exposure between investment advisors (29.79%), brokerages (25.25%), and hedge funds (24.74%), while family offices show a stronger preference for Ethereum. Investment advisors and hedge funds allocated 5.8% and 4.5% of their total crypto allocation to Ethereum, while family offices had 25% of their nearly $173 million crypto allocation targeted to Ethereum. Hougan’s remarks reinforce industry expectations that professional investment access to crypto is entering a new maturity phase. As product availability widens and allocation norms shift upward, crypto may play a more regularized role in portfolio construction.

Title: Banks Exploring Stablecoin Amid Fears of Losing Market Share, BitGo Executive Says
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-toronto-2025-coverage/2025/05/14/banks-exploring-stablecoin-amid-fears-of-losing-market-share-bitgo-executive-says

As the stablecoin competition is heating up with looming regulation in the U.S., traditional finance institutions are taking notice—largely out of fear of losing out to digital dollars, said Ben Reynolds, BitGo's managing director of stablecoins, at Consensus 2025 in Toronto. Speaking at a panel discussion, he said that BitGo's recently launched stablecoin-as-a-service has seen “incredible inbound” interest from U.S. and foreign banks wanting to tokenize deposits or issue stablecoins. "A lot of banks are just being defensive—they’re afraid they’re going to lose their deposits,” Reynolds said. "They look at stablecoins and say: How do we not get left behind?" Yield-bearing versions of stablecoins and tokenized money market funds have seen rapid growth recently, but still make up only a fraction of the $230 billion stablecoin market. A16z’s Sam Broner said that while yield-bearing stablecoins are a promising market segment, their primary use case is for payments and transactions where users don't really care about yields. Still, a near-term killer use case could be “collateral mobility”—the ability to instantly move money to meet obligations across different platforms. "You can’t do a lot of things with a share of a money market fund," Broner said. "You’ve got lock-up periods, business-hour settlement, and contracts that have to be manually reviewed. Crypto gives you programmatic, permissionless flexibility." Yield-bearing stablecoins could also be attractive for institutions, said Matt Kunke, crypto product strategist at BlackRock. "If you're a DAO, protocol, or market maker, moving between crypto holdings on an exchange and your brokerage account is slow and full of friction," he said. "Stablecoins that carry yield just reduce that drag.” However, regulatory distinctions will shape the market. “A tokenized Treasury fund is a security, and an actual stablecoin is not,” he explained. “They deserve fundamentally different markets." Joseph Saldana, chief financial officer of the Wyoming Stable Token Commission, pointed out that yield–generating tokens have the power to broaden investors' access compared to mutual funds that often have minimum limits of investment that "lock out a lot of people." "We want to service the underbanked and give broader access to instruments the rest of us enjoy every day," Saldana said.

In an interview with Decrypt, the famed computer scientist and Blocksteam CEO said that given all the institutional money flowing into the space, the price of the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency should be higher. Bitcoin was recently trading for $103,300 per coin—unmoved in the past day but up more than 7% over the past week, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko. It is off just 5% from its all-time high near $109,000, despite a late winter, early spring swoon. Back, who holds a computer science doctorate in distributed systems from Exeter University and has long been involved in cryptography, told Decrypt: "I'm thinking this cycle could get quite high, but the cycle stretches out a few years, right? So I was thinking $500,000 to $1 million, because there's a lot going on." He added: "There doesn't seem to be a clear logical reason to me for why we are only at $100,000. That's not very high given all of the things that are different compared to a couple years ago." Back noted the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which have generated more than $41 billion in net inflows, and the crypto-friendly policies of U.S. President Trump. Wall Street's top regulator, the SEC, last year approved Bitcoin ETFs—funds managed by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity—which give investors easy access to BTC with shares that can be bought via brokerage accounts. The approval of the funds has led to a flow of new money into the space from investors previously locked out of the crypto investing sphere. Bitcoin's latest record—hit in January—isn't that high compared to previous cycles when looking at the coin's movement following its historical halving events. BTC tends to move in four-year cycles. But Back said that he thought brokers and individual investors tend to buy things that have already risen, so more money will flow into the space as Bitcoin climbs, creating price momentum. "I think if you get a new all-time high, it could quickly become a lot higher," he said. Back is the co-founder and CEO of Blocksteam, a company building Bitcoin infrastructure, like crypto wallets. Back had an email exchange with Bitcoin's mysterious creator—or creators—Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, the year that the original paper outlining the blockchain network was published. Bitcoin's mining process is derived from Hashcash, a proof-of-work system that Back invented.

Title: Trump gets a jet. But it’s what he’s giving in return that should have Americans worried.

Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows By Chris Hayes This is an adapted excerpt from the May 13 episode of “All In with Chris Hayes.” For decades, going back to Ronald Reagan, when an American president makes their first visit to a foreign nation, they almost always go to Canada. It makes sense: They’re our top trading partner; we share a language and a very long border. But in 2017, Donald Trump did not do that. Instead, Trump went to the oil-rich kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where he joined in laying hands on a glowing orb. During that trip, he also forged a close friendship with the nation’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who would later invest $2 billion in a business owned by Trump’s son-in-law, against the advice of his own economic experts. It’s worth noting that before that announcement, Syria’s leader offered to build a Trump Tower in Damascus. Eight years later, Trump is president again. This time around, Trump, once again, decided he wasn’t going to Canada, the country he openly wants to annex. Instead, the president went back to the Middle East, landing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, with plans to visit Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next. The Saudis, the Qataris and the Emiratis all clearly understood the assignment. Take the crown prince: He greeted Trump on the tarmac and rolled out the royal purple carpet. Not only did the Saudis welcome Trump with open arms, but they also welcomed his co-president, Elon Musk. However, Musk wasn’t the only billionaire on the trip. Trump and the crown prince joined forces to open a U.S.-Saudi investment forum for big-money players from the two nations, with speakers from U.S. firms like Citigroup, BlackRock and Palantir. The White House claims Trump “secured $600 billion in deals with the Saudi government and firms.” But, according to The New York Times, “the details the White House provided were vague and totaled less than half that number. And a closer look at the projects the administration provided shows several were already in the works before Mr. Trump took office.” But Trump claimed a big win, and so the president responsible for the “Muslim ban” posed onstage in front of a massive Saudi flag and was applauded. Trump had some other big gifts ready, too. The president announced a $142 billion arms agreement to provide the Saudis with U.S. weapons and defense contractors to maintain them. He also announced that he plans to lift sanctions on Syria, which Trump said was at the behest of the Saudis. “Oh, what I do for the crown prince,” he said from the stage. While that announcement was a good one and those sanctions on Syria should be dropped, we should not drop them as a favor to the Saudi crown prince who threw $2 billion at your son-in-law. It’s also worth noting that before that announcement, Syria’s leader offered to build a Trump Tower in Damascus and said he would give the U.S. mineral rights contracts in his country, according to several sources familiar with the efforts who spoke with Reuters. Mideast diplomacy is one of the most complicated, fraught areas of American foreign policy, and out of the gate, Trump is basically just going down a list of policies that the Saudis and their allies wanted. Policywise, some of those concessions are better than others; corrupt processes can sometimes accidentally create a decent policy here and there. But they’re not policies so much as presents for his overseas buddies, and, in return, those buddies are giving him what he wants. Which brings us, of course, to the Qatari jumbo jet. A special Boeing 747 that has been called a “palace of the sky” and a “flying mansion.” A luxury item worth $400 million and gifted to Trump by the Qatari royal family over the weekend. It is full of leather, gold and burl wood accents. It sports at least three lounges, two bedrooms, nine bathrooms, five galleys and a private office. Trump is palpably stoked out of his shoes about this thing, like a very rich kid on Christmas morning getting the world’s most expensive toy. Accepting this jet would be the most shockingly corrupt act by a president in the history of the presidency. It violates not only the spirit of the Constitution, but literally the text. However, according to Trump, not taking it would be “stupid.” It seems the only thing that unites the policies Trump has announced on his Middle East tour so far is that they are exactly what the Gulf states wanted. The Gulf states don’t have huge armies, but they have a lot of oil and a lot of money, and they use it to extend their geopolitical dominance. It makes sense, this is the place Trump feels most at home because these countries get Trump in a way they never got any other American president. That’s because this American president openly admires despots and envies what they have. The Gulf states that are hosting Trump understand that. They recognize he is not there for 330 million Americans. He is there for himself, and they are there to indulge him. It’s not because Trump is a unique force of nature. He is not special; he is just easy. He’s not even the first foreign leader to be gifted a 747 by the Qataris. Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan got a half-billion-dollar jumbo jet back in 2018. But this is the thing: The Gulf states have been doing this forever. They don’t have huge armies, but they have a lot of oil and a lot of money, and they use it to extend their geopolitical dominance. That only goes so far with a traditional, law-abiding American administration. However, with Trump, a man not just willing but thirsty to trade on the trappings of the office that American voters bestowed on him, the sky is the limit.

Title: Quantum Threat? BlackRock Flags Future Risk In Bitcoin ETF Filing
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/quantum-threat-blackrock-flags-future-risk-in-bitcoin-etf-filing/
Time Published: 2025-05-14T15:00:28Z
Full Content:
BlackRock has added a warning about quantum computing to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing. Based on reports, the asset manager sees a future risk that ultra-powerful machines might crack the math securing Bitcoin. This is the first time BlackRock has flagged this concern in its spot Bitcoin ETF paperwork. According to the updated regulatory filing on May 9, BlackRock now lists “quantum computing” among possible threats to its Bitcoin ETF. The trust holds about $64 billion in net assets, making it the largest spot Bitcoin fund on record. Company lawyers say that if quantum processors become strong enough, they could decrypt private keys and put wallet security in jeopardy. It’s a standard move in ETF filings to note every conceivable risk, even if it feels far-off. Based on reports, worries kicked up last December when Google unveiled Willow, a chip claimed to solve certain tasks in minutes that would take today’s supercomputers 10 septillion years. A few months later, Microsoft introduced Majorana 1 to tackle long-standing scaling hurdles. Those announcements set off alarm bells in the crypto world. In theory, a quantum device running Shor’s algorithm could factor the large numbers behind Bitcoin’s elliptic-curve signatures. In practice, we’re still in the early, error-prone “NISQ” era, so real attacks remain at least years away. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, surfaced another angle in February. He suggested that once quantum hackers can break old private keys, they might recover Bitcoin from the roughly 3.7 million coins considered lost forever. Ardoino stressed that quantum machines are still distant from cracking 256-bit security, so no coins will reappear anytime soon. Crypto analyst Willy Woo jumped in, asking whether Google, a government agency, or a new startup would be first to seize those dormant assets. He figures the $350 billion in lost coins could spur fresh quantum investment if those keys ever become vulnerable. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in more cash than ever. Data from Farside Investors shows over $41 billion in net inflows since these funds launched in January. On May 8, weekly ETF inflows topped the previous all-time high of $40 billion. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas called lifetime net flows “the hardest metric to grow,” yet ETFs raced to new highs despite recent market jitters. Investors appear focused on price moves today, not on the quantum questions of tomorrow. In the months ahead, crypto developers and standards groups will work on “post-quantum” signature schemes. If they stay on schedule, Bitcoin networks could adopt new, quantum-resistant algorithms long before any real threat appears. For now, the market’s heavy inflows suggest that mainstream buyers aren’t yet spooked by next-generation computing power.

Title: Next Crypto to Explode as VanEck Launches US Treasury Fund Tokens on Ethereum and Solana

Proving there’s never a dull moment in the crypto market, yet another US asset manager – VanEck – is embracing the digital-assets era by launching a tokenized US Treasury fund. That’s good news for the traditional and crypto finance worlds, as well as the next crypto to explode. The VanEck Treasury Fund (VBILL) is a blockchain-based investment vehicle that provides digital access to short-term US government bonds. So whereas those bonds were traditionally accessed through banks and brokers, qualified investors can now access them with stablecoins, like $USDC. By the way, by ‘qualified,’ we mean large. VBILL requires a minimum investment of $1M on Ethereum, and $100K on the other blockchains it’s available on. Those include Solana, BNB Chain, and Avalanche networks. VanEck is no newcomer to the crypto scene – it already issues spot $BTC and $ETH ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and ETNs (exchange-traded notes). And now it’s following the lead of BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and other firms by tokenizing traditional assets. In another positive move for crypto, cross-border banking giant Standard Charter is also increasing its crypto activity. Standard Charter is now collaborating with digital-asset prime brokerage FalconX, which will integrate the bank’s forex services and infrastructure to provide its institutional clients with a broader range of offerings. This comes after the recent announcement of a partnership with OKX that enables institutional clients to use crypto as collateral. According to a Standard Global press release, the collaboration ‘continues FalconX’s efforts to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets with enterprise-grade infrastructure’. As digital assets are increasingly embraced by the traditional finance sector worldwide, it’s great news for the crypto market – and investors. With the Bitcoin price back up above the $100K mark, the market is looking bullish. And what’s good for the $BTC is generally good for other tokens. If you’re looking to invest in what could be the next crypto to explode, here are options well worth considering – including the best presale tokens of the year. The Solana blockchain is second only to Ethereum in terms of market dominance and the number of tokens. It’s fast and has relatively low transaction costs. But Solana is also plagued by network congestion and failed transactions. That’s where Solaxy ($SOLX) steps up to the plate. This meme coin is introducing the first-ever Layer-2 Solana platform – and that’s a big deal in the crypto world. Solaxy is building on Solana’s strong points (speed, low costs) and adding to it. The $SOLX project has solid tokenomics, with 30% allocated to development. That will be an important aspect of its long-term success. It’s also why $SOLX could be the next crypto to explode. Investor interest has so far been impressive. This is one of the best meme coins on presale – it has already raised $35.5M in funding. We expect big things to come from Solaxy after the presale ends and it lists on DEXs and CEXs. And that means there’s no better time to invest in $SOLX, with its current presale price of $0.001724 and 113% staking rewards. Take a look at our complete guide to buying in Solaxy – as well as our $SOLX price prediction – to find out how to make the most of what has the potential to be the next crypto to explode. In another crypto first, enter BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – the one and only meme coin that tracks Bitcoin’s price. And when that price reaches a milestone, $BTCBULL holders will be airdropped $BTC as a reward. Considering $BTC’s recent bull run, there’s little reason not to expect its price to hit the $150K, $200K, and onwards to $1M in the not-too-distant future. It’s exactly at those milestones that holders of $BTCBULL will receive their own $BTC in the Best Wallet app. The $BTC rewards will be airdropped each time the price grows by $50K. And in-between – at $125K, $175K, and $225K thresholds – $BTCBULL tokens will be burned, adding to the scarcity (and potentially the value) of the token. If you’re keen to ride the $BTC bull run, you may find our full guide to buying the Bitcoin Bull Token helpful. It explains how to buy this top new crypto token – $BTCBULL – at its current price of $0.00251, with 72% APY staking. ChainGPT ($CGPT) is the native token of the ChainGPT ecosystem. This Web3 platform combines artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to provide AI-powered tools that pretty much anyone can use – individuals or businesses – without having advanced technical knowledge. Among the ChainGPT AI offerings are a smart contract generator and auditor; NFT generator; trading assistant; Web3 chatbot; and a tool that enables you to build an AI agent (like MIND of Pepe, for instance) without coding. All those features are powered by $CGPT token. $CGPT holders also have voting rights in decision-making. And with growing adoption of crypto as a legitimate asset, this may well mean the $CGPT is among the best altcoins – and the next crypto to explode. Unlike $SOLX and $BTCBULL, $CGPT is not on presale. It is currently listed on both CEXs (including Binance, ByBit, MEXC, and KuCoin) and DEXs – PancakeSwap and Uniswap. One $CGPT currently costs $0.141, making it an affordable investment with potentially explosive gains. Touch wood, but things appear to be looking up for the crypto market. That sentiment is clear with the likes of the VanEck Treasury Fund being launched, and Standard Global partnering with FalconX. A recovery in the Bitcoin price also signals light on the horizon. And with that, the next crypto with the potential to explode – Solaxy, BTC Bull Token, and ChainGPT among them – may mean highly impressive gains.

Title: Why Catalytic Capital Needs a Better Definition (Blog)

The decline and fall of ESG offers a cautionary tale for social impact financing and highlights the need for the sector to sharpen its understanding of catalytic capital. We propose a potential definitional framework for catalytic capital to drive clarity, measurement, and greater market participation. The decline and fall of ESG offers a cautionary tale for social impact financing and highlights the need for the sector to sharpen its understanding of catalytic capital. We propose a potential definitional framework for catalytic capital to drive clarity, measurement, and greater market participation. By Savannah Baum, Olivia Rosen, Sean Sellers & Billy Silk May 14, 2025 On the heels of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards exploded onto the scene as a way for companies to focus on sustainability in business decisions and for investors to prioritize socially responsible companies. In the years that followed, trillions of dollars poured into ESG funds. But cracks started to emerge. As journalists looked under the hood of ESG funds, they found investments in oil and gas majors. In 2021, Tariq Fancy, former chief investment officer for sustainable investing at Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager, penned a scathing essay that the ESG label was being used to dupe the American public with greenwashing. Backlash against the consideration of social factors in investments also began to grow; in recent years, 19 US states have passed 42 anti-ESG laws preventing public fund managers from taking social considerations into account. At its core, ESG’s problem stems from a lack of clarity. There are, of course, innumerable instances of ESG-focused funds leading important change globally. Many have helped reform operational and governance standards within corporations, and forced internal dialogue and measurement efforts to gauge social progress. But in the absence of clear, value-based standards, it’s often just a buzzword. Its loosely defined, “yes and” posture allows companies and investors to toss it around to validate their commitment to social good without having to meet specific requirements. Companies’ loquacious race to classify themselves as “ESG-approved” has led to justified attack, with shareholder support for ESG declining and institutional investors citing ESG fatigue. The ESG movement may be too far gone to revive. But its fate can help shape the development of another type of impact financing: catalytic capital. A sharper, shared understanding of this form of risk-tolerant investment, which takes on risk to validate a new business model or market with the aim of ultimately drawing in more capital, can dramatically increase the volume and scope of funding for social impact. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. To scale promising social enterprises, leaders of social change need access to context-appropriate capital—funding that considers and addresses the unique risks and needs (such as limited liquidity and longer timelines) that ventures in challenging markets face. This type of investment is widely known as catalytic capital and is remarkably good at market building. According to Convergence, every $1 of catalytic capital mobilizes $4 of downstream traditional investment for social impact efforts. A compelling example is FarmWorks, a social enterprise that provides farming inputs, finance, training, and market access to smallholder farmers in Kenya. In 2020, the company’s co-founders Yi Li and Peter Muthee began looking for investors who understood the unique needs of building an agricultural business in the region. FarmWorks’ business model was fundamentally different than the high-margin software businesses typically favored by venture capital. As Li explains, "To sell a kilo of tomatoes, you're growing another kilo of tomatoes," underscoring the methodical nature of agricultural scaling compared to typical venture-backed businesses. Building FarmWorks also meant developing extensive logistics networks, managing relationships with thousands of farmers, and operating warehouses across the region. Like many social ventures in emerging economies, the company also faced limited supply and payment infrastructure, complex distribution channels, and customers with constrained purchasing power. Its path to profitability would be longer, and its exit strategy less defined than what traditional investors typically sought. As Li told us, "For businesses like FarmWorks that are not disrupting a model but are significantly improving the efficiency and scale of possibility [in] a traditional sector, patience is required.” In 2021, Acumen’s Resilient Agriculture Fund stepped in to provide pre-seed, patient capital, a form of catalytic capital geared toward longer horizons. This allowed the team to honor their ambitious mission sustainably without short-sighted pressures of quick exits and high returns. The company used initial funding to grow its services into an integrated suite of end-to-end support, including financing for low-cost machinery and reliable access to markets, and became the largest domestic distributor of fresh vegetables in Kenya within four years. Today, it works with 3,000 farmers to bring produce to market, and sells more than 1,000 tons of local staples and high-value crops monthly. A recent $4.1 million, pre-series A funding round—led by Acumen Resilient Agriculture Fund and supported by Livelihood Impact Fund, Vested World, family offices, and angel investors—signaled confidence in both the company’s market opportunity and ability to scale systems-level impact. Estimates vary, but proxies suggest that catalytic capital constitutes less than 0.01 percent of global investment capital. And while the impact investing market has grown to approximately $1.1 trillion, only a fraction of this sum can be considered catalytic capital. This scarcity of flexible funding for early-stage social ventures that are working in challenging but promising markets isn't just about numbers; it represents a tremendous amount of transformative impact left unrealized. On the surface, the definition of catalytic capital may seem clear: flexible financing for impact ventures that investors can tailor to take on unique risks. But go a level deeper, and questions proliferate. What kinds of risk? What kinds of financing? Different organizations perceive catalytic capital differently. For example, some emphasize concessionary returns that trade lower financial gains for social impact, some focus on taking on greater market risk, and some aim to benefit specific groups of people. Some argue that any concessionary instrument (including a loan or a grant) qualifies, while others insist that the investment must pull more traditional financiers into these markets via blended transactions or follow-on investments. During our time as MBA candidates pursuing social impact research, we’ve spoken with many investors and professors experienced with catalytic capital who believe some definitional flexibility is good. Rather than gatekeeping on semantics, they believe maintaining some openness to different forms of catalytic capital helps bring more investors into the market. We don’t necessarily disagree. But they also recognize the downsides of ambiguity. Inconsistent definitions present a number of problems. For example, it’s time-consuming and challenging for social entrepreneurs to look across the wide range of impact capital providers to identify who might be the right investor for their unique needs. Catalytic investors meanwhile struggle to collaborate on deal flow to solve market gaps, and follow-on or commercial co-investors struggle to compare deals side-by-side. The result is an inefficient catalytic capital market with limited impact. Delineating catalytic capital by the mechanisms through which it operates, however, can improve everyone’s understanding, more efficiently match market needs with particular investor flexibilities, and ultimately scale more impact through greater capital flows. For example, a biotech startup developing a maternal health diagnostic may need highly flexible, long-term capital due to high R&D costs, regulatory hurdles, and a delayed path to revenue. This would make it better suited to non-concessionary patient capital. In contrast, a community-owned broadband provider serving rural areas might achieve steady revenue relatively quickly through subscriber fees but operate with intentionally limited margins to keep services affordable. While it can generate cash flow, its social mission caps its returns. This makes it a better fit for concessionary capital that prioritizes impact over market-rate returns. Both models create meaningful impact but require different capital structures to thrive. Catalytic capital is intended to “go first”—derisking an asset or market with the goal of attracting additional investments, often from conventional investors who wouldn’t otherwise participate. It’s thus important to ensure that conventional investors can compare deals apples-to-apples—including elements like impact metrics, mobilization goals, or market forecasts—so that they don’t walk away from the market altogether. As noted earlier, investors aren’t monolithic. Catalytic and commercial investors have unique preferences; their motivations, risk appetites, and returns expectations differ. One catalytic investor may be willing to seek concessionary returns on loans, while another might sacrifice on return horizons. Co-investors are similarly diverse; what makes an investment too risky for one commercial lender will differ from another. And certainly, investee needs vary widely. In addition, while many impact investors do great work determining the needs of specific markets to close financing gaps, they often do so in silos. No coordinating body actively tracks and shares financing gaps across markets or maps where specific investors are most willing to take on specific risks. Given this, a lot of great deals that aren’t a fit for one investor likely die when a better-suited capital provider might have carried them forward. Clearer definitions can address these market failures in several ways. For one, they reduce transaction friction for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are too often left in the dark, unable to determine which capital stacks and investors best match their business needs. Better definitions for the type of risks individual catalytic investors are willing to take on equips entrepreneurs with the knowledge they need to find the right investors. In addition, they improve market efficiency by better matching capital to opportunity. Although the motivations and capabilities of catalytic investors vary widely, they often cluster around similar opportunities while leaving other needs unmet. More clearly distinguishing the different dimensions of catalytic capital can help them identify the right fit. Clearer definitions also enable better investor coordination. When investors can clearly articulate their risk appetites and preferred impact dimensions, they can more effectively combine forces. They help align traditional investors with relevant catalytic investors who have the right tools to sufficiently de-risk specific areas of concern. Given this opportunity to create a more robust and responsive impact capital market, we propose a new framework for defining catalytic capital that has two parts: requisite properties and dynamic attributes. We do not propose this framework with the expectation that it answers every ambiguous question around catalytic capital, or even that this is the “right” set of guardrails for all catalytic market participants. We hope this framework can serve as a starting point for discussion on the anatomy and gradient of catalytic investments, with both traditional and non-traditional dimensions. It also aims to strike a balance between rigor, clarity, and flexibility. The first part, requisite properties, offers a baseline understanding of what catalytic capital “must be and do,” and includes three criteria: The second part of the framework then proposes that catalytic capital must be dynamic in at least one of five (but usually more) specific attributes: An investment does not need to fall in the leftmost box of every dimension in the chart to be catalytic. Indeed, many catalytic investments incorporate more traditional features across several dimensions. For example, investors might consider an investment that deviates meaningfully from at least one standard commercial norm (the chart’s rightmost boxes) somewhat catalytic. A debt instrument with conventional liquidity and a standard return timeline might offer concessionary returns and take a first-loss position in the capital stack (the order in which investors are repaid if the company defaults) if the investee defaults. Investors might also consider an investment that is non-concessionary but allows abnormally long timelines for return catalytic. For example, an investor in carbon projects might demand strong returns (say, a 15 percent internal rate of return) but allow investees to repay them over 15-20 years instead of the more traditional 8-10 years. Understanding where an investment falls within this taxonomy enables more effective market engagement, offering a shared language and clearer perspective on what type of catalytic capital is and is not being deployed. In the absence of widely adopted, data-driven approaches or logic-tested theories of change, investor commitment to ESG has proven fleeting. Better definitions and specific language can help catalytic capital avoid the same fate, and provide a more reasoned commitment to market development and systemic change. The framework presented here is not an exercise in dogmatism, attempting to set forth rigid definitions that limit participation. It is an attempt to support the discipline and rigor of like-minded entrepreneurs and investors in pursuit of more effective collaboration. Incremental changes, driven by clearer frameworks and objective standards, will ultimately lead to much greater impact than chasing buzzwords or hype. More stories like that of FarmWorks are waiting to be written, and their chapters can unfold when visionary entrepreneurs align with the right investors and timing. Some may want ambiguity to persist in the name of inclusion, but allowing anyone to call their capital catalytic risks a more troubling exclusion: holding communities back from building and sharing a more prosperous future. Developing a shared understanding in service of better coordination is an important next step in the field’s evolution. Support SSIR’s coverage of cross-sector solutions to global challenges.

Morning Rundown: The fight over Trump’s agenda bill, Gavin Newsom’s shift on homelessness, and Memphis residents take on Elon Musk Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Trump offers an optimistic vision of relations with countries in the Middle East. The Supreme Court’s upcoming hearing on birthright citizenship will tackle the power of lower courts. And the Menendez brothers were resentenced in their parents’ 1989 killings. Here’s what to know today. President Donald Trump spoke of a future for the Middle East steeped in prosperity, business deals and technological advances as he announced the U.S. would end sanctions against war-torn Syria and signed a $600 billion investment agreement with Saudi Arabia in his first visit to the region since his second term began. He also offered an image of rising regional powers steeped in homegrown economic self-development. Applause followed Trump’s promise to withdraw sanctions in Syria. But in announcing his “fervent wish” that Saudi Arabia join the Abraham Accords, the diplomatic agreements Trump’s first administration made between Israel and several Arab nations, the president drew silence from the room. The ongoing conflict with Hamas remains a sticking point for Saudi Arabia, which has reaffirmed its support for a Palestinian state in recent months. This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. The $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the U.S. includes $20 billion in AI data centers and other technologies, while companies like Google, Salesforce, Uber and Oracle will invest $80 billion in projects across both countries, according to a White House statement. Also in attendance at yesterday’s ceremonial events were Sam Altman of Open AI, Palantir CEO Alex Carp, billionaire Blackrock co-founder Larry Fink and the leaders of companies like Amazon and Coca-Cola, to pitch Saudi investors as the kingdom promises to spend on technology, infrastructure and more. Elon Musk was also present. Trump’s rhetoric and vision of a prosperous future with the region contrasted the words of former President Joe Biden, who deemed Saudi Arabia “a pariah” before taking office. And while rejecting the idea that U.S. policy should judge foreign leaders’ morals, he swiped at destructive forces in the region, calling out Iran for causing “unthinkable suffering in Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and beyond.” Today, Trump met with Syria's new president in a major breakthrough for the former jihadi commander. Read the full story here. Also looming over Trump’s visit this week is Qatar’s proposed gift of a luxury plane to be used as a new Air Force One for the president. Trump has said he would accept it. However, aviation experts said converting the 747 jet would cost over $1 billion and might not be completed by the end of Trump’s term in 2029. The jet would have to be dismantled, part by part, to ensure there were no listening devices or other vulnerabilities, and then fitted with sophisticated systems for secure government communications. That’s not all. The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments tomorrow over President Donald Trump’s plan to end birthright citizenship, but the court is not actually using the cases before it to give the final word on whether Trump can reinterpret the long-understood meaning of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment. Instead, it will focus on the question of whether lower-court judges have the authority to block the policy nationwide. The Trump administration is asking the court to limit the scope of the birthright citizenship injunctions so that they apply only to individual people, organizations that sued or potentially the 22 states that challenged Trump’s executive order. In recent months, his administration and allies have raged at judges for issuing “universal injunctions” concerning birthright citizenship and other policies which a DOJ official characterized as a “direct attack” on presidential power. While broad injunctions have also been used against former Presidents Joe Biden (18 during his term) and Barack Obama (19 during his two terms), Trump, who saw 86 injunctions during his first term, has sought to use executive power to circumvent Congress more than his predecessors. Five of the six members of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority have, in various cases, raised concerns about universal injunctions and suggested they should be curbed in certain circumstances. Read the full story here. R&B singer Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, took the stand on the second day of Sean “Diddy” Combs’ federal sex trafficking trial, detailing years of alleged abuse by the music mogul. Ventura is the prosecution’s star witness, and her 2023 lawsuit against Combs, which was settled privately one day after it was filed, became a framework for the government’s sprawling case against the music mogul. In her first day on the stand, Ventura, 38, gave graphic and emotional testimony of alleged physical abuse and control that included dayslong, drug-fueled sexual encounters with male escorts under Combs’ direction. She said she first participated in the “freak-offs” around 2008, when she was 22, and they continued while she dated Combs on and off before the pair split in 2018. The sex would occur in Combs’ homes, her homes and hotel suites around the world, and Ventura said they might find escorts off Craigslist, paying them between $1,500 and $6,000. Combs appeared to listen intently during the testimony. “I felt pretty horrible about myself,” Ventura said. “I felt disgusting. I felt humiliated.” Ventura, who first met Combs in 2005 when she was 19 and signed a 10-album deal with his Bad Boy label, also testified that her music career stalled when arranging “freak offs” for Combs “became a job.” She went on to say that angering Combs would result in physical and ongoing psychological abuse. Read more about Ventura’s testimony and her allegations against Combs. She’s expected to take the stand again today, and her testimony could last through the week. NBC News is following the trial closely. Sign up for the Diddy on Trial newsletter to receive the latest news, including insights and analysis from our team inside the courtroom. After months of delays, opposition from Los Angeles County’s district attorney and a series of witnesses who advocated for them, Erik and Lyle Menendez are now eligible for parole in the 1989 killings of their parents at their Beverly Hills home. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic said in a ruling yesterday that the brothers would be resentenced to 50 years to life, adding that he did not believe they posed an “unreasonable risk” if released. Now, a California parole board will weigh whether the men are suitable for release and is expected to submit its clemency recommendation next month to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The brothers, who have been serving life sentences without the possibility of parole, gave statements after yesterday’s ruling. Lyle said he made no excuses for killing his parents or for seeking to have people perjure themselves on his behalf. Erik echoed those comments. Read the full story here. I’ve always been fascinated with learning about Louisiana’s history and unique cultural stories. As someone who has done extensive family research myself in the state, it’s exciting to uncover unexpected connections. The process feels like a scavenger hunt. So when I started seeing chatter about Pope Leo XIV’s ties to New Orleans on social media, I connected with genealogist Alex DaPaul Lee, who has assisted me in previous archival searches for my reporting in Louisiana. He told me that he had discovered evidence of Leo’s ancestral roots, which show his Creole background through his great-great-grandmother, Celeste Lemelle. But historic documentation from Louisiana, as we saw while looking through the Lemelle family’s records, can reveal both the highs and lows of history: ownership, status, literacy, freedom and wealth, juxtaposed with racism, social class divides, slavery and discrimination. All of it adds spice and complexity to the perfect bowl of gumbo. The resulting story of Pope Leo’s lineage shines a light on our imperfect American history while bringing an extra layer of pride to people from Louisiana. — Maya Eaglin, NBC News correspondent Wondering how to treat scars and reduce their appearance?

Title: Merz woos Trump with invitation to German ancestral village

The chancellor appears to want to appeal to the American president’s German ancestry in order to improve frayed relations. BERLIN — Germany’s new chancellor has a plan for getting on U.S. President Donald Trump’s good side: appeal to his German ancestry. Friedrich Merz said he has invited Trump to the western German village where the president’s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born and raised before emigrating to the United States at the age of 16 in 1885 “I’ve invited him to Germany, to visit his ancestral town,” Merz said at a business summit in Berlin. “I’ll go there with him.” It’s not yet clear whether Trump will take up Merz on the offer. Despite Trump’s frequent criticisms of Germany, a country he had repeatedly called “delinquent” on defense spending, the president has often highlighted his German roots. “I have German in my blood,” he said during a 2019 meeting with Angela Merkel as the then-chancellor reacted with a look of amusement at that phrasing. The invitation comes as Merz prepares for his first official trip to Washington as chancellor. Although it is unclear when the visit will take place, Merz has said it will happen “soon.” A former chairman of BlackRock Germany and longtime supporter of the transatlantic alliance, Merz has often said he would appeal to Trump’s love of making “deals” in order to strengthen frayed relations between the U.S. and Germany over an array of issues, from Ukraine to tariffs. Merz and Trump have spoken twice since the German election. Their most recent call took place during Merz’s recent visit to Kyiv along with French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. It’s not clear whether Trump would be well received in Kallstadt, his grandfather’s birthplace. In 2016, ahead of his first term in office, many in the town told POLITICO they didn’t care for the then-presidential candidate. “We really don’t give a damn about Trump,” one resident said at the time. “He’s never been here, and he apparently doesn’t care about us, either.” Germany’s foreign minister said the country “is ready” to follow a 5 percent of GDP spending target, but that’s dismaying his left-wing partners. Restoring conscription would mark a major policy shift. Officials say the group planned explosive parcel attacks to spread fear and destabilize the country. The group, which opposes Germany’s constitutional order, is headed by a self-appointed monarch calling himself “King Peter.”

Title: From Fringe to Foundation: Coinbase’s Debut Signals Crypto’s Coming of Age (Nkahiseng Ralepeli)

For years, digital assets carried a whiff of skepticism in traditional finance circles – a perceived “taboo stain” that serious institutions were hesitant to touch. Many remembered the early days of Bitcoin’s wild price swings, high-profile exchange hacks, and regulators sounding alarms. Crypto companies struggled for mainstream respect; a large pension fund or bank wouldn’t want to be caught with a crypto exchange on its balance sheet. But Coinbase’s S&P 500 inclusion emphatically wipes away much of that historical stigma. It signals that crypto businesses have matured into credible, profitable enterprises worthy of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Fortune 500 stalwarts. Inclusion in the S&P isn’t arbitrary – a company must meet strict criteria for market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability and sustained profitability. By meeting those standards, Coinbase essentially earned a mainstream seal of approval, demonstrating that a company built on crypto can be as fundamentally sound as any in traditional finance. Just a few years ago, major indices and investors kept digital asset companies at arm’s length. Now we have Indices effectively declaring that at least one crypto firm has “made it” into the upper echelon of public companies. The symbolism is powerful. In practical terms, it means Wall Street’s perception of crypto has undergone a dramatic turnaround. What was once seen as a risky curiosity is now recognized as a permanent fixture. Legacy institutions – from investment funds to brokerage houses – are increasingly engaging with blockchain infrastructure, exploring digital custody solutions, and even trading tokenized assets. With Coinbase now in the same index as banks and tech giants, the message is clear: crypto and digital assets are now a credible part of global finance’s fabric, woven into indexes and portfolios worldwide. Moreover, Coinbase’s induction may pave the way for other digital asset firms to join major indices in the future. It’s a precedent that says crypto companies can graduate from the periphery to the very core of equity markets. The “taboo” has truly been, at least to a large degree, broken. Mainstream Milestones: Wall Street and Payment Giants Embrace Crypto Coinbase ’s S&P 500 debut isn’t happening in isolation. It caps off a series of milestones that have steadily blurred the line between traditional finance (TradFi) and the crypto world. Over the past two years, some of the biggest names in global finance and tech have made decisive moves to integrate digital assets into their offerings, further validating that crypto is here to stay. Consider just a few of these developments: Seriously, the examples are literally endless. I am picking a handful so as to not bore you, the reader to death, but you can read more of my thoughts regarding digital assets every Monday. Adapt or Be Left Behind: A Warning to the Skeptics The convergence of traditional finance and crypto is no longer speculative – it’s structural. And that carries a warning for any institutions still refusing to acknowledge crypto’s rise. In 2025, to ignore crypto is akin to ignoring the internet in 2000 – a recipe for irrelevance. The past year has shown a “join or miss out” dynamic: those who integrated digital assets reaped the benefits of new revenue streams, broader client bases, and improved tech infrastructure, while those who stayed on the sidelines watched innovation pass them by. Regulators and policymakers are also coming around (albeit cautiously), providing clearer frameworks that remove excuses for institutional inaction. With reputable players in the game and safeguards maturing, the barrier to entry for traditional institutions is lower than ever. Let me be clear: The taboo is gone. The credibility is proven. The demand is undeniable. This is no longer a game of maybe's. This is the new reality. Crypto is not an outsider anymore, but an integral part of the financial structure. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 is just the latest sign that the walls are down and a new, hybrid financial era is taking shape. The old skeptics have less and less to point to as justification for shunning digital assets. Final Thought If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em – or better yet, index them. Coinbase’s addition to the S&P 500 isn’t just a victory for one company – it’s a milestone for an entire industry. The bulls of Wall Street and the bulls of crypto are finally running in the same direction. And those still waiting for crypto to “go away” might want to check the index — it’s already here.

Title: VanEck to compete with BlackRock in tokenized US Treasuries race, launching on Ethereum, BNB, Solana, Avalanche

VanEck’s VBILL fund marks a new era for qualified investors with strategic multi-chain deployment and stablecoin integration. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Traditional finance heavyweight VanEck has entered the real-world asset (RWA) arena with the launch of VBILL, a tokenized fund offering exposure to short-term U.S. Treasuries across Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Solana. The fund marks a significant step in the institutionalization of tokenized finance, as asset managers race to offer blockchain-native, yield-generating alternatives to crypto-native treasuries. Structured as a BVI-domiciled fund, VBILL is managed by Van Eck Absolute Return Advisers, with Securitize acting as the placement agent. The fund is open to qualified investors only, with a $100,000 minimum investment across most supported chains and a $1 million minimum on Ethereum. Under the hood, the fund holds U.S. Treasury bills, custodied by State Street Bank & Trust, with on-chain NAV data supplied daily via RedStone oracles. Subscriptions and redemptions occur via USDC, and token transfers across blockchains are made possible using the Wormhole protocol. VBILL also features atomic redemption into Agora’s AUSD stablecoin, allowing for frictionless liquidity pathways between yield and stablecoin markets. “By bringing U.S. Treasuries on-chain, we are providing investors with a secure, transparent, and liquid tool for cash management,” said Kyle DaCruz, Director of Digital Assets Product at VanEck. VanEck’s move follows BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, launched in March 2024, which brought the world’s largest asset manager into the tokenization race. With VBILL, VanEck goes a step further by deploying across four chains from day one, a signal of growing confidence in cross-chain infrastructure. The tokenized T-bill sector has grown explosively, recently surpassing $6.8 billion in total value locked, a more than 5x increase year-over-year. VanEck’s launch appears to be both a strategic counter to BUIDL and an effort to offer more flexibility and composability to crypto-native treasury desks and stablecoin providers. Despite its blockchain-native architecture, VBILL is limited to accredited investors via exemptions under Regulation D and Rule 506(c). Retail participation remains out of reach, and the fund’s $100,000+ ticket size reinforces its institutional focus. While State Street custody provides traditional security guarantees, the product still inherits smart contract risk and cross-chain bridge vulnerabilities. Key open questions remain around redemption queues and liquidity provisioning during market stress, especially for users accessing the fund across different blockchain environments. “This collaboration merges the best of Securitize’s tokenization model with VanEck’s expertise… demonstrating tokenization’s ability to create new market opportunities,” said Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize. With BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and now VanEck diving into the RWA space, tokenized money-market products are quickly becoming a new battleground for traditional asset managers. Each is experimenting with different blends of on-chain transparency, liquidity access, and compliance guardrails to capture a growing pool of crypto-native capital seeking real-world yield. VBILL’s multi-chain rollout, stablecoin integration, and institutional pedigree could make it a standout choice for crypto treasurers seeking safe yield with composability. As tokenization of risk-free assets gains traction, the line between TradFi and DeFi continues to blur, and the world’s safest collateral is now just a smart contract away.

Title: eToro locks in $4.2B valuation, tests IPO waters with Nasdaq listing
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/etoro-locks-in-4-2b-valuation-tests-ipo-waters-with-nasdaq-listing/
Time Published: 2025-05-14T05:21:10Z

The stock brokerage and burgeoning crypto platform eToro is stepping into the Wall Street spotlight, having priced its initial public offering at $52 per share. This move signals the company’s readiness to gauge investor appetite for new listings in a market still finding its footing after a period of volatility. The Israel-based firm successfully raised nearly $310 million through the sale of almost 6 million shares, a transaction that pegs the company’s valuation at approximately $4.2 billion. This pricing lands above its initially targeted range of $46 to $50 per share. Alongside the company’s offering, existing investors are also divesting an additional tranche of nearly 6 million shares, further shaping the public float. The path to this moment has been paved with cautious optimism. The IPO market had shown signs of a potential resurgence earlier in the year, particularly following President Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, which some hoped would break a prolonged drought influenced by rising interest rates and persistent inflationary concerns. Indeed, CoreWeave’s successful March debut provided a glimmer of hope for other aspiring public companies, including eToro, online lending giant Klarna, and ticket reseller StubHub. However, this nascent recovery faced headwinds. “Tariff uncertainty temporarily stalled those plans,” the original article noted, capturing a period of market jitters. Consequently, eToro, which had filed for its IPO in March, alongside Klarna and StubHub, opted to shelve its immediate ambitions as markets grappled with the implications of trade policy shifts. Now, as eToro prepares for its Nasdaq debut under the ticker symbol ETOR, its performance may serve as a significant litmus test for the broader public market’s willingness to embrace risk. The IPO landscape is showing renewed activity; digital physical therapy company Hinge Health has commenced its IPO roadshow, revealing in a Tuesday filing its intention to raise up to $437 million. Also on Tuesday, fintech innovator Chime submitted its prospectus to the SEC, indicating its own public market aspirations. This follows the April move by another trading application, Webull, which went public via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Founded in 2007 by brothers Yoni and Ronen Assia along with David Ring, eToro operates in a competitive landscape, challenging established players like Robinhood. Its revenue model is built on fees tied to trading activities, such as spreads on buy and sell orders, and non-trading operations including withdrawals and currency conversions. The company’s financial trajectory has been notable, with net income soaring almost thirteenfold last year to $192.4 million, a substantial increase from $15.3 million the previous year. A significant driver of this growth has been its expanding crypto business. Revenue from cryptoassets more than tripled to exceed $12 million in 2024, and crypto-related activities accounted for a quarter of its net trading contribution last year, up sharply from 10% in the prior year. This isn’t eToro’s maiden voyage into the public offering process. “In 2022, the company scrapped plans to hit the market through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) during a sharp downturn in equity markets,” the source material highlighted. That earlier deal would have valued eToro at a considerably higher figure of more than $10 billion. Despite the previous setback, CEO Yoni Assia remained committed to a public listing. He told CNBC early last year that eToro was still aiming for a market debut but was “evaluating the right opportunity” while building relationships with exchanges, including the Nasdaq. “We definitely are eyeing the public markets,” Assia stated at the time. “I definitely see us becoming eventually a public company.” Adding a vote of confidence to the current offering, eToro disclosed in its prospectus that investment behemoth BlackRock had “expressed interest in buying $100 million in shares at the IPO price.” The company further detailed its plan to sell 5 million shares in the offering, with existing investors and executives slated to sell an additional 5 million. The underwriting syndicate for this significant financial maneuver includes industry heavyweights Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and UBS.

Title: Palantir CEO Alex Karp praises Saudi engineers and takes a swipe at Europe, saying it has 'given up' on AI

At an investment forum in Riyadh, Alex Karp, CEO of defense tech company Palantir Technologies, praised Saudi engineers for meritocracy and patriotism — and took a swipe at Europe over its slow AI adoption. "You're seeing a receptivity in this region, especially in the kingdom," Karp said at the Saudi-US Investment Forum on Tuesday. "But the receptivity is on the back of people who have a deep tradition in engineering excellence and, quite frankly, believe in their own future." Karp was addressing a request from panel host and CNBC anchor Sara Eisen to expand upon a previous comment that the countries and regions that are best utilizing AI right now are the US and the Middle East. "Obviously, the great contradistinction here is Europe, where, you know, it's like people have given up, and we — I really hope that turns around in Europe," he added. The talk came as President Donald Trump received a royal welcome with golden chairs and Arabian horses in Riyadh on Tuesday as he kicked off his Gulf tour. Flanked by executives from Google, Nvidia, BlackRock, and others to discuss AI, defense, and energy with Saudi officials, Trump said he aims to secure $1 trillion in deals. Based on an October 2024 report published by QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, European organizations lag behind their US counterparts by 45 to 70% in terms of AI adoption. And while Europe leads in producing AI semiconductor equipment — machinery and tools used to make semiconductors — the report said that Europe has below 5% market share in areas like raw materials, cloud infrastructure, and supercomputers. "Opportunity remains wide open, but Europe is starting from a disadvantage," the report QuantumBlack wrote. Europe is also known for much more stringent AI regulations. On August 1, 2024, Europe enacted the AI Act, the first-ever legal framework on AI, and established an AI office to oversee the implementation of these regulations. The AI Act is just one part of a wider package of measures that the EU said ensures "trustworthy AI," which explicitly banned practices such as AI-based manipulation and deception, real-time remote biometric identification for law enforcement purposes in public spaces, and individual criminal offense risk assessment. According to the AI Act, ways of using AI, such as robot-assisted surgery and credit scoring, are also categorized as "high-risk" and subjected to strict scrutiny. The best-known European AI company that raised the most amount of funds is French AI startup Mistral, which is backed by over €1 billion in funding. Dubbed as Europe's answer to OpenAI, the company has recently ruled out acquisition and is eyeing an IPO while pushing its open-source AI models and generative chatbot "Le Chat" into new markets.

Posted on 05/13/2025 5:07:00 PM PDT by MinorityRepublican RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — President Trump got the royal treatment on his first stop in Saudi Arabia, as white Arabian horses flanked his motorcade — with adviser Elon Musk in tow. Dozens of Saudis rode on horseback carrying US and Saudi flags as Trump’s motorcade peeled into the Royal Court, where he got a warm welcome before going to a lunch in the palace adorned with chandeliers and marble floors. “I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump told reporters after his arrival, referring to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a friend. He later recalled how “impressed” he was when he first met the 31-year-old MbS back in 2017 during their first visit, and how they quickly became friends. “I like visiting with you, and we’ve known each other very well, and I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump said. The president was escorted into the country by six Saudi F-15s bracketing Air Force One, got a 21-gun salute on arrival, and was met with the level of pomp and circumstance that he was met with during his first trip to the kingdom in his first term. The lunch was attended by members of the Saudi government — as well as a number of tech billionaires and business leaders, including Musk, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, and more. Other tech guests included Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Palantir CEO Alex Karp, Google CIO Ruth Porat, Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey, LinkedIn executive chairman Reid Hoffman — and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez. Musk — who has taken one step back from the Department of Government Efficiency and is largely no longer working from the White House — was spotted shaking hands with MbS.

The lunch was attended by members of the Saudi government — as well as a number of tech billionaires and business leaders, including Musk, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, and more. Other tech guests included Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Palantir CEO Alex Karp, Google CIO Ruth Porat, Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey, LinkedIn executive chairman Reid Hoffman — and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez.

Title: SEC punts decision on crypto ETFs again, final rulings anticipated later in 2025

The regulator postponed decisions on three crypto-related ETFs, while acknowledging 21shares' Dogecoin ETF filing. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission postponed decisions on multiple crypto-related exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications on May 13, including those filed by Grayscale and BlackRock. The delays extend the agency’s review timeline and align with expectations that it will grant no approvals before the final quarter of 2025. Grayscale’s proposed spot ETFs for Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) were deferred. The new filing deadlines for both are August 11 and October 10. The SEC also delayed action on BlackRock’s request to enable in-kind redemptions for its approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF. BlackRock’s request has no updated deadline, which centers on technical mechanics rather than initial approval. Separately, the SEC acknowledged the 19b-4 filing for a 21Shares spot Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF, initiating the official review timeline for the product. This filing begins the countdown toward an eventual decision under the agency’s statutory schedule. The agency’s latest moves follow a broader pattern of staggered reviews across more than 70 crypto ETF proposals, which remain in various evaluation stages. On April 29, the SEC delayed decisions on five other crypto-related ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas described the current cycle of delays as routine. Seyffart said the delay was “expected,” and most of the affected products face final deadlines no earlier than October. Balchunas added that the SEC is unlikely to issue substantive approvals until recently confirmed Chair Paul Atkins completes internal meetings and strategy sessions with staff. He said: “They’ve been taking outside meetings with people. Probably coming up with a strategy. After that, likely approvals.” SEC decisions on crypto ETF applications follow a multi-stage statutory process based on the publication of proposed rule changes in the Federal Register. The agency typically operates on review intervals of 45, 90, 180, and 240 days, allowing multiple opportunities to delay decisions before reaching a final deadline. The regulator’s recent actions are consistent with its historical practice of extending reviews to the full statutory limits before issuing decisions. No ETF in this group faces a final deadline before late in the third quarter, leaving applicants and investors awaiting further clarity on the regulatory trajectory for crypto-linked investment vehicles.

Title: New True chief vows to pay firm's 1st dividend in 25 years
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/3024911/new-true-chief-vows-to-pay-firms-1st-dividend-in-25-years
Time Published: 2025-05-13T22:36:00Z
Full Content:
The newly appointed group chief executive of True Corporation has outlined his mission for the first 100 days, writing a new chapter for the telecom company by continuing its profitability, driving operations of trusted services, and strengthening data centre development. Sigve Brekke vowed True would pay a dividend in 2025 for the first time in more than 25 years as the company has retired all accumulated losses. He also stressed the need to increase True's revenue. The company reported net profit after tax of 1.6 billion baht for the first quarter of 2025, marking a milestone turnaround within two years of its amalgamation with Total Access Communication (dtac). Excluding the impact from one-off items, the normalised profit for the first quarter was 4.3 billion baht. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation have continued to improve since the merger, driven by a reduction in operational expenses from performance focus and financial discipline, along with ongoing benefits from synergies. "Bringing together True and dtac was an astonishing feat. We united two industry leaders with a sharp focus on performance, financial discipline and synergies, we modernised our networks, and infused AI [artificial intelligence] into customer touchpoints," said Mr Brekke. However, he said he is not satisfied with net profit and performance as the company has to compete with a rival and improve service standards. In the first quarter this year, the company's mobile subscribers declined by 638,000, or 1.3% from the previous quarter, totalling 48.8 million. Mobile subscribers declined 4.4% year-on-year due to the focus on quality subscriber acquisition in 2024, said Mr Brekke. Mobile postpaid subscribers increased 0.2% quarter-on-quarter to 15.3 million for the period, while mobile prepaid subscribers declined by 2.0%, tallying 33.5 million due to seasonality, according to True. Online subscribers increased 0.7% quarter-on-quarter to 3.8 million, while 5G subscribers tallied 14.2 million. Mr Brekke said increasing True's prepaid subscribers and revenue is a crucial mission for the company, particularly as it competes with rival Advanced Info Service (AIS). He started as group chief executive of True on March 11. On March 1, Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group appointed the Norwegian as executive chairman of the telecom and digital business. Mr Brekke said CP Group, through its subsidiary True Internet Data Centre, recently partnered with Global Infrastructure Partners under BlackRock in a move to jointly invest in a digital infrastructure project worth between US$3-5 billion to serve Thailand's digital economy. Strengthening data centre development through partnerships is one of Mr Brekke's missions. "A merger is a marathon, but we have to sprint," he said. Mr Brekke unveiled three strategic moves to fuel the company's growth, focusing on customers, leveraging technology, and empowering staff. The company will ensure a good customer experience by accelerating the integration of systems between True and dtac, modernising and expanding service centres, and delivering a reliable and future-proof network, he said. True will raise awareness among businesses and the public about the potential of AI to stimulate widespread adoption, said Mr Brekke. The company also aims to create a unified organisational culture, ensuring that every approach places the customer at the heart of everything it does.

Title: SEC delays Solana and Litecoin ETFs as Dogecoin and BlackRock proposals enter public comment

Time Published: 2025-05-13T21:09:35Z
Full Content:
Share this article The US Securities and Exchange Commission delayed its decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF today, while opening public comment periods for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF redemption model and the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. The SEC extended its review of the Grayscale Solana Trust to evaluate whether the listing meets investor protection standards and market integrity requirements. If approved, the trust would hold SOL and trade on NYSE Arca. It also delayed a decision on the Grayscale Litecoin Trust, instituting proceedings to further assess whether the listing aligns with requirements under the Securities Exchange Act. Both Solana and Litecoin filings now face extended timelines as the agency continues its review. Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s filing to amend BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust is now open for public comment. The proposed change would allow the fund to support in-kind redemptions, meaning authorized participants could create or redeem shares using Bitcoin directly rather than cash. The SEC initially approved the fund in January with a cash-only redemption mechanism. The 21Shares Dogecoin ETF has also entered its public comment phase following a filing to list under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d), which covers commodity-based trust shares. The ETF plans to track DOGE prices using a CF Benchmarks index and aims to provide Dogecoin exposure through traditional brokerage accounts. The SEC’s recent actions come as the agency reassesses crypto product listings under new Chair Paul Atkins. The commission has dismissed several enforcement cases and increased public engagement through crypto-focused roundtables since President Trump took office.

Title: Happy 20-year anniversary, Leeroy Jenkins!

We’re still shouting his name two decades later by Kyle Burke Twenty years ago, the name Leeroy Jenkins rang through the halls of Upper Blackrock Spire, and now it echoes through eternity. On May 11, 2005, the famous “Leeroy!!” video was posted to WarcraftMovies, a website dedicated to World of Warcraft machinima. The video came from a guild called Pals for Life. In it, the guild leader addressed the group in a semi-serious tone, asking after coming up with a detailed plan, “Can you give me a number crunch real quick?” In response, the apparent number-crunching guy laid down the first meme of the video, “I’m coming up with 32.33 repeating, of course, percentage of survival.” Don’t ever tell Leroy the odds, because that’s when he declared, “Times up,” and delivered a battlecry for the ages, “Leeeeeeeeeroy Jenkins!!!” Soon after charging in from an AFK state, Leeroy Jenkins stepped on a bunch of dragon eggs that spawned hatchlings, killing everybody in the room. When the dust settled a bit, Leeroy was berated, “Goddamn it, Leeroy,” one said, another adding in, “You moron.” Taking things in stride, Leeroy responded with words of wisdom, “At least I have chicken.” It’s gone down in history as a defining moment for viral clips while bringing some gaming culture into the mainstream. The list of pop culture references to Leeroy Jenkins includes a Family Guy bit, trivia on Jeopardy!, a How I Met Your Mother impersonation, a Howard Stern segment, and even U.S. House Rep. Jared Huffman using the rallying call during a Speaker of the House vote. Blizzard kept Leeroy Jenkins alive by turning him into a staple Hearthstone card, rewarding the “Jenkins” title for a World of Warcraft achievement, and making a Leeroy Jenkins NPC voiced by Ben Schulz (the real Leeroy Jenkins) in the Warlords of Draenor expansion. Kotaku confirmed in 2017 that the beloved clip was staged as a comedy skit by the Pals for Life guild after much speculation about its authenticity. Ben Vinson, the video recorder (not Leeroy himself), said, “We didn’t think anyone would believe it was real, we thought it was so obviously satire, but we were wrong.” I guess everyone just wants to believe that charging headfirst into danger — chicken in hand — is the best way to go down.
