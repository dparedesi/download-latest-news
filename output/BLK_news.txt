At an investment forum in Riyadh, Alex Karp, CEO of defense tech company Palantir Technologies, praised Saudi engineers for meritocracy and patriotism — and took a swipe at Europe over its slow AI adoption. "You're seeing a receptivity in this region, especially in the kingdom," Karp said at the Saudi-US Investment Forum on Tuesday. "But the receptivity is on the back of people who have a deep tradition in engineering excellence and, quite frankly, believe in their own future." Karp was addressing a request from panel host and CNBC anchor Sara Eisen to expand upon a previous comment that the countries and regions that are best utilizing AI right now are the US and the Middle East. "Obviously, the great contradistinction here is Europe, where, you know, it's like people have given up, and we — I really hope that turns around in Europe," he added. The talk came as President Donald Trump received a royal welcome with golden chairs and Arabian horses in Riyadh on Tuesday as he kicked off his Gulf tour. Flanked by executives from Google, Nvidia, BlackRock, and others to discuss AI, defense, and energy with Saudi officials, Trump said he aims to secure $1 trillion in deals. Based on an October 2024 report published by QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, European organizations lag behind their US counterparts by 45 to 70% in terms of AI adoption. And while Europe leads in producing AI semiconductor equipment — machinery and tools used to make semiconductors — the report said that Europe has below 5% market share in areas like raw materials, cloud infrastructure, and supercomputers. "Opportunity remains wide open, but Europe is starting from a disadvantage," the report QuantumBlack wrote. Europe is also known for much more stringent AI regulations. On August 1, 2024, Europe enacted the AI Act, the first-ever legal framework on AI, and established an AI office to oversee the implementation of these regulations. The AI Act is just one part of a wider package of measures that the EU said ensures "trustworthy AI," which explicitly banned practices such as AI-based manipulation and deception, real-time remote biometric identification for law enforcement purposes in public spaces, and individual criminal offense risk assessment. According to the AI Act, ways of using AI, such as robot-assisted surgery and credit scoring, are also categorized as "high-risk" and subjected to strict scrutiny. The best-known European AI company that raised the most amount of funds is French AI startup Mistral, which is backed by over €1 billion in funding. Dubbed as Europe's answer to OpenAI, the company has recently ruled out acquisition and is eyeing an IPO while pushing its open-source AI models and generative chatbot "Le Chat" into new markets.

Here are the categories that saw the biggest price changes https://t.co/sm83vgCKYv April was the third-straight month that US inflation data came in softer than forecast: Here’s your Evening Briefing https://t.co/urTxjTlseP 최근 4년여 만에 '가장 낮은' 연간 상승률을 기록한 '4월 CPI'는 예상치를 하회했습니다. 미국 '쇼핑 시즌'을 앞두고 '트럼프'의 관세로 인해 미국 GDP의 70%를 차지하는 소비 둔화가 지속되면 GDP 성장률이 숫자로 나타날 것입니다. 1분기 미국 경제를 3년 만에 역성장 내놓은 '트럼프'가 지지층(MAGA)에 대선 공약을 했고 셀 수도 없이 수차례 강조한 만큼, '원도 한도 없이' "관세를 걷어서 감세나 하라"고 하고, 민주당 지역구도 감세해 달라고 하는데 안 해준다? '트럼프' 관세 때문에 물가가 오르는데 감세를 안 해주면 민주당 지지층은 쌍욕(결집)이 나올 것입니다. 미 국채와 부채가 문제가 되는 가운데, '트럼프'는 7월까지 상호관세를 유예시키고 9월까지 중국과 관세 임시 합의를 했으며 스콧 베선트 미 재무장관은 '부채한도'를 늘려야 한다고 말하였습니다.

Title: Arabian horses escort Trump’s Beast in Saudi Arabia, with Elon Musk in attendance

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/13/2025 5:07:00 PM PDT by MinorityRepublican RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — President Trump got the royal treatment on his first stop in Saudi Arabia, as white Arabian horses flanked his motorcade — with adviser Elon Musk in tow. Dozens of Saudis rode on horseback carrying US and Saudi flags as Trump’s motorcade peeled into the Royal Court, where he got a warm welcome before going to a lunch in the palace adorned with chandeliers and marble floors. “I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump told reporters after his arrival, referring to Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a friend. He later recalled how “impressed” he was when he first met the 31-year-old MbS back in 2017 during their first visit, and how they quickly became friends. “I like visiting with you, and we’ve known each other very well, and I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump said.

Title: SEC punts decision on crypto ETFs again, final rulings anticipated later in 2025

The regulator postponed decisions on three crypto-related ETFs, while acknowledging 21shares' Dogecoin ETF filing. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission postponed decisions on multiple crypto-related exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications on May 13, including those filed by Grayscale and BlackRock. The delays extend the agency’s review timeline and align with expectations that it will grant no approvals before the final quarter of 2025. Grayscale’s proposed spot ETFs for Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) were deferred. The new filing deadlines for both are August 11 and October 10. The SEC also delayed action on BlackRock’s request to enable in-kind redemptions for its approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF. BlackRock’s request has no updated deadline, which centers on technical mechanics rather than initial approval. Separately, the SEC acknowledged the 19b-4 filing for a 21Shares spot Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF, initiating the official review timeline for the product. This filing begins the countdown toward an eventual decision under the agency’s statutory schedule. The agency’s latest moves follow a broader pattern of staggered reviews across more than 70 crypto ETF proposals, which remain in various evaluation stages. On April 29, the SEC delayed decisions on five other crypto-related ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas described the current cycle of delays as routine. Seyffart said the delay was “expected,” and most of the affected products face final deadlines no earlier than October. Balchunas added that the SEC is unlikely to issue substantive approvals until recently confirmed Chair Paul Atkins completes internal meetings and strategy sessions with staff. He said: “They’ve been taking outside meetings with people. Probably coming up with a strategy. After that, likely approvals.” SEC decisions on crypto ETF applications follow a multi-stage statutory process based on the publication of proposed rule changes in the Federal Register. The agency typically operates on review intervals of 45, 90, 180, and 240 days, allowing multiple opportunities to delay decisions before reaching a final deadline. The regulator’s recent actions are consistent with its historical practice of extending reviews to the full statutory limits before issuing decisions. No ETF in this group faces a final deadline before late in the third quarter, leaving applicants and investors awaiting further clarity on the regulatory trajectory for crypto-linked investment vehicles.

Title: New True chief vows to pay firm's 1st dividend in 25 years
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/3024911/new-true-chief-vows-to-pay-firms-1st-dividend-in-25-years
Time Published: 2025-05-13T22:36:00Z
Full Content:
The newly appointed group chief executive of True Corporation has outlined his mission for the first 100 days, writing a new chapter for the telecom company by continuing its profitability, driving operations of trusted services, and strengthening data centre development. Sigve Brekke vowed True would pay a dividend in 2025 for the first time in more than 25 years as the company has retired all accumulated losses. He also stressed the need to increase True's revenue. The company reported net profit after tax of 1.6 billion baht for the first quarter of 2025, marking a milestone turnaround within two years of its amalgamation with Total Access Communication (dtac). Excluding the impact from one-off items, the normalised profit for the first quarter was 4.3 billion baht. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation have continued to improve since the merger, driven by a reduction in operational expenses from performance focus and financial discipline, along with ongoing benefits from synergies. "Bringing together True and dtac was an astonishing feat. We united two industry leaders with a sharp focus on performance, financial discipline and synergies, we modernised our networks, and infused AI [artificial intelligence] into customer touchpoints," said Mr Brekke. However, he said he is not satisfied with net profit and performance as the company has to compete with a rival and improve service standards. In the first quarter this year, the company's mobile subscribers declined by 638,000, or 1.3% from the previous quarter, totalling 48.8 million. Mobile subscribers declined 4.4% year-on-year due to the focus on quality subscriber acquisition in 2024, said Mr Brekke. Mobile postpaid subscribers increased 0.2% quarter-on-quarter to 15.3 million for the period, while mobile prepaid subscribers declined by 2.0%, tallying 33.5 million due to seasonality, according to True. Online subscribers increased 0.7% quarter-on-quarter to 3.8 million, while 5G subscribers tallied 14.2 million. Mr Brekke said increasing True's prepaid subscribers and revenue is a crucial mission for the company, particularly as it competes with rival Advanced Info Service (AIS). He started as group chief executive of True on March 11. On March 1, Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group appointed the Norwegian as executive chairman of the telecom and digital business. Mr Brekke said CP Group, through its subsidiary True Internet Data Centre, recently partnered with Global Infrastructure Partners under BlackRock in a move to jointly invest in a digital infrastructure project worth between US$3-5 billion to serve Thailand's digital economy. Strengthening data centre development through partnerships is one of Mr Brekke's missions. "A merger is a marathon, but we have to sprint," he said. Mr Brekke unveiled three strategic moves to fuel the company's growth, focusing on customers, leveraging technology, and empowering staff. The company will ensure a good customer experience by accelerating the integration of systems between True and dtac, modernising and expanding service centres, and delivering a reliable and future-proof network, he said. True will raise awareness among businesses and the public about the potential of AI to stimulate widespread adoption, said Mr Brekke. The company also aims to create a unified organisational culture, ensuring that every approach places the customer at the heart of everything it does.

Title: SEC delays Solana and Litecoin ETFs as Dogecoin and BlackRock proposals enter public comment

Time Published: 2025-05-13T21:09:35Z
Full Content:
Share this article The US Securities and Exchange Commission delayed its decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF today, while opening public comment periods for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF redemption model and the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. The SEC extended its review of the Grayscale Solana Trust to evaluate whether the listing meets investor protection standards and market integrity requirements. If approved, the trust would hold SOL and trade on NYSE Arca. It also delayed a decision on the Grayscale Litecoin Trust, instituting proceedings to further assess whether the listing aligns with requirements under the Securities Exchange Act. Both Solana and Litecoin filings now face extended timelines as the agency continues its review. Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s filing to amend BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust is now open for public comment. The proposed change would allow the fund to support in-kind redemptions, meaning authorized participants could create or redeem shares using Bitcoin directly rather than cash. The SEC initially approved the fund in January with a cash-only redemption mechanism. The 21Shares Dogecoin ETF has also entered its public comment phase following a filing to list under Nasdaq Rule 5711(d), which covers commodity-based trust shares. The ETF plans to track DOGE prices using a CF Benchmarks index and aims to provide Dogecoin exposure through traditional brokerage accounts. The SEC’s recent actions come as the agency reassesses crypto product listings under new Chair Paul Atkins. The commission has dismissed several enforcement cases and increased public engagement through crypto-focused roundtables since President Trump took office.

Title: Happy 20-year anniversary, Leeroy Jenkins!

Time Published: 2025-05-13T20:58:42Z
Full Content:
We’re still shouting his name two decades later by Kyle Burke Twenty years ago, the name Leeroy Jenkins rang through the halls of Upper Blackrock Spire, and now it echoes through eternity. On May 11, 2005, the famous “Leeroy!!” video was posted to WarcraftMovies, a website dedicated to World of Warcraft machinima. The video came from a guild called Pals for Life. In it, the guild leader addressed the group in a semi-serious tone, asking after coming up with a detailed plan, “Can you give me a number crunch real quick?” In response, the apparent number-crunching guy laid down the first meme of the video, “I’m coming up with 32.33 repeating, of course, percentage of survival.” Don’t ever tell Leroy the odds, because that’s when he declared, “Times up,” and delivered a battlecry for the ages, “Leeeeeeeeeroy Jenkins!!!” Soon after charging in from an AFK state, Leeroy Jenkins stepped on a bunch of dragon eggs that spawned hatchlings, killing everybody in the room. When the dust settled a bit, Leeroy was berated, “Goddamn it, Leeroy,” one said, another adding in, “You moron.” Taking things in stride, Leeroy responded with words of wisdom, “At least I have chicken.” It’s gone down in history as a defining moment for viral clips while bringing some gaming culture into the mainstream. The list of pop culture references to Leeroy Jenkins includes a Family Guy bit, trivia on Jeopardy!, a How I Met Your Mother impersonation, a Howard Stern segment, and even U.S. House Rep. Jared Huffman using the rallying call during a Speaker of the House vote. Blizzard kept Leeroy Jenkins alive by turning him into a staple Hearthstone card, rewarding the “Jenkins” title for a World of Warcraft achievement, and making a Leeroy Jenkins NPC voiced by Ben Schulz (the real Leeroy Jenkins) in the Warlords of Draenor expansion. Kotaku confirmed in 2017 that the beloved clip was staged as a comedy skit by the Pals for Life guild after much speculation about its authenticity. Ben Vinson, the video recorder (not Leeroy himself), said, “We didn’t think anyone would believe it was real, we thought it was so obviously satire, but we were wrong.” I guess everyone just wants to believe that charging headfirst into danger — chicken in hand — is the best way to go down.

Joining President Donald Trump and top US and Saudi officials for lunch in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday are dozens of business leaders from some of America’s largest companies. The executives — from tech firms, banks, consumer groups and other industries, including representatives of four of the 10 biggest US companies by market value — may be there to pitch for business from deep-pocketed Saudi investors, businesses and government departments. Their companies are also dealing with the tariffs imposed by Trump on US trading partners, so the trip is an opportunity to lobby top Trump officials, such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, on trade policy. Saudi Arabia has emerged as one of the world’s largest investors in artificial intelligence, an effort to diversify the oil-rich nation’s economy and give it influence over one of the hottest sectors in the business world. Notable AI players at the lunch include Sam Altman, chief executive of ChatGPT parent OpenAI; Jensen Huang, the leader of advanced chipmaker Nvidia; Ruth Porat, chief investment officer of Alphabet, Google’s parent company; and Andy Jassy, the chief of Amazon, which is a major provider of cloud-computing services. There is also Elon Musk, who, in addition to overseeing Trump’s effort to slash the size of the federal government, also runs Tesla, SpaceX and his own AI company called xAI, which is in talks for new financing that could value the firm at as much as $120 billion. Advertisement The vast sums of money that Saudi Arabia is spending on technology, infrastructure and other priorities have made the country a popular destination for financial executives seeking to advise the kingdom and its companies. Top financial leaders at the lunch include Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jane Fraser of Citigroup.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Warns on Volatility Despite US-China Tariff Truce

Markets surged yesterday (May 12) on news of a temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China, with the S&P 500 climbing to its highest level in months. But BlackRock CEO Larry Fink remains wary of the economic turbulence tariffs could still bring. “There’s going to be a lot of volatility until we have greater certainty as to what is the new equilibrium,” the billionaire said today (May 13) at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh.

You can opt out anytime. In Fink’s view, investors are still struggling to discern the Trump administration’s broader aims for reshaping global trade. That said, he believes the path forward is becoming clearer. “The equilibrium is probably sooner than we thought maybe two to three weeks ago,” he added. The U.S. and China agreed yesterday to a 90-day pause on tariff escalation, scaling back their respective duties: U.S. tariffs are dropping from 145 percent to 30 percent, while China’s will decline from 125 percent to 10 percent. Despite the reprieve, investors remain cautious amid ongoing global economic uncertainty, with many opting for defensive strategies such as holding cash. “When there is that uncertainty, you’re going to keep more and more money in cash, and that’s what we’ve witnessed,” Fink said, noting that this is a global phenomenon. In Europe, he pointed out, 12 trillion euros are currently held in bank accounts, while U.S. money market funds are sitting on $11 trillion. Fink also emphasized that tackling economic uncertainty must include addressing the U.S.’s ballooning deficit—something he’s warned about in the past. “Let’s be clear: the U.S. deficits are an issue,” Fink said. The U.S. economy shrank 0.3 percent in the first quarter. To reach a sustainable 3 percent growth rate, Fink said, the country will need to lean more heavily on private investment.

Title: Elon Musk Brings Starlink to Saudi Arabia as U.S. Oligarchs Join Trump in Middle East

Elon Musk says his satellite internet provider Starlink, a part of SpaceX, has been approved in Saudi Arabia for maritime and aviation use. The billionaire made the announcement while being interviewed at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, a conference where several American oligarchs have joined President Donald Trump to cut deals with the Saudi royal family. Musk “thanked the kingdom for approving Starlink,” referring to the Saudi government, without explaining further, and teased that he’d like to bring his nascent robotaxis to Saudi Arabia. “Yeah, so really you can think of a car or future cars as being robots on four wheels. And you know, I think it would be very exciting to have autonomous vehicles here in the kingdom, indeed, if you’re amenable,” Musk said “You heard it here from Elon,” the interviewer said. “He’s bringing his robotaxi to the kingdom.” Musk didn’t offer any specifics and is long known as a bullshitter, so it’s not clear how serious the billionaire is about bringing robotaxis to the Middle East. Tesla plans to launch a trial of its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June, but details on that venture are still scarce. Musk also promoted his tunnel-digging venture, The Boring Company, while on stage, explaining that his goal was to “solve traffic” by digging tunnels underground. The billionaire hyped The Boring Company relentlessly during Trump’s first term but has only delivered the most pathetic results. Musk billed his ideas, like the Hyperloop and The Loop, as next-generation, high-speed answers for transportation. In the end, he’s only delivered a slow-moving Tesla driven by a human and hobbled public works projects. But that didn’t stop Musk from insisting that his only functional tunnel ride in Las Vegas, “feels like teleporting for one part of Vegas to another.” Most people do not describe the experience like that. Musk’s America PAC, one of the political arms the billionaire started to help get Trump elected in 2024, shared a video on X that included Musk talking about humanoid robots. Elon Musk's full remarks at the SaudiâU.S. Investment Forum 2025 in Riyadh pic.twitter.com/E6orrvgZYA — America (@america) May 13, 2025 “My prediction, actually, for humanoid robots is that ultimately they will be tens of billions,” Musk said, according to CNBC. “I think everyone will want to have their personal robot. You can think of it, like, as though you had your own personal C-3PO or R2-D2. But even better.” President Trump was supposed to be the main attraction at the forum on Tuesday, and his presence in Saudi Arabia was extremely weird, to say the least. Trump opened his speech at the conference with organizers playing Lee Greenwood’s song “God Bless the USA,” as though it was the national anthem or something. Trump stood there in silence for the entirety of the song as the room all stood in silence. The camera periodically cut to Saudi leader Mohammad bin Salman, sometimes known as MBS, and he appeared to be stifling laughter. Trump, who earlier had trouble keeping his eyes open, largely focused on U.S. domestic politics and his personal grievances during the speech, which may not have been exceptional if he had been on American soil. Historically, it’s more normal for U.S. presidents to expand their focus when traveling overseas and not bring up petty matters in an international setting. These aren’t normal times, of course. Several American business leaders were spotted in Riyadh on Tuesday, including Palantir CEO Alex Karp, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang even announced his company would be selling 18,000 of its latest AI chips to Saudi Arabia, according to CNBC. But not every tech oligarch was on hand for the forum. In fact, Trump called out Apple’s CEO saying during his speech that, “Tim Cook isn’t here,” apparently upset about that for some reason. “This week there are multi-billion dollar commercial deals with Amazon, Oracle, AMD, they’re all here… Uber, Qualcomm, Johnson & Johnson, and many more,” Trump said. “So I want to congratulate everybody. So many great business executives, many of you… most of you, I know.” Trump went on to say “they weren’t that happy when they saw me,” apparently referring to his election in Nov. 2024, “and now they’re saying, sir, you’re doing a great job, thank you very much. It’s amazing what a rising market will do.” And Trump isn’t altogether wrong. OpenAI’s Sam Altman, who criticized the president during his first term, was spotted meeting with both MBS and Trump in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Altman has been rallying behind Trump, as AI boosters believe the Republican president can help inject money into their technology. Trump has held close ties to MBS and the Saudi royal family, even after the leader became an international pariah during Trump’s first term. Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi was murdered at the order of MBS in Istanbul, Turkey, but Trump has always cozied up to the most brutal dictators around the world while denigrating the leaders of liberal democracies. President Trump said Tuesday that Saudi Arabia would be buying $600 billion of military equipment. And Trump’s tech buddies, from Musk to Altman, are happy to go along for the ride as long as it helps their bottom line. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Title: The inflation fight isn't over. Forecasters expect tariffs to show up in prices as soon as next month
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/inflation-april-cpi-tariffs-prices-trump-trade-war-economci-outlook-2025-5

Full Content:
Americans got some relief from inflation last month, but top forecasters say the effects of the trade war aren't yet being reflected in the data, and the coming months could see a fresh spike in prices. The consumer price index cooled unexpectedly in April, with the overall inflation rate dipping to 2.3% year-over-year, down from 2.4% in March. But consumers might be navigating another bout of inflation in the coming months. For one, the data is backward-looking and takes time to appear in official statistics. Firms, meanwhile, appeared to stockpile inventory in the first quarter to avoid tariff-related costs. Advanced imports of consumer goods surged as much as nearly 30% during the quarter, Morgan Stanley said. "This number doesn't matter, because the tariff effects are really going to start to show up in next month's number," Ellen Zentner, the chief economist strategist at Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management division, told CNBC on Tuesday after the CPI report. Higher numbers in next month's CPI data imply that prices will start to increase for consumers as soon as this month. Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said he believed the inflationary impact from tariffs would "escalate" in the summer months. At the moment, there's little evidence to suggest tariffs have affected inflation, besides a slight increase in auto prices, he wrote on Tuesday. John Kerschner, the head of US securitized products and a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, also said he believes inflationary pressures from tariffs could show up starting in June. "Thus, the market will wait with bated breath for those readings to make a determination of where we actually stand on tariff-induced rising prices," he wrote in a note. Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel speculated that price increases could come over the next several months. "Again, I don't think we're going to be seeing the effects of this tariff until, you know, maybe June or July. Because so little actually did come into this country and then get priced at the retail level and then sampled by the government officials to get in," Siegel told CNBC prior to the CPI report. Banks have adjusted their forecasts for inflation and economic growth after the US struck a deal with China to lower tariffs for 90 days, but many on Wall Street are still anticipating higher inflation by the end of the year. Goldman Sachs estimated that core Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, could rise from 2.6% annually in March to 3.6% by the end of the year. "Our forecast reflects a sharp acceleration in most core goods categories," the bank wrote in a note, adding that it believes tariffs would cause the "most acute" price increases in consumer electronics, autos, and apparel. "There was maybe a hint of tariffs in the data as a few line items with significant imports-household furnishings, medicinal drugs, IT commodities, and toys-saw price increases accelerate this month. But we continue to expect clearer evidence in the months ahead," Bank of America analysts wrote following the CPI release. Economists have warned that tariffs could stoke inflation for Americans, as companies could pass on tariff-related costs to consumers. The average effective US tariff rate will likely end up somewhere around 17%, the Yale Budget Lab estimated this month. That's lower than previous forecasts, but still the highest average tariff rate the US has seen in more than 80 years, Siegel said. Jump to

Title: Capital Markets: New Zealand pushes for renewable investment amid high demand, setbacks

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Genesis Energy's Waipipi wind farm in South Taranaki. Photo / Brett Phibbs, PhibbsVisuals THREE KEY FACTS New Zealand is being promoted as the “smart choice” for investors in renewable electricity, where tens of billions of dollars must be spent in the capital-hungry sector to meet demand and environmental goals. The new push to attract big money came at the New Zealand Infrastructure Investment Summit in March and following the event, New Zealand Trade and Enterprise says it is seeing “significant investor interest” among developers and investors from Japan, Korea, Britain, Germany and from investor migrants through the Active Investor Plus visa programme. As of early May, the renewable energy prospectus released during the summit had been viewed 358 times and downloaded 85 times. The big push for capital comes at a time when there have been high-profile setbacks for large-scale renewable projects and the abrupt exit of the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock, after a solar power investment soured. Fast-track consenting processes are now in place but so is a growing queue to have projects considered under new rules. But energy experts at one law firm describe the renewable investment opportunity as “immense” and in a prospectus released by the Government at the summit, the case for it was set out. “With an abundant supply of renewable energy, robust renewable foundations and growing energy demands, New Zealand is the smart choice for your investment.” As New Zealand progresses towards its net-zero aims by decarbonising every sector of the economy, this country’s reliance on electricity is projected to soar, with demand growing by 60% over the next 25 years. To meet this, industries will increasingly rely on our abundant supply of renewable energy. “This presents an enticing proposition, not only to invest in New Zealand’s growing renewable energy and green fuel sectors, but to use our natural resources to your business’s advantage,” the prospectus from Invest NZ says. “Proximity to export markets in Asia and Australia and the country’s strong sustainability goals positioned the renewable energy sector to grow exponentially – benefiting the planet and investors alike.” While in 2023, around 88% of New Zealand’s electricity was generated from renewable sources, there was “huge growth potential” to power industrial processes and transport with clean energy as electrification drives demand. A MinterEllisonRuddWatts report into investing in the renewable energy sector, published last December, says the Government’s domestic target of doubling renewable generation by 2050 will help drive an increase in its electricity supply by close to 70% by 2050 to meet domestic needs, as the New Zealand economy electrifies. In real terms this equates to approximately 400-500 megawatts (MW) of new generation capacity needed every year through to 2050 – a rate of development never seen in this country before. The firm also notes that to support all this new generation, it is estimated at least $22 billion of investment in the distribution network is needed this decade. “Accordingly, the opportunity for investing in renewable energy projects and the associated infrastructure needed is immense, with long-term returns.” Another MinterEllisonRuddWatts report, on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the renewables sector, was published just before the summit and shows high levels of activity. It says as of September last year, there had been more than 160 projects, predominantly wind and solar. Because not all projects in the pipeline will be completed (or complete under current ownership), there remains scope for new entrants, strategic investment and, more relevantly, consolidation or sell-down by existing investors and developers. Independent developers may continue to struggle to secure bankable, offtake arrangements, such as a PPA (power purchase agreement) for a project. It says the New Zealand PPA market is immature and a lack of offtake impacts funding decisions, so some projects may need to be sold. Last year was a busy one for M&A in the renewables sector. MinterEllisonRuddWatts noted that: ● Singapore-based fund management company SC Oscar acquired 100% of utility-scale solar developer Rānui Generation. ● Lodestone announced the acquisition of two grid-level solar sites in Manawatū from Kiwi Solar. ● Genesis Energy secured an advanced stage, 127-megawatt peak (MWp) consented site near Edgecumbe in Bay of Plenty from Helios Energy. ● In September, Contact Energy Ltd entered into a Scheme Implementation Agreement to acquire up to 100% of the shares in generator and wholesaler Manawa Energy Ltd through a scheme of arrangement. The deal values Manawa at $1.86b. ● Genesis took a $64 million, 65% stake in EV charging company ChargeNet NZ Ltd, reflecting Genesis’ ambition to be one of the major players in EV charging networks. ChargeNet has more than 400 fast-charging points nationwide and Genesis’ investment is expected to boost the pace of network development. The Government’s Invest in New Zealand prospectus points to global demand for renewables skyrocketing – and New Zealand is perfectly positioned to meet it, thanks to an abundance of accessible resources generated by hydro, wind, solar and geothermal. Developments in hydrogen and other biofuels also offer significant investment opportunities and excellent export potential. Although big energy users and consumer groups have different views, the Government’s pitch says the country’s energy and electricity markets are mature and open-access. The Electricity Authority monitors the market to ensure fair competition and consumer protection. The Government says it is committed to ensuring businesses have access to secure electricity at internationally competitive prices. At this year’s New Zealand Energy Conference, the Major Energy Users Group warned of the risk of de-industrialisation, with energy-intensive industrial sectors gradually moving their production elsewhere or reducing levels of production here. It said increases in transmission and distribution charges were impacting all consumers and with fewer parties supplying gas, businesses were “having trouble getting long-term gas contracts alongside electricity at reasonable prices”.

Title: Institutional Investors Drive Surge in Bond ETFs

BlackRock expects bond ETF assets to more than triple to $6 trillion worldwide within five years. Bond exchange-traded funds have been racking up investment inflows over the last few years and continue to gather steam, thanks in large part to institutional investors, according to BlackRock. The asset management giant forecasted bond ETF assets to more than triple, to $6 trillion worldwide, by the end of the decade. According to a BlackRock report, it took 17 years for bond ETF assets to reach $1 trillion in 2019 and then just another five years for that figure to climb to $1.7 trillion as of the end of September 2024. “The global bond ETF industry is growing faster than expected,” the report stated. “A key driver of this growth has been the adoption of fixed-income ETFs by institutional investors.” According to BlackRock, the 10 largest asset managers—and nine of the 10 largest insurance companies—along with some central banks, are using the investment vehicle. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  The report also stated that growing use of actively managed ETFs has contributed to the sharp rise in bond ETF assets. The report found that while bond ETF growth has traditionally been fueled by index-based investments, that source has expanded to now include actively managed ETFs, which provide access to sub-asset classes that are more difficult to index. “Historically, active strategies have only been available in mutual funds or separate accounts,” the report stated. “Today, however, the expanding landscape of active fixed income ETFs enables institutional investors to access these same strategies.” The report cited a recent PricewaterhouseCoopers survey of institutional investors that found that nearly 25% of respondents are considering investing in active ETFs over the next year or two. “Increasingly, active ETFs are becoming critical components in fixed-income portfolios alongside index and enhanced index strategies,” the report stated. “In fact, over the past three years, U.S. actively managed bond ETFs have outpaced the growth of index ETFs at an annualized 26% rate.” According to the BlackRock report, actively managed strategies currently account for 14% of U.S. fixed-income ETF assets under management and 8% of total U.S. ETF assets. “The growth rate of active ETF assets is expected to outpace total ETF growth in coming years, in part driven by the evolving demands from the institutional investor base,” the report stated.

Title: Trump inks $142B arms deal with Saudi Arabia, part of $600B investment package

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — President Trump signed off on the largest defense sales agreement in history, worth $142 billion, on his first full day in Saudi Arabia Tuesday — part of a series of bilateral deals worth $600 billion in investments. In remarks to business leaders, the president pitched Saudi Arabia as the key to building peace and prosperity in the Middle East, contrasting the kingdom with the nuclear intransigence of Iran. “Exactly eight years ago this month, I stood in this very room and looked forward to a future in which the nations of this region would drive out the forces of terrorism and extremism, and take your place among the proudest, most prosperous, most successful nations of the world—as leaders of a modern and rising Middle East,” Trump said after taking the stage to his signature theme tune, Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless The USA” Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known widely as MBS, had promised Trump that the Kingdom would facilitate deals worth $600 billion if the president would make Saudi Arabia his first foreign stop in his second administration — and the two were openly chummy before signing the memorandums at the Royal Court in Riyadh, with Trump joking at one point that they should make the investments worth an even $1 trillion. “Are we doing a good job so far for America? They’re only putting in a trillion dollars,” Trump told reporters while touring the investment forum exhibits before his speech. The $142 billion defense agreement calls for the US to give the Saudis “state-of-the-art warfighting equipment and services from over a dozen U.S. defense firms,” per a White House readout. The deal will focus on air force advancement and space capabilities; air and missile defense; maritime and coastal security; border security and land forces modernization and communication systems upgrades. The US makes “the best military equipment, the best missiles, the best rockets the best everything,” Trump told investors. The president has long touted Saudi arms sales as a boon to American industry, but they have been controversial in the past. In 2019, a bipartisan majority in Congress passed a trio of bills blocking an $8 billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia and its ally, the United Arab Emirates, over concern about how they would be used in Yemen’s long-stalemated civil war. The congressional rebuke of Saudi Arabia followed the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, which weakened support for Riyadh in Washington after US intelligence agencies assed MBS ordered the operation. Trump vetoed the restrictions, saying at the time that blocking the arms transfers “would hamper the ability of the United States to sustain and shape critical security cooperation activities.” The $600 billion investment commitment includes letters of understanding for future cooperation on energy, future defense capabilities, mineral resources, and space and infectious diseases. As part of the agreement, Saudi-based DataVolt, will invest $20 billion towards US AI centers; while Google, Oracle, Salesforce, AMD, and Uber have pledged $80 billion in technology across both countries. Meanwhile, US companies Hill International, Jacobs, Parsons, and AECOM are taking on infrastructure projects inside Saudi Arabia worth a total of $2 billion, including the expansion of Riyadh’s King Salman International Airport. GE Vernova will also send out gas turbines and “energy solutions” worth $14.2 billion, while Boeing will sell 737-8 passenger aircraft to Saudi jet rental service AviLease for a cool $4.8 billion. Additionally, kingdom-based Shamekh IV Solutions has agreed to invest $5.8 billion to construct a facility in Michigan. “It is crucial for the wider world to note, this great transformation has not come from Western interventionists flying in with lectures on how to live or how to govern your own affairs,” Trump said. “The gleaming marvels of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation-builders, neo-cons, or liberal non-profits like those who spent trillions failing to develop Kabul and Baghdad. “Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought about by the people of the region themselves, developing your own sovereign countries, pursuing your own unique visions, and charting your own destinies in your own way.” Turning to Iran, Trump said he did not want “merely to condemn the past choices of Iran’s leaders, but to offer them a new and a better path toward a much more hopeful future.” The investment conference was packed with business leaders lobbying for more economic partnerships between the US and Saudi Arabia, which has targeted increased diversification as part of its Saudi Vision 2030 initiative. The projects include New Murabba, a climate controlled indoor city that is said to be the world’s largest downtown project — and will include a cube skyscraper when completed at the turn of the next decade. Trump aide Elon Musk made a surprise appearance on stage at the forum, revealing he spoke with Trump and Saudi royal family about building “tens of millions” of “humanoid robots” that he hopes will be a part of our everyday lives soon. He also spoke to the leaders about autonomous cars and how his technology would be relevant to Saudi Arabia’s future economic vision. The Post spotted Palantir CEO Alex Karp walking around the conference center after speaking with the two leaders at the Royal Court. Other business leaders who had access to Trump and MBS on Tuesday included BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, Google CIO Ruth Porat, Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey. LinkedIn executive chairman Reid Hoffman was also listed as attending a lunch attended by Trump and nearly two dozen Saudi royals, but retweeted a photo Tuesday afternoon confirming he was not in Riyadh.

Donald Trump’s first visit to Saudi Arabia as president for the second time came with some standard fare, like an unbelievably massive arms deal he signed on Tuesday. Less orthodox is the lunch scheduled for today, which featured leading executives in American business and finance as well as a few random hangers-on. The lunch was part of a summit in which Saudi leaders agreed to a purported investment of $600 billion in American companies, mostly working in tech, artificial intelligence, and, of course, defense contractors. (Of the $600 billion sum, $142 billion will go to American defense firms selling missile systems, training, and the like.) To prepare for the glut of oil money coming their way, the president invited many leaders like Sam Altman of OpenAI; Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir; Jeff Miller, the CEO of Halliburton; Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia; and Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon. Most of the names on the list make sense. If you’re looking at boosting Saudi investment in U.S., you probably want BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman there. If you’re looking at further investment in American AI, Altman, Huang, and IBM CEO Arvind Krishna are going to be munching apps, too. Obviously, Elon Musk is going to be there. But there are a few standouts. Why the mayor of Miami in Riyadh? What are the CEOs of Coca-Cola or Epic Games doing there? And what about Travis Kalanick, the former bad boss of Uber? The answer is kind of obvious: Saudi money and/or Trump fealty. For example, Kalanick’s latest venture is a ghost-kitchen company backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund — which is reportedly considering an initial public offering in the Middle East. Or take Miami mayor Francis Suarez, a staunch cryptocurrency booster who has backed the president’s pro-crypto industry policies. Despite leading the 42nd-largest U.S. city, he ended up with a ticket. Beyond securing the $600 billion promise, Trump, for one, did not seem especially focused at the meeting, commenting on Apple CEO Tim Cook’s absence and bragging about winning “all seven swing states.” But the real question remains this: Why isn’t the McDonald’s CEO there?

US President Donald Trump secured a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to invest in the United States after the oil power accorded him a gala welcome at the start of a tour of Gulf states.Trump punched the air as he emerged from Air Force One to be greeted by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later signed an agreement with the president in Riyadh on energy, defence, mining, and other areas.The US agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion, according to a White House fact sheet that called it "the largest defense cooperation agreement" Washington has ever done. The agreement covers deals with more than a dozen US defense companies in areas including air and missile defense, air force and space advancement, maritime security and communications, the fact sheet said."Today we hope for investment opportunities worth $600 billion, including deals worth $300 billion that were signed during this forum," the Saudi crown prince said in a speech during a US-Saudi Investment Forum session held in Riyadh on the occasion of Trump's visit.

(credit: REUTERS/BRIAN SNYDER)"We will work in the coming months on the second phase to complete deals and raise it to $1 trillion," he said.Saudi Arabia is one of the largest customers for US arms. Reuters reported in April that the US was poised to offer the kingdom an arms package worth well over $100 billion."I really believe we like each other a lot," Trump said during a meeting with the crown prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler.The US and Saudi Arabia had discussed Riyadh's potential purchase of Lockheed F-35 jets, two sources briefed on discussions told Reuters, referring to a military aircraft that the kingdom is long thought to have been interested in.It was not immediately clear whether those aircraft were covered in the deal announced on Tuesday.Trump, who was accompanied by US business leaders including billionaire Elon Musk, will go on from Riyadh to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.He has not scheduled a stop in Israel, a decision that has raised questions about where the close ally stands in Washington's priorities, and the focus of the trip is on investment rather than security matters in the Middle East. "While energy remains a cornerstone of our relationship, the investments and business opportunities in the kingdom have expanded and multiplied many, many times over," Saudi Investment Minister Khalid al-Falih told the US-Saudi investment forum."As a result ... when Saudis and Americans join forces very good things happen, more often than not great things happen when those joint ventures happen," he said before Trump's arrival.Trump was shown speaking with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund governor Yaser al-Rumayyan, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, and Falih as he toured a hall that showed off models for the kingdom’s flashy, multi-billion-dollar development projects.Trump called the Saudi crown prince a friend and said they have a good relationship, according to a pool report from the Wall Street Journal, adding that Saudi investment would help create jobs in the USBIG INVESTMENTSBusiness leaders at the investment forum included Larry Fink, the CEO of asset management firm BlackRock; Stephen A. Schwartzman, CEO of asset manager Blackstone; and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.Musk chatted briefly with both Trump and the crown prince, who is otherwise known as MbS, during a palace reception for the US president. And joining Trump for a lunch with MbS were top US businessmen including Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.MbS has focused on diversifying the kingdom's economy in a major reform programme dubbed Vision 2030 that includes "Giga-projects" such as NEOM, a futuristic city the size of Belgium. Oil generated 62% of Saudi government revenue last year.The kingdom has scaled back some of its ambitions as rising costs and falling oil prices weigh.Saudi Arabia and the US have maintained strong ties for decades based on an ironclad arrangement in which the kingdom delivers oil and the superpower provides security in exchange.MbS' ties with Trump have been smoother than with his predecessor, Joe Biden. Their relations were strained by the 2018 killing of Saudi commentator Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. US intelligence believed the killing was ordered by MbS. He denied involvement.Trump did not include Israel on his schedule although he wants Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a new ceasefire deal in the Gaza war.Israeli officials have put a brave face on Trump's decision but there are growing doubts in Israel about its position in his priorities as frustration mounts in Washington over the failure to end the 19-month-old war.Israel's military operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and its assassinations of the two Iran-allied groups' leaders, have at the same time given Trump more leverage by weakening Tehran and its regional allies.US and Iranian negotiators met in Oman at the weekend to discuss a potential deal to curb Tehran's nuclear program. Trump has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails.Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said last week he expected progress imminently on expanding accords brokered by Trump in his 2017-21 first term under which Arab states including the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco recognised Israel.But opposition by Netanyahu to a permanent stop to the war in Gaza or to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress on similar talks with the Saudis unlikely, sources told Reuters.

Reuters reported in April that the US was poised to offer the kingdom an arms package worth well over $100 billion."I really believe we like each other a lot," Trump said during a meeting with the crown prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler.The US and Saudi Arabia had discussed Riyadh's potential purchase of Lockheed F-35 jets, two sources briefed on discussions told Reuters, referring to a military aircraft that the kingdom is long thought to have been interested in.It was not immediately clear whether those aircraft were covered in the deal announced on Tuesday.Trump, who was accompanied by US business leaders including billionaire Elon Musk, will go on from Riyadh to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.He has not scheduled a stop in Israel, a decision that has raised questions about where the close ally stands in Washington's priorities, and the focus of the trip is on investment rather than security matters in the Middle East. "While energy remains a cornerstone of our relationship, the investments and business opportunities in the kingdom have expanded and multiplied many, many times over," Saudi Investment Minister Khalid al-Falih told the US-Saudi investment forum."As a result ... when Saudis and Americans join forces very good things happen, more often than not great things happen when those joint ventures happen," he said before Trump's arrival.Trump was shown speaking with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund governor Yaser al-Rumayyan, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, and Falih as he toured a hall that showed off models for the kingdom’s flashy, multi-billion-dollar development projects.Trump called the Saudi crown prince a friend and said they have a good relationship, according to a pool report from the Wall Street Journal, adding that Saudi investment would help create jobs in the USBIG INVESTMENTSBusiness leaders at the investment forum included Larry Fink, the CEO of asset management firm BlackRock; Stephen A.

President Trump signed the economic cooperation agreement with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and co-chaired the Saudi–U.S. Investment Forum 2025 in Riyadh. During the forum, Amin Nasser, the chief executive of Aramco, said that the Saudi state giant is signing today a $3.4-billion agreement to expand the Motiva refinery in Texas to integrate chemicals production. Motiva Enterprises, controlled by Saudi Aramco, operates the huge Motiva refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. The refinery is the second largest in the United States by operable capacity, after Marathon Petroleum’s 631,000-bpd refinery at Galveston Bay, Texas, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration as of January 1, 2024. Currently, the Motiva refinery produces conventional gasoline, commercial aviation fuel, ultra low sulfur diesel, export (high cetane) diesel, and Texas low emissions diesel. Aramco is also signing on Tuesday agreements with U.S. companies NextDecade and Sempra, Nasser said at the forum. “The US is really a good place to put our investment,” Nasser noted. Aramco is signing a memorandum of understanding with Sempra to receive about 6.2 million tons per year of LNG, the executive added. Last year, Aramco signed a non-binding agreement to buy LNG from Sempra’s Port Arthur LNG project and potentially acquire 25% in the project’s Phase 2. Under the non-binding Heads of Agreement (HoA), Aramco and Sempra discussed a 20-year sale and purchase agreement for LNG offtake of 5.0 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 expansion project. The Saudi-U.S. investment forum was also attended by Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, and Elon Musk, among other prominent U.S. entrepreneurs.

Title: It Awaits Your Experiments

You may have heard of Christian Bök. You may have read about him on this very blog if you’ve been hanging out here long enough. Perhaps you were even one of the very select few to witness the seminal talk I gave back in 2016[1]—“ScArt: or, How to Tell When You’ve Finished Fucking”— which climaxed with a glowing description of Bök’s magnum opus, then still in progress. And if you read Echopraxia, you’ll have encountered—without even knowing it— a brief cameo of that work near the end, suggesting that at least in the Blindopraxia timeline, he’d brought his baby to fruition. Truth to tell, I didn’t know if he was actually going to pull it off for the longest time. I thought he’d given up years ago. The story so far: back in the early two-thousands Christian Bök, famous for accomplishments lesser poets would never even dream of attempting (he once wrote a book in which each chapter contained only a single vowel) started work on the world’s first biologically-self-replicating poem: the Xenotext Experiment, which aspired to encode a poem into the genetic code of a bacterium. Not just a poem, either: a dialog. The DNA encoding one half of that exchange (“Orpheus” by name) was designed to function both as text and as a functional gene. The protein it coded for functioned as the other half (“Eurydice”), a sort of call-and-response between the gene and its product. The protein was also designed to fluoresce red, which might seem a tad gratuitous until you realize that “Eurydice”’s half of the dialog contains the phrase “the faery is rosy/of glow”. Phase One involved engineering Orpheus and Eurydice into the benign and ubiquitous E. coli, just to work out the bugs. Ultimately, though, the target microbe was Deinococcus radiodurans: also known as “Conan the Bacterium” on account of being one of the toughest microbial motherfuckers on the planet. To quote Bök himself: Astronauts fear it. Biologists fear it. It is not human. It lives in isolation. It grows in complete darkness. It derives no energy from the Sun. It feeds on asbestos. It feeds on concrete. It inhabits a gold seam on level 104 of the Mponeng Mine in Johannesburg. It lives in alkaline lakelets full of arsenic. It grows in lagoons of boiling asphalt. It thrives in a deadly miasma of hydrogen sulphide. It breathes iron. It breathes rust. It needs no oxygen to live. It can survive for a decade without water. It can withstand temperatures of 323 k, hot enough to melt rubidium. It can sleep for 100 millennia inside a crystal of salt, buried in Death Valley. It does not die in the hellish infernos at the Städtbibliothek during the ﬁrebombing of Dresden. It does not burn when exposed to ultraviolet rays. It does not reproduce via the use of dna. It breeds, unseen, inside canisters of hairspray. It feeds on polyethylene. It feeds on hydrocarbons. It inhabits caustic geysers of steam near the Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park. I’d love to quote all seven glorious and terrifying pages, but to keep within the bounds of Fair Use I’ll skip ahead to the end: It is totally inhuman. It does not love you. It does not need you. It does not even know that you exist. It is invincible. It is unkillable. It has lived through five mass extinctions. It is the only known organism to have ever lived on the Moon. It awaits your experiments. As things turned out, it had to await somewhat longer than expected. The project hinged upon molecular techniques that did not exist when the experiment began. Christian taught himself the relevant skills— genetics, proteomics, coding— and enlisted a team of scientists (not to mention a supercomputer or two) to invent them. His audacity was more than merely inspiring; some might even call it infuriating. As I railed back in 2016: It was fine when Art came to science in search of inspiration; that’s as it should be. I suppose it was okay— if a little iffy— when Science started going back to Art for solutions to scientific and technical problems. But this crosses a line: with The Xenotext, we have reached the point where Science is being used solely to assist in the creation of new art. Scientists are developing new techniques just to help Christian finish his bloody poem. Up to now, we’ve generally been in the driver’s seat. Insofar as a relationship even existed, Science was the top, Art the Bottom. But Art has now started driving Science. Science has discovered its inner sub. As a former scientist myself, I was not quite sure how to feel about that. But however that was, I knew Christian Bök was to blame. Fortunately, Science got a reprieve. The project hit a bump at E. coli. Eurydice fluoresced but the accompanying words got mangled. When they eventually cleared that hurdle and moved to Phase Two, Deinococcus fought back, shredding the code before it ever had a chance to express. Conan, apparently, does not like people trying to play with its insides. It’s already got its genes set up just the way it likes them. Unkillable. That, as far as I knew, was where the story ended ten years ago. Christian released The Xenotext: Book One in 2015, documenting his efforts and gift-wrapping them in some gorgeous and evocative bonus content, but the prize remained out of reach. He headed off to Australia to follow other pursuits; then to that oversurveilled and repressive shithole known as the United Kingdom. We fell out of touch. I assumed he’d given up on the whole project. Oh me of little faith. Because now it’s 2025, and he fucking did it. The Xenotext is live and glowing in Deinococcus radiodurans: iterating away inside that immortal microbial bad-ass that feeds on stainless steel, that resides inside the core of reactor no. 4 at Chernobyl, that does not die in the explosion that disintegrates the Space Shuttle Columbia during orbital reentry. Christian Bök did not give up. Christian Bök did not fail. Christian Bök is going to outlive civilization, outlive most of the biosphere itself. The rest of us might think we achieve artistic immortality if our work lasts a century or three. Bök blows his nose at such puny ambitions. His work might get deciphered by Fermi aliens who finally make it to our neighborhood a billion years from now. It could be iterating right up until the sun swallows this planet whole. It’ll almost certainly be around for Dan Brüks to find in the Oregon desert, mere decades down the road. The Xenotext: Book Two comes out from Coach House in June 2025. It would be well worth the price just for the the acrobatics and anagrams and sonnets, for the way it remixes science and fiction and the classic canon of dead white Europeans[2]. It contains poetry to entrance people who hate poetry. It juggles space exploration and the Fermi Paradox and the potentially extraterrestrial origins of Bacteriophage φx174. But its rosy flickering heart is that dialog iterating away in Conan even as I type. A reinvention, almost a quarter-century in the making. A fucking monument if you ask me, equal parts revelation and revolution. If you happen to live in or around Toronto, it’s getting an official launch on May 27 at The Society Clubhouse, 967 College St, from 7-9pm. It’s one of a half-dozen Coach House titles that will be launched that night, and no doubt all six authors are worthy in their own right. Still. You know who I’m going for. Maybe I’ll see some of you there. Δ Δ Literature encoded into juggernaut microbial genes by a man who, facetiously taking at face value the Mooring-dialect North Frisian meaning of his surname, is literally called Bible. This has apocalyptic implications Inb4 Pope Influenza I Clever. But can it sing “Row, row, row your boat”? I think that’s on the list. Right after “evolve opposable thumbs”. A bacterium with opposable thumbs? Fair shot, it can’t do much worse than H sapiens has. Several lifetimes ago, waaaay back when I was hilariously crashing out of premed, I can remember the biochem prof cited this one weird trick—where a single DNA sequence expresses multiple proteins just by adjusting the read offset—as evidence of God’s handiwork. Although personally I think it much more compelling evidence that Earth is a vast massively parallel supercomputer with lovely crinkly bits grinding the combinations for 10 million 3.5Bn years. Never send a brain to do an algorithm’s work, that’s my motto nowadays. And DNA’s already halfway to Forth. Tip o’ the hat to Mr Bök for his God-level advance trolling of whatever race of hyperintelligent cockroaches eventually arises in our wake. Only the paperback? What is wrong with the publishing industry today? If I’m okay with read-and-forget, I’d buy a pdf or whatever the current thing is, epub or mobi or whatever. If I’m willing to both shell out and spend the precious shelf space in my shoebox of a domicile on some sliced dead wood, I’d want it to be durable. Physical. Bequeathable. Hard-cover. What’s this obsession with paperbacks? They don’t really last, and don’t save any more trees either. And I’ll be fucked if this right here is the kind of literature one reads on the tube during the commute, folding the corner instead of a bookmark before shoving it into the pocket of one’s coat. Xenotext doesn’t need to be read by puny meatsacks. Xenotext is immortal. I mean, the text that is not meant to be read, the signal that is not meant to be received, the meaning that is not meant to be understood is just noise. Isn’t it? And a large part of our problem right now is we make too much noise. Not in the sense of loud sounds, but in the sense of rubbish, garbage, bonkers signals. Rorschach is known to consider these things an attack. I’m not the only person who finds paperbacks easier to read. Oh really? I this a thing? I wasn’t aware it was. I have acquaintances who claim superiority of paper over digital, but I’ve never heard of hardcover vs paperback before. >Christian taught himself the relevant skills – genetics, proteomics, coding – Sentences like these demonstrate the enormity of some peoples sheer intellectual superiority. Compared to a dude like him, i might as well be pond slime, happily gurgling away mindlessly in some nutrient broth. I am beyond impressed. Holy shit, this is one of those stories that remind you to never quit art, even if you are not sure if you are on board with this life thing anymore. Thank you for bringing it up, Dr. Watts 🙂 Nice. Apropos of nothing, apparently quantum energy teleportation has been confirmed. It’s not the telematter stream sending antimatter yet, but it looks interesting. One can hope we will NOT live to see ads casually added into someone’s genetic material …? Well, by the time Echopraxia takes place, you can apparently find the specs for the Denver sewer system in genes, so… If it encodes a useless protein, does that make it a disadvantageous trait that will be eliminated by selection pressure? More likely it’ll be selectively neutral; a single gene doesn’t take a whole lot of energy to maintain, and our own genomes are loaded with useless-but-non-deleterious code that’s accumulated over our evolutionary history. If there were some teensy Deinococcus-eating predator out there that hunted by sight, I suppose the glowing Conans would be more vulnerable to predation. Otherwise I don’t think it would make much difference. Ah. What I think is more like this: synthesising bioluminescent proteins consumes organic matter but produces no benefit. This should at least cause natural selection to favour their unmodified counterparts? Perhaps we should also deploy some versions with gene poem that don’t express, just as a backup. “Useless” is relative: to random mutation it’s all raw materiel. Sure it’s non-coding today, but rotate a few bits just-so and it’s sharks with fricking laser beams evolved on their heads tomorrow. […] Read More […] ewww. You just copypasted a few paragraphs from this article under another name on a random website to get a backlink? what a shame I did not. Someone scraped this post without attribution. ewww. Did you just copy paste a few paragraphs from this article under another name on a random website to get a backlink? what a shame It’s spammy bot BS. Pay it no heed. : : : DO NOT TAUNT THE XENOTEXT : : : Nature of humanity, bud. We will poke it with a stick. You’ve heard about Moore’s law but have you heard about Carlson curve? It’s a similar thing but for DNA sequencing. Between the year Bök has begun his work and the current year the cost of DNA sequencing has been reduced by 200%. In twenty something years any basement dwelling punk might pull this off. I hadn’t, so looked it up. WP’s graph is lagging but it looks like cost has dropped a whole magnitude over the last 10 years. Did you mean 2000%? Quite impressive when the 2001 bill for a human genome was $100M and now it’s approaching $100. Six magnitudes. Moore, clocking 4, looks distinctly sedate. I like my cyberpunk with 1980s electronics and 2080s genomics. “I just do eyes…” Damn straight. — Apropos of other things, tweaking Interstellar’s “Mountains” to ⅛ tempo makes an interesting Oort cloud experience for those needing a Big Ben fix. (Use a YouTube downloader to grab it as .mp3 file as YT shits ads all through it otherwise.) What kind of maths is this? 200% reduction implies that it was reduced to zero, and then reduced by its cost again, so whoever wants to sequence something should be paid for it. So if the cost was 1000 bucks, now after a 200% reduction you’d receive 1000 bucks if you order a sequencing. 200% = 2.0, so a reduction would be one-half of the original cost. I suspect that wasn’t what parent intended. Never trust percentages, shifty sods. Damn, that’s impressive. Not just that he pulled this off, but that he took his dedication to his art up to a whole different level. Incredibly inspiring and impressive. But, to play the cynic, I worry the specific sequence (if not the entire protein itself) will be altered or lost entirely after several (if not a few) generations unless a selective pressure maintains the precise sequence. The hypothetical super-Bök molbio artist would have to generate a poem sequence which gives rise a protein of such unalterable importance to bacterial function that genetic drift is strongly selected against. Perhaps a bacterium is too simple an organism for this, and more complex life needs support this endeavour… May ’25 • UK funds a series of geoengineering experiments to “buy time” in the race against climate change. Small-scale and cautious, they say. Ecologically sound, they say. Will certainly not be used as an excuse to not cut carbon emissions, they say. We’ll see. April ’25 • Trump opens protected marine conservation area to commercial fishing. Because of course. PopSi coverage here. • Latest marine heatwave leaves over 80% of the world’s coral reefs impacted by bleaching. On the upside, this is an official NOAA report on an ongoing environmental catastrophe. I thought they weren’t allowed to do that any more. • Bypassing the International Seabed Authority, Trump signs executive order opening the deep sea for commercial mining. Because why refrain from fucking up an ecosystem just because it’s out of sight? • Ocean heatwaves three times longer and 1°C hotter thanks to climate change. Only a paywalled preview link because the University of Toronto seems to have inexplicably stopped subscribing to PNAS, and I can’t find the paper on Sci-Hub. PopSci summary here • “Entire asset classes are degrading in real time”. Top insurance company warns that climate change is “on track to destroy capitalism“. And yet, they say that as though it’s a bad thing. March ’25 • Canadian company in negotiations with Trump to mine seabed. Because MAGATs aren’t the only assholes on the planet. • South Korean wildfires worst on record. • Another new buzzword for these times: “Global Weirding“. AKA, “climate whiplash”. • BP abandoning its net-zero pledges because, well, why the fuck not? They were empty anyway. February ’25 • Looks like the odds are the AMOC won’t be collapsing completely before the end of the century— just “significantly weakening” by 50-80%. After 2100, though, all bets are off. Summary article here. • NOAA is now refusing to mention the C-words when reporting record-breaking global temperatures. • Last January hottest on record: 1.75°C above preindustrial baseline. So much for La Niña cooling the place down. • “1.5°C is dead” is so passe. Based on these findings, James Hansen now says that 2°C is dead, too. In other news, the North Pole is 20°C warmer than it should be. Assuming it’s not just some Chinese hoax. January ’25 • Net Zero has “suspended operations” after Blackrock bails (the last straw in an ongoing procession of desertions from the world’s financial institutions). • Four of Canada’s largest banks have also quit Net-Zero. • I just learned a new word: “panzoonotic”. H5N1 is one. So far it’s infected over 48 mammalian species. • Lancet study estimates civilian deaths in Gaza at around 64,260 from Oct 7 2023, to June 30 2024. Fun fact: that’s about 70% higher than estimates from the supposedly Hamas-controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health. • The six biggest banks in the US have all bailed on Net Zero. Because who cares about that shit now that Trump’s back in charge? • Looks like a sea level rise of at least 1 m is now inevitable no matter what we do, as early as 2070 under current emissions. 2-3m is “very likely”. On the plus side, that means most of the world’s oil ports will be underwater in less than fifty years. December ’24 • Over half the current US population has been exposed to adverse concentrations of lead, resulting in elevated levels of mental illness. Explains a lot. • Geoffrey Hinton ups his guesstimate of AI-caused Human extinction to “10-20%” over the next 30 years. Honestly, at this point, the sooner the better. • 2024 officially the “hottest year on record“. • A whole new potential kind of environmental apocalypse: “mirror life“, based on biomolecules of reversed chirality. I’m sure we have nothing to worry about, though, now that the scientists have warned us of the dangers. Society always listens when scientists warn it of the dangers. Fun fact: the whole mirror-life thing is old news in science fiction, dating at least back to 1970’s Spock Must Die! by James Blish, later to be ripped off by Sheri Tepper’s Grass in 1989. • “International talks on curbing plastic pollution fail to reach agreement“. Oh, and in case you missed it: the multicorporate entity “Alliance to End Plastic Waste” generated 1,000 times more plastic waste than they cleaned up. November ’24 • So it turns out that the usual collection of assholes and shitstains did, in fact, manage to effect real change at COP29 after all: they deleted the bit about “transitioning away from fossil fuels”. Honestly, I don’t know why they even bothered. It’s not like those things are ever binding anyway. • 1.5° “deader than a doornail“. In other news, the Allieds storm the beaches of Normandy. • Ah, crap: the planet will continue to warms for centuries even after we hit net zero. Assuming we ever do. Tech specs here. • Oh, lookee here: Cop29 CEO filmed agreeing to facilitate fossil fuel deals at climate summit. No big surprise, mind you. It’s not like this hasn’t happened before. • Biodiversity COP16 turns out to have been a total clusterfuck. Not that we were expecting anything different, given that he international community has never met a single fucking goal in this particular arena. October ’24 • Over a third of the world’s tree species currently in danger of extinction. • Currently on track for 2.6-3.1°C warming by century’s end. • Monkeypox has figured out how to spread via direct human-to-human contact, a step up from its original zoonotic mode of spreading. We’ve seen this before. Anyone remember Zika? • Risk of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation collapsing in the near term have been “greatly underestimated”. • A decent overview of the various and sundry corporations who’ve chosen to renege of their climate pledges. • Time to give up on direct-air carbon capture. It was always a fool’s errand anyway. 2.7°C, here we come. September ’24 • Everything tickety-boo! Nothing to see here! August ’24 • Current ground temperatures on Antarctica are on average 10°C higher than normal (whatever “normal” means these days). Up to 25°C higher, in some spots. July ’24 • This decade’s methane emissions—which have 80 times the heat-trapping power of CO2— have “far exceeded baseline projections” and are accelerating. In completely unrelated news, Kamala Harris has reneged on an earlier pledge and, if elected, will not ban fracking after all. • And now it’s Jasper’s turn to burn to the ground. By way of poetic justice, the Trans-Mountain pipeline just happens to pass through that burg.) • In unrelated news, last Sunday—July 21, 2024— was the hottest day on record, ever. Well, until Monday, anyway. • The next pandemic is expected to be “Bird Flu” again? What is this, a clip show? Where’s Nipah when you need it? Or even the Black death? May ’24 • Renewable energy in the US produced “$249 billion in climate and health benefits” from 2019 to 2022. PopSci coverage here. • Working paper (not yet peer reviewed) concludes that “macroeconomic damages from climate change are six times larger than previously thought“. A mere 1°C increase (which, mind you, we’ve already passed) leads to a 12% decline in world GDP. PopSci coverage here. If reality-based threats aren’t enough to get the politicians off their asses, maybe a threat to the global economy will. Not holding my breath, though. • Global ocean temperatures have been breaking historical records for a solid year now. • Leafhoppers devastating Argentinian crops. Winter frosts used to keep the insects in check, but, you know. • We’ve already spent a year above 1.5°C, but that’s nothing; 78% of surveyed IPCC scientists expect us to blow past 2.5°C by century’s end (current trends point to 2.7°C). “We live in an age of fools”, one scientist opines. • Biodiversity loss is biggest driver of disease outbreaks; climate change and invasive species also implicated. (Strangely, urbanization was a negative correlate. Which seems weird given the high-density thing…) • Annual jump in global CO2 levels hits new record. Blame El Nino. Sure. April ’24 • EPA mandates that US coal-fired plants have to put up or shut down. Okay. Conditional green. We’ll see if this survives the inevitable industry onslaught. • Climate change predicted to cost the global economy $38 trillion annually by midcentury, or six times what it would cost to keep warming to a merely-catastrophic 2°C. Of course, all those Exxon-Mobil CEOs will be long dead by then, so don’t expect anyone to move on this. • Arctic permafrost now a net carbon producer. • Globally, hottest March in History. That’s ten consecutive monthly world records broken. Remember when they were warning we might exceed 1.5°C as early as 2030? We already did that. For the past solid year. • The East Antarctic Plateau just hit 38.5°C above its seasonal average. In related news, emperor penguin colonies are collapsing. March ’24 • 2023 was 0.2°C higher than expected and no one knows why. (No, it wasn’t El Nino.) • Great Barrier Reef bleaching again. Fifth time in eight years, if anyone’s counting. • “Last Chance Tourism” is a thing now. “Quick, they’re going extinct! How can we make a buck off that?” • A good candidate for Least Surprising Development Of The Week: major banks abandoning the “bare minimum environmental standards” for fossil fuel development that they themselves invented. Not that those were in any way binding in the first place, of course. • It’s official: Avian Flu now in mainland Antarctica. (Previous cases were only confirmed among island populations south of the Circle.) February ’24 • First Human fatality from recently-discovered arctic Alaskapox virus (who readers may remember from my recent story “Contracting Iris“): also bubonic plague surfaces in Oregon. Cats implicated in both cases. Go cats! • North Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation en route to catastrophic tipping point”: 1m Atlantic sea-level rise, Europe cools so fast that “no realistic adaptation measures can deal”. Significant uncertainty remains regarding when exactly the collapse will occur. Let’s just ignore that Nature paper that says it could happen as soon as 2025… • New “Category 6” hurricane proposed. Because hurricanes are way stronger now than they were in the old days. January ’24 • Air pollution from Alberta Tar Sands 1,900-6,300% higher than previously reported. Meaning the tar sands emit as much air pollution as all other Canadian sources combined. • Greenland losing thirty million tones of ice per hour, 20% more than previously thought. Another nail in AMOC‘s coffin. • Norwegian government approves deep-sea mining. I’ve spoken to a couple of Norwegian scientists who think this is a very bad idea. They have a lot of company. • We made it to 1.48°C in 2023! 0.17°C higher than last year, and we could break 1.5 in just a few months! Come on, you ecocidal shitstains! Let’s show those candy-ass coral reefs who’s boss! • Raptors on the African savanna in deep shit. 88% have declined over the past 40 years; 69% are in danger of extinction. • So, H5N1 is killing polar bears now. How very seasonal. What, did you think pandemics were only a human thing? 2023 November ’23 • COP28 lobbyists to present meat as ‘sustainable nutrition’. Because apparently, putting an oil company CEO in charge of the whole event wasn’t sufficiently farcical. • Earth just experienced the hottest year in recorded history, and probably within the past 125,000 years. A quarter of the global population exposed to “dangerous extreme heat events” for at least a 10-day period. They say next year’s going to be worse. • UK forests facing “catastrophic collapse” within 50 years. On the up side, that means they’ll outlast civilization itself by a good two decades. • Number of species in danger of extinction doubles to two million. Personally I bet that’s extremely conservative; we don’t even know how many species are out there in the first place. • World’s governments plan to produce more than twice the 1.5°C-limit for fossil fuels by 2030. Plus ca change. October ’23 • Avian flu makes it to Antarctica, after a massively successful South American Tour that killed “500,000 seabirds and 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru alone”. Let’s see if they can top that down on Bird Island. • Another tipping point passed: looks like we’re losing the West Antarctic Ice Sheet no matter what we do; there’s “no significant difference between mid-range emissions scenarios and the most ambitious targets of the Paris Agreement.” Goodbye, coastal cities. PopSci coverage here. • Twenty one species removed from the Endangered species list because they’re, um, extinct. Well, that’s one way to clear the backlog. September ’23 • Swiss glaciers decline 10% by volume in two years. Measurement stopped on some glaciers because they’re, um, gone already. • OK, I’ll admit this is pretty cool: Water from portable desalinator potentially “cheaper than tap water”. Solar powered, fits in a suitcase, 4-6l/hr. • Senior oil executives providing “support” to COP28. Plus ca change… • 98% of Europeans breathing air that exceeds WHO pollution standards. Two-thirds of them are breathing air that’s over twice those standards. Not a green post because pollution is, you know, bad. But not a red one either, because the associated annual deaths of 400,000 of the world’s most cancerous pest species has gotta be some kind of silver lining, yes? • Nipah outbreak in India. When this bug goes global—and sooner or later, it will go global—it’s gonna make smallpox look like a head cold. • Antarctica warming “much faster than models predicted“, because of course it is. PoSci coverage here. • Hottest Summer Evar, by two-thirds of a degree. From the Dept. of Duh. • Tropical mosquitoes bring their disease-vectoring ways to Paris, en route to the Baltic. Right on schedule. August ’23 • Leader of religion that forbids birth control laments environmental destruction. Well, I suppose it’s easier than doing something about all kids they’ve raped and murdered. • Oh, and filed under “News So Unsurprising It’s Barely Even News”: July 2023 officially the hottest month ever recorded. A record that’ll probably stand for about thirty-one days. • Amazon leaders fail to commit to end deforestation by 2030. Something about not wanting to give up “extractive industries”. • Tick-borne deathly red-meat allergies may affect hundreds of thousands! That’s one way to cut back on meat consumption—and by the way, did I call it or what? Now, if only some feisty ecoterrorists could port that trait into mosquitoes and horseflies… • Irony of the week: Stricter controls on maritime pollution increase global heating. Seems all those airborne sulfates increased cloud reflectivity; now they’ve been reduced, more solar radiation gets through. • Ocean surface temperature now hotter than any time in recorded history, and still climbing. Parboiled fish floating belly-up off Florida. • Hey, everybody: leprosy’s back! (Just in Florida so far, but not for long: armadillos are leprosy reservoirs, and thanks to climate change those guys are already as far north as Nebraska.) July ’23 • The deep sea gets a one-year reprieve from mining. China finally backed down. • Antarctic sea ice at record low. • G20 countries fail to reach agreement on cutting fossil fuels again. Because, you know. Maybe it’s all just sunspots or something. • And July 4 was even worse. • July 3 was the hottest day the planet has known since we started keeping records. June ’23 • The nation of Tuvalu is uploading itself into the digital realm. Because its days are pretty clearly numbered in this one. • Climate change amped the odds of the current Texas heat wave by five times. On the up side, it couldn’t have happened to a more deserving state. Except maybe Florida. • In case you were getting bored of humans changing the global climate, here’s something new: Humans are also changing the axial tilt of the planet by depleting groundwater reservoirs. • Oh, bother. Canada’s on fire again. • Ice-free summer Arctic ahead no matter what we do. Previous models, suggesting we might save the ice cap if we really cut back our emissions, underestimated ice loss. All together now: the optimists are always wrong, and the pessimists are too optimistic. May ’23 • Still on track to hit 1.5°C by 2027. Of course, if you only look at temperatures over land masses, we blew past that benchmark years ago. • Alberta—heart of the Canadian fossil fuel industry, home to the Athabasca Tar Sands, hotbed of climate-change denialism—is on fire. Gosh. Who could have seen this coming? April ’23 • World’s ocean surface temperature hits record high. After three years of La Niña tamping down on the cooker, it’s back to business as usual. • Increased flow of Antarctic meltwater compromising abyssal circulation. Deep ocean stagnates; shallow ecosystems starve for want of upwelled nutrients. • Canadian bank world’s biggest financier of global fossil fuel projects. It’s not like you can expect the federal government to chip in—they already gave more than $15 billion to the oil industry in 2022 alone… March ’23 • 8000-km swathe of sargassum weed headed for the Florida coastline. What’s not to like? Massive overgrowth, increased bioproductivity, increased CO2 absorption. The only thing it fucks up is Florida’s human population—and really, who deserves it more? • ‘Murrica’s “environmental president” approves 576m-barrel oil drilling project in Alaska, “potentially producing more than twice as many emissions than all renewable energy projects on public lands by 2030 would cut combined.” • Humans and their livestock now account for 98% of the planet’s terrestrial mammalian biomass. (When you include marine mammals we’re only at 94%, if you want to put a positive spin on things.) • New UN finalizes deal to protect (most) international waters. Although I might downgrade this to orange depending on what it ends up saying about deep-sea mining. • New GI-tract disease caused by plastics documented in seabirds. • The Guardian tries to put a happy face on the fact that emissions continued to rise in 2022 by saying at least they didn’t rise as much as they did the year before. February ’23 • Antarctic sea ice hits record low. In unrelated news, it’s 15°C today in Toronto. In the middle of February. • Wind and solar were EU’s top electricity source in 2022. Despite—or maybe because of—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. January ’23 • Now even neural nets are telling us that things are worse than we thought: 80% chance we hit 2°C by 2065 even assuming carbon neutrality. • World’s oceans hottest ever recorded in 2022. Absorbed about 10 zettajoules more heat than in 2021. • Current carbon offsets are bullshit. • Best-case (1.5°C) scenario: Half of all glaciers gone by 2100. Current trajectory: two thirds. December ’22 • COP15: Politicians desperate for some kind of win praise a non-binding biodiversity agreement with no enforcement, no accountability, and which doesn’t even mention commercial fishing or agriculture. (At least it can’t possibly do worse than its predecessor, which failed to meet a single one of its goals.) November ’22 • “None” now second-largest religious demographic in England and Wales. The US is still a fundamentalist nuthouse, of course, but you take your wins where you can find them. • Over 20K dead from this year’s heat waves in western Europe alone. (Although maybe this should be a green post. Surely fewer of us is a good thing?) • This year’s carbon emissions on track to be highest ever. Way to bend that curve, guys. • Previously-documented decline in human male fertility is accelerating! • Fossil fuel reps at COP27 up 25% over last year.”More than the combined delegations from the 10 most climate-impacted countries.” • Equipment designed to cut methane emissions is failing. • Past eight years hottest on record; each hotter than the one before. Follow the link if you want the ugly and consistent details about methane, CO2, arctic sea ice, glacier melt, and sea level rise. Bet you can guess the bottom line, though. October ’22 • No credible pathway to 1.5°C; currently on track for 2.8°C by 2100. Only hope is a radical and immediate transformation of global energy, food, and financial systems. Good luck with that. September ’22 • Christianity could well be a minority religion in the US within the next few decades. And it’s not other religions taking up the slack, either; the population is becoming increasingly nonreligious. This assumes that no massive social upheavals cause everyone to turn back to religion as a security blanket, mind you. Not necessarily a safe bet these days. • At least a third of Pakistan is underwater. August ’22 • All by itself, Greenland Ice Sheet decline will cause at least a 27cm rise in sea level no matter what we do now. “a very conservative rock-bottom minimum … Realistically, we will see this figure more than double within this century.” PopSci coverage here. • On the plus side, life expectancy in the U.S. continues to decline. Assuming anyone, you know, still trusts the CDC. • Australian wildfires are probably enlarging the Antarctic ozone hole. And I thought the ozone layer was the one thing we’d managed to put right. • Oh, great: polio’s back. • Apropos of nothing in particular, turns out even a teensy nuclear war could cause global famine. On the up side, a major war would cut the numbers of the world’s most pernicious pest species by more than half. • Okay, I’ll give you this one: the curiously-named “Inflation Reduction Act” at least gets the US off the sidelines and taking a first step. Even though it’s not nearly enough. Even though the cheerleaders seem to be breezing past the fact that the IRA makes offshore windfarm development contingent on an annual sacrifice of 60 million acres to the fossil fuel industry. At this point, you take what you can get. July ’22 • Democratic Republic of Congo opening vast tracts of forest (including gorilla habitat) to oil extraction. “Our priority is not to save the planet”, proclaims their government’s climate guy. Don’t sweat it, dude. It’s not anyone’s priority. • Monarch butterflies officially endangered. Kind of surprised it took them so long. • From Britain to China, record-breaking heat-waves, forest fires, and evacuations. “Not a very normal situation,” reads one quote from a Portuguese meteorologist. Yes it is, dudette. These days, it very much is. • US Supreme Court guts the EPA’s options for regulating carbon emissions. Because why just force people to have more babies when you can do that and increase the carbon bootyprints of each larva in the bargain? June ’22 • Desertification: Central Asian deserts have expanded by a hundred kilometers since the eighties. May ’22 • Exxon fails to wriggle out of going on trial for fucking over the planet and lying about it. This does absolutely nothing to mitigate climate change or to de-oil a single marine organism, but at least the odds of fucking up a few of the culprits may have improved a little. • You know those 50+°C heatwaves that are all the rage in India and Pakistan these days? A hundred times more likely now, thanks to climate change. Once every three years, instead of once every three centuries. • Pollution responsible for 1 out of every 6 deaths on the planet. That’s nine million a year. Put that together with the ongoing decline in Human fertility, this problem might just take care of itself. • It’s now basically a coin toss whether we blow through 1.5°C within the next five years. • 91% of the Great Barrier Reef bleached this year. And the year’s not over. • Fossil industry embarked on 646Gt worth of “carbon bombs“, more than enough to blow through the planet’s entire remaining carbon budget for a 1.5°C scenario. Then again, 1.5 was always a pipe dream anyway, right? And besides, there’s a war on. • Swapping out just 20% of global beef production for mycoprotein could, by midcentury, cut deforestation (and associated emissions) in half. April ’22 • Over 15,000 mammal-to-mammal zoonoses expected over the next half-century as a result of climate change. • A fifth of all reptile species are threatened with extinction. Popsci coverage here. • And of course, mere hours after the IPCC’s latest report emphasises yet again how we absolutely cannot afford to approve new fossil-fuel megaprojects, the Trudeau government approves a new fossil-fuel megaproject. They promise it won’t have any “significant adverse environmental effects”, though. Cross their hearts. • 1.5° is officially off the table. Now, the most optimistic scenario hinges on sucking carbon back out of the air to compensate for the inevitable “overshoot”. March ’22 • Great Barrier Reef bleaching yet again, during an El Nina this time (which is supposed to be when corals catch a break from the heat). “It’s also happening faster than was predicted 20 years ago.” • Coal surging, renewables stagnating, thanks to the war. I guess we can kiss goodbye even Cop26’s delusional and miniscule hopes of 1.5°C. On the up side, none of this matters in the event of a nuclear war. • 175 countries pledge to act on plastic pollution. It’s not a deal so much as a pledge to work out a deal, but at least it’s a legally-binding deal covering the the whole production cycle. Popsci coverage here. • Latest IPCC Report is out. “brutal“… “bleakest warning yet”… impacts “sooner and greater than we originally thought”… Ah, what’s the use. We’ve heard it all before, and we do fuck-all. February ’22 • U.S. Oil Industry Uses Ukraine Invasion to Push for More Drilling at Home. And less environmental regulation. And more pipelines. You know the list. • SW US megadrought now worst in at least 1,200 years. At least. • Global methane hits 1,900ppb. Been spiking since 2007. Arctic-thaw feedback suspected. January ’22 • Coal is in ascension again. All hail the post-covid economic recovery. • Ghost Flights are back. Up to 2.1 million tons of greenhouse gas emitted as empty planes fly around the skies of Europe. Didn’t we end this shit back in 2020? December ’21 • You know how the Arctic is warming “twice as fast” as the rest of the world? Turns out it’s actually warming twice as fast as that. So, four times. Yet another case of exceeding the worst-case scenario. November ’21 • The moral case for destroying fossil fuel infrastructure. About the only thing I’d disagree with is the claim that there’s no moral case for taking human life. Oh, and “Ethical” would have been a better word to use than “moral”. • In the wake of COP26, Biden administration selling off drilling rights to 80 million seabed acres in the Gulf of Mexico. Way to “lead by example”, you duplicitous scumbag. • Oh, here’s a cute little post-mortem tidbit from COP26: researchers were frequently prevented by the conference organizers from accessing the rooms where negotiations were taking place“. Kinda tells you all you need to know about how science factors into these things. • You may have heard that if every country honors the commitments made thus far at Glasgow, we could be looking at a merely disastrous increase of 1.8°C, instead of the downright catastrophic 2-plus.Wrong. Try 2.4°C. (PopSci coverage here.) • Hey, the grass roots finally accepts the reality of climate change! Of course, we’re still willing to do fuck-all about it. October ’21 • You know how we’re supposed to cut emissions in half by 2030? Current pledges, even if implemented, will only cut them by 17% according to the most recent UN Report (popsci coverage here). Yet another “thundering wake-up call”; so much for “building back better”. • 45% of Americans Don’t Believe Humans Cause Climate Change. Which probably still makes them smarter than Pyro650: at least most of them admit that climate change exists. • Fossil fuel industry gets subsidies of $11,000,000 a minute. Also, Biden signed as many drilling permits in the first six months of his administration as Trump did in his first year, during a time when no new drilling can occur past 2021 if we want to have a hope in hell of achieving even the flaccid half-assed commitments of the Paris Accord September ’21 • Coral reef coverage declined by 50% worldwide between the fifties and 2007. And that was before all those massive bleaching events hit the Great Barrier Reef. • Still on track for 3°C, thanks to virtually every Paris signatory not even coming close to meeting their commitments. (The only country that is on track? Gambia.) • Of course, they haven’t won a lot yet— and the moment they start, governments will probably just pass legislation to ban these kinds of lawsuits— but attribution studies are coming into their own when it comes to suing corps and countries for screwing the pooch on climate change. (Personally I’d like to see more in the way of jail terms and death penalties— but as usual, the good news is so far and few between you pretty much have to take what you can get.) August ’21 • Big Oil has a plan to deal with climate change. Basically, it’s suck up every drop of oil we can, for as long as we can, while getting governments and taxpayers to fund our ultimate and inevitable switch to renewables. • Germany’s greenhouse gas emissions are about to undergo the biggest jump since 1990, thanks to the post-covid economic ‘recovery’. Ah well. At least they’re learning to live with the whole catastrophic-flooding thing… • Hey, here’s a teensy glimmer of hope: coal-free steel. Note they didn’t say “carbon-neutral” steel, so I don’t know how “green” it is. Still. We take what we can get. • Down in the US, this passing Summer of the Furnace has changed people’s minds about climate change not at all. Hell, 1 in 4 don’t even think it’s any big deal. • Parts of the March ’22 IPCC report leaked seven months early by scientists fearing the usual governmental watering-down. How fucked are we? See for yourself. • Yup. We’re fucked even more unequivocally than we were the last time the IPCC checked in. Popsci coverage here. • Revenge Travel. It’s a thing. • Oh goodie. Looks like the Gulf Stream might be shutting down. Too many downstream effects to list here. • Last July worst for wildfires, globally, since records began. • The Greenland Ice Sheet lost enough meltwater to cover Florida to a depth of two inches last, um, Tuesday. 8.5 billion tonnes in one day. It’s not even a record. July ’21 • “Everything is on fire.” Siberia hit by unprecedented burning. • Remember “Limits to Growth”? Turns out they were right all along. Recent analysis suggests that business-as-usual will lead to global societal collapse around 2040, right on schedule. J. Industrial Ecol. report downloadable here. • Even now—even now— the G20 won’t agree on commitments to combat climate change. Four of the miserable fuckers have put forth plans that would lead to a 5C rise in global temperatures if everyone adopted them. • Not to be outdone by the Europeans catastrophic flooding also in China! All that coal-powered economic growth, finally paying off. • Tired of the same old stories about heat waves, droughts, and wildfires? You’re in luck! Climate change causes catastrophic flooding in Europe, too! Climate Change. A Catastrophe for Every Mood. • The Amazon rainforest is now a net carbon producer. Goodbye, “Lungs of the Planet”. It was nice knowing you. • June ’21 was the hottest ever recorded in the US. Wanna bet July breaks that record? • Last June’s inferno over on N’Am’s western reaches was rendered 150 times more likely due to climate change. • Hate to sound like a broken record but once again, worse than the worst-case scenario: Nobody saw the Lytton conflagration coming. Scientists never factored “heat domes” into their models. June ’21 • ExxonMobil lobbyists filmed saying oil giant’s support for carbon tax a PR ploy. ExxonMobil shocked and appalled by these allegations. May ’21 • Electric cars ‘will be cheaper to produce than fossil fuel vehicles by 2027’. One source even says this will happen by 2024. • Europe to clamp down on air and water pollution under green deal. “The overarching goal is to eliminate all harmful contamination by 2050.” Good words. Let’s hope the actions live up to them. • Heartened by so many governments suddenly hopping on the green bandwagon? Even if they all keep all their commitments, we’re still looking at a 2.4C global increase. Ah, well. 1.5C was always “aspirational” anyway… April ’21 • Australian Academy of Science: holding warming to 1.5C now “virtually impossible“. (As usual, the Hope Police object to the dire wording, but even they admit it’s “super-challenging” and “hanging in the balance”.) • Coal is powering the post-covid economic recovery. This year’s coal usage expected to rival peak burn of 2014. • European droughts over the past five years are “unprecedented in the past 2,110 years“. Popsci coverage in The Guardian. • Carbon emissions to soar in 2021 by second highest rate in history. Massive surges in coal power in the US and China. The Covid Dip. It was nice while it lasted. • Only 3% of the world’s ecosystems remain intact. We might be able to recover up to 20% through species reintroduction if we really get off our asses, but what are the odds? March ’21 • Disease outbreaks more likely in deforestation areas. Well, duh. • Bottom trawling releases as much carbon as air travel. Not to mention the sheer physical damage of clearcutting entire benthic ecosystems. Popsi coverage here. • Bladeless, even windless wind power. From giant wobbling dildos to streetlamp-mounted little turbines that harness air displaced by passing traffic. • Former CIO for sustainable investing at BlackRock states that “Green Investing” is Bullshit. Turns out capitalism is incompatible with decarbonization pretty much by definition. Who knew. • Geoengineering goes mainstream. At least, the National Academies of Sciences thinks we should be taking a serious look. • Falling sperm counts ‘threaten human survival’. It’s old news—and I remain skeptical that linear regression is the appropriate analysis in any case—but wouldn’t it be nice if our sperm counts really did hit zero by midcentury? And we’ve got no one to blame but ourselves. • Hey, new Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Actually it’s been going on since January, but who can keep track? (Also it now appears that Ebola can lie dormant in a host for up to 5 years, and then jump out and out break all over again…) • Northern California’s Kelp forest ecosystem reduced by 95% since 2013. Crash instigated by a “multiyear marine heat wave”. • UN agrees on standards to put a monetary value on ecosystems. Works great until Jeff Bezos pulls out his checkbook and says Okay, I’ve bought the Amazon. Let’s burn the fucker down.” • Global carbon emissions on track to surpass pre-Covid levels. December emissions 2% higher in 2020 than in 2019. Goodbye, Covid dip. You were nice while you lasted. February ’21 • Chance of keeping global warming below 2C currently 2%. Goodbye, coral reefs. • Nineteen out of twenty Australian ecosystems are seriously fucked (i.e., “experiencing potentially irreversible environmental changes.”) Guardian coverage here. • China doubles the number of “Protected” animal species. Now there’s, like, six of them. (Just kidding. Really, it’s nice to see they’ve given up on the whole wolf-extermination thing.) • Global “Peace Levels” have declined 2.5% since 2008. (Actually this dates from last August but I just discovered it now.) In your face, Stephen Pinker. • 20% of all Human mortality due to particulate air pollution. 30% in east Asia. Guardian coverage here. • US Cities are vastly underestimating their carbon emissions. The uncounted difference adds more annual emissions than the entire state of California. PopSci coverage here. January ’21 • Past estimates of sea-level rise are too conservative. The worst-case scenario gets even worse, yet again. PopSci coverage here. • Global ice loss now following IPCC’s worst-case trajectory. Which might be relatively good news, given how many indicators are trending to worse than worst-case. PopSci coverage here. • Electric cars will be cheaper than the fossil-powered variety by 2023-2025. Of course, fossil-powered SUV sales are still going through the roof. • Increased rewilding of landscape in rich countries, thanks to declining birth rates. See what happens if we just ignore that whole Judeo-Christian “fill up the world with thy numbers” edict? • Three quarters of the world’s sharks and rays are in danger of extinction. As usual, a conservative estimate. Popsci perspective here. • Electric car batteries with five-minute charging times produced. 1000 – 2500 recharge cycles without significant battery degradation. • Future environmental conditions will be far more dangerous than currently believed. “The scale of the threats to the biosphere and all its lifeforms—including humanity—is in fact so great that it is difficult to grasp for even well-informed experts.” Popsci summary here. • World’s insects suffering ‘death by a thousand cuts’. A series of papers in PNAS. Popsci summary here. • Solar now cheapest electricity in history. Oil use still hasn’t peaked— and won’t without “stronger climate action”— but it’s something. • 2020 hottest year in recorded history. Technically tied with 2016, but 2016 cheated by getting an El Niño boost. December ’20 • Monarch butterflies are endangered under the ESA, but won’t get protection because ‘it costs too much’. Not the only such species, by a long shot. • Mass die-off of birds in south-western US ’caused by starvation’. One guess what the drought that caused the starvation was caused by. • Fighting the Covid recession by amping up fossil-fuel production. Imagine my surprise. • Global human-made mass now exceeds all living biomass. This doesn’t even include landfills. • Water now trading on the Stock Market. Hey, at least they haven’t monetized the air we breathe. Yet. • EU’s biggest oil producer closes deal to shut down its entire oil industry. Legally binding on future governments and everything. • November 202 hottest November on Record, beating out runners-up 2016 and 2019. During an El Nina no less, which acts to cool the planet. • By 2030, world’s governments plan to produce more than double the fossil fuels than would be consistent with curbing global warming. Meeting even the half-assed Paris accords requires cutting fossil fuel production by 6% annually. Current plans: an annual increase of 2%. • Media Reframes Projected Failure to Meet Carbon-Reduction Targets as Being ‘Within Striking Distance’ . If every country honors their pledges (which virtually none have done up to this point) we’re still looking at 2.1C increase by centuries’ end. But hey, let’s move the goalposts and call it a win. • Cloned Meat Goes Commercial. Only in Singapore, so far. And highly carbon-intensive until it scales up. But in a world in which 96% of mammalian biomass is people and livestock, it’s a start. November ’20 • Once covid passes, we plan on driving even more. We’re a bit more restrained when it comes to flying, at least. Be still my heart. October ’20 • A fifth of the world’s countries are in danger of ecosystem collapse. Odd. I didn’t realize that “ecosystems” respected international boundaries… • Arctic methane deposits starting to release, scientists find. Preliminary findings. Still awaiting confirmation. But if true, another cascade has begun. • China pledges Carbon-neutrality by 2060. The bad news is, talk is cheap from the world’s biggest coal-burner. Good news is, totalitarian regimes can turn on a dime if they really want to. None of that messy pandering-to-the-voter bullshit. • Over half the Great Barrier Reef has disappeared since the nineties. As usual, this estimate is conservative; it doesn’t include major bleaching events over the past year. • California wildfires spawn first ‘gigafire’ in modern history. One fire, one-million-plus acres. • Climate change could tip 1.45 million km2 of Amazonian rainforest to savannah by century’s end. Admittedly a conservative estimate. Popsci coverage here. September ’20 • World fails to meet a single one of the UN’s 2010 Aichi biodiversity targets to put the brakes on global ecocide. Not a single fucking one. Report here. • Northern Hemisphere’s 2020 summer hottest in recorded history. • Global wildlife populations down by 68% since 1970. Two thirds down, one to go. August ’20 • Greenland Ice Sheet has passed Point of No Return. Already the largest single contributor to rising sea levels. Now there’s no Off switch. • Rising temperatures on track to kill as many people as all current infectious diseases combined. Original paywalled study here. July ’20 and earlier • Forget future development; emissions resulting from projects already committed/underway mean we can kiss 1.5°C goodbye as an attainable target. • Covid Means Fewer Children!. Even better, the fertility decline preferentially affects those with the biggest carbon bootprints (i.e., urbanites in rich countries). • 2020: the worst year ever for the fossil fuel industry. “We’re still in for a long and ugly fight”, they admit. Still. • Virtual extinction of Polar bears within eighty years due to climate change. But it’s not all bad. A few straggly survivors may be all Coca Cola needs to keep its advertising campaign within the bounds of good taste. • Green power beats fossil fuels for first time in Europe. Still less than half, and pandemic-temporary. But something. Also when there’s a renewables surplus they pay you to consume electricity. • Unsuitable for ‘human life to flourish’: Up to 3B will live in extreme heat by 2070. • Record-breaking Siberian winter keeps 2020 on track to be hottest year in recorded history. Covid Pause? What Covid pause? • It hit 80F in the Arctic this week. Not to mention the zombie fires. • 2019: the Hottest Year in Europe’s Recorded History. • Ecuador To Sell A Third Of Its Amazon Rainforest To Chinese Oil Companies. • Amazon could switch from carbon sink to carbon source within twenty years.. “Decades ahead of even the most pessimistic climate models.” • The Great Barrier Reef is experiencing its third mass-bleaching event in five years.. Hey, just because nobody’s talking about it doesn’t mean it’s stopped happening. • E.P.A., Citing Coronavirus, Drastically Relaxes Rules for Polluters. But it’s okay, because they’re also asking companies to “act responsibly”. • Australian Bushfires destroyed over a fifth of the continent’s temperate broadleaf forests. This year alone. Who knows what next year might bring? • Global carbon emissions fall 2%. It’s pathetic progress and utterly insufficient, but I’ll take what I can get. • Australia’s Bushfires Completely Blasted Through the Models. They weren’t supposed to get this bad for another eighty years. • A quarter of climate-change tweets are from bots. The vast majority of them denialist. • January 2019 warmest in recorded history. • Good news for a change: Global emissions didn’t increase in 2019. • Climate change displaced 17.2 million from their homes in 2019. • Atmospheric triflouromethane—a greenhouse gas 12,000x worse than CO2— reaches record levels. • We’re currently adding 5 Hiroshima bombs worth of heat per second to the world’s oceans. And climbing. • Climate threats now dominate long-term risks. Global leaders finally admit risks outweigh those from cyberattacks, pandemics, geopolitical conflict and weapons of mass destruction. Well, duh. • Earth just had its hottest decade on record. NASA’s Gavin Schmidt admits 1.5C goal unattainable. • 2019 UN Emissions Gap Report (global emissions have to drop by 7.6% annually starting now or we’re even more fucked). • 3.2C unless emission-control efforts tripled. • Greenhouse gases accelerated to new peak in 2018. • Nature: Predicted extent of global flooding is triple previous estimates.

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Zeke Miller, Associated Press Zeke Miller, Associated Press Aamer Madhani, Associated Press Aamer Madhani, Associated Press Jon Gambrell, Associated Press Jon Gambrell, Associated Press Leave your feedback RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump signed a host of economic and bilateral cooperation agreements in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as he kicked off a four-day Middle East trip with a focus on dealmaking with a key Mideast ally while shared concerns about Iran’s nuclear program and the war in Gaza dragged on in the background. WATCH: Trump delivers remarks at U.S.-Saudi investment forum Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi de facto ruler, warmly greeted Trump as he stepped off Air Force One at King Khalid International Airport in the Saudi capital. The two leaders then retreated to a grand hall at the Riyadh airport, where Trump and his aides were served traditional Arabic coffee by waiting attendants wearing ceremonial gun belts. “I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump said later during a brief appearance with the crown prince at the start of a bilateral meeting. They later signed more than a dozen agreements to increase cooperation between their governments’ militaries, justice departments and cultural institutions. Additional economic agreements were expected to be inked later Tuesday at a U.S.-Saudi investment conference convened for the occasion. Prince Mohammed has already committed to some $600 billion in new Saudi investment in the U.S., but Trump teased $1 trillion would be even better. The pomp began before Trump even landed. Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s provided an honorary escort for Air Force One as it approached the kingdom’s capital — an exceptionally rare sight. Trump and Prince Mohammed also took part in a formal greeting and lunch at the Royal Court at Al Yamamah Palace, gathering with guests and aides in an ornate room with blue and gold accents and massive crystal chandeliers. As he greeted business titans with Trump by his side, Prince Mohammed was animated and smiling. It was a stark contrast to his awkward fist bump with then-President Joe Biden, who looked to avoid being seen on camera shaking hands with the prince during a 2022 visit to the kingdom. Biden had decided to pay a visit to Saudi Arabia as he looked to alleviate soaring prices at the pump for motorists at home and around the globe. At the time, Prince Mohammed’s reputation had been badly damaged by a U.S. intelligence determination that found he had ordered the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. READ MORE: Trump will visit Gulf Arab states this week as pressing crises flare in Gaza and Iran But that dark moment appeared to be distant memory for the prince as he rubbed elbows with high-profile business executives — including Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — in front of the cameras and with Trump by his side. Later, the crown prince will fete Trump with an intimate state dinner at Ad-Diriyah, a UNESCO heritage site that is the birthplace of the first Saudi state and the site of a major development project championed by the crown prince. Saudi Arabia and fellow OPEC+ nations have already helped their cause with Trump early in his second term by stepping up oil production. Trump sees cheap energy as a key component to lowering costs and stemming inflation for Americans. The Republican president has also made the case that lower oil prices will hasten an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. But Saudi Arabia’s economy remains heavily dependent on oil, and the kingdom needs a fiscal break-even oil price of $96 to $98 a barrel to balance its budget. It’s questionable how long OPEC+, of which Saudi Arabia is the leading member, is willing to keep production elevated. The price of a barrel of Brent crude closed Monday at $64.77. Trump picked the kingdom for his first stop, because it has pledged to make big investments in the U.S., but he ended up traveling to Italy last month for Pope Francis’ funeral. Riyadh was the first overseas stop of his first term. The three countries on Trump’s itinerary — Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — are places where the Trump Organization, run by Trump’s two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects. They include a high-rise tower in Jeddah, a luxury hotel in Dubai and a golf course and villa complex in Qatar. Trump is trying to demonstrate that his transactional strategy for international politics is paying dividends as he faces criticism from Democrats who say his global tariff war and approach to Russia’s war on Ukraine are isolating the U.S. from allies. READ MORE: Russian drones attack Ukraine after Kremlin rejects 30-day ceasefire proposal He’s expected to announce deals with the three wealthy countries that will touch on artificial intelligence, expanding energy cooperation and perhaps new arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The administration this month announced initial approval to sell $3.5 billion worth of air-to-air missiles for Saudi Arabia’s fighter jets. But Trump arrived in the Middle East when his top regional allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, are far from neatly aligned with his approach. Before the trip, Trump announced Washington was halting a nearly two-month U.S. airstrike campaign against Yemen’s Houthis, saying the Iran-backed rebels have pledged to stop attacking ships along a vital global trade route. The administration didn’t notify Israel — which the Houthis continue to target — of the agreement before Trump publicly announced it. It was the latest example of Trump leaving the Israelis in the dark about his administration’s negotiations with common adversaries. READ MORE: Who is Edan Alexander, the Israeli-American hostage released by Hamas? In March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t notified by the administration until after talks began with Hamas about the war in Gaza. And Netanyahu found out about the ongoing U.S. nuclear talks with Iran only when Trump announced them during an Oval Office visit by the Israeli leader last month. “Israel will defend itself by itself,” Netanyahu said last week following Trump’s Houthi truce announcement. “If others join us — our American friends — all the better.” William Wechsler, senior director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, said Trump’s decision to skip Israel on his first Middle East visit is remarkable. “The main message coming out of this, at least as the itinerary stands today, is that the governments of the Gulf … are in fact stronger friends to President Trump than the current government of Israel at this moment,” Wechsler said. Trump, meanwhile, hopes to restart his first-term effort to normalize relations between the Middle East’s major powers, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Trump’s Abraham Accords effort led to Sudan, the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco agreeing to normalize relations with Israel. But Riyadh has made clear that in exchange for normalization it wants U.S. security guarantees, assistance with the kingdom’s nuclear program and progress on a pathway to Palestinian statehood. There seems to be scant hope for making headway on a Palestinian state with the Israel-Hamas war raging and the Israelis threatening to flatten and occupy Gaza. Prince Mohammed last week notably hosted Palestinian Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh in Jeddah on the official’s first foreign visit since assuming office in April.

Title: Donald Trump signs economic agreement with Saudi Arabia

US president Donald Trump secured a $600 billion (€537 billion) commitment from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to invest in the United States. Mr Trump, who was beginning a tour of the Gulf states, was greeted by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, who later signed an agreement with the president in Riyadh on defence, energy, mining and other areas. The US agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion (€127 billion), according to a White House fact sheet that called it “the largest defence co-operation agreement” Washington has ever done. The agreement covers deals with more than a dozen US defence companies in areas including air and missile defence, air force and space advancement, maritime security and communications, the fact sheet said. “Today we hope for investment opportunities worth $600 billion, including deals worth $300 billion that were signed during this forum,” the Saudi crown prince said in a speech during a Saudi-US Investment Forum session held in Riyadh on the occasion of Mr Trump’s visit. “We will work in the coming months on the second phase to complete deals and raise it to $1 trillion,” he said. Saudi Arabia is one of the largest customers for US arms. [ A ‘very nice gesture’: Trump accepts gift of new Air Force One plane from QatarOpens in new window ] Mr Trump, who was accompanied by US business leaders including billionaire Elon Musk, will go on from Riyadh to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday. He has not scheduled a stop in Israel, a decision that has raised questions about where the close ally stands in Washington’s priorities, and the focus of the trip is on investment rather than security matters in the Middle East. Mr Trump left Israel off his schedule, although he wants Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu to agree to a new ceasefire deal in the 19-month-old Gaza war. Israel’s military operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hizbullah in Lebanon, and its assassinations of the two Iran-allied groups’ leaders, have at the same time given Mr Trump more leverage by weakening Tehran and its regional allies. [ Trump’s direct hostage talks with Hamas signal his growing impatience with Israel’s Gaza warOpens in new window ] US and Iranian negotiators met in Oman over the weekend to discuss a potential deal to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme. Mr Trump has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails. Mr Trump told the investment forum he wants to offer Iran a new and better path towards a more helpful future. If no new nuclear deal is reached, he said, Tehran will face maximum pressure. Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said last week he expected progress imminently on expanding accords brokered by Mr Trump in his 2017-21 first term, under which Arab states including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco recognised Israel. Mr Trump said it was his “fervent hope” that Saudi Arabia would soon sign its own normalisation agreement with Israel, adding: “But you’ll do it in your own time.” Mr Netanyahu’s opposition to a permanent stop to the war in Gaza or to the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress on similar talks with the Saudis unlikely, sources told Reuters. Mr Trump also said he would order the lifting of sanctions on Syria at the behest of the crown prince, in a huge boost for interim Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa as he seeks to stabilise a country shattered by war. The US imposed sanctions on Syria during the rule of Bashar al-Assad, and had kept them in place since he was toppled from power in December after more than 13 years of war. The US president also said he would send secretary of state Marco Rubio to Istanbul for talks on the war in Ukraine on Thursday. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday he would attend only if Russian president Vladimir Putin – who suggested the talks – is also there. The Kremlin has yet to say whether Mr Putin will take part. Mr Trump is also sending Mr Witkoff and Keith Kellogg, three sources familiar with the plans said. Mr Kellogg earlier said that Mr Trump will show up in Istanbul if Mr Putin attends the talks. – Reuters © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

VLADIMIR Putin has refused to meet brave Volodymyr Zelensky in Turkey for Ukraine peace talks - despite President Trump's offer to bring the Russian tyrant to the table. Zelensky had challenged the Russian dictator to meet him face-to-face to turn the screw and make a deal, but mad Vlad has instead made his latest dodge from peace. The bombshell list for the Russian delegation at Thursday's meeting was released by the Kremlin - with Putin's name missing. And a mere few minutes after it was established the tyrant wouldn't be in attendance, it was confirmed that Trump wouldn't be coming either after previously hinting he might. It's unclear whether Zelensky will still go to Istanbul. Speaking on Air Force One on Wednesday, Trump said: "[Putin] would like me to be there, and that’s a possibility. "I don’t know that he would be there if I’m not there. We’re going to find out." Russia is still sending a troop of heavyweights - including a presidential advisor, top diplomat, and senior military and intelligence officials. But if Putin were on the delegation list too, it would have marked a serious indication that he could be interested in ending the bloody war. The Russian dictator last week proposed to hold direct talks with Ukraine on Thursday May 15 - but had then gone silent on his offer. Zelensky on Tuesday said he was willing to go to Turkey but only if Putin was also there. Trump is currently in the Middle East as part of his first major tour since taking over the Oval Office. He is currently in Qatar for a state visit. It comes one day after Don inked the biggest arms deal in history to supply Saudi Arabia with $142bn worth of weapons, the White House said. The sale is part of a landmark $600 billion deal with Jeddah that was signed after Trump landed in Riyadh to kickstart his Middle East tour on Tuesday. The President has also taken a shot at rival Iran in a marquee speech, saying the Islamic Republic needed to make up its mind about whether it wanted to chase developing a nuclear weapon and get war or choose peace and a trading relationship. It marks Trump's first state visit of his second administration, after Saudi Arabia was also the first state visit in 2016. Follow our live blog below for the latest updates: Trump on Tuesday hailed a former terrorist warlord as “a young, attractive guy”. The maverick US President gushed with praise after meeting Ahmed al-Sharaa, who ousted Syrian tyrant Bashar al Assad last year. Trump also agreed to lift US economic sanctions on Syria which have been in place since 2011. Sharaa, previously linked to al-Qaeda, spent years in US custody after being captured in Iraq and once had a £7.5million bounty on his head. Now interim Syrian president, he shook hands yesterday with Trump in Riyadh, along with Saudi Arabia’s leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also joined a meeting by video link, which Trump later said went “great”. He described Sharaa as a “young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter.” But it puts Trump at odds with Israel, which issued warnings against the former terror master and has continued military action against its long-standing enemy. Asked if Sharaa can normalise relations with Israel, Trump said: “I told him, ‘I hope you’re going to join once you’re straightened out and he said yes’. But they have a lot of work to do.” Read the full story here. Twin celebrations of Trump's birthday and the Army's 250th anniversary will include as many as 25 tanks rolling through Washington in a celebration that will cost $25 million to $45 million, US officials have revealed. The US Army had long been planning to move troops and equipment to the National Mall in Washington on June 14 as part of its anniversary celebration. Plans now include an extravagant parade since the event coincides with Trump's 79th birthday. Two US officials revealed the eventual cost could be as high as $45 million. One of them said the cost included several million dollars more than it would have without a parade. The official added that the Army is planning on sending about two dozen M1 Abrams tanks for the celebration. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will travel to the US to meet Trump when he has returned from his Middle East tour. The trip will aim to "reset the strategic relationship between the two countries", according to Ramaphosa's office. Relations between the US and South Africa have nose-dived since Trump took power. The American cut all financial aid to the country - and then granted refugee status to a group of its white population on the grounds they face racial discrimination there. Multiple congressional Republicans are amongst those concerned by the wildly controversial $400million airplane Qatar wants to gift Trump. Rep Senator Rand Paul said: “I think it's not worth the appearance of impropriety. I wouldn't take it." Democrats rivals slammed the plan as an illegal foreign donation and national security threat. When Donal Trump announced he would be lifting all sanctions on Syria, it surprised even his own officials. Figures from the State and Treasury Departments scrambled to figure out how they would even go about cancelling the sanctions, according to four official sources. Many of the measures have been in place for decades - and must now be unstitched. Britain will strip Chinese ingredients from UK-made medicines bound for the US after pressure from Donald Trump, The Sun can reveal. The condition is part of the landmark UK-US trade pact signed last week, which slashed tariffs on British steel and car exports. In return, Britain had to swallow strict national security measures - including a clause to stop the UK becoming a “backdoor” for Chinese goods entering the American market. The US President has long accused the Communist giant of rigging trade, stealing IP and flooding Western markets with cheap state-backed goods. It is understood one key demand is that any drugs exported from Britain to America must be free from Chinese-made chemicals and components. A Government source told The Sun: "We are going to work with the pharmaceutical industry to secure the supply chain." Read the full story here. Iran's president said his country would not "bow to any bully" - after Trump criticised Tehran earlier on his tour. President Masoud Pezeshkian said of Trump: "He thinks he can come here, chant slogans, and scare us. "For us, martyrdom is far sweeter than dying in bed. You came to frighten us? We will not bow to any bully." The President branded Iran "the most destructive force" in the Middle East at an investment summit in Saudi on Wednesday - and blamed it for the continued instability. He also reiterated Washington's commitment to blocking Iran from ever developing nuclear weapons - and threated "maximum pressure" if Tehran rejected his "olive branch". Neither Vladimir Putin or Donald Trump will attend the Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul on Thursday, their officials confirmed. The list for the Russian delegation was released this evening - and Putin wasn't on it. Then, shortly afterwards, a US official confirmed that Trump would not be making the trip. Trump had hinted he would join Zelensky and Putin if he thought there was the chance of a deal being cut. It's not clear whether Putin's absence was the reason for Trump sitting out the negotiations. Guests at the state dinner in Doha tonight are being served roasted camel as part of the "culinary and cultural experience", reports Sky. The dish is considered a delicacy in Qatar and often rolled out for special occasions. Camel meat tastes similar to lean beef, but slightly gamier. Democrats have flown a banner over President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, drawing attention to his new, cosy, Qatari ties. The banner which reads "Welcome to Qatar-a-Lago" flew across the blue Palm Beach skies while Trump was in Doha for day two of his tour of the Middle East. Speaking at a state dinner hosted by the Emir of Qatar, Donald Trump has said Doha is working with the US on securing a deal with Iran, adding that he wants to see the country "thrive". He said: "It's a terrible situation and we want to do the right thing. "We want to do something that can save millions of lives." Piers Morgan was pictured being welcomed by Donald Trump at the Emir of Qatar prior to the state dinner. President Trump has been pictured greeting Kelly Ortberg - the chief of American manufacturing giant Boeing. Earlier, Trump announced that Qatar agreed to what he dubbed the "largest order of jets" in Boeing's history. Trump's right-hand man Marco Rubio has left the Trump team in Doha and is now bound to Turkey. The US secretary of state is to meet with Nato foreign ministers tomorrow in Antalya. Rubio is scheduled to travel on to Istanbul on Friday - where the US State Department says he will be in crunch talks with his counterparts on the Ukraine war. The US and Qatar signed an agreement to generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2trillion, the White House just revealed. Donald Trump has doubled down on his reason to accept a $400million aircraft as a gift from Qatar, calling the opportunity too valuable to refuse. While en route Qatar this morning for a state visit, Trump said to reporters onboard his Air Force One: "The plane that you’re on is almost 40 years old. “When you land and you see Saudi Arabia, you see UAE and you see Qatar, and they have these brand-new Boeing 747s, mostly. You see ours next to it – this is like a totally different plane. "We’re the United States of America. I believe we should have the most impressive plane.” The $400million jet could be the most expensive ever given by a foreign power to the United States - and will be used as his new Air Force One for much of his time in office. However, Trump's move to accept the palatial aircraft has raised a lot of eyebrows - including from his right-wing supporters like Ben Shapiro. While signing the deal, Trump compared the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Than with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump said to the Emir: "We came from Saudi Arabia, where we have another great man over there that's a friend of yours. "You two guys get along so well and like each other, you remind me a little bit of each other, if you want to know the truth. Both tall, handsome guys that happen to be very smart." President Trump and the Emir of Qatar have signed agreements to purchase aircraft from US Boeing. Qatar Airways had placed a "record" order for 160 planes from Boeing worth more than $200 billion. Trump said: "It's over $200 billion but 160 in terms of the jets. That's fantastic. So that's a record. "It's the largest order of jets in the history of Boeing. That's pretty good." Both parties have also agreed on a defence cooperation - inked by US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth - which includes a statement of intent. A letter of offer and acceptance for MQ-9B drones was also signed. The US president was given an unusual motorcade as he arrived in Qatar on the next stop on his historic four-day visit to the Middle East. Donald Trump's car was escorted through Doha by bullet-proof Tesla Cybertrucks. Tesla is run by Elon Musk who joined US officials for Saudi talks on Tuesday. Donald Trump is due to sit down with Qatari officials soon to have lunch before completing a signing ceremony. It is unclear what the president is set to sign as just 24 hours ago he announced a historic deal with Saudi Arabia. © NEWS ENTERPRISES, INC.

These new initiatives place Cisco at the center of the AI revolution in the Gulf, providing world class and trusted technology together with other Cisco partners.

During his tour of the region, Chuck Robbins met with the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Khaled bin Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan, Deputy Ruler of Abu Dhabi and National Security Advisor, Shiekh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Prime Minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, National Security Advisor of Bahrain, Sheikh Nasser bin Hamed, as well as other senior officials and dignitaries.
