Presently he works as Director of Energy Security and Supply Chains, at Strategy… More Info The outcome of the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Washington, including his meeting with Trump and his entire entourage, has been successful, at least by media reporting. The impact of all is still to be seen, but from the start, MBS’s visit not just rebooted a strained political relationship. The primary outcome, based on all, is that it has reset the economic core of the US–Saudi partnership around Aramco. While the largest oil company in the world had already found its place in global power projections, Aramco has now become the principal vehicle for turning headline investment promises into hard assets, contracts, and code. Though 2025 isn’t over yet, Aramco’s multibillion-dollar dealmaking spree with the United States has already reached staggering levels. In May 2025, the oil company had already unveiled 34 preliminary agreements with US companies worth up to $90 billion, encompassing a wide range of projects, including LNG, refinery upgrades, AI, advanced materials, and finance. The latter is now followed by another 17 MOUs, adding another $30 billion in potential projects, from LNG and manufacturing to services procurement. If you take both figures together, it shows clearly that the Saudi pledge to raise total investments is now anchored at around $1 trillion. Analysts should understand that these levels of financial commitments are no longer just about crude exports and arms sales; the message has become different. It represents a multi-layered energy, technology, and supply-chain bargain that puts Aramco at the center, with geopolitics written into it in capitals. For decades, Aramco’s main asset in the USA has been Motiva in Port Arthur, Texas. Its role is clear: Motiva has completed a debottlenecking that makes Port Arthur the largest refinery in the US, capable of processing about 654,000 bpd. Aramco indicated in May 2025 that it will invest another $3.4 billion to further integrate the refinery into a larger petrochemicals and fuels complex. The current moves made by Saudi Arabia and Aramco show, however, a sweeping change from crude oil to American-made supply chain products, as these downstream dollars sit alongside a sweeping web of MOUs with US industrial and service champions: At the same time, the Kingdom and Aramco have set their sights on access to US financial services and capital markets. Both are already showing results, as seen in the agreements with PIMCO, State Street, Wellington, and Wall Street banks, including BlackRock and Goldman Sachs. The main moves are to create dedicated vehicles, such as a “Fund of One,” to channel Saudi capital into US infrastructure and transition assets. The 'Fund of One' is a financial mechanism that enables Saudi Arabia to invest its capital directly in specific US projects, thereby supporting the US economy and safeguarding its long-term interests. Related: New Iraqi Leadership Confronts Water Shortage and Economic Strain While most are focusing on the synergies between US President Trump and his Saudi counterpart, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Kingdom's underlying strategic moves are guided by the well-known Saudi Vision 2030. Riyadh uses all projects and arrangements to lock in technology, services, and financing, mainly meant for local Saudi Vision 2030 projects. At the same time, these moves are diversifying Aramco’s earnings away from pure upstream oil, showcasing the company's adaptability. The Trump Administration, at the same time, wants to keep Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s most prominent investors and energy suppliers, deeply entangled in the US industrial base amid growing competition with China. The most strategic moves are seen in the LNG sphere. The Saudi oil giant is pursuing a clear gas pivot, while the USA sees it as an export machine. This shift has significant geopolitical implications, as it not only changes the dynamics of the global gas trade but also impacts the energy security strategies of both Saudi Arabia and the USA. Again, geopolitics, economics, and strategy are merging. Natural gas is the most strategic part of all. Saudi Arabia’s leading revenue maker, Aramco, has slowly but steadily repositioned itself from an oil-only behemoth toward becoming a serious LNG player. US export capacity has been assessed and approved as one of its main springboards. LNG markets have been woken up since April 2025 by Saudi moves, following the signing of a 20-year sale-and-purchase agreement by a subsidiary of Aramco with NextDecade. The latter SPA entails the delivery of 1.2 Mtpa of LNG from Train 4 of the Rio Grande project in Texas. According to current info, the project’s first phase is already under construction, with full build-out expected to cost around $18 billion. A year earlier, in June 2024, Aramco had already struck a heads-of-agreement with Sempra Infrastructure for 5 Mtpa of LNG offtake from the Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 expansion. The HOA also includes an option to take a 25 percent equity stake. Since May 2025, Aramco has been framing these commitments, 6.2 Mtpa initially, holding an ambition to reach 7.5 Mtpa by 2030. For the Saudis, these deals are seen as the backbone of a global gas portfolio that complements their oil exports. On the geopolitical stage, these deals and strategies are doing three things: Trump is also looking at a significant win, as Saudi capital and contracts will support US LNG expansion. This will significantly enhance Washington's power to lock in long-term influence over the global gas trade, a testament to the weight of these strategic moves. Another significant issue should also be addressed, linked to a combination of supply chains, critical minerals, and de-risking from China. Both parties have been very subtle in their moves to rewire supply chains away from Chinese dominance. Already at the broader US–Saudi Investment Forum, both parties have flagged agreements not only in energy but also in critical minerals and industrial inputs central to batteries, renewables, and advanced manufacturing. The goals of Aramco in this regard are clear; they want to secure long-term access to catalysts, metals, control systems, and specialized equipment that underpin both conventional and low-carbon projects. Washington’s goal is to ensure that a key Middle Eastern partner sources more of its strategic inputs from American or allied producers rather than from Chinese suppliers, as Trump seeks to counter or mitigate Beijing's growing influence in the Kingdom. For both parties, it is a form of mutual de-risking. The need for supply-chain interdependence matters to both. While Washington wants to block China, Riyadh wants the option to arbitrage between US, European, and Asian suppliers. Current Aramco-led deals are effectively creating a new layer of sunk-cost interdependence. If in place, these will make a sharp political rupture more expensive for both capitals. Overall, energy and AI are also explicitly fused into the relationship. Both countries have announced a US–Saudi AI Strategic Partnership aimed at making the Kingdom a “global AI leader.” Washington is reportedly considering approving the first sales of advanced AI chips to the Saudi venture Humain. The latter would open a controlled channel for high-end semiconductors into the Kingdom. Again, Aramco plays a pivotal role in all of this. In recent months, Aramco has already announced partnerships with Nvidia for AI and robotics infrastructure, AWS for cloud and environmental digitalization, and Qualcomm for advanced industrial connectivity. The geopolitical cloud is very relevant, as AI will give Aramco an operational edge, especially by enabling it to model reservoirs more effectively, optimize production and trading, and monitor infrastructure for cyber and physical threats. Again, the Kingdom’s role as the world’s default swing producer and system stabilizer is at play. The Saudi-US tech stack will also serve as a counterweight to Chinese solutions from firms like Huawei. Washington will also gain export control leverage, as it retains the ability to tighten or loosen access to advanced chips and cloud services. This will increase US leverage on Saudi decision-making, this time outside of oil and gas. It is also part of a new systemology that complements or substitutes for traditional defense and arms sales tools. Aramco’s main AI goal is not only focused on efficiency but also on gaining access to US-centered digital ecosystems. Beijing, as the leading competitor, will certainly notice this new alignment. International media have been discussing, especially, nuclear energy, defense, and security. Trump has clearly framed the broader package as a historic deepening of economic and defense ties, highlighting up to $1 trillion in prospective Saudi spending that spans nuclear energy, F-35 fighter jets, advanced chips, and energy investments. A Saudi-US civilian nuclear deal, worth several billions of dollars, was also signed after years of slow negotiations. Washington has clearly indicated that it wants Saudi nuclear and AI development to happen under American, not Beijing’s, umbrella. Even though Aramco is not a defense company, all its deals cannot be separated from the security architecture surrounding them, including oil and gas security, infrastructure hardening, and gas as a strategic commodity. Reality is again that all of the latter amounts to a renewed oil-for-security bargain. The only change is that it has been set up in a much more complex form: crude plus LNG, plus AI and chips, backed by US naval power and advanced weapons. Optimism is high, but….the proof is in the eating of the pudding, or maybe in this case, a bowl of Umm Ali. The MOUs will need to move from paper-based to hard assets. It is still to be seen how much of the $120 billion in Aramco MOUs will materialize into contracts, equity stakes, or shovel-ready projects. At the same time, will there be more or deeper US equity in Saudi projects? As Saudi Arabia opens more upstream and downstream assets to international capital – from gas fields to petrochemical complexes – US firms could seek larger equity stakes. Washington will push for this to balance the substantial positions held by Chinese and other Asian companies. Nuclear will be a long-term project; assessments will be needed. At the same time, all deals will be affected by political risk in both capitals. On the sidelines of all, but not to be forgotten, GCC countries will be assessing the changes too. Qatar and the UAE will be reassessing their relative positions towards the USA and within their existing bilateral relations. Saudi Arabia will be seeking a more prominent position, perhaps at Qatar's expense. As stated before, the situation is in flux and moving to different levels. When looking at the US-Saudi relationship, current moves are not a nostalgic return to the 1970s oil-for-bases deal, but a 21st-century variant in which Aramco serves as the hinge between hydrocarbons, LNG, digital infrastructure, and security. Washington will use its LNG-AI-high-end manufacturing links to ensure that a critical Gulf power stays within the Western strategic orbit and helps underwrite Atlantic energy security in an era of great-power rivalry. Riyadh’s position is clear: by locking in US infrastructure, chips, capital, and naval protection, it buys not only insurance for its own diversification but also supports Aramco’s transition from a pure oil major to a broader energy-and-technology platform. The coming months and years will depend on whether both sides can manage the inevitable frictions (human rights, regional wars, OPEC+ policy, or China) without lunging into a position of weaponizing the very interdependence they are now deepening. If successful, the Aramco-led wave of deals could mark the beginning of a more stable, if more complex, US–Saudi compact. In case of a significant failure, markets will need to understand that the same network of LNG contracts, AI clouds, and supply-chain ties will become the terrain on which the next phase of geopolitical competition is fought. For current developments, a clearer option exists: the personal relationship between MBS and Trump, two transactional powers holding options to change a region. As long as both sides can prevent a Zelensky situation, positive results can be made.

Title: Private Credit Firms to Swap Debt for Equity in Stressed 48Forty

Private credit lenders are poised to take control of pallet company 48Forty Solutions, about a year after providing $1.75 billion of debt to support Summit Partners’ acquisition of the business, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A group of lenders including Antares Capital are set to take equity in 48Forty under a proposed restructuring slated to close by the end of the year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Other lenders include KKR & Co., BlackRock Inc. and Carlyle Group Inc., the people said. The deal would shed about $1 billion of liabilities from 48Forty’s balance sheet as lenders swap their debt for a stake, the people said. As part of the proposal, lenders including Antares will inject around $75 million of new debt into 48Forty, they said. Representatives for Antares, KKR, BlackRock and Carlyle declined to comment. 48Forty and Summit didn’t respond to requests for comment. In cases where borrowers are struggling with their liabilities, private credit firms are more frequently swapping their debt positions for equity stakes to try and prevent losses. While swaps can produce upside, they also offer more unpredictable returns than direct loans, which are designed to provide stable income over time. Lenders proposed a debt restructuring for 48Forty earlier this year. The company, which was already paying the majority of the interest on its debt in kind, stopped paying interest in August, according to the people. FS KKR Capital Corp., a fund jointly managed by KKR and Future Standard, marked down the value of a loan to 48Forty to about 46 cents on the dollar in the third quarter, from around 86 cents a year ago, according to a filing. With the restructuring, plans to cut costs could include shuttering multiple pallet recycling plants, the people said, though no decision on closures has been made. 48Forty, which provides recycled wood pallets and pallet management services across the US and Canada, currently has 73 plants, according to its website. Lenders are also looking to appoint a new board for the company, the people said. Antares and KKR will each have two appointments, while Carlyle and BlackRock will jointly agree on one appointment, and first-lien lenders will all agree on another, they said. The last board seat will be reserved for the company’s chief executive officer. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P. This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs snap 5-day outflow streak with $75M reversal!

Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $75.47 million in net inflows on November 19, breaking a five-day outflow streak. Yes. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $75.47M in net inflows on 19 November, breaking a brutal 5-day outflow streak that drained institutional money. IBIT bounced back with $60.61M in inflows—a dramatic reversal from the historic $523M outflow just one day earlier on 18 November. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $75.47 million in net inflows on 19 November, snapping a five-day outflow streak that tested institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure. The reversal arrived as BTC stabilized near $90,000, with BlackRock’s IBIT leading the recovery just one day after suffering its worst exodus on record. Source: SoSoValue SoSoValue data shows the turnaround marks a critical shift in sentiment. The five-day bleeding period saw institutional money flee Bitcoin ETFs as price broke below key support levels and Fed rate cut expectations collapsed. IBIT contributed $60.61 million in inflows on 19 November, completely reversing course from the historic $523 million outflow recorded on 18 November. That single-day exodus represented the largest redemption in IBIT’s history, dragging the entire ETF market into negative territory. The rapid reversal suggests institutional sellers exhausted themselves during the five-day decline. Buyers stepped in as Bitcoin held support near $89,000, viewing the dip as an accumulation opportunity rather than the start of a deeper correction. Grayscale’s smaller BTC fund added another $53.84 million in inflows, continuing its pattern of attracting institutional capital even during broader market weakness. The fund has consistently posted positive flows while larger competitors experienced volatility. Not all ETFs participated in the recovery. Fidelity’s FBTC recorded -$21.35 million in outflows, extending its own streak of redemptions. VanEck’s HODL posted -$17.63 million in exits. Meanwhile, most mid-sized and smaller ETFs, including GBTC, ARKB, BITB, and others, recorded zero net flows. The concentration of activity in IBIT and Grayscale’s mini BTC fund suggests institutional money remains selective about which vehicles they use for Bitcoin exposure. Total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs now sit at $117.34 billion, representing roughly 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. Despite recent volatility, the category has maintained structural growth since its launch in January 2024. The $75 million inflow may seem modest compared to the hundreds of millions that fled during the five-day streak. But the directional change matters more than the magnitude. Breaking a five-day outflow pattern signals that institutional selling pressure has eased. If flows remain positive or neutral over the next week, it would confirm that the November selloff represented profit-taking rather than a fundamental shift in institutional demand. Bitcoin currently trades at $89,516.91, down from recent highs near $100,000 but holding above the critical $88,000-$90,000 support zone. The ETF reversal suggests institutions view current levels as attractive entry points rather than the beginning of a deeper downturn.

Share this article US Bitcoin ETFs recorded $75 million in net inflows yesterday, ending a five-day streak of outflows as institutional investors resumed accumulating the digital asset. BlackRock, the global investment management firm operating the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), led the buying activity alongside Grayscale’s mini ETF, which also contributed to the positive flows. These two products were the only ones driving net inflows, while most other issuers saw flat activity. VanEck and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund recorded net outflows, signaling a more cautious stance among other providers during the market reversal. The renewed institutional interest marks a shift from recent selling pressure that had dominated Bitcoin ETF flows. BlackRock has consistently been among the top contributors to Bitcoin ETF inflows since the products launched, helping drive institutional adoption of crypto assets.

Title: BlackRock’s Staked Ethereum ETF Play Could Supercharge Bitcoin Hyper

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: BlackRock just spun up a new trust in Delaware for an iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, signaling phase two of institutional crypto: yield on-chain, wrapped in TradFi. Roughly 15 months after launching its flagship Ethereum ETF, $ETHA, the asset management giant is now lining up a product that combines $ETH price exposure with staking rewards. $ETHA, which launched in July 2024, has already pulled in around $13B in inflows and quickly became one of the most successful spot Ethereum ETFs on the market. The key detail: ETHA itself does not stake its $ETH, so investors get pure price exposure alone, and nothing from the roughly 4% average staking yield that validators earn on-chain. The new trust changes that equation. A staked $ETH ETF would transform Ethereum exposure into a total-return product, tacking on staking yield to capital gains. That kind of structure is tailor-made for institutions that want the benefits of blockchain without running their own validator infrastructure or worrying about slashing risks. When big money gets comfortable with yield-bearing crypto ETFs on Bitcoin and Ethereum, the usual pattern is simple: liquidity and attention trickle down the risk curve. First majors, then high-beta infrastructure plays. In this cycle, one of the cleanest ways to express that ‘higher beta on Bitcoin’ thesis is not another meme coin, but a Bitcoin Layer-2 like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) that tracks Bitcoin’s performance while adding real utility. That is where Bitcoin Hyper’s ongoing presale starts to look very interesting. Bitcoin Hyper is building a Layer-2 rollup on top of Bitcoin that batches transactions off-chain, executes them at high speed, then settles the final state back to Bitcoin Layer-1. In practice, it aims to turn Bitcoin into something that feels closer to Solana in terms of speed, while still inheriting Bitcoin’s battle-tested security. To do this, the team uses a canonical bridge that wraps native $BTC into a compatible asset for use on the Hyper rollup. A Solana Virtual Machine environment then handles execution, enabling thousands of transactions per second and near-instant finality. This is the pain point Bitcoin Hyper goes after: Bitcoin is the largest, most trusted asset in crypto, yet still awkward to use beyond simple transfers and custody. Fees spike in every hype cycle, throughput caps out around single-digit TPS, and DeFi flows largely bypass the network. By pushing computation to an L2 while anchoring security on Bitcoin, Hyper tries to unlock that trapped value. The next logical step is infrastructure that lets those assets actually move and work in DeFi. A Bitcoin-native L2 that can route wrapped BTC into lending, DEXs, and payments is directly aligned with that shift. Add in the project’s public focus on conservative security assumptions, and the narrative becomes straightforward: a scaling solution that respects the base chain, rather than trying to replace it. On the numbers side, the Bitcoin Hyper presale has already raised over $28M, with the current token price sitting at $0.013305. That puts it in the upper tier of the best crypto presales of 2025 and suggests there is real appetite for Bitcoin-aligned infrastructure rather than just memes. Staking is a major part of the pitch. Early buyers can stake $HYPER for reported rewards of around 41%, turning idle presale allocations into a yield-bearing position while the team ships its roadmap. Learn how to buy and stake $HYPER today. There is also a clear roadmap-linked upside story. Our price modeling sees potential highs of $0.08625 in 2026 if Bitcoin Hyper hits its milestones around mainnet, early dApps, and DAO launch. For holders who already believe in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory and see BlackRock-style products as confirmation, $HYPER acts like a leveraged play on that same thesis: more throughput, more DeFi rails, and more ways for $BTC liquidity to earn yield. In other words, while BlackRock stays tightly focused on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, investors who want to front-run where that institutional adoption might push demand next are looking directly at Bitcoin Layer-2s. Right now, Bitcoin Hyper is one of the few presales offering that combination of narrative fit, clear technical design, and significant capital already committed. Check out the Bitcoin Hyper presale.

Title: Securitize Leverages Plume to Expand Global Real-World Asset Reach

Modular RWA-focused layer 2 blockchain Plume announced Wednesday that tokenization giant Securitize is set to expand its footprint in DeFi by rolling out institutional-grade assets on Plume's Nest staking protocol. The partnership, underscoring the growing convergence of traditional finance and DeFi infrastructures, will connect BlackRock and Morgan Stanley-backed Securitize's tokenized funds to Plume's network of over 280,000 real-world asset (RWA) holders – supposedly the largest RWA investor community globally. In essence, Securitize's institutional-grade assets gain another robust onchain venue to move, trade and earn yield at scale. All underlying assets are issued and managed under Securitize’s rigorous regulatory framework, ensuring transparency, full auditability, and compliance. Plume's Nest staking protocol lets investors move, trade, and earn yield on tokenized assets within a regulated and composable DeFi ecosystem, supported by Bluprynt's Know-Your-Issuer verification system for enhanced transparency and trust. "Through Plume, we’re connecting institutional-grade assets to one of the largest communities of onchain RWA holders anywhere in the world. This collaboration represents a major step toward realizing truly global, transparent, and accessible digital capital markets," Carlos Domingo, Co-Founder and CEO of Securitize, said in a press release shared with CoinDesk. Teddy Pornprinya, co-founder and CBO of Plume, emphasized that the on-chain world operates under the same principle as traditional markets: distribution determines scale. He explained that tokenized assets require liquidity, reach, and composability to realize their potential, capabilities Plume is uniquely positioned to provide. “Securitize sets the gold standard in compliant issuance. Plume delivers the global distribution, composability, and liquidity layer that makes these assets come alive in DeFi," Pornprinya said. The rollout starts with Hamilton Lane funds and will expand through 2026, targeting $100 million in capital, according to the press release. As a part of the deal, Bitcoin finance platform Solv plans to invest up to $10 million in Plume's RWA vaults, broadening BTC-based yield offerings with regulated, real-world asset exposures. Speaking on the matter, Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol, stressed BTC's role in yield-bearing markets. “As regulated on-chain markets emerge, bitcoin will underpin a new generation of yield, credit, and liquidity infrastructure, where demand for yield-bearing bitcoin with RWA-backed yields replaces passive treasuries as the next phase of institutional adoption," Chow said.

BlackRock eyes staking integration as SEC clears path for advanced crypto ETFs after Nasdaq’s July filing. It’s often the first public sign that a new ETF may be in development before formal regulatory filings. Instead of just spot exposure, this product appears to focus on staking, allowing yield generation. BlackRock is once again signaling deeper ambitions in the Ethereum [ETH] ecosystem. Fresh corporate filings in Delaware reveal a new entity named the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust, suggesting that the world’s largest asset manager is exploring a staked Ethereum product. The registration was filed by BlackRock Managing Director Daniel Schweiger, the same individual behind the firm’s original iShares Ethereum fund in 2023. This move signals a potential expansion beyond simple spot exposure, suggesting interest in yield-generating, staking-based investment products. Importantly, a Delaware name registration often serves as the first public clue that a new ETF may be in the works. Analysts believe this case is no exception, interpreting it as an early step toward a broader crypto investment strategy. This development follows Nasdaq’s updated 19b-4 filing in July, which requested approval to add staking capabilities to BlackRock’s existing iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). The current filing indicates that BlackRock may be pursuing not just a new product, but also enhancing its current Ethereum offerings with staking features. This momentum comes on the heels of the SEC’s recent approval of listing options for spot Bitcoin ETFs, clearing a major regulatory barrier for more advanced crypto fund structures. In fact, according to Eric Balchunas, a memo from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) earlier this week marked the final key approval required before these derivative products launch. Remarking on which, Blachunas added, “Now it’s just a matter of when, not if. We will get the exact data as soon as we can.” This comes at a time when BlackRock appears uninterested in pursuing any altcoin ETF filings, even as institutions accelerate efforts around Solana and XRP products. Reflecting this stance, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, said, “Most of the altcoins as worthless.” For example, in October, Grayscale secured approval to enable staking for two of its U.S.-listed funds: the Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and the Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH). This milestone made them the first spot-market ETFs, publicly registered under the Securities Act of 1933, to offer staking rewards—marking a significant step forward in regulated crypto investment products. Earlier this year, REX-Osprey also introduced a staking-enabled Solana ETF under the Investment Company Act of 1940, later expanding its portfolio with an ETH staking fund using the same structure in September. However, while U.S. regulators and asset managers continue to navigate the complexities of staking-enabled ETFs, other markets are moving faster. Hong Kong’s ChinaAMC, for instance, launched the world’s first spot Solana [SOL] ETF earlier today, trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The product offers exposure in HKD, RMB, and USD with a 0.99% annual management fee, effectively beating U.S. competitors to market by several weeks. Thus, with Hong Kong already approving spot Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum ETFs, the region is positioning itself as a global hub for tokenized capital markets. Meanwhile, on the price front, Ethereum was trading at $3,023.18, down 0.88% over the past 24 hours and nearly 15% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Additionally, institutional sentiment also appears equally strained, with Ethereum ETFs recording continuous withdrawals since 11th November. On the 18th of November alone, the sector saw $74.2 million in outflows, followed by $37.4 million on the 19th of November. BlackRock’s own ETHA fund has led this downtrend, logging $165.1 million and $24.6 million in outflows on the same respective dates, the highest among its peers. Yet, despite this bearish flow cycle, regulatory milestones continue to reshape the landscape.

Walmart Inc., the world’s biggest retailer, said it will move its stock listing to the Nasdaq, marking the largest defection in the New York Stock Exchange’s history. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, which has been on the NYSE since 1972, said it expects its shares to begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the highest of the exchange’s three tiers, on Dec. 9. The move to the tech-heavy Nasdaq reflects Walmart’s “technology-forward approach,” the retailer said, and it will transfer the listing of nine bonds to the exchange as well. Its stock will trade under its current ticker symbol, “WMT.” Large companies have made the move before, with PepsiCo Inc. abandoning its nearly century-long listing on the NYSE in 2017. With a market capitalization of about $166 billion at the time, it was then the biggest company to transfer to Nasdaq, later topped by Linde Plc, which shifted to Nasdaq with a value of roughly $180 billion at the time. Walmart’s market cap, meanwhile, tops $800 billion. Nasdaq said last year that some 40 members of the S&P 500 have migrated, with 24 of those companies now in the Nasdaq-100 index. Both Nasdaq and the NYSE have lured companies away from each other’s venues in recent years, and moves can include perks such as marketing and cost savings. The NYSE said it’s attracted 347 companies from Nasdaq, including Virtu Financial Inc., which transferred over earlier this year. While Nasdaq and the NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc., dominate US stock listings, competition from new entrants is intensifying. The upstart Texas Stock Exchange, backed by investors including JPMorgan Chase & Co., BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities, has received approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission and plans to begin trading in 2026. The exchanges are also grappling with the growing trend among companies to stay private for longer, tapping funding sources such as private equity firms that offer capital without the costs and regulatory oversight associated with operating a publicly traded company.

Title: ‘Blue-chip’ cryptocurrencies fall on volatile macros, profit booking by large institutions

BTC price fell from $115,699.2 level as on September 20, 2025 to $91,835.5 as on 18:30 IST, November 20, down 21 per cent. ETH fell from $4,480.41 to $3,028.86 during same period, down 32 per cent. BTC touched its all-time high of $126,198.07 just last month, while ETH hit an all-time high of $4,953.73 in August, according to investing.com and coinmarket cap. Sumit Gupta, Co-founder and CEO at CoinDCX, said over the past month, both BTC and ETH have experienced elevated volatility primarily due to macro-driven liquidity shifts and profit-booking by short-term market participants. Bitcoin dropping below the $90,000 mark the first time since April has been influenced by US-China tariff row, tightening global liquidity, uncertainty around US fiscal conditions, and rapid position unwinding by leveraged traders. “At the same time, broader market sentiment has been oscillating, as investors reassess risk assets amid mixed inflation cues and shifting expectations around interest rate policy. Even blue-chip tokens are not insulated from these forces. However, it’s important to note that the structural fundamentals for BTC and ETH remain intact,” he said. He added that recent ETF flow data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen about $2.59 billion in outflows this month, with BlackRock’s IBIT recording roughly $1.26 billion outflows and Fidelity’s FBTC around $540 million. These outflows indicate investor repositioning, Gupta says, but they should not be interpreted as a strategic exit by major institutions. According to Vikas Gupta, Country Manager at Bybit India, while some of the recent decline appears to be driven by profit-booking rather than any meaningful exit from long-term institutional investors, BTC’s breach of key technical support levels has intensified the market reaction, triggering automated liquidations and resulting in steeper price swings. The trend line support in the $95,000–$100,000 range also appears to have been breached, leading to heavy liquidations and reducing stability at current levels. “Recent on-chain data indicates notable outflows from BTC and ETH wallets controlled by large institutions, and this is also visible in ETF redemptions led by major issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity. As a result, this has raised questions about whether large financial institutions are actually reducing their exposure to crypto assets. However, these outflows appear to be driven by short-term profit-taking and regular portfolio rebalancing rather than a long-term exit from the crypto space,” he said. Aishwary Gupta, Global Head of Payments at Polygon Labs, said technically BTC is still in a post-halving cyclical uptrend, but with much more institutional flow this time. As long as it holds its higher-lows structure on the weekly chart, the broader bull cycle remains intact, even with deep corrections. The key levels to watch are the prior cycle’s range highs as support zones, and the ETF-driven “price discovery” area as resistance. If those supports hold through macro volatility, BTC continues to behave like a high-beta, digital macro asset for 2025–26. For ETH, Gupta says, the technicals intersect more directly with fundamentals: On-chain, ETH is gradually turning into infrastructure/“tech equity” plus collateral for rollups, DeFi, and restaking. Structurally that supports a longer-term uptrend even if it underperforms BTC in phases. “From a chart perspective, the important thing is whether ETH can sustain a multi-year pattern of higher highs and higher lows against both USD and BTC. If it does, 2025–26 looks like a consolidation-plus-accumulation phase where ETH behaves like a growth asset leveraged to the broader crypto/app-chain cycle,” he said.

Title: Trump urges Scott Bessent to take Fed chair role, ‘but he wants no part of it, he likes being secretary of the Treasury’

For the second time in two days, President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would like to appoint Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to chair the Federal Reserve. Yet Bessent keeps saying he doesn’t want the job, Trump added, in comments to the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum. “We’re thinking about him for the Fed, but he wants no part of it, he likes being secretary of the Treasury,” Trump said. “I think we’ll leave him — so let’s cross your name off right, officially, right?” Trump has been sharply critical of the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May, for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. Trump’s pick as a replacement will almost certainly push for rapid interest rate cuts and likely institute wide-ranging changes in how the Fed operates. Bessent earlier this year published extensive criticisms of the Fed’s groundbreaking efforts to shore up financial markets and the economy after the 2008-2009 Great Recession and during the pandemic. Bessent is heading up the Trump administration’s search for a new Fed chair. Yet despite his protestations, he is also widely seen as a leading potential replacement for Powell. “He’s a top-tier candidate right now,” Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser to Trump in his first term, said. Trump “wants to shake things up, so I think he wants an outsider.” Two of the five candidates Bessent has named are current Fed officials: Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. The other three would fit the outsider criteria: Kevin Hassett, currently a top White House economic official; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who has been highly critical of the Fed; and Rick Rieder, a senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. Late Tuesday, in an interview on Fox News with Bret Baier, Bessent said the administration is continuing to interview potential nominees for Fed chair. By mid-December, “the president will meet the final three candidates and hopefully have an answer before Christmas,” Bessent said. ___ Associated Press Writer Fatima Hussein contributed to this report.

Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden sells $1.3 billion in BTC as retail panic grows, while institutional ownership of Bitcoin ETFs climbs to 40% despite market fear. Owen Gunden, one of the richest early Bitcoin holders, has sold his entire Bitcoin position as retail investors flee the market and institutions continue increasing their share of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The wallet tagged as Owen Gunden by blockchain data platform Arkham transferred his last 2,499 Bitcoin (BTC) worth $228 million to cryptocurrency exchange Kraken on Thursday. In total, Gunden’s wallet has sold 11,000 Bitcoin worth around $1.3 billion since Oct. 21, liquidating his entire Bitcoin holdings, according to Arkham. Gunden’s transactions come amid growing concerns over the end of the bull market, with Bitcoin market conditions deteriorating to their “most bearish” level during the current cycle. CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index has declined to 20/100, or extreme bearish, Cointelegraph reported earlier on Thursday. Related: BlackRock leads near $3B Bitcoin November ETF exodus with record $523M outflows Gunden is the eighth-richest person in crypto, with a net worth of about $561 million according to Arkham’s list of the top crypto millionaires. Gunden was an early Bitcoin arbitrage trader on exchanges like Tradehill and the now-defunct Mt. Gox. He traded 10s of thousands of Bitcoin on the exchange when it was still operational until 2014, building his onchain wealth. Related: BitMine sits on $3.7B loss as DAT ‘Hotel California’ meets BlackRock’s staked ETH ETF Meanwhile, the institutional ownership of US spot Bitcoin ETFs continues rising to new highs, despite retail fears over the end of the bull market cycle. The institutional ownership of Bitcoin ETFs surged to 40% on Wednesday, wrote Bitcoin analyst Root, in an X post. This marks a significant increase from the 27% institutional ownership recorded in the second quarter of 2024, when about 1,119 firms held investments via US spot Bitcoin ETFs. The 40% is based on the latest 13-F filings of institutional participants, which is a “conservative estimate” considering that only institutions managing over $100 million are required to file these reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Root said. The growing figures indicate that institutions are holding onto their shares, despite the large-scale selling by ETF shareholders, which has resulted in $2.8 billion in outflows so far in November, according to Farside Investors data.

Title: Exclusive: Former BlackRock employees raise $4.6 million for HelloTrade, a blockchain-powered trading platform
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/20/former-blackrock-employees-raise-4-6-million/
Time Published: 2025-11-20T13:00:00Z

Kevin Tang and Wyatt Raich used to work in digital assets at BlackRock, where they helped the company pivot from its loud skepticism of crypto to being one of Wall Street’s major players in the sector. During this time, they came to feel it was too difficult for people overseas to participate in common investment opportunities like purchasing U.S. stocks. That’s why they co-founded HelloTrade, a mobile-first, blockchain-powered trading platform. The company announced on Thursday that it raised $4.6 million in a first round of funding from Dragonfly Capital, with backing from Mirana Ventures, along with angel investors. “We see a huge market opportunity to make these traditional assets such as stocks and commodities accessible to anyone around the world with an internet connection,” Tang, co-founder and CEO of HelloTrade, said in an interview with Fortune. “We believe that the next frontier of blockchain adoption will be the movement of these traditional markets on chain.” HelloTrade aims to give investors around the world access to U.S. assets. For example, people in Vietnam or Indonesia may want to buy Tesla stock. But through their current brokerage systems, those aren’t easily accessible. By using crypto technology, HelloTrade plans to solve that problem. The platform also offers perpetual futures, which give customers more exposure to an asset than they would have in cash on the platform. HelloTrade’s value proposition is similar to that of trading platforms like Robinhood and Revolut. Tang says those companies can be clunky and hard to use, and that HelloTrade will focus on building a better user interface. The startup’s product has not launched yet, but Tang said he expects it to launch at the end of this year or the beginning of next year. The company currently has about 10 employees. At BlackRock, Tang and Raich, HelloTrade’s co-founder and CTO, helped develop the firm’s crypto offerings. Tang worked as senior director on its digital assets team, and Raich was the head of engineering at its digital asset lab. During their tenure, the company released the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) ETFs, funds that both had record debuts on the stock market and were among the first crypto ETFs to launch. The two HelloTrade co-founders aren’t the only ones bringing their legacy finance talents to the crypto world. In a report from last month, the well known venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto arm found that workers coming into crypto tend to come from a traditional finance background. This blending of Wall Street and crypto coincides with President Donald Trump’s friendly policies toward the sector. Since last year’s election, big banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have developed their blockchain technology. Tang and Raich often heard a saying at BlackRock: you spend decades building up trust, and you can lose it in a matter of minutes. It’s an ethos they have brought to HelloTrade, which is why they plan to spend their new capital in part to educate individuals around the world about the benefits of blockchain technology, and to invest in the safety and security of their product.

If private finance is to shoulder the burden for nature conservation, government has to create the necessary incentive structure. If private finance is to shoulder the burden for nature conservation, government has to create the necessary incentive structure. By Mark Opel Nov. 20, 2025 It’s easy to demonstrate the need to fund nature conservation, beyond simply funding the fight against climate change. Wildlife populations have declined 73 percent since 1970, one million species are threatened with extinction, and scientists have determined that the world has crossed seven of nine planetary boundaries. Five of the 10 greatest long-term global risks are environmental, according to the World Economic Forum, with biodiversity loss and ecological collapse ranking second among all risks to the global economy and population. Moreover, funding biodiversity is an investment, not a cost: With over half of global GDP dependent on nature, a transition to a nature-positive economy could actually generate up to $10.1 trillion in annual business value, creating 395 million jobs globally by 2030. Fighting climate change and conserving nature are not in opposition, of course. Nature will be critical to solving the climate crisis: neither biodiversity loss nor climate change will be successfully resolved unless both are tackled together. Yet while nature-based solutions can contribute about one-third of the climate change mitigation needed by 2030, nature receives only 2 percent of total climate funding. Why this disparity? The problem is that we’ve expected private finance to shoulder the burden, and it hasn’t. When I left the world of private equity to apply my finance skills to nature conservation, I had hundreds of conversations with people who used buzzwords and phrases like “innovative finance,” “market-based solutions,” and “impact investing” to describe their goal of uniting profit with conservation. “We just need to build a pipeline of investable projects” was a common refrain, and they made it sound easy to save nature and make money at the same time. When I looked, however, I found that pipeline virtually empty, and it has remained so over the past ten years. Everyone agrees that private finance will be essential to close the nearly $1 trillion annual biodiversity funding gap, but 40 years of generating “innovative finance” and “market-based solutions” have left governments still providing over 80 percent of nature funding. Climate finance is often taken as a model for financing nature conservation, but the economics are fundamentally different. In 2023, private sources provided over $1.2 trillion of climate finance out of a total of $1.9 trillion, representing 66 percent of total climate finance. The share of private finance for climate was over four times the 15 percent share of private finance for nature. The difference is that the private sector can generate attractive financial returns by investing in things like renewable energy, electric vehicles, and efficiency upgrades; these opportunities have led to massive increases in private investments addressing climate change. Similar opportunities to generate revenues and returns simply don’t exist in nature conservation. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. It’s important to remember that attractive climate investment opportunities didn’t happen on their own or through market forces. Governments implemented meaningful policies that make investing in climate solutions profitable and, in some cases, also put in place disincentives that make contributing to climate change costly. For example, in the solar industry, the United States subsidized the research and development that created the first solar panels, China’s industrial policies drove down the costs of manufacturing those panels, and Germany, China, the US, Japan, and other countries all subsidized the adoption of solar that made it attractive for consumers to install. Even now that renewables are the cheapest form of energy, they continue to need government policy support to meet the world’s climate goals. Nature conservation is going to need comparable levels of policy and regulatory support as climate, if it is going to attract private capital at the scale necessary to close the biodiversity funding gap. While there are compelling reasons for the private sector to collectively invest in nature, there is not a compelling business case for any individual business to invest in what will always be, ultimately, a public good. And however much value nature provides (and will be missed if it’s gone), companies and investors have no incentive to internalize their externalities, which will be borne by society but not accounted for on individual financial statements. We can’t blame companies, managers, or investors for this lack of investment; they are incentivized to maximize profits for their shareholders (“You must not expect unnecessary good behavior from capitalists,” as Jeremy Grantham put it). To do otherwise risks your bonus or your job as a manager and, if you are publicly traded, invites an attack on your company (see, for example, Danone) from activist hedge funds (which are also just doing their job in our current system). Being a private company not subject to public market pressures doesn’t change the incentive structure: there are few copycats of Yvon Chouinard’s strategy at Patagonia. We have seen a range of voluntary commitments on climate from large tech companies and groups of banks, but companies inevitably prioritize shareholder returns over voluntary sustainability efforts. We have therefore seen prominent climate goals in the tech sector missed, deforestation pledges fail, and coalitions like the Net-Zero Banking Alliance cease operations. This is a classic example of a market failure that must be addressed through government action. Governments need to recognize biodiversity as the public good that it is, like education and science, public health, infrastructure, and security, the sort of public good that must be funded by governments or incorporated into private investment decision-making through public policy, regulations, and incentives. The private sector is not going to step up and invest in nature voluntarily if it doesn’t increase returns to shareholders in the short term; that’s not how the game is played. However, as Tariq Fancy, former Chief Investment Officer of Sustainable Investing at BlackRock put it, governments can “fix the rules of the game.” Governments can change the rules of the game for the private sector through incentives and regulations, and can also raise funds from the private sector through taxes, fees, and levies that can then be used to directly fund investments in nature, each of which is discussed below. “To realize the potential of private sector investment in nature protection and conservation,” as Hank Paulson put it, “governments must put in place policy measures—such as tax breaks, de-risking guarantees, and regulatory requirements—that induce the private sector to invest.” Governments can incentivize the protection and restoration of nature through a variety of mechanisms, including government grants, loans, guarantees and tax incentives that encourage activities that generate positive impacts, or reduce negative impacts, on biodiversity. For example, Costa Rica’s payments for ecosystem services (PES) program pays landowners for the environmental services (e.g., carbon sequestration, biodiversity and soil conservation, and water purification) provided by the conservation and reforestation of their land. Funded by a tax on fossil fuels, the program has helped Costa Rica increase its forest cover from 21 percent in the late 1980s to over 50 percent today. The United States provides tax incentives to encourage private land conservation, which have resulted in the conservation of over 61 million acres of private lands, an area larger than all of the U.S. National Parks combined. A similar program in South Africa has added over one million acres to its protected area network. Government-backed entities like the U.S. Development Finance Corporation, Inter-American Development Bank, and World Bank have provided guarantees that attract private capital in debt-for-nature swaps that generate new long-term funding for nature, totaling $1.7 billion to date. And the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), launched at COP30 in Brazil, is the latest effort to provide incentives for private investment in conservation. The TFFF intends to raise $25 billion of government funding and use that to leverage $100 billion of private funding. Returns from investments of these funds will be used to pay tropical forest for the conservation and restoration of their forests. The government contributions are junior to the private contributions to the fund, de-risking the investment for the private investors. There is also massive potential for governments to shift incentives by redirecting government subsidies away from activities that harm nature toward activities that conserve and restore it. Governments currently provide $2.6 trillion of environmentally harmful subsidies to fossil fuel, agriculture, forestry, construction, fisheries and other industries, about three times the amount needed to close the biodiversity funding gap, and agreed to reform $500 billion of those subsidies by 2030 in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Governments can require increased private investment in nature by implementing regulations that require changes in private sector activities that impact nature and investments to implement those changes. Examples include the US Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, which set limits on pollution of air and water, generated trillions of dollars of private investment and resulted in significant positive impacts on biodiversity and human health. The UK is also instituting a new regulation that requires developers to deliver a biodiversity net gain of 10 percent. It is intended to make sure development will result in more or better-quality natural habitat than there was before development. The EU Regulation on Deforestation-free Products requires businesses to prove that their products do not originate from recently deforested land or have contributed to forest degradation. In addition to incentives and regulations, governments can generate funds from the private sector through taxes, fees, and levies that they can then use to invest directly in biodiversity. Colombia, for example, has implemented a carbon tax that generates $100 million annually and uses 80 percent of the proceeds to fund investments in nature. The US Land and Water Conservation Fund uses earnings from offshore oil and gas leases to fund state and federal land and water conservation and has provided over $22 billion to date. Botswana’s protected area fees generate $8 million per year. Belize charges a $20 conservation fee to all tourists that directly funds its Protected Area Conservation Trust. The state of Hawaii is assessing a “Green Fee” on tourists that is projected to generate $100 million per year to invest in its natural resources. And my hometown of Boulder, Colorado, was the first city in the nation to implement a tax to conserve land, resulting in the protection of over 45,000 acres (over 70 percent of the city) and helping to make it one of the best cities to live in the country. There are also initiatives underway to develop and implement global levies on things like fossil fuels, aviation, shipping and financial transactions to generate more funds. And governments need to fund nature-related research and development (as they have in renewable energy) in areas such as sustainable agriculture that will help develop new technologies that reduce costs and lead to positive outcomes for biodiversity. Nature is in crisis, and we need fewer “finance experts” and complex voluntary efforts and more focus on generating political will. We need to embrace the irony that to get the private sector investing in nature, we have to first focus on the public sector. Leaders in all sectors who have committed to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the Paris Climate Agreement must generate private finance by changing the rules of the game.

Title: Ed Dowd: It Has Begun — Housing, Credit and FCF Have Cracked … Stocks Are Next

What is a Hindenburg Omen? Why does Ed Dowd think that a deflationary event has already begun…one which will shake the world? Tune in to find out… In this podcast, I sit down with Ed Dowd, the former BlackRock portfolio manager, to discuss the AI bubble and how the stock market is entirely being propped up by just 7 companies, most of whom are engaged in what is being termed “circular financing.” That practice hearkens back to the dot.com bubble when companies engaged in what was termed ‘vendor financing.’ In other words, you pay your customers to buy your products. In this era, ‘circular financing’ is vastly more complicated in is workings, but the essence is exactly the same when the maneuvers are boiled away. Ed explained that the math just isn’t mathing. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, needs something like $900 billion of annual subscription revenue at 25% margins just for a 10% ROI. Nope, not going to happen. And certainly not before their first waves of chips wear out and have to be replaced at enormous cost. So, what happens when this bubble bursts? Ed believes that a serious market crash is in the cards. Of course, this means stocks will drop in price, but the main action is going to be in the credit markets. Treasuries will continue to advance in price (fall in yield), making them an attractive option to ride out the storm, while other forms of lesser credit will implode, as is already happening across the subprime lender space (TriColor, PrimaLend, First Brands). When will this happen? According to Ed, it already is. He tracks the Free Cash Flows (FCF) as the more important arbiter of company health and by that metric, all of the Big 7 companies are experiencing declining FCF, while Oracle’s debt is getting more and more expensive to insure against a default. And, oh by the way, stocks are at historically expensive levels, a condition that has historically resulted in very poor returns over the following years: Ed’s view is Deflation first (in housing & credit destruction), which will force the Fed back to QE again, leading to a second inflation wave (energy + money printing). At the same time, Ed views Trump and Bessent’s messaging on the economy as tone-deaf (“Greatest economy ever!”) while the real economy implodes. Ed thinks that a “Hoover scenario” is highly probable, where Trump is remembered for overseeing one of the greatest economic collapses in US history. Given all this, what should a prudent investor do? Tune in to hear Ed’s outlooks… For those who now realize that having a risk-managed approach is more important than ever, please do yourself a favor and schedule a free, no-obligation meeting with Paul Kiker’s team at Kiker Wealth Management to go over your portfolio and strategy.

Title: BlackRock Registers New Staked Ether Trust ETF In Delaware, Eyes SEC Approval

BlackRock is seeking to go beyond simple Ether (ETH) exposure and participate in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake consensus system. This comes after a recent Delaware filing revealed the $13 trillion asset management giant’s intent to enter the yield-bearing Ethereum market. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, registered a new Delaware statutory trust, the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, on Nov. 19, as noted by Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Delaware registrations are procedural first steps that have typically preceded formal exchange-traded fund applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933. The next step will involve filing a registration statement with the SEC, which can be an S-1 or another form, depending on the structure of the Ether ETF, to put the product on track for regulatory approval. If approved, the proposed staking fund would complement BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which has attracted nearly $11.5 billion in assets under management since going live on Wall Street in July 2024. In July this year, BlackRock filed a rules-change request to add staking functionality to ETHA, a move that would allow the fund to earn rewards by validating transactions on the Ethereum network. The registration comes as Ethereum staking ETFs have begun trading in the U.S. In October, Grayscale secured the greenlight to enable native staking for its U.S. Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH) products, becoming the first spot-market funds registered under the Securities Act of 1933 to unlock staking rewards for holders. More recently, REX-Osprey unveiled an ETH staking fund under the less common Investment Company Act of 1940. The SEC under the Trump administration has been more open to new crypto exchange-traded products, and recently approved new generic listing standards facilitating quicker approvals, as each application no longer needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. BlackRock’s proposed staking-enabled Ethereum ETF could increase its appeal to yield-focused institutional investors who may have avoided ETH investment vehicles due to their lack of income.

Title: JPMorgan’s ‘Everything Rally’ Ignites After Nvidia’s Q3 Blowout | US Crypto News

Written & Edited byLockridge Okoth Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee and settle in because markets are moving, and not in small ways. What started as another busy week of earnings and economic data has quickly changed into something more significant. Somewhere between Nvidia’s eye-popping numbers and JPMorgan’s latest call, traders are suddenly talking about an “everything rally,” and even Bitcoin miners are waking up to the buzz. JPMorgan’s trading desk forecasts an “everything rally” after Nvidia exceeded expectations with $57 billion in quarterly revenue and a $65 billion guidance, triggering a 5% after-hours surge and adding over $200 billion to the chipmaker’s market value. Nvidia’s impressive earnings report bolstered belief in the AI investment cycle. Gains spread across chipmakers, and Bitcoin rose above $91,000, with risk appetite returning to markets after a multi-day slide. Nvidia projected an even stronger fourth quarter, guiding revenue to $65 billion versus the $62 billion anticipated by analysts. Nvidia’s upbeat report sparked gains in other chipmakers. AMD, Micron, Broadcom, and Intel all climbed in after-hours trading, reflecting optimism for the semiconductor sector. The results reinforced investor confidence that AI infrastructure spending remains on track despite recent volatility. After the S&P 500 Index fell 3.4% over four days, JPMorgan’s trading desk issued a bullish note. Andrew Tyler reiterated a dip-buying stance, emphasizing stable fundamentals and stating the investment thesis is not reliant on Federal Reserve policy shifts. The bank highlighted Nvidia earnings and the September nonfarm payrolls report as major catalysts for potential new market highs. SETUP POISED FOR AN "EVERYTHING RALLY"JPMORGAN TRADING DESK:"Given that there have not been any changes to the fundamental story, nor does our investment hypothesis rely on the Fed easing, we are dip-buyers. As we look at the two key events this week, (i) Sept's NFP and (ii)… Goldman Sachs mirrored JPMorgan’s optimism. Partner John Flood described the recent market drop as a “real buying opportunity” ahead of Nvidia’s earnings, anticipating a year-end rally. The investment bank stated that hedge funds have de-risked, while discretionary investors remain underweight and are poised to deploy capital. November has been the S&P 500’s weakest month since 2008, with a 3% decline month-to-date. Bitcoin mining stocks like Cipher Mining, IREN, and Hut 8 leapt in pre-market trading after Nvidia’s strong guidance. The surge reflected growing acknowledgment of miners’ expanding role in AI infrastructure and high-performance computing. Nonetheless, institutional investors, including Peter Thiel and SoftBank, have recently trimmed their holdings in Nvidia and major AI companies, signaling wariness over high valuations. Peter Thiel reportedly sold his entire position of 537,742 shares in Nivdia.Why? It’s a bubble, they all know it & are cashing out. – Nvidia ALONE = 15% of US GDP.-OpenAi wants a govt bailout. – US Growth is .01% when you remove AI sector. pic.twitter.com/mk3Nc6yBpk A Bank of America survey revealed that 45% of fund managers see an AI bubble as the primary threat to markets. Global regulators, including the Bank of England and the IMF, warn of risks from potential AI and crypto bubbles. Amidst strong market enthusiasm, investor Michael Burry raised concerns regarding Nvidia’s stock-based compensation. Burry examined financial data since 2018, highlighting a gap between reported earnings and true value creation for shareholders. Since the beginning of 2018, NVDA earned about $205B net income and $188B free cash flow, assuming all cap ex was growth cap ex.SBC amounted to $20.5B.But it bought back $112.5B worth of stock and there are 47 million MORE shares outstanding.The true cost of that SBC dilution… pic.twitter.com/u8VhZyokrB Burry’s analysis suggests stock-based compensation has masked Nvidia’s real earnings strength. The company posted $205 billion in net income and $188 billion in free cash flow since 2018. Despite this, its share count rose by 47 million, even after $112.5 billion in repurchases. The dynamic raises questions about whether headline numbers fully reflect value for shareholders. This debate captures ongoing tensions in market sentiment. While JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs highlight strong fundamentals and structural AI demand, skeptics point to valuation risks and possible headwinds. As investors digest Nvidia’s results and changing economic data, the coming weeks will reveal whether the “everything rally” expectation comes true or volatility persists.

Title: BitMine sits on $3.7B loss as DAT ‘Hotel California’ meets BlackRock’s staked ETH ETF

BitMine’s $3.7 billion paper loss and the falling mNAV valuations are threatening the business model of DATs, according to 10x Research. Concerns are mounting over the sustainability of corporate crypto-treasury firms as BlackRock moves forward with a staked Ether fund that analysts say could compete directly with existing digital-asset treasuries. BitMine Immersion Technologies, the world’s largest corporate Ether (ETH) holder, is currently down $1,000 per purchased ETH, implying a cumulative unrealized loss of $3.7 billion on its total holdings, according to a Thursday research report from crypto insights company 10x Research. The decline in net asset value (NAV) across these firms is making it difficult to attract new retail investors while leaving many existing shareholders effectively “trapped” unless they sell at a steep loss, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen wrote in a LinkedIn post. “When the premium inevitably shrinks to zero, as it is doing now, investors find themselves trapped in the structure, unable to get out without significant damage, a true Hotel California scenario,” he said. He added that, unlike exchange-traded funds (ETFs), digital-asset treasury companies, or DATs, “layer on complex, opaque, and often hedge-fund-like fee structures that can quietly erode returns.” Related: BlackRock leads near $3B Bitcoin November ETF exodus with record $523M outflows The mNAV ratio compares a company’s enterprise value to the value of its crypto holdings. An mNAV above 1 allows a company to raise funds by issuing new shares to accumulate digital assets. Values below 1 make it much harder to expand capital and holdings. BitMine’s basic mNAV stood at 0.77 while its diluted mNAV stood at 0.92, according to data from Bitminetracker. BitMine holds about 3.56 million ETH valued at roughly $10.7 billion, representing 2.94% of the total Ether supply. The firm’s average cost basis is $4,051 per ETH. Other DATs also suffered a sharp decrease in their mNAVs, including Strategy, Bitmine, Metaplanet, Sharplink Gaming, Upexi and DeFi Development Corp. Related: Strategy rides out Bitcoin crash, still on track for S&P 500 spot: Matrixport BlackRock has registered a new staked Ether ETF offering in Delaware, marking the first step for the $13.5 trillion asset management giant’s diversification into Ethereum-based products, Cointelegraph reported earlier on Thursday. BlackRock’s proposed Ether staking ETF could offer another low-cost, yield-generating fund, without the hidden costs associated with traditional treasury firms. This development may threaten the economics of DATs, according to 10x Research. “With BlackRock now seeking approval to stake ETH in its ETF, offering a low-cost source of yield, the economics of DATs are likely to face increasing scrutiny,” the research report states. More investors may start reallocating toward a potential staked Ether fund from BlackRock when they realize that the 0.25% management fee is far smaller compared to the embedded costs of DATs, according to 10X. Asset managers REX-Osprey and Grayscale have already launched staked ETH ETF products in September and October.

Title: The Dam United - Netherland's powerhouse seek history

RTÉ Sport journalist Ice baths have become common place in the routine of a GAA player before and after a big match, but 30-odd Amsterdam hurlers might be taking it to the extreme as they get set to leap into the Herengracht Canal ahead of the biggest ever game for the club – a Leinster Special Club Junior final against Longford Slashers on Saturday. On 17 March, 2003, as Gary Hanniffy was lifting the Tommy Moore Cup as Birr defeated Dunloy in the All-Ireland final, seeds were being sown 750km east as the Amsterdam GAA club was formed on a chilly St Patrick's Day in the Netherlands. History was made at Croke Park that day as Birr became the first four-time All-Ireland winners, moving clear of Cork’s Blackrock and Galway’s Athenry, and 22 years later it’s Amsterdam who have made a bit of history by becoming the first mainland European team to reach a Leinster final. The special club tournament – essentially a Junior B grade – was first run in 2007 and won by Offaly’s Kullrin, before their amalgamation with Killeigh to form Clodiagh Gaels, and the prize on offer, by coincidence, was a trip to the Netherlands with a match scheduled against a European selection in the Hague. It ran until 2015 before being placed on hiatus until its return this year - and this weekend, a crowd of club members will gather in Mulligan’s Irish Bar in the Dutch city to watch the final while for the second time in a number of weeks, the panel will make the trip to Ireland. Earlier this month, the side travelled to Ashbourne and faced Meath IHC finalists Rathmolyon. Five points down at the break, and four behind with just 10 minutes left, the four-in-a-row European champions fought back down the stretch and fittingly it was Galway’s Grahame McDermott who moved them ahead for only the second time in the contest with a penalty in the 63rd minute with their player-manager, Limerick’s Dara O’Farrell, putting the seal on a famous 1-13 to 1-11 win. They’re off to Glennon Brothers Pearse Park for the final against Robbie Stakelum’s Slashers, who won their county’s senior title this year with a win over Wolfe Tone's and defeated Wicklow’s Aughrim in the other Leinster semi-final. With history already made, the hope is they can add some more, but whatever the outcome, it’s going to be a day to remember for club chairperson Eimear Lafferty. A member of the famed Gormley clan in Tyrone – her aunt Eilish is one of the best ladies players in Ulster history - Lafferty was always likely to find her way to the GAA club when landing in 'Mokum’ four years ago. It only took hours in the end, the player heading to training on the very same evening she arrived. She still plays with them, helps with the management too and, of course, chairs a committee that is completely player-led. "We’re a long-established club, but we seem to be growing year-on-year," said Lafferty. "For a number of years, the ladies' team was an amalgamation of teams from the Benelux region (the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg) but we’re lucky enough now to have the numbers for our own team. "We’re quite lucky with our facilities, it’s outside the city but with the bike culture, we can all cycle there – it's about a 45-minute cycle each way for me. "The biggest challenge for us is that we are an entirely player-run club. A lot of the European clubs don’t have that older generation to turn to who did a lot of that managing in terms of the logistics of the club. "It is difficult to separate those roles when you’re still a player, but we’ve worked really hard on it. "In the last couple of years we have established a camogie team and they won their first tournament this year, we’re building our youth team – we hosted Cúl Camps last year and the European Féile this year – and we’ve also set up a handball team this year; I suppose you could call us a fully-fledged GAA club for the first time. "It’s certainly given myself and the committee members a deeper appreciation of all the work our Irish clubs carry out to keep us playing and invested in the sport we grew up with - particularly my home club, Aodh Ruadh, now Thomas Clarke’s, which was founded by inspirational and dedicated women of the GAA that had to push and campaign to have their voices heard, and to become a successful club." Two trips to Ireland in a fortnight is what the club wanted, but it brings with it a serious financial burden. That’s where the dip in the canal comes in with a Go Fund Me campaign promising a series of forfeits for each milestone met, with players set to shave heads, perform a song in the middle of Dam Square and – for a target long since reached – jump as a group into water in their full club kit. The city is set for a temperature high of 6 degrees this week, according to forecasts, so it’s cash well earned. "It’ll cost about €500, €600 to send each player over to Ireland and we have a panel of 30," Lafferty continued. "We’re lucky the lads are happy to do all these challenges. There’s maybe a few girlfriends unhappy with all these shaved heads and shaved moustaches, but we’re very good at pulling together as a club. "You can take being player-run as a negative as there is that extra pressure, but it does mean that everyone who is involved is really dedicated and wants to see the club flourish and thrive." It's an all-Irish squad travelling to Longford, although the club has - and continues to - attract players from both the Netherlands and a number of nations. 'Big' Thom Verweijen has played a key role in midfield at times for the hurler while the club's female teams in particular attract players from various nations. It adds another layer of pride for all involved with the club. That pride will be on display at Pearse Park. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Can We Blame Private Equity for Everything?

The Blackstone Group offices in New York, 2013. The 2010s were, among other things, the decade of private equity. A segment of the finance sector long shrouded in myth and controversy, private equity is at its core a straightforward business: A firm raises money from clients (such as pension funds) and uses it to buy businesses and other assets (such as real estate), usually adding a large chunk of borrowed money to the mix. The PE firm aims to increase the value of the acquired assets and then sell them at a profit. Clients receive whatever is left of any gains after the deduction of fees, which include a share of those gains. The “equity” in private equity refers to the ownership stakes the PE firm takes, while the “private” means these investments are held outside of public stock markets. Though private equity has been around since the 1970s, its growth went into overdrive after the global financial crisis of 2007–09. Until that point, banks—especially investment banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan—had been the most powerful players in the world of global finance. Yet banks were widely held responsible for the crisis, leading regulators in the United States and a host of other countries to clip their wings. As big banks became “more heavily regulated and scrutinized,” Bloomberg Businessweek reported in 2019, private-equity firms like Apollo, Blackstone, and KKR moved decisively out of their shadow. “Almost everything that’s happened since 2008 has tilted in [private equity’s] favor. Low interest rates to finance deals? Check. A friendly political climate? Check. A long line of clients? Check…. Private equity managers,” the Bloomberg Businessweek report concluded, “won the financial crisis.” By 2021, the average Blackstone employee was earning more than $2 million per annum, and the firm’s CEO, Stephen Schwarzman, had a net worth of nearly $40 billion. It is thus little wonder that recent years have seen a slew of books aimed at coming to grips with the PE phenomenon, with more in the works. The latest addition to the crop is Bad Company: Private Equity and the Death of the American Dream, by the journalist Megan Greenwell. Although there have been notable exceptions—including two memoirs about working in private equity, from very different perspectives—most of the recent books, as Greenwell points out, have been attempts to understand and evaluate PE in broad terms as an economic and social phenomenon: what it is, how it operates, its size and structure, and so forth. Such books focus, Greenwell observes, “on the macro level: the number of companies that shutter, the number of jobs that disappear, the number of dollars that are won and lost.” In Bad Company, Greenwell takes a different tack, shifting the lens from the macro to the micro level. “When we talk about how private equity affects communities,” she writes, “we’re really talking about how it affects people, the individuals who have no choice but to rely on firms for their jobs, their homes, their essential services.” And so she presents us with the stories of four individuals whose lives have been impacted by the PE takeover of, respectively, a retail chain, a small-town hospital, a newspaper company, and an apartment complex. Through these profiles, Greenwell paints a picture of a decidedly unedifying phenomenon: of PE firms swooping into local communities, buying local assets, and radically degrading the conditions of people’s lives. But does this analytical shift from the macro to the micro scale ultimately pay dividends for our understanding of the nature and effects of the PE business? There are, of course, always different ways to tell a story, and the story of private equity is no different in this respect. However, when the mode of analysis is the exploration of individual lives, as it is in Bad Company, it’s important to think closely about what those lives can and cannot meaningfully tell us about the wider phenomenon under consideration. When books that explore broad social phenomena through individuals’ life stories work particularly well, there is usually an intimate and necessary connection between the lives in question and the phenomenon to which the author is relating them. The sociologist Matthew Desmond’s 2016 book Evicted is a good example. In it, Desmond follows eight individuals in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as they and their households go through the process of eviction at the hands of their landlords. Focused on these individual lives, Evicted also manages to serve as an exemplary study of the wider phenomenon of eviction because of two key characteristics of the latter. The first is that eviction is precisely something that happens to individuals. The second is that, for tenants, involuntary eviction is a unique hardship: While housing insecurity can take many forms and can be suffered in all sorts of ways, nothing else matches the experience of being evicted from one’s home against one’s wishes. Then what about working for a company or living in an apartment that is taken over by a PE firm? Is that, too, a unique type of experience? Consider Greenwell’s four profiles: Liz is laid off without severance from Toys “R” Us when its PE owners close its last 200 stores; Roger, a doctor, sees his beloved hospital in rural Wyoming stripped of resources and crucial services after a PE takeover; Natalia is a reporter at a local newspaper whose staff is slashed after PE ownership takes hold, diminishing the paper’s capacity to report and hence the community’s access to local news; and Loren moves from public rental housing into a PE-owned apartment complex where mold and infestations of mice and roaches are not allowed to stand in the way of rent hikes. Is there a necessary and intimate connection between these types of personal experience and the phenomenon of private equity, one that makes them “PE experiences” per se? Greenwell maintains that there is indeed such a necessary and intimate connection. For her, the experience of working at a PE-owned business or living in PE-owned housing is special inasmuch as the PE ownership and operation of such assets is itself special. As she sees it, it all comes down to profitability—that is, what ostensibly connects the individuals whose lives Greenwell chronicles, thus making theirs a shared experience as opposed to four unrelated ordeals, is their subjection to a distinctive profit calculus. But is that calculus unique to PE? Early in Bad Company, Greenwell cites the American economist Milton Friedman and his influential 1970 essay about the role of the corporation in American capitalism. “The social responsibility of business,” Friedman famously insisted, “is to increase its profits.” And that, he added, is its sole responsibility. Friedman’s injunction has been endlessly debated in the decades since. For Greenwell, its particular relevance is that private equity, and only private equity, has, in her view, followed the Friedmanite philosophy to the letter. Friedman, she says, “set the stage for the rise of private equity.” To explain how PE differs from other forms of owning and operating assets like businesses and real estate, Greenwell offers the following take: “The definition of success is loftier in the private equity world: not just making profits, but maximizing them.” “Merely making a profit was no longer enough,” she writes, for instance, of what changed when Apollo Global Management took over LifePoint Health and its chain of rural hospitals across the US, including Roger’s hospital in Wyoming. “Now the goal,” à la Friedman, “was to maximize shareholder value.” In positing this Manichaean distinction between “normal” capitalist businesses that “just make” profits and PE firms that seek to “maximize” them, Greenwell establishes a pro forma narrative of what happens when private equity comes to town: “When the only worth of a local grocery store, a newspaper, or a hospital is the short-term profits it can generate, the company becomes little more than a mine awaiting extraction.” Which, crucially, is not what that company had previously been: “Businesses that were once pillars of a society founder and crumble,” Greenwell writes. By this way of thinking, other capitalist businesses, unlike PE firms, do take seriously “responsibilities” other than profit-making. Far be it from me to downplay private equity’s profiteering, but this argument clearly rests on a questionable supposition: Is it genuinely credible to cast non-PE firms as less obsessed with profit? Try telling BlackRock, State Street, or the other major shareholders in America’s 4,000-odd public companies that the goal of those companies is something besides maximizing shareholder value. Greenwell’s own reporting demonstrably belies the distinction her book posits. Take Gannett, the media group that owned the local newspaper employing Natalia when it was acquired by Fortress Investment Group in 2019. Was Gannett formerly a pillar of local society, whose modus operandi was rudely upended by the PE barbarians? Hardly. “Well before private equity was in the local media game,” Greenwell informs us, “Gannett was creating [PE] firms’ playbooks for them: ruthlessly consolidate, centralize as much as possible, boost shareholder value at all costs—even when the cost was the journalism, the company’s ostensible raison d’être.” Gannett, it turns out, was already an archetype of Friedmanite capitalism, red in tooth and claw. The same kind of contradiction befalls the other case studies here. The more Greenwell tells us about the businesses that private equity came in and subsumed, the less like pillars of society and paragons of business ethics they appear to be. Rather than substantiating her thesis of a sui generis role for private equity in destroying civil society and the American dream, what Greenwell actually reaffirms is a kind of bog-standard point about how business is done in America. Because, of course, it wasn’t just private equity that took Friedman’s gospel to heart. Capital at large did. None of this is to say that there aren’t important differences between PE firms and other owners and managers of businesses and real estate—that things do not change when PE comes to town. Very often they do. Nor is it to say that the individual stories that Greenwell spotlights in Bad Company have nothing to tell us about the corrosive effects of a corporate and financial world single-mindedly beholden to maximizing shareholder value. But as insights, in and of themselves, into the nature of the PE phenomenon? Not so much. In reality, much the same book, containing much the same litany of woes, could be written about the effects on individuals and communities of adventures in the capitalist profit imperative that have nothing to do with private equity whatsoever. Indeed, over the years, many such books already have been written, from Michael Harrington’s The Other America to Barbara Ehrenreich’s Nickel and Dimed and Jefferson Cowie’s Stayin’ Alive. Does a private-equity takeover often result in dire outcomes for workers and tenants? To be sure. But it is far from being unique in that. It’s for good reason that the other recent books seeking to comprehend and appraise the PE phenomenon are primarily pitched at the macro level. Private equity is a quintessentially macro-scale enterprise; instructive analysis of it cannot eschew that analytical scale. Boiled down to its essence, private equity is an investment phenomenon. Yet if investment is the term we use to refer to the myriad ways in which actors holding surplus capital are connected to the actors who put that capital to work, then private equity represents above all a distinctive way of configuring that connectivity. Arguably, its cardinal characteristic—evident to all institutional stakeholders—is that the investment explicitly does not have an open time horizon. Allocating client capital via funds with fixed lifespans, and returning the capital (ideally with a profit) to clients upon the funds’ termination, PE managers buy assets—and this cannot be emphasized enough—in order to later sell them. Whether the acquired businesses or rental homes or whatever else it may be are held for one year, three, or five, everything that the PE manager does with those assets while they are under its control is done with a view specifically to maximize the price at exit. If there is a single thing that one must grasp in order to understand private equity, this is it. Alma Avalle Jeet Heer Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers Books & the Arts / David A. Bell Bad Company, to be clear, does not eschew macro-scale analysis altogether. Greenwell has plenty to say about the role of debt financing in PE buyouts; the relationship of PE firms to their clients in the institutional-investor community; the significance of PE tax breaks, which generations of policymakers have refused to abolish; and much else besides. Ultimately, it’s a question of balance. The examination of how a handful of individuals experience life at the sharp end of private equity’s pillaging can, without doubt, add texture and color to our understanding, helping to humanize the impacts of an industry often discussed in dry financial terms. But it’s questionable whether it can do more than that, not least because those experiences are not categorically different from the experiences of individuals ensnared by capitalist ravages more generally. Private equity, to my mind at least, has always internalized a fundamental tension concerning its ability to exit its investments, which is typically achieved either through a sale to another private buyer (whether a strategic trade buyer or another financial investor) or through an IPO on the stock market. Why, one wonders, are other investors willing to pay the top-dollar exit price that private equity, by its very nature, demands? If—as is generally assumed to be the case—the PE firm has itself exhausted all the obvious opportunities for value enhancement and extraction during its period of ownership, why buy what’s left? If all the fruit has been plucked and the PE firm has achieved its signature goal of exiting at maximum value, is not the only way for the subsequent value of those assets, in fact, down? Over the past couple of years, it seems that the penny may have finally dropped. PE firms are widely struggling to exit their investments profitably and return cash to their clients. In mounting desperation, they have turned to launching so-called “continuation vehicles”—essentially, mechanisms for extending fund life and protecting the book value of marginal assets—but clients, smelling a rat, have been reluctant to back them. A vicious circle seems to be setting in: Required to hold on to assets for longer and longer periods, private equity is, as the financial journalist Katie Martin observes, “squeezing more of the juice out of them, and leaving little for public market investors,” thereby making it even harder still to achieve an exit. The upshot is that the PE sector is now sitting on some $3 trillion worth of unsellable assets. And as clients have become increasingly frustrated with the difficulties of achieving and realizing gains from PE investments, they have responded by beginning to allocate less capital to the sector. Private-equity fundraising slid to a seven-year low in the last year, and with a record number of firms chasing this dwindling pot of capital, many have resorted to “unprecedented enticements to attract new investor cash,” not least markedly lower fees. No wonder that PE firms have meanwhile been lobbying furiously for access to new sources of capital, with America’s individual retirement savings—hitherto off-limits for PE managers—considered the holy grail, and President Trump seemingly willing to oblige. In short, the PE sector, and its profitability prospects, are under pressure as perhaps never before, making it possible to ask a question that until recently would have been deemed outlandish: Has private equity had its moment in the sun? If so, and for reasons that Bad Company and all the other recent PE books make abundantly clear, few will feel any sympathy.

Title: Bitcoin just hit a critical point: analysts split between $85K crash and $250K surge

While Bitcoin price has recovered from the low of $88,540 hit on November 19, the question is whether it will hit a higher high than the $93,403 registered on November 18. Some analysts believe BTC is preparing for a deeper slide, while others insist a powerful rebound is already forming beneath the surface. At press time, BTC price was around $92,237 and already showing signs of exhaustion, which would spell doom since it formed a lower low on November 19, which is a bearish sign. At $92,237, Bitcoin (BTC) is reeling from a bruising stretch that has erased more than $33,000 from its value in under two months. Notably, today’s uptick follows a pause in ETF outflows and a rebound in tech stocks, driven by Nvidia’s stronger-than-expected earnings. While the market remains on edge as macro uncertainty and shifting liquidity conditions continue to pressure risk assets, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson remains one of the strongest voices calling for a major rebound. During CNBC’s Squawk Box show on Tuesday, Hoskinson argued that Bitcoin’s recent losses reflect broader macro distortions, including tariff tensions, recession risks, and uneven regulatory signals. Hoskinson believes these forces will ease in the coming months. He expects BTC to recover sharply and potentially hit $250,000 within the next year, projecting that institutional adoption and large-scale tokenisation will redefine market cycles. Michael Saylor shares a similar level of confidence, viewing the current downturn as typical of Bitcoin’s long-term behaviour. The MicroStrategy executive says the company is built to withstand extreme drawdowns, calling his position “indestructible” in a recent interview with Fox Business. ₿etter than Ever. Today I was the warm-up act for @natbrunell as we both talked Bitcoin with @cvpayne. You’ll want to hear what she had to say. pic.twitter.com/vDaFceyeza — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 18, 2025 Notably, Saylor has continued to buy BTC even as volatility increases, reinforcing his view that deep corrections are part of the broader path toward higher valuations. ETF activity has also become a pivotal factor. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF posted a record $523 million daily loss on November 18 following a streak of outflows across the spot Bitcoin ETF landscape. The Bitcoin ETFs outflow seems to have stabilised, with IBIT seeing $60M worth of inflows on November 19. Analysts warn that sustained inflows will be essential if Bitcoin hopes to avoid a retest of this week’s lows. Not all signals point upward. Some traders see a real chance BTC could break below key support levels near $90,000. If the market fails to hold this support, prediction platforms indicate rising expectations of a drop toward $87,000. ETF outflows totalling more than $3 billion this month highlight lingering caution, and many retail participants remain hesitant after weeks of drawdowns. Macro conditions remain complicated. Expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts have faded, while recession concerns are resurfacing due to weak jobs data and ongoing trade friction. These pressures have limited upside momentum even as Nvidia’s tech rally briefly boosted risk appetite. Despite the uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to trade like a high-beta asset tied closely to broader market sentiment, and the next few days may determine whether buyers regain control or whether sellers will test new lows.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Bleeds Over $500 Million In Its Biggest One-Day Outflow

Nearly two years after the inception of the Bitcoin ETF sector in the United States, these funds are currently grappling with significant challenges, exacerbated by mounting concerns regarding a potential bear market in the coming months. This turmoil is exemplified by the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which experienced its largest single-day withdrawal since launch, further contributing to the decline in Bitcoin’s price. The recent outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF highlight the severity of the current selloff within the Bitcoin market, which has experienced a substantial correction below the crucial $100,000 mark following a record high reached in October. This downturn emphasizes the widespread pullback affecting various risk assets, while gold has notably remained resilient. Some analysts suggest that these developments indicate a trend of investors shifting their exposure from Bitcoin to gold. “The crypto market entered a hangover in August,” said Thomas Perfumo, Global Economist at Kraken, in a recent interview with Reuters, noting that much of the earlier demand for Bitcoin had been fueled by borrowed funds. He added, “Momentum seemingly peaked during the summer. But the truth is this hangover trend started months ago.” Analysts have also pointed to profit-taking behaviors among long-term holders and increasing caution among Bitcoin ETF funds and digital asset treasury (DAT) firms, which had previously ramped up their acquisitions throughout the year. Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, stated that Bitcoin treasury companies had collectively purchased nearly $50 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past year. Recently, however, many of these firms have begun trading at a discount to their net asset value, which could dampen market expectations for new Bitcoin purchases in the near term. This shift occurs amid rising concerns among heavyweight investors regarding inflated valuations across various asset classes. José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, noted that “an ongoing lack of speculative spirits is weighing on Bitcoin.” Despite managing over $73 billion in assets, IBIT has seen a decline of 19% in the current quarter. Data from SoSoValue indicates that spot Bitcoin ETF funds collectively have recorded $2.59 billion in outflows this month alone. Leading the pack is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which has experienced $1.78 billion in outflows in November alone. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) ranks second, with nearly $540 million in outflows. The turbulence isn’t limited to Bitcoin; the Ethereum exchange-traded fund sector also faced outflows, totaling approximately $74.2 million yesterday, with BlackRock selling off $165.1 million. On a more positive note, Solana spot ETFs reported net inflows of $30.09 million on Tuesday, primarily driven by Bitwise’s BSOL. This marks a major streak of 15 consecutive days of inflows for Solana.

Title: BlackRock expands Ethereum staking plans with new Delaware trust

Time Published: 2025-11-20T07:55:09Z

BlackRock has taken another step toward a staking-focused Ethereum ETF by setting up a new statutory trust in Delaware, signalling fresh movement in the fast-growing market for yield-generating crypto products. The trust, called the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, was officially formed on Nov. 19, according to state records. While the filing does not include product documents, it adds to a broader industry shift toward staking features within regulated ETFs. The move positions BlackRock to explore yield-bearing structures as competitors such as Grayscale, Fidelity, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and REX-Osprey advance their own staking plans across major digital asset funds. The new trust was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which requires full disclosures before any product reaches investors. This registration serves as a preliminary step rather than a full submission to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. To move forward, BlackRock would still need to file a Form S-1, but the firm has not provided a timeline. Delaware continues to be a popular state for early-stage ETF setup because of its regulatory structure, and BlackRock has often used the same route when preparing digital asset products. The trust now sits alongside ETHA, the firm’s spot Ethereum ETF that launched in July 2024. ETHA has attracted more than $13 billion in inflows and currently does not stake its holdings. Nasdaq filed a Form 19b-4 in July 2025 to allow ETHA to stake ETH with approved validators. If approved, that update would introduce staking rewards while also requiring detailed disclosures about custody arrangements, slashing risks, validator selection, and the handling of locked ETH. Staking rewards on Ethereum generally range between 3% and 5% each year, and issuers must explain how they will track, calculate, and distribute those rewards. BlackRock’s move comes as the broader ETF market accelerates toward staking-enabled products. Grayscale received approval in October 2025 to introduce staking within ETHE and its Mini Trust ETF, making them the first Ethereum funds under the 1933 Act permitted to earn staking rewards. Other issuers, including Fidelity, 21Shares, Franklin Templeton, and REX-Osprey, have also submitted similar filings. REX-Osprey already operates a staked Solana ETF and launched a staked Ethereum version in September. BlackRock’s digital assets head Robert Mitchnick said staking features across ETFs could attract between $10 and $20 billion by mid-2026. Experts now expect the next catalyst to be BlackRock’s potential S-1 submission, which would move the new trust closer to becoming a yield-bearing Ethereum ETF. ETF analysts say expanding staking options could lock a significant amount of ETH within regulated products, influencing liquidity and long-term supply. The combination of new filings, updated fund structures, and rising capital inflows has set up a competitive race among issuers. BlackRock’s new trust adds another step in that process, signalling how institutional demand for Ethereum staking continues to reshape the ETF landscape.

BlackRock has now joined the race to launch a staked ether ETF, registering the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF in Delaware on Nov. 19, according to a state filing highlighted by Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. The registration is only an initial step and not yet a formal application under the Securities Act of 1933, but it signals that the world’s largest asset manager is preparing to seek approval for a yield-bearing ether product. BlackRock's move comes weeks after VanEck registered a similar trust tied to Lido’s staked ETH, positioning issuers for the next phase of competition once regulators give clarity on whether staking can be included in U.S. ETFs. The first wave of spot ETH ETFs launched in 2024 without staking after the SEC told issuers to strip the feature, citing its view that certain staking services could constitute unregistered securities offerings.

Title: 1 in 3 young investors switched advisers over crypto access: Survey

Time Published: 2025-11-20T05:30:20Z
Full Content:
Young and rich investors want wealth advisers to offer crypto, and some have moved their money from those who don’t, according to a survey by Zerohash. Money managers may need to rethink their approach to digital assets, with over a third of young, wealthy investors in a recent US survey indicating they had moved on from advisers who don’t offer crypto exposure. Crypto payments provider Zerohash’s survey of 500 US investors aged 18 to 40, released on Wednesday, found that 35% had moved money away from advisers who didn’t offer access to crypto. Those surveyed had incomes between $100,000 and $1 million, and more than half of those who moved money due to an advisers lack of crypto offerings said they had moved between $250,000 and $1 million. Crypto has only recently enjoyed an ultra-friendly policy environment in the US, and some wealth advisers are still playing catch-up as younger investors are less risk-averse compared to past generations. Zerohash said that over four-fifths of those surveyed said their confidence in crypto was boosted due to its adoption by major finance institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Morgan Stanley. Zerohash found that respondents with incomes of $500,000 and up were “leading the exodus,” with half having moved from advisers over crypto access. The survey also found 84% of all respondents planned to increase their crypto holdings in the next year, with nearly half saying they would “increase their allocations significantly.” Zerohash said the findings show that crypto “has become essential to modern portfolio strategy” and many wealthy investors “are not waiting for their private wealth managers to catch up.” “Advisers who adapt early can strengthen client loyalty and capture new growth, while those who delay risk falling behind,” they said. Related: US government reopening may unleash crypto ETF floodgates: Analyst They added that investors were clear with their expectations and wanted “insured, compliant crypto access.” Zerohash said based on its survey results, its playbook for advisers to win investors is to offer crypto on “the same dashboard as traditional assets” with insured custody. “Investors expect more than Bitcoin and Ethereum,” it added. “Ninety-two percent say access to a broader range of digital assets is important.” Meanwhile, asset managers have begun offering exchange-traded products with exposure to a wide range of cryptocurrencies, with products tied to altcoins including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE). More novel products have featured staking, which rewards users for locking up tokens to secure a blockchain. Major issuer BlackRock is also seemingly set to offer staking exposure, filing for a staked Ether (ETH) exchange-traded fund in Delaware on Wednesday.

Title: Abu Dhabi Investment Council triples stake in Bitcoin ETF in Q3: Report
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/abu-dhabi-investment-council-bitcoin-etf-holdings-increase-q3
Time Published: 2025-11-20T01:50:12Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF share price is down almost 23% since the end of the third quarter. The Abu Dhabi Investment Council nearly tripled its exposure to Bitcoin during the third quarter through BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin fund, according to a recent report. Several market participants saw it as a signal that institutional interest in crypto is still gaining momentum in the United Arab Emirates. ADIC, an investment arm of Mubala Investment Company, told Bloomberg on Wednesday it sees Bitcoin (BTC) as the digital equivalent of gold. ADIC’s IBIT increase came during a volatile period for Bitcoin. The quarter ended just days before BTC surged to an all-time high of $125,100 on Oct. 5, before dropping back below $90,000 on Wednesday. Bloomberg reported that ADIC increased its IBIT holdings from 2.4 million shares at the start of Q3 to almost 8 million by Sept. 30, valuing the position at around $520 million. IBIT closed the quarter at $65 per share and rose to $71 on Oct. 6, the day after Bitcoin hit its all-time high. However, Bitcoin’s recent plunge below $100,000 has also dragged IBIT lower. The ETF closed Wednesday at $50.71, down around 23% since the end of the third quarter. Despite the Bitcoin price decline, the ADIC stock increase was widely read as a sign of broader institutional adoption. Crypto investment platform M2 treasury manager, Zayed Aleem, said in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that it is “fantastic to see such institutional conviction and another strong signal that the UAE is securing its place as a global hub for digital assets.” Echoing a similar sentiment, crypto commentator MartyParty said that “the position reflects a strategic bet on BTC’s role as a store of value.” The news comes just one day after IBIT experienced its most significant daily outflows since its January 2024 launch, totaling $523.2 million, according to Farside, amid Bitcoin briefly falling to $88,000. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $92,089, according to CoinMarketCap. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on Wednesday that the IBIT ETF was having an “ugly stretch.” Related: Crypto exchange Kraken submits confidential US IPO filing “Although YTD flows are still at an astronomical +$25b (6th overall). All told $3.3b in total outflows past month from BTC ETFs, which is 3.5% of AUM,” Balchunas said. Since the IBIT launched in January 2024, it has posted around $63.12 million in net inflows, according to Farside. Analysts are divided on where Bitcoin will go for the remainder of the year. Bitcoin analyst VICTOR recently said that the current drawdown is “the close your eyes and bid type of range.” Magazine: Ethereum’s Fusaka fork explained for dummies: What the hell is PeerDAS?

Delaware Division of Corporations records show that the trust was formed on November 19. The listing does not include product documentation, but the public entity record can be viewed directly through the state’s search portal. Forming a Delaware statutory trust is a common early step for ETF issuers, particularly for commodity and crypto products. The next stage typically involves filing a registration statement with the SEC, which can be an S-1 or another form depending on the fund structure. The preparatory move, however, does not indicate that a filing is imminent. Decrypt has reached out to BlackRock and its registered agent for further information. The registration comes as Ethereum staking ETFs have begun trading in the U.S., including the REX Osprey ETH + Staking ETF, which launched the first combined spot and staking-enabled Ethereum ETF in late September. Grayscale, meanwhile, became the first U.S. issuer to add staking to an exchange-listed Ethereum product in October, following the SEC’s approval of generic crypto ETP listing standards, which enabled the firm to incorporate native staking into its Ethereum ETFs. The move gave the market its earliest regulated benchmark for how staking yield could be passed through to shareholders. Still, dedicated staking-focused Ethereum ETFs remain small. The REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF, for example, reported about $2.4 million in assets as of mid-November, with trading activity remaining light since its launch. Earlier in July, BlackRock filed a rules-change request to allow additional staking functionality in its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). New language in the proposed changes stated the trust would “receive all or a portion of the staking rewards” generated by the staking provider, adding that such rewards may be “treated as income to the Trust.” In Ethereum, staking means locking up Ethereum while staked so the network can choose users to validate transactions, in return for earned rewards. It also affects the circulating supply, as staked Ethereum is not freely tradeable until it is withdrawn. Staking remains a point of regulatory caution because it involves active participation in network validation and introduces operational, slashing, and custody risks that differ from simple asset holding. Issuers seeking to stake inside a registered product have had to detail validator selection, liquidity management, custody segregation, and how rewards will be accounted for under securities rules.

Title: BlackRock signals it is working on a new staked Ethereum trust ETF
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/blackrock-registers-trust-staked-eth-etf
Time Published: 2025-11-20T01:05:50Z
Full Content:
BlackRock is now pursuing a new staked Ethereum ETF, offering more lucrative returns, approximately 15 months after launching its flagship ETH fund, ETHA. BlackRock has registered for a new staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund in Delaware, signalling that the $13.5 trillion asset manager is now ready to expand beyond its flagship Ethereum ETF product. A Delaware name registration is one of the first steps that a fund issuer needs to take to file for a new ETF. BlackRock, however, still needs to file other relevant documents to put the proposed product on track for regulatory approval. It would also complement BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which has attracted $13.1 billion worth of inflows since launching in July 2024. BlackRock did not add staking to its spot Ethereum product, stating on its website: However, in July, they proposed a rule change with the SEC to incorporate staking into ETHA, along with other issuers. The US Securities and Exchange Commission under the Trump administration has been more open to new crypto exchange-traded products, and recently introduced a generic listing standard enabling faster approvals, as each application no longer needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that BlackRock’s staked ETH ETF product is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which requires strong transparency and investor protection measures, as well as full disclosure before shares can be publicly sold. There are currently around 70 crypto products awaiting regulatory approval, which were held up by the US government shutdown across October and November. Related: Stablecoins strengthen the dollar and empower the developing world BlackRock’s filing comes as REX-Osprey and Grayscale launched staked ETH ETF products in September and October. Incorporating staking into an Ethereum ETF could enhance returns by adding a steady yield component on top of price exposure, thereby transforming the fund into a total-return product. It could therefore broaden the product’s appeal to yield-focused investors who may have avoided Ethereum ETF products due to their lack of income. The average annual return on ETH staking is approximately 3.95%, according to Blocknative data. While other issuers have filed for a multitude of altcoin-focused ETFs in recent months, BlackRock appears to be abstaining, having only recently filed a Bitcoin Premium Income ETF in September as a sequel to its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. The Bitcoin Premium Income ETF also aims to generate yield by selling covered call options and collecting premiums. Magazine: Ethereum’s Fusaka fork explained for dummies: What the hell is PeerDAS?

Sir, – It is often only in hindsight that we realise how good we had it. Paschal Donohoe was a safe pair of hands in the finance brief, and I predict we will realise that soon. As my late mother would regularly say with a big smile on her face any time he came on TV, “Paschal is just great, isn’t he.” And she was right. He worked harder than any of the rest of us back in our Trinity College Dublin days and he has worked hard since too. Apart from that, he is a good guy. Wishing him continued success. Thank you for your service. – Yours, etc, ANNE MCCORMACK, Rush, Co Dublin. Sir, – I’m surprised that you didn’t publish any more positive letters about Paschal Donohoe (“Resignation of Paschal Donohoe,” Letters, November 19th). Are all your readers supporters of the Opposition and blind to what the rest of Europe and the world value. I think I may be reading the wrong paper. – Yours, etc, OWEN McKEON, Skerries, Co Dublin. Sir, – During the early days of Covid-19, I could not grasp the potential or clandestine medical issues involved, nor could I grasp the medium- to long-term consequences the epidemic might have on human society. I could, however, anticipate that the State’s financial and economic structures and status could well come under severe stress. I was thankful that Paschal Donohoe was our minister for finance. – Yours, etc, MICHAEL GANNON, St Thomas Sq, Kilkenny. Sir, – It can hardly come as a surprise that one of the most senior members of our Government has decided to jump ship (“Donohoe in line for hefty remuneration package at World Bank,” Irish Times, November 18th). The feeling is that many of the doyens now walking the corridors of power are just hanging around until the right job comes along. Self-interest is as good an explanation as any for their long-running failures to address serious social issues. Similarly there can be no surprise that Paschal Donohoe would opt to join an institution such as the World Bank. He will have little difficulty fitting in. The World Bank has been criticised for allowing its policy to be dictated by a select group of multilateral agencies. Indeed, it can be concluded that the bank’s “Harmony and Coherence” policy is little more than a vehicle to allow the most powerful pass off their own self-interest as the common good. Sound familiar? Think of the numerous “plans” to “solve” the housing crisis here. – Yours, etc, JIM O’SULLIVAN, Rathedmond, Co Sligo. Sir, – Paschal Donohoe was a very conservative minister who preserved the status quo for the old monied cabal with a minimal social conscience. His parting legacy will be of a minister for finance who will be remembered for doing nothing for older people, workers, or vulnerable cohorts such as children and the disabled in his final budget, yet who caved into lobbying from the hospitality sector for their commercial demands on the pretext of preserving jobs. Mr Donohoe may have been an effectively prudent fiscal management accountant. This trait will probably suit the World Bank, whose primary objective is to preserve the traditional status quo of the first world nations and ruling established liberal democracies. The former minister was totally risk averse when it came to stimulating creativity, didn’t show an ability to think “outside the box”, and seemed to lack the “vision thing”. He was, therefore, not the statesman needed by us in these unprecedented and challenging times, both nationally and internationally. By all accounts, a very nice man, though. – Yours, etc, STEVE PETHERBRIDGE, Swords, Co Dublin, Sir, – Sincere best wishes to Paschal Donohoe on his move to the World Bank. Hopefully he can help many poor countries escape from debt and develop into fair and successful economies that can trade on an equal footing with the rest of the world. Wishing him every success in this new and demanding role. – Yours, etc, PAUL CONNOLLY, Main St, Cavan. Sir, – Last Friday our national broadcaster RTÉ aired a radio item on its Drivetime show in which the current President’s appearance – her hair and clothes – were parsed and discussed in detail with a guest. I have emailed RTÉ with the following question: in the 14 years of Michael D Higgins’s presidency, did RTÉ ever air a similar news item about his clothes and hair? I’m still waiting for an answer. – Yours, etc, ROSEMARY LAFFERTY, Lucan, Co Dublin. Sir, – The recent correspondence on these pages regarding catering faux pas reminded me of the story told by the late playwright Hugh Leonard. On checking in after midnight to a midlands hotel, he asked: “Any chance of a nightcap?”. The porter replied: “Certainly sir, would you like a drink while you’re waiting?”. – Yours, etc, PETER McCARTHY, Salthill, Galway. Sir, – I admire The Irish Times’s journalistic integrity in reporting exactly what is said, but couldn’t you relax your standards just a little bit to avoid embarrassment to your subjects? I don’t doubt that it’s exactly what she uttered (“Joanne McNally: ‘I was like, I’ll absolutely fly to Ireland and play golf with Bill Murray’,” People, November 19th), but it takes only a minor fib to spare her blushes at being caught out using such a nefarious neologism as the quotative “like”. – Yours, etc, SEAN BOYLE, Warner Rd, London. Sir, – Michael McDowell hits the nail on the head as usual in his column (“Britain’s asylum shake-up creates an Irish problem,” Opinion. November 19th) on the possible fallout for Ireland from proposed changes to asylum procedures and processing in the UK. Speaking from his own experience as minister for justice, he is well aware Ireland has always had to track UK policy given the numbers that travel via (or from) the UK to claim international protection here. Quite apart from a marked increase in numbers claiming asylum in the State since 2022, it is often overlooked that there are in the region of 1,000,000 people illegally in the UK. It is obvious that as the UK cracks down on people living illegally there, Ireland will be an increasingly attractive location for many to claim asylum, especially if people are paid to voluntarily leave if and when their asylum claims fail. A final thought is that the former minister (the only one with a sense of humour I came across in my Civil Service career) is correct when calling out the likely judicial review onslaught if we implement the EU Migration Pact next year. There is next to zero possibility of the 90-day limit for interview and possible appeal to be met, with a consequent lawyers’ bonanza at taxpayers’ expense highly likely. – Yours, etc, MICHAEL FLYNN, Bayside, Dublin 13, Sir, – Dr Eoin Drea’s recent opinion piece (“The EU presidency will show how out of touch Ireland is”, Opinion, November 13th) doesn’t quite tell the full story of Ireland’s relationship with the European Union and our upcoming EU presidency next year. Having just returned from one of my routine trips to Brussels, I met politicians and officials from across different EU countries and institutions, and I can confirm that next year’s Irish presidency of the Council of the EU is highly anticipated. Ireland has a strong track record of delivering on its EU presidencies, with some notable achievements. It may be easy to forget them but in 2013, when emerging from the financial crash, Ireland steered the EU ably through its presidency and secured the Youth Guarantee at a time of massive youth unemployment. In 2004, we welcomed 10 new EU countries in what has been the largest ever EU enlargement. Dr Eoin Drea’s observations on security and defence certainly do have merit. However, Ireland is responding. Ireland continues to stand with Ukraine. We became home to over 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and have provided significant financial aid. Ireland has demonstrated strong moral leadership on the conflict in Palestine, which is desperately needed at this time. Our economic success is not rooted in “dubious facilitation”, but in political stability, an educated workforce and access to the EU single market. These factors make us the second largest net contributor per capita to the EU budget; not an insignificant contribution from a country supposedly “out of touch”. – Yours, etc, NOELLE O’CONNELL, European Movement Ireland, Dublin 2. Sir, – As suggestions are sought by Una Mullally regarding the future of Baggot St Hospital, I have one that might be consistent with Dublin’s architectural history, provide a valuable educational resource and solve a potential problem in healthcare all at a minimal cost. In her article she observes that the current dilapidated structure was designed by William George Murray, architect of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, whose father had designed the College of Surgeons building. There is a great deal to recommend that the Government restructure his Baggot St design as a modern College of Anaesthesiologists of Ireland (CAI). The CAI currently operates from a house on Merion Square. With considerable ingenuity, from there it endeavours to oversee the training of more than 250 doctors in specialist training. – Yours, etc, BRIAN O’BRIEN, Kinsale, Co Cork. Sir, – Like Colm O’Brien (Letters, November 19th) I too cannot understand why Oliver Callan’s programme has been moved to accommodate David McCullagh’s Today programme. Yesterday morning Paschal Donohoe’s departure from Government was headline news on Morning Ireland. It was followed by David McCullagh’s first item – an interview with Paschal Donohoe. We now have constant talking until Louise Duffy’s show at 3pm. Please bring Louise back at noon, we need some light relief – and a female presenter! – Yours, etc, PAMELA McDONALD, Blackrock Village, Cork. Sir, – I note that we have a new Minister for Education. Last Thursday I attended the only training day I will have for the new Leaving Certificate geography course I am to begin teaching next September. There are, as yet, no sample papers. There will be no marking scheme to guide us in teaching our students when those papers do finally appear. And individual questions may not have marks attached to them, à la the reformed Junior Certificate, just to confuse students even more. They will be forced to guess how many marks for each question and how long they should spend on it. In other words, I learned nothing of value on this day. It seems futile to ask a third minister in a little over a year to review all of this urgently before the catastrophe that this reform unquestionably is begins to unfold in front of us. Especially as the previous two ministers simply stuck their fingers in their ears and refused to listen to the ideas and opinions of those of us charged with implementing this reform. But I have no choice. Someone has to at least be able to say I told you so. Plus ca change, Minister. – Yours, etc, ALAN O’CONNOR, Donnycarney, Dublin 9. Sir, – There are many elements of possible defence against aggression and invasion which are nothing to do with killing or being prepared to kill other people (Letters, November 19th). These include scuttling (destruction) of facilities, which would be of use to an invader, and “nonviolent civilian defence” which is about preparing the population for resistance and non-cooperation with an invader – or internal oppression – including hidden disobedience. Publicising these would be a deterrence to invasion. Gene Sharp’s 198 varieties of nonviolent resistance give just a small taste of what is possible. It is clear from the interrogation of Nazi generals after the second World War that they knew exactly how to deal with violence but they were at a loss when it came to non-violent resistance. Obviously it was violence which won that war for the Allies but it illustrates the power of non-violence. The 2023, State-organised Consultative Forum on International Security Policy refused to look at non-offensive defence and non-violent civilian defence which was just a part of why that was a propaganda exercise. But the wider question is how to prevent war, including nuclear war which would be the end of civilisation as we know it, and throwing us back to far worse than the stone age if we survived at all. The Irish Government seems content to add fuel to the flickering flames in Europe. We are currently looking in the wrong direction. – Yours, etc, ROB FAIRMICHAEL, Ballynafeigh, Belfast. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trump urges Treasury Secretary Bessent to take Federal Reserve job

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER and JOSH BOAK WASHINGTON (AP) — For the second time in two days, President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would like to appoint Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to chair the Federal Reserve. Yet Bessent keeps saying he doesn’t want the job, Trump added, in comments to the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum. “We’re thinking about him for the Fed, but he wants no part of it, he likes being secretary of the Treasury,” Trump said. “I think we’ll leave him — so let’s cross your name off right, officially, right?” Trump has been sharply critical of the current Fed chair, Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May, for not cutting interest rates quickly enough. Trump’s pick as a replacement will almost certainly push for rapid interest rate cuts and likely institute wide-ranging changes in how the Fed operates. Bessent earlier this year published extensive criticisms of the Fed’s groundbreaking efforts to shore up financial markets and the economy after the 2008-2009 Great Recession and during the pandemic. Bessent is heading up the Trump administration’s search for a new Fed chair. Yet despite his protestations, he is also widely seen as a leading potential replacement for Powell. “He’s a top-tier candidate right now,” Stephen Moore, a senior economic adviser to Trump in his first term, said. Trump “wants to shake things up, so I think he wants an outsider.” Two of the five candidates Bessent has named are current Fed officials: Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. The other three would fit the outsider criteria: Kevin Hassett, currently a top White House economic official; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who has been highly critical of the Fed; and Rick Rieder, a senior managing director at asset manager BlackRock. Late Tuesday, in an interview on Fox News with Bret Baier, Bessent said the administration is continuing to interview potential nominees for Fed chair. By mid-December, “the president will meet the final three candidates and hopefully have an answer before Christmas,” Bessent said. Associated Press Writer Fatima Hussein contributed to this report.

Title: BlackRock registers iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF in Delaware

Share this article BlackRock has registered a new statutory trust in Delaware under the name iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF, according to records from the Delaware Division of Corporations. Delaware registrations have typically preceded formal ETF applications to the SEC in recent crypto developments. The registration comes after Nasdaq filed Form 19b-4 with the SEC to enable staking for BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), allowing the ETF to stake its Ether through approved providers and classify rewards as income. However, the SEC has recently removed the requirement for 19b-4 filings for crypto exchange-traded products. Under the new generic listing standards, exchanges can now list qualifying crypto-commodity ETPs without submitting a product-specific 19b-4 rule change each time. BlackRock joins 21Shares, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale, all seeking to add staking to their Ethereum ETFs. Before spot ETH ETFs were approved, firms removed stakes from their applications amid concerns staking services could be treated as unregistered securities. The REX-Osprey ETH + Staking ETF is the first US Ethereum staking ETF, which offers exposure to ETH while also distributing native staking rewards to investors.

(NYSE: BLK), today announced the estimated 2025 annual reinvested capital gains distributions for the iShares ETFs listed on the TSX or Cboe Canada. Please note that these are estimated capital gains amounts only, as of October 31, 2025. As these are estimated amounts, the final capital gains distributions may change by the Funds' December 15, 2025 or December 31, 2025, in the case of iShares Premium Money Market ETF (“CMR”), tax year-ends. These estimates are for the annual non-cash capital gains distributions, which are typically reinvested in additional units of the respective funds at the year-end, and do not include estimates of ongoing periodic (e.g., monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual) cash distribution amounts. The additional units will be immediately consolidated with the previously outstanding units such that the number of outstanding units following the distribution will equal the number of units outstanding prior to the distribution. We expect to announce the final annual reinvested distribution amounts, as well as the ongoing cash distribution amounts, as applicable, for 2025, on or about December 29, 2025. The record date for the 2025 annual distributions will be December 30, 2025, payable on January 5, 2026. The actual taxable amounts of reinvested and cash distributions for 2025, including the tax characteristics of the distributions, will be reported to brokers (through CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. or “CDS”) in early 2026. Details regarding the estimated distribution amounts are as follows: (1) Distribution per unit amounts are in U.S. dollars for IBIT.U, XAGG.U, XAW.U, XCBU.U, XDG.U, XDU.U, XEC.U, XEF.U, XFLI.U, XMC.U, XMU.U, XQQU.U, XSHU.U, XSTP.U, XTLT.U, XTOT.U, XUS.U, XUSC.U, and XUU.U.

Factors that could cause the actual distributions to differ from the estimated distributions between now and December 15, 2025 (the iShares ETFs’ tax year end) or December 31, 2025 in the case of CMR, include, but are not limited to: the actual amounts of distributions received by the iShares ETFs; the actual amounts of capital gains generated from sales of securities; trading activity within the iShares ETFs, including buying and selling of securities; index changes which cause rebalancing within the iShares ETFs; and subscription and redemption activity.

Bitcoin is down to around $88,000, falling more than 20% over the last 30 days. The crypto market as a whole today fell to $3.04 trillion—down 4.82% in 24 hours—with 95% of all coins bleeding red. The Fear and Greed Index just hit 16, the lowest reading since April, firmly in extreme fear territory. To put this in perspective: Zcash is the only coin in the top 50 by market cap managing to stay green today, squeezing out a 4% gain. And the macro picture? It's not helping. Expectations for a December Federal Reserve rate cut are decreasing, Bitcoin ETFs just posted their fifth consecutive day of outflows (a record $523 million from BlackRock alone just yesterday), and traders seem to be looking for a hedge as the possibility of a crypto winter in 2026 gets more serious. Meanwhile, on Myriad—the prediction market built by Decrypt's parent company Dastan—traders are positioning for more carnage. A whopping 73.3% of the money on Myriad is betting Bitcoin dumps to $85K, as opposed to pumping to $115K. As for Ethereum, Myriad users place the odds at 62% that ETH, currently trading for around $2,800, slides to $2.5K over a rally to $4K. Are they right? Here's what the charts say. Bitcoin opened today at $92,911 and promptly fell off a cliff, sliding more than 4% to its current price of $88,605. That's a $4K slip in a single day that once again pushed BTC below the psychologically critical $90K level and marked a fresh seven-month low. The technical setup is starting to look ugly. Exponential Moving Averages, or EMAs, help traders identify trend direction by tracking the average price of an asset over the short, medium, and long term. When the short-term 50-day EMA falls below the long-term 200-day EMA, it typically means sellers are dominating the market structure. For Bitcoin, the 50-day EMA just crossed below the 200-day EMA, forming the dreaded "death cross" pattern that signals longer-term bearish momentum. Bitcoin is now trading well below both moving averages, which creates nasty overhead resistance that bulls need to reclaim before any meaningful recovery can begin. Here's where it gets worse: The Average Directional Index—which measures trend strength regardless of direction—is sitting at a robust 38.25. ADX readings above 25 indicate a strong trend is in place, and above 35 signals a very strong trend. This tells us the current downtrend isn't some weak, directionless chop; there's real momentum behind this selloff, as reflected in the “extreme fear” reading on the Crypto Fear and Green Index. Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index, or RSI, has cratered to 27.12, firmly in oversold territory below 30. RSI measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold based on recent price movements, and at 27, Bitcoin is stretched like a rubber band. This doesn't mean the selling stops immediately, but it does suggest we're approaching exhaustion levels where a violent bounce becomes more likely. That may mean prices soon testing the support (now resistance) level that has been in place since June, visible in the chart above in the dotted white line. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator, which shows the market phase of prices and helps identify when trends are about to shift, is flashing bearish impulse signals, confirming the compression is releasing downward. So are Myriad predictors right in setting that $85K target? The wisdom of the crowd might be onto something. The chart shows a Fibonacci support around $84,451, with stronger support near $71,486. If Bitcoin loses the $88K-$89K zone it's currently testing, there's not much stopping a move toward $85K and below. However, that oversold RSI suggests any drop to $85K would likely be a quick wick rather than a sustained breakdown. Capitulation moves tend to reverse violently once they flush out the last of the leveraged long positions—those futures contracts betting on the price of Bitcoin to go up using borrowed capital. The upside case to $115K would require Bitcoin to reclaim the death cross and break above the descending trendline around $100,492—a tall order that explains why only 26.7% of traders are betting on it. Key levels: Resistance: Support: And if Bitcoin is in bad shape, then Ethereum has it even worse. ETH today dumped 6.73% from an opening price of $3,121.7 to close at $2,911.8, with an intraday low of $2,895.8. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum's 50-day EMA is still trading above its 200-day EMA—a "golden cross" that's supposed to be bullish. So why is ETH getting destroyed? The golden cross tells you the longer-term trend structure is intact, but it doesn't protect you from brutal corrections within that trend. Ethereum is trading below both moving averages despite the golden cross, which means the bullish structure is being tested hard. Also, the setup is very likely to turn bearish soon: The two EMAs are just about to cross, so if ETH dips for a few days, you’ll have another death cross here too. And get this: Ethereum's ADX is even more extreme than Bitcoin's at 42.4. Traders would view this as a very strong trend, and right now that trend is firmly bearish. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator for ETH is likewise showing bearish impulse signals What might make this particularly painful for ETH holders is that Ethereum has stronger downward momentum (higher ADX) but is also barely above oversold territory with an RSI of 30.92—just kissing the 30 threshold. This creates a knife-edge situation where the strong downtrend could push RSI deeper into oversold before reversing. The ETH chart shows support around $2,796 and stronger support near $2,300. Myriad users are again strongly favoring the downside at the moment, with nearly 67% odds that Ethereum falls to $2.5K or below, which aligns with the technical analysis. Ethereum needs to hold the $2,700-$2,800 zone (shown in the Fibonacci levels) to keep the 200-day EMA intact. If that breaks, the next meaningful support is indeed around $2,300-$2,500—exactly where most Myriad users are looking. For the 33% betting on $4K? That would require ETH to reclaim the $3,100-$3,200 zone, hold it as support, and grind through multiple resistance levels. It’s possible if macro conditions improve, but the technicals right now don't support it. Keep praying, bulls. This is crypto after all. Crazier things have happened.

Title: Vitalik Buterin warns of two threats to Ethereum if BlackRock gets any bigger

About us Copy link Beware of BlackRock and its ilk. If the world’s largest asset managers continue to accumulate Ether, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, at unprecedented rates, the network will face two key existential threats, according to Vitalik Buterin. Buterin spoke at a panel at the Funding the Commons side event at Devconnect conference in Buenos Aires alongside computer scientist Roger Dingledine, who co-founded the privacy software Tor Project . During the talk, attended by DL News, Buterin laid out how institutional capture could fundamentally break what makes Ethereum valuable. “How do you avoid capture by big behemoths like BlackRock?” Dingledine asked Buterin, referencing the flood of institutional interest following BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF launch. Buterin’s answer was blunt. Institutional influence creates two specific risks that could destroy Ethereum’s core purpose. The nine Wall Street firms that offer Ethereum exchange-traded funds now hold over $18 billion in Ether, while treasury companies hold an additional $18 billion on their balance sheets. Analysts, moreover, forecast that institutions could hold more than 10% of Ethereum’s entire supply in the near-term. But Buterin sees danger in that type of success. Indeed, since the arrival of Wall Street behemoths, Ethereum has faced a fundamental tension. Institutional money brings legitimacy and capital. But it also brings pressure to optimise for institutional needs — not the permissionless, censorship-resistant values that made Ethereum exciting to build on in the first place. The first risk is pretty straightforward. When BlackRock and other institutions gain too much influence, they alienate the people who actually care about decentralisation. “It easily drives other people away,” Buterin said. The core community and builders who spent years developing Ethereum’s infrastructure don’t want to build for Wall Street. They want to build transparent, permissionless systems, he explained. If Ethereum becomes primarily a tool for institutional finance, those builders could get up and leave. And without them, Ethereum loses the technical expertise and ideological commitment that keeps it decentralised. There’s a second, more concrete, threat. Institutional pressure leads to technical decisions that could break Ethereum’s accessibility. “Their existence easily leads to the wrong kinds of choices on the base layer,” said Buterin, who offered up an example: 150-millisecond block times. Faster blocks sound great for high-frequency trading and institutional applications, but they create impossible constraints for ordinary users. Worse, 150ms blocks make it “infeasible to operate a node unless you’re in NYC” — or another financial hub with ultra-low latency connections to validators. The result is ghoulish for a community predicated on decentralisation and sticking it to the man. An Ethereum optimised for Wall Street becomes an Ethereum that only Wall Street can use. That means geographic centralisation, exclusion of privacy-conscious users, and a node operator base limited to whoever can afford data centres located in Manhattan. In any case, Buterin offered a fix. “We need to focus on the things that would otherwise be in short supply: global, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocol,” he said. Wall Street doesn’t need Ethereum to move fast or settle trades efficiently. It has systems for that. What Wall Street can’t build — and what makes Ethereum valuable — is a truly global system that anyone can access without permission nor trust. Maintaining that requires a “strong core community that focuses on those things,” Buterin said. Not a community optimised for institutional adoption, but one committed to the values that make Ethereum different from traditional finance.

BlackRock Bitcoin ETF outflow today: BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF saw its largest single-day outflow of $523 million as Bitcoin plunged to a seven-month low. This significant withdrawal signals investor unease and a potential shift towards safer assets like gold, amid a broader market retreat and concerns over stretched valuations. Profit-taking and a 'crypto hangover' are also cited as contributing factors.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Sees Record $523 Million Outflow as BTC Drops Below $90,000

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recorded its largest single-day outflow of $523 million on Nov. 18, extending a five-day streak of redemptions totaling $1.425 billion as Bitcoin tests levels below $90,000. Investors pulled approximately $523 million from BlackRock‘s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) on Nov. 18, marking the fund’s largest outflow since its debut in January 2024, according to data from Farside Investors. This significant withdrawal comes amid a broader decline in Bitcoin BTC $84 812 24h volatility: 6.6% Market cap: $1.70 T Vol. 24h: $137.39 B prices, which recently reached a seven-month low. The ETF price rose slightly at the beginning of Nov. 19, but at the time of publication, it was down by more than 3%. IBIT price | Source: Yahoo! Finance The record outflow continued a trend of sustained withdrawals from Bitcoin ETFs, representing the fifth consecutive day of net redemptions. In total, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has shed $1.425 billion in capital over this period. November is shaping up to be the worst month for Bitcoin ETFs, with cumulative outflows surpassing previous monthly records. While BlackRock’s IBIT experienced record outflows, other Bitcoin ETFs, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and Franklin Templeton’s ETF (EZBC), recorded inflows of $139.6 million and $10.8 million, respectively, on Nov. 18. According to Reuters, this divergence suggests that some investors may be shifting to alternative Bitcoin investment vehicles even as broad risk aversion persists. Bitcoin’s price decline to less than $90,000, down approximately 30% from its October high above $126,000, has coincided with increased selling pressure in ETFs. On Nov. 19, the Bitcoin price is testing again levels below $90,000, with 24-hour trading volume 42% lower. At $89,620 per BTC, it represents another 4.30% dip in a day. Bitcoin price | Source: TradingView Analysts note that the average purchase price for spot Bitcoin ETF buyers is around $90,146, suggesting many investors are either breaking even or incurring losses at current levels, possibly prompting redemptions. Despite this week’s heavy withdrawals, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust remains the leading Bitcoin ETF by assets under management, with $87.63 billion as of Nov. 19. The fund had seen strong inflows in the months before this sell-off, accumulating nearly $25 billion from March through October 2025.

The exchange-traded fund has hemorrhaged more than $1.4 billion in assets since last Thursday, according to UK asset manager Farside Investors, the highest total for any consecutive day stretch in its 22-month history. "IBIT had worst day of outflows ever yesterday... ugly stretch," Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X, although he noted that net inflows still topped "an astronomical" $25 billion for the year. $IBIT had worst day of outflows ever yesterday about half a billion. Ugly stretch, although YTD flows still at an astronomical +$25b (6th overall). All told $3.3b in total outflows past month from btc ETFs, which is 3.5% of aum. pic.twitter.com/lhTMIu1H8B — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 19, 2025 The losses have come amid a six-week market swoon precipitated by macroeconomic uncertainties, including the longest government shutdown in U.S. history and concerns about inflation, an ongoing trade war, slumping jobs data pointing toward a recession, and the impact of AI initiatives on big tech firms' balance sheets. Bitcoin touched a seven-month low of $89,037 on Wednesday and was recently trading at $89,204, a more than 4% drop over the past 24 hours and its lowest level in seven months, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now down 4% year-to-date, just six weeks after hitting a record high above $126,000. In a Myriad prediction market, users forecast just a 28% chance that Bitcoin will hit $115,000 in its next move, rather than falling to $85,000–a sharp reversal of trendlines from just a week ago that reflects investors' sour mood. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a unit of Dastan, the parent company of Decrypt.) IBIT shares were recently off 3.6% on Wednesday and have tumbled more than 16% over the past month, according to Yahoo Finance. The ETF set its previous record of $463 million in outflows last Friday. It had previously only shed more than $400 million in assets on two other days, rare missteps for the dramatically successful fund. In June, IBIT reached $70 billion in inflows faster than any ETF in the industry's 32-year history. IBIT now manages more than $73 billion in assets, more than three times the AUM of its closest rival, with the gains coming as institutional interest in Bitcoin has risen. Harvard University recently upped its position in IBIT to 6.8 million shares worth about $442 million, from a previous holding of 1.9 million shares, according to a regulatory filing. Other Bitcoin ETFs have also been hard-hit, with the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shedding more than $266 million and $146 million in investments over the past five trading days, respectively, although none on Tuesday. The 11 spot Bitcoin funds collectively control more than $130 billion in assets. The Bitcoin funds declines have come even as fledgling Solana funds have added investments, particularly the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), which has posted net inflows on every day of its less than three-week history and now oversees $611 million in AUM. On Wednesday, 21Shares Solana ETF (TSOL) became the fifth Solana-tracking fund to list on a U.S. exchange.

The exchange-traded fund has hemorrhaged more than $1.4 billion in assets since last Thursday, according to UK asset manager Farside Investors, the highest total for any consecutive day stretch in its 22-month history. "IBIT had worst day of outflows ever yesterday... ugly stretch," Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas wrote on X, although he noted that net inflows still topped "an astronomical" $25 billion for the year. $IBIT had worst day of outflows ever yesterday about half a billion. Ugly stretch, although YTD flows still at an astronomical +$25b (6th overall). All told $3.3b in total outflows past month from btc ETFs, which is 3.5% of aum. pic.twitter.com/lhTMIu1H8B — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 19, 2025 The losses have come amid a six-week market swoon precipitated by macroeconomic uncertainties, including the longest government shutdown in U.S. history and concerns about inflation, an ongoing trade war, slumping jobs data pointing toward a recession, and the impact of AI initiatives on big tech firms' balance sheets. Bitcoin touched a seven-month low of $89,037 on Wednesday and was recently trading at $89,204, a more than 4% drop over the past 24 hours and its lowest level in seven months, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is now down 4% year-to-date, just six weeks after hitting a record high above $126,000. In a Myriad prediction market, users forecast just a 28% chance that Bitcoin will hit $115,000 in its next move, rather than falling to $85,000–a sharp reversal of trendlines from just a week ago that reflects investors' sour mood. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a unit of Dastan, the parent company of Decrypt.) IBIT shares were recently off 3.6% on Wednesday and have tumbled more than 16% over the past month, according to Yahoo Finance. The ETF set its previous record of $463 million in outflows last Friday. It had previously only shed more than $400 million in assets on two other days, rare missteps for the dramatically successful fund. In June, IBIT reached $70 billion in inflows faster than any ETF in the industry's 32-year history. IBIT now manages more than $73 billion in assets, more than three times the AUM of its closest rival, with the gains coming as institutional interest in Bitcoin has risen. Harvard University recently upped its position in IBIT to 6.8 million shares worth about $442 million, from a previous holding of 1.9 million shares, according to a regulatory filing. Other Bitcoin ETFs have also been hard-hit, with the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shedding more than $266 million and $146 million in investments over the past five trading days, respectively, although none on Tuesday. The 11 spot Bitcoin funds collectively control more than $130 billion in assets. The Bitcoin funds declines have come even as fledgling Solana funds have added investments, particularly the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), which has posted net inflows on every day of its less than three-week history and now oversees $611 million in AUM. On Wednesday, 21Shares Solana ETF (TSOL) became the fifth Solana-tracking fund to list on a U.S. exchange.
