You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. In today’s "Crypto for Advisors" newsletter, Harvey Li from Tokenization Insights takes us through tokenization trends, money market funds, and institutional adoption as we head into 2026. Then, in "Ask an Expert," Michael Sena looks at what it means for investors with BlackRock’s announced plans to tokenize everything from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to real estate. - Sarah Morton Tokenization entered a new phase in 2025. What started as an experiment is now becoming a functional part of institutional infrastructure, led by banks and asset managers who aren’t waiting for a tokenized future — they’re building it. One specific product category has emerged as the clear front-runner: tokenized money market funds (MMFs). Tokenized MMFs are quickly becoming the core on-chain liquidity instrument for institutions, treasurers, and sophisticated funds. They bridge traditional short-term U.S. Treasury exposure with digital settlement, programmable workflows, and real-time portability. Growth is real: And institutions are incorporating tokenized MMF into businesses: Momentum is building, but the real story is what comes next in 2026. 1. Regulatory validation and collateral eligibility The Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC)Global Markets Advisory Committee recommended tokenized MMFs as eligible collateral, and Acting Chair Caroline Pham launched a dedicated initiative in late 2025 to advance tokenized collateral adoption. If tokenized MMFs become approved as eligible margin collateral, recognized for cleared derivatives, swaps, and repo and embedded into CCP and FCM rulebooks, then tokenized MMFs evolve from a cash-parking tool into core institutional collateral, the same category that fuels trillions in daily financing today. This is a major unlock for banks, brokers, hedge funds, and trading venues that need intraday settlement and programmable liquidity. 2. The “institutional legitimacy” moment Seventy institutions, including State Street, Fnality, Franklin Templeton, and UBS, contributed to Global Digital Finance’s November 2025 report and demonstrated that tokenized MMFs can be: 3. The rise of tokenized cash rails at major banks Until recently, tokenized MMFs could only be redeemed via traditional banking rails or stablecoins. That is changing quickly. In 2025, we saw: As tokenized cash rails mature, institutions will be able to move tokenized MMF to tokenized deposit and settlement cash within the same ecosystem, with no friction and no conversion back to legacy payment rails or stablecoins. That is the moment when tokenized MMFs stop being a crypto-adjacent product and become digital liquidity management blocks for institutions. 4. Regulatory momentum for U.S.D and EUR stablecoins While tokenized institutional cash rails are rapidly expanding, stablecoin policy and legislation are helping stablecoins become the default cash rail for public permissionless space: Once these frameworks settle and SMEs become more comfortable with leveraging stablecoins for cash purposes, tokenized money market funds naturally become the yield, collateral, treasury, and portfolio cash solution. The direction of travel is clear. Cash that used to sit in bank accounts or legacy MMF portals is now being re-packaged into programmable instruments that plug directly into digital asset rails, and tokenized money market funds are becoming the cash management and collateral solution for all tokenized cash forms: tokenized bank deposits, deposit tokens and stablecoins. 2025 was the breakout year for tokenized money market funds as an asset class.2026 looks to be the acceleration phase, when tokenized MMFs become a standard treasury, settlement, and collateral asset for institutions. - Harvey Li, founder, Tokenization Insight Q: Traditionally, U.S. ETFs follow Wall Street’s market hours and settle through their clearing houses. What are the benefits and hurdles BlackRock’s investors will face in terms of round-the-clock trading? A: 24/7 trading will change everything from staffing to risk management. When markets never close, it changes the way you need to operate. The benefits of real-time markets means that those who can react first will be able to capture the bulk of moves in asset prices. Q: The tokenized asset market is still insignificant compared to the trillion-dollar U.S. ETF industry. How will BlackRock’s participation contribute to the tokenization ecosystem? A: BlackRock’s massive asset portfolio will instantly increase the overall value represented by the tokenized ecosystem. More than that, it brings credibility to all types of blockchain-based assets beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Q: BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, has been bullish on asset tokenization and wants to tokenize almost every traditional asset. Is tokenization a move to extend better services to investors or maintain its hegemony as the largest asset manager? A: BlackRock clearly sees the future of tokenized assets and all the benefits they bring: reduced operational overhead, increased efficiency, and more trust. Most of a large asset manager’s business isn’t in front-facing markets, but is in clearing, settlement, and other types of back and middle office operations.

It says a lot about the ever-bullish outlook of Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood that she predicted bitcoin to reach $1.2 million by 2030, and it was, in fact, a downgrade. This feature is a part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025 list. Cathie Wood made her forecast for BTC's price in November 2025, slightly revising the target down from $1.5 million based on the explosive rise of stablecoins, which she claimed may usurp some of bitcoin's value as a transactional instrument. Her impact on cryptocurrency goes beyond her notoriously bullish predictions, however. Ark's spot bitcoin ETF, which it listed in partnership with 21Shares, is the third-largest such product in the U.S. behind only the runaway market leaders provided by asset management giants BlackRock and Fidelity. Wood's optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency industry is evident in the holdings of some of Ark's largest ETFs. The firm’s $8.4 billion Innovation ETF counts crypto exchange Coinbase among its largest holdings, as do two of Ark's other largest ETFs by net assets. The initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2025 of stablecoin issuer Circle and crypto exchange Bullish (the parent company of CoinDesk) also prompted sizeable investments by Ark. Through its ETFs, Ark and, by extension, Wood, who also holds the role of chief investment officer (CIO), may represent a North Star for understanding which disruptive technologies are likely to provide the most lucrative high-growth plays.

Title: Climate Skeptics Rush to Misuse Texas v. BlackRock
URL: https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2025/12/11/climate-skeptics-rush-to-misuse-texas-v-blackrock/
Time Published: 2025-12-11T14:06:37Z

Texas v. BlackRock (E.D. Tex.) (BlackRock), a case in which 11 states claim that the institutional-investor defendants colluded to profit through coordinated output reductions at coal companies they partially owned, remains in its early stages, with discovery continuing through 2027. Already however, opponents of climate-risk mitigation have rushed to extract specious theories of antitrust harm from Judge Kernodle’s partial denial of the motion to dismiss (the BlackRock MTD decision). Following procedural requirements, Judge Kernodle took as true plaintiffs’ allegations that the BlackRock defendants joined climate alliances and pursued related mitigation goals that “necessarily result in the reduction of coal output.” Judge Kernodle also found plausible plaintiffs’ allegations of antitrust harm to consumers, as reflected in rising prices during a period of decreased production by the relevant coal companies. Judge Kernodle did note that BlackRock may possess a valid defense to these allegations, stemming from long-term declines in coal consumption. But interests aligned with the BlackRock plaintiffs already have assembled a house-of-cards antitrust argument that any institutional investor factoring climate risk into its business decisions should face heightened scrutiny on routine portfolio acquisitions. A neutral analysis of the BlackRock MTD decision does not justify imposing such legal burdens, which would hinder these investors’ capacity to compete against their climate-indifferent rivals. This post seeks to clarify: (1) why the BlackRock MTD decision remains far from proclaiming institutional investors’ every climate consideration a proven anticompetitive output reduction; and (2) why institutional investors’ “solely for investment” exemption from antitrust scrutiny still permits these investors to promote a wide range of climate-risk mitigation measures. The BlackRock complaint contains multiple antitrust claims. The plaintiffs assert violations under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, claiming each defendant used its partial ownership of coal companies in a manner reasonably likely to reduce competition, to consumers’ detriment. Plaintiffs also assert violations under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, claiming defendants collectively agreed to coerce the coal companies’ implementation of a coordinated output reduction (reducing coal supply in order to intensify demand, raise prices, and boost profit margins). And Plaintiffs assert violations under state antitrust laws (not covered by this blog post). Judge Kernodle’s MTD dismissal notes that the Texas complaint’s “first of its kind” allegation of a “horizontal agreement among investors to pressure competitors in another industry to reduce output” [italics in original] does not call for per se antitrust analysis (an approach which assumes the anticompetitive harms of a given activity, and only considers whether defendants engaged in that activity). Instead, the court will conduct an elaborate rule-of-reason balancing, to “divin[e] the procompetitive or anticompetitive effects” of these defendants’ business arrangements. Judge Kernodle makes clear that “weighty economics questions” remain to be resolved in later stages of litigation. Those questions will likely focus on defining an appropriate market to measure the competitive effects of defendants’ actions, determining whether plaintiffs have persuasively pinpointed how defendants’ actions harmed competition in these markets, and assessing defendants’ claims of procompetitive benefits. To scrutinize antitrust defendants’ effects on competition, courts typically first define a particular market in which the purported harm occurred or might occur. Judge Kernodle’s MTD dismissal notes that defendants did not contest “at this stage” of litigation the plaintiffs’ proposed focus on the markets for South Powder River Basin coal, and thermal coal. Yet defendants may have good reason to contest these market definitions at subsequent stages. Consideration of a broader market (one encompassing a wide range of energy sources that satisfy the relevant consumers’ needs) could allow defendants to argue that modernization and diversification of product options in order to meet shifting economic conditions (such as mounting climate risk), have not, on balance, harmed energy consumers. By extension, defendants might call into question the status of coal-company output decisions as a but-for cause of consumer harm, by pointing to across-the-board price increases for a diverse array of energy products. Alternately, if defendants could show that rising coal prices coincided with increased demand for substitutable energy products (such as renewable power, nuclear power, and/or natural gas), this also may weaken the plaintiffs’ claims of harm to consumers or to competition. The BlackRock plaintiffs will face additional challenges meeting their burden of persuasion as this case progresses. The defendants only need to poke holes in plaintiffs’ theory of harm. The defendants might start, for example, from plaintiffs’ argumentative reliance on: “different responses…exhibited by…publicly held companies…whose shares Defendants acquired and who cut their output during a period of rising prices…and…privately held companies, who raised their output.” This facile comparison between publicly and privately owned coal companies looks easily contestable. The plaintiffs must convince the court that broader economic trends would not have prompted these same disparities between public and private coal companies’ output. But given the escalating societal concerns and conspicuous financial risks associated with an emissions-intensive energy source like coal, public companies’ greater susceptibility to reputational costs (alongside their added disclosure obligations) may incentivize such categorical differences in output. That certainly offers a simpler account than the elaborate conspiracy plaintiffs allege, in which institutional investors promised transformational clean-tech innovations, pushed for robust emissions reporting while faking their focus on climate mitigation, and cynically captured inflated profits by peddling dirty fuels. The BlackRock plaintiffs also advance tenuous antitrust causation claims through their frequent conflations of defendants’ alleged coal-reduction, emissions-reduction, and net-zero pledges. This misapplies antitrust’s output-reduction concerns to restraints on firms’ negative externalities (greenhouse-gas byproducts), rather than on their supplying of economic goods (carbon-based energy sources). To date, Judge Kernodle has taken as true plaintiffs’ assertion that a pledge to reduce coal emissions “necessarily means cutting coal production because ‘there is no realistic path for a coal company to cut coal emissions other than by cutting production.’” Yet regardless of whether one doubts the fossil-fuel industry’s pledges of near-term clean-coal deployment, we consider it unlikely that a merits-stage court analysis would give the plaintiffs’ brusque, future-oriented pronouncement of “no realistic path” much factual weight in proving present market harms. We likewise find it ironic that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has signed off (both as a licensed attorney, and as an accountable public official) not only on this sweeping denial of clean-coal boosterism, but also on a recent letter celebrating President Trump’s “BEAUTIFUL, CLEAN COAL” [capitalization in original] agenda. Nor do AG Paxton’s questionable claims stop there. In fact, the BlackRock complaint comes closest to demonstrating an agreement to reduce coal output (rather than to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions) by repeatedly misrepresenting plaintiffs’ own evidence on this topic. For but one example, the complaint brazenly cherry-picks from a Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) document, so that NZAM appears to call on its members (including each BlackRock defendant) to “immediately ceas[e] all financial or other support to coal companies…building new coal infrastructure.” Yet plaintiffs fail to disclose that the cited NZAM document does not require this particular approach. The approach is one of five climate-mitigation strategies that NZAM signatories are expected to choose from (other options include a “phase out” of thermal-coal investments on an unspecified timeline, or “restricting financing for unabated coal power generation, i.e. without carbon capture and storage”). Judge Kernodle’s MTD decision, in turn, cites this NZAM quotation in multiple passages, at times reading it as an express NZAM requirement, rather than as a nonbinding option. Later stages of litigation will allow defendants to question whether membership in a climate alliance that permits an open-ended “phase out” of coal investments has evidentiary value in a lawsuit claiming real-world market effects between 2019 and 2022—and whether plaintiffs established that evidence in bad faith. Former Congressmember (and ranking Republican on the House of Representatives’ Antitrust Subcommittee) Ken Buck has catalogued further ways in which “the facts dispute the allegations,” including: no relevant coal-company manager being removed by proxy vote during the complaint’s timeframe; certain defendants never voting against a single director; and purportedly colluding defendants consistently voting differently from each other. Should plaintiffs navigate these impediments to presenting a persuasive causal chain that culminates in anticompetitive effects, they still will need to address defendants’ procompetitive defenses. Multiple procompetitive rationales for corporate climate pledges present themselves, particularly for pledges to reduce emissions. To begin with, given regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. on coal emissions, as well as increasingly strict greenhouse-gas regimes in other advanced economies, reducing industry emissions (especially through lower emissions intensity) may facilitate continued coal production, under whatever constraints the industry finds itself facing. Moreover, the net-zero commitments in this case’s climate pledges need not even commit a signatory to reduced coal emissions (let alone reduced coal output), since by definition “net-zero” calculations balance GHG additions to, and removals from, the atmosphere (with possibilities for offsets). Defendants also may argue that collective emissions pledges improve the quality of each investor firm’s offerings, and follow antitrust law on standard-setting by “encourag[ing] competition with cleaner, more innovative, or more transparent products.” Along related lines, the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission’s (the Antitrust Agencies) statement-of-interest filing on the BlackRock MTD sets the stage for a green-transition procompetitive defense, particularly in investment markets: “an institutional investor…could advocate in favor of the business in which it owns…stock to exit one market in favor of another, more profitable market [and] could even pressure the management of the firm to undertake such a transition [so long as this transition] would reduce output in the first market in service of achieving higher profits in another.” This logic leaves ample room for institutional-investor defendants with substantial coal holdings to persuade the court that they did not seek to self-destruct by advocating a net-zero transition—but instead to increase profits (and improve their own investment products) by calling for energy-sector innovation that better fits evolving economic circumstances. Amid these daunting challenges still faced by the BlackRock plaintiffs, climate denialists already have doubled down on dubious antitrust rationales for stifling emissions-mitigation and disclosure initiatives. The “woke alert” advocacy organization Consumers’ Research, for example, sent a September letter to the Antitrust Agencies, celebrating Judge Kernodle’s “vindicat[ion]” of the agencies’ BlackRock statement, which primarily argued that defendants overstated antitrust law’s exemption from Section 7 scrutiny, provided to stock acquisitions made “solely for investment.” Consumers’ Research highlights the Antitrust Agencies’ assertion that “an investment is not ‘solely for investment’ if an investor has an intent to use stock to influence significantly or control management of the target firm.” Yet from this measured premise, Consumers’ Research mischaracterizes many reasonable business efforts to reduce climate risk as suspicious “mixed motive” practices demanding enhanced antitrust scrutiny. These suspect practices would include: an institutional investor’s public statement encouraging clarity in corporations’ greenhouse-gas reduction targets; an institutional investor’s voting of shares against incumbent directors who fail to pursue net-zero alignment; and even an investor’s mere vote for annual emissions disclosures like those increasingly required in most advanced economies. This legal pivot from anticompetitive harms and managerial control (in the Antitrust Agencies’ statement), to a much broader array of climate-minded “business decisions,” would vastly restrict the shareholder rights of institutional investors and their clients, while harming competition in investment markets by capriciously targeting firms that engage in broad categories of risk analysis. By contrast, the Antitrust Agencies’ BlackRock statement offered multiple indications that “conferring with directors and management on best practices for…oversight processes,” or using “investment holdings and market status to influence or change…public reporting practices,” does not inevitably depart from Section 7 solely-for-investment standards. Rather, these actions confirm the “critical role in corporate governance matters” played by institutional investors. Subsequent rounds of the Texas v.

Title: BlackRock’s move into Ethereum staking signals a brutal new fee regime that mid-tier operators won’t survive

BlackRock’s filing raises questions on slashing risk, custody waterfalls and yield passthrough. We chart three scenarios for fees and liquidity. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock filed for a staking-enabled Ethereum (ETH) trust on Dec. 5, which reframes the question of what kind of risk stack institutional investors will accept. The document outlines a structure that requires allocators to price three distinct failure modes simultaneously. First, protocol-level slashing penalties can hit the trust’s vault account with no guarantee of full recovery. Second, a multi-entity custody arrangement where a trade credit lender holds first-priority liens over trust assets and can liquidate positions if credits aren’t repaid on time. Third, a variable yield stream in which the sponsor controls how much ether is staked versus held in liquid form, creating a direct tension between the trust’s redemption needs and the sponsor’s staking-related fees. The filing seems like a bet that institutional buyers will treat Ethereum validator risk the way they’ve learned to treat counterparty risk in prime brokerage: as manageable, diversifiable, and worth paying someone else to monitor. BlackRock plans to stake 70% to 90% of the trust’s ETH through “provider-facilitated staking,” selecting operators based on uptime and slashing history. The S-1 acknowledges that slashed assets are debited directly from the vault and that any compensatory payments from providers may not fully cover losses. The language leaves open how much residual risk investors ultimately absorb and whether the sponsor would cut staking levels materially if validator risk climbs. That matters because slashing doesn’t hurt through the raw ETH destroyed, but through the second-order behavior it triggers. An isolated slashing event is written off as an operator-quality problem, while a correlated slashing event, such as a client bug that takes down validators across multiple providers, becomes a system-trust problem. Exit queues lengthen because Ethereum’s validator churn is rate-limited. Liquid staking tokens can trade at steep discounts as holders scramble for immediate liquidity while market makers pull back. Institutional allocators are demanding clearer indemnities, proof of multi-client failover, and explicit backstops, which are pushing fees higher and separating “institutional-grade” operators from everyone else. The custody structure adds another layer. The trust routes assets through an ETH custodian, a prime execution agent, and a trade credit lender, with the option to move to an additional custodian if needed. To secure trade credits, the trust grants a first-priority lien over both its trading and vault balances. If a credit isn’t repaid on time, the lender can seize and liquidate assets, burning through the trading balance first. The dynamic creates a claim-priority question in fast markets: who gets paid when, and what happens if service relationships are restricted or terminated? The filing notes that insurance programs may be shared across clients rather than dedicated to the trust, which weakens the comfort level for large allocators. Settlement timing adds friction. Moving ETH from the vault to the trading balance occurs on-chain to prevent network congestion from delaying redemptions. That’s not theoretical, as Ethereum has seen periodic gas spikes that would bottleneck large fund flows. On yield, the trust will distribute staking consideration net of fees at least quarterly, but the exact fee split remains redacted in the draft filing. The S-1 flags a conflict of interest: the sponsor earns more when staking levels run higher, but the trust needs liquidity to meet redemptions. There’s no guarantee of rewards, and past returns don’t predict future ones. The filing implicitly prices three scenarios, each with different effects on validator fees and liquidity. Under normal operations, staking looks boring. Exit queues stay manageable, withdrawals happen on schedule, and liquid staking tokens trade near fair value with small discounts that reflect general risk appetite. Additionally, operator fees stay tight as providers compete on uptime, client diversity, and reporting quality rather than charging explicit insurance premiums. Reputation and operational diligence drive pricing more than tail risk. A minor, isolated slashing event nudges the equilibrium but doesn’t break it, causing only a small direct economic loss. Some providers quietly rebate fees or absorb the hit to preserve institutional relationships, and demand drifts toward higher-assurance operators. The result is a modest fee dispersion between top-tier and mid-tier setups. Liquid staking token discounts might widen briefly, but liquidity mechanics stay smooth. The effect typically fades within days or weeks unless it exposes deeper operational flaws. A major, correlated slashing event resets risk pricing entirely, and institutional allocators demand stronger multi-client diversification, proof of failover, and explicit slashing backstops. The best-capitalized or most trusted operators gain pricing power and can charge higher fees. Exit queues lengthen because Ethereum limits the number of validators who can leave per epoch. Liquid staking tokens trade at deep discounts as holders chase immediate liquidity and market makers protect themselves against uncertain redemption timing and further losses. The system can appear liquid on paper while feeling illiquid in practice. Confidence and pricing can take weeks to months to normalize, even after the technical issue resolves. A staked Ethereum ETF will likely operate in the “normal-ops” regime most of the time, but the market will embed a small haircut into its staking yield to account for tail risk. That haircut widens in a major slashing scenario due to both lower expected net yields and a higher liquidity premium demanded by investors. The question isn’t whether BlackRock can execute the mechanics, but whether the structure shifts enough demand toward “institutional-grade” staking to create a new fee tier and liquidity regime. If it does, the validators who win institutional flows will be the ones who can credibly price and manage correlated risk, not just run nodes reliably. The losers will be mid-tier operators who can’t afford the insurance, reporting infrastructure, or client diversification that allocators will start requiring. Wall Street will pay for Ethereum yield if someone else owns the operational and protocol risk. Validators now have to decide whether they want to compete for that business or let the world’s largest asset manager pick their replacements.

Title: So Trump Seized A Venezuelan Oil Tanker?
URL: https://www.wonkette.com/p/so-trump-seized-a-venezuelan-oil
Time Published: 2025-12-11T13:55:40Z
Full Content:
Excuse me, what in the Somali pirate?! Donald John Trump, commander in chief of these United States, claimed on Wednesday that the US Coast Guard has seized a Venezuelan oil tanker. And the US is going to keep the oil! And he’ll do it again! Was the oil tanker full of liquefied fentanyl it was coming to squirt on the US? No! Was it engaging in hostilities? No again. It was full of oil from PDVSA, Venezuela’s state-owned facilities, chugging between Venezuela and Cuba, reportedly en route to Asian oil brokers. Seems Trump has now forgotten all about that fake “fentanyl” pretense now. Subscribe to Wonkette for all your WARBLOGGING needs! It sounds like legit privateering and not piracy though. The ship called the Skipper had been sanctioned for moving Iranian oil, and a federal judge had approved a warrant for its seizure a few weeks ago. Joe Biden also seized a tanker, in 2023. But a big difference is that that one was actually full of Iranian oil. And this one is full of Venezuelan oil. So why does the US get to seize all the oil too? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Anyway, Pam Bondi posted video on X. The oil boat maybe went to Iran before, so this is just fine? And an unnamed official claimed to the New York Times that the vessel was sailing under the flag of another Latin American nation in which it was not registered. If true, that is just like Russia has allegedly done at least 133 times that we know of to evade sanctions! But Trump would never dare. What has Trump ever gotten from NATO? Where is his Trump Tower Paris? Watch his baloney hole, if you can stand it: An interesting day, from the standpoint of news. “As you probably know, we have just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela, a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually, and other things are happening.” Trumptannia rules the waves! He does not sound all there. And oh hey, are we ever going to get video of those bombing survivors getting murdered, like Trump said? What about these Asian oil brokers, does he plan to pay them anything for bogarting their delivery? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ But Trump’s not taking the well-worn path America has usually taken to remove South American dictators! Coups and installing a puppet would be traditional, being much cheaper, faster and cleaner than murdering random innocent-until-proven-guilty people on tiny boats in international waters off of the coast (many who have turned out to not even be Venezuelan at all) in hopes that the dictator presidente will then step down out of sympathy, or something. But seems Trump doesn’t just want a new partner at the top, he wants a different sort of package entirely, details TBD. He seems particularly focused on the seas, in addition to the oil that will be a “field day” for American companies, obviously. Venezuela may not be a significant source of drugs to America, but being at the tippy-top of South America, it is one of the busiest waypoints for cocaine and heroin in the world, and is one of the busiest container ports for other goods, too, including oil. Money comes in, oil, opiates and heroin go out, that’s what running a port is all about! Why would Trump want a mere puppet, when he could occupy it all, and Venezuela will pay for it? Throw in collecting a toll at the Panama Canal, and Trump and friends like BlackRock could do grifts the likes of which the world has never seen, from most of the ship traffic in the hemisphere! But why won’t these unnamed White House sources specify what the plan is for after deposing Nicolás Maduro? A new election? Edmundo González, the apparent winner of the 2024 vote, returning from exile in Spain? Maybe Congress should try harder to find out. That vote on War Powers would be nice, too. Meanwhile, Americans are not fucking interested in whatever Trump’s got going on. In a CBS/YouGov poll a few weeks ago, only one in five had even heard that there was a military buildup in the first place. (These voters today, with their TikToks and their algorithms!) Once informed, two-thirds of Republicans said Trump needs to explain his actions. Independents were especially pissed, with 86 percent demanding an explanation. And 70 percent of all respondents opposed any kind of military action down there. What next in the old man’s all-to-real reality gameshow? Stay tuned, it’s sure to be full of more surprises!

Title: Trump Administration Joins EU in Russian Frozen Asset Madness
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/12/trump-administration-joins-eu-in-russian-frozen-asset-madness.html
Time Published: 2025-12-11T11:52:15Z
Full Content:
The level of derangement among far too many of our putative betters has reached such a fever pitch that mere narcissism and grandiosity seem inadequate as explanations. The latest example comes via the Wall Street Journal, in an exclusive account as to how the Trump Administration intends to avail itself of Russian central bank frozen assets, with the fig leaf that of course Russia would go along to curry favor with Trump and because investing in a busted up country is clearly a fabulous commercial opportunity. Let us not forget that the US tried a more adult version of this plan and got nowhere. It hired BlackRock as an adviser to flog a Ukraine reconstruction fund,1 back the days when the tale that Ukraine would win the war seems much more plausible, and got nowhere. The interesting angle here is that the US has pitched this goofy idea to EU officials, since they control the bulk of the frozen Russian central bank assets which has been reported most recently as €140 billion or more worth in Euroclear.2 Mind you, the Europeans, in the persons of European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, and her allies in planned Russian asset heist like Emmanuel Macron, Kier Starmer, Frederich Merz, and Kaja Kallas, are as deluded, but less flamboyantly so, since they are having to labor mightily to paint a veneer of legality over a theft that puts the budgets of EU member states in peril. Part of von der Leyen’s scheme is grandly to apportion liability to each and every member state that is made to participate in this heist, even if it is fiercely opposed. But back to the more obviously bonkers Trump plan. The Journal account suggests that the Trump plan to use Russia frozen assets in a US managed “fund” for Ukraine reconstruction, which was part of leaked 28 points plan, has set off the frenzy in European capitals to grab them pronto, before the US and Russia can come to an agreement….as if that were at all likely. From U.S. Blueprint to Rewire Economies of Russia, Ukraine Sets Off Clash With Europe: The Trump administration in recent weeks has handed its European counterparts a series of documents, each a single page, laying out its vision for the reconstruction of Ukraine and the return of Russia to the global economy… The U.S. blueprint has been spelled out in appendices to current peace proposals that aren’t public but were described to The Wall Street Journal by U.S. and European officials. The documents detail plans for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap roughly $200 billion of frozen Russian assets for projects in Ukraine—including a massive new data center to be powered by a nuclear plant currently occupied by Russian troops. Let’s stop here. The Zaporzhizhia nuclear power plant is not merely “currently occupied”. It is in one of the four oblasts that voted to join Russia and Russia, per its constitution, has made part of Russia. There is simply no way that the West is going to get use of it on anything other than arms-length commercial terms. Any discussion of power or reconstruction of Ukraine generally ignore the fact that no one other than Russia can execute it. Recall that Russia has already done considerable damage to not just Ukraine electricity transmission but increasing to generation as well. Ukraine’s grid runs on old Soviet standards, as does Russia now. Western businesses simply are not going to set up production capacity to make want amounts to a very large special order of the needed repair and replacement kit. Russian firms are in that business and could be persuaded or induced to gear up for the needed big but time-limited output surge. And of course there is the overriding highly optimistic assumption, that there will be an economically and politically independent Ukraine after the war. Ukraine and the EU are laboring mightily to make sure that does not happen. Their continued intransigence and belligerence have made the case to a highly risk-averse Putin that Russia will have to dictate outcomes on the battlefield. So the only question is how much Russia decides it has to add to Russia versus make into a rump Ukraine overseen by a friendly regime. Back to the Journal: Another appendix offers America’s broad-strokes vision for bringing Russia’s economy in from the cold, with U.S. companies investing in strategic sectors from rare-earth extraction to drilling for oil in the Arctic, and helping to restore Russian energy flows to Western Europe and the rest of the world. This is the worst sort of arrogant paternalism, as if Russia still needed the West. The quiet scandal in global economics: From 2008 to 2025, Russia’s real GDP per capita grew faster than Germany, the UK, and France despite sanctions, SWIFT bans, export controls, frozen assets and a full-scale geopolitical confrontation. pic.twitter.com/0C7ijjrCcc — . (@Lucid_Watcher) December 5, 2025 But not to worry, the Journal reassures us that Russia really is hurting: A new assessment by a Western intelligence agency, reviewed by the Journal, said that Russia has technically been in recession for six months and that the challenges of running its war economy while trying to control prices are presenting a systemic risk to its banking sector. One has to assume the Russian negotiators were also informed about this scheme (a version of this idea, but perhaps less detailed, was to be respectfully receptive when the US presented this asset, erm, usage plan, as opposed to bursting out laughing, or alternatively getting angry over being presumed to be total chumps. Returning to the Journal: Some European officials who have seen the documents said they weren’t sure whether to take some of the U.S. proposals seriously. One official compared them to President Trump’s vision of building a Riviera-style development in Gaza. Another, referring to the proposed U.S.-Russia energy deals, said it was an economic version of the 1945 conference where World War II victors divvied up Europe. “It’s like Yalta,” he said. Readers are encouraged to opine, but given the early similarly high-handed-while-also-barmy Ukraine “raw earths” scheme that the US browbeat Ukraine into accepting after some negotiation, yours truly thinks this is part of Team Trump following the Red Queen practice of working to believe impossible things. Such as: U.S. officials involved in the negotiations say Europe’s approach would quickly deplete the frozen funds. Washington, on the other hand, would tap Wall Street executives and private-equity billionaires to invest the money and expand the amount available to invest. One official involved in the talks said the pot could grow to $800 billion under American management. “Our sensibility is that we really understand financial growth,” the official said. Now to the European part. Ursula von der Leyen is attempting to ram through legislation that would allow the Commission to seize the frozen assets in Euroclear pursuant to emergency powers. Belgium has objected vociferously since it would be on the hook if Euroclear were sued successfully. The ECB has refused to provide a backstop: I asked ECB President Lagarde about the potential impact on financial stability of using Russian frozen assets held at Euroclear (140 billion). The ECB has (rightly) indicated that a guarantee would be a breach of the Treaty. Other options urgently needed for Ukraine👇 @wbeke pic.twitter.com/ih9j89n5GV — Dirk Gotink (@DirkGotink) December 3, 2025 Since Euroclear has also said in no uncertain terms that it thinks the asset heist, prettied up as trying to use the assets as collateral for loans, is illegal, I am not sure how it can be compelled to turn over the funds, given the general rule of “possession is 9/10 of the law” and the near-certainty that Euroclear and Belgium would seek an injunction too. ❗️Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever called the European Commission's proposal to use frozen Russian assets to provide Ukraine with a reparations loan “theft,” reports VRT NWS. “There are certainly better solutions than stealing the Russian central bank’s money. This is a… pic.twitter.com/KJR0mQWD5D — 🪖MilitaryNewsUA🇺🇦 (@front_ukrainian) December 10, 2025 Aside from Russia suing Euroclear in a non-EU court where Euroclear operates (readers can opine, but I see Singapore courts provide for discovery), Russia can also take matters into its own hands: One of the unintended consequences of the EU's batshit crazy plan of ̶s̶t̶e̶a̶l̶i̶n̶g̶ appropriating and repurposing Russia's frozen assets is the fact that Euroclear, a body responsible for processing equities, bonds, derivatives, and investment fund transfers, still holds… pic.twitter.com/6RHLDTpjEk — Nina 🐙 Byzantina (@NinaByzantina) December 10, 2025 But weirdly (or perhaps following its friends at the Commission) the Financial Times in a story yesterday tried to make Hungary’s Viktor Orban, regularly demonized for being too friendly with Russia, into the bad guy. From a Wednesday story: EU countries are to fast-track a decision to indefinitely immobilise up to €210bn in Russian sovereign assets, in an attempt to bypass Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán even before Europe’s leaders meet for a summit next week. The hurried effort to pass the legislation — which invokes emergency powers to override national vetoes on the extension of sanctions — aims to protect Brussels’ leverage in US-led peace talks over the war in Ukraine, according to officials familiar with the plans. Diplomats handling the legislation see advantage in moving swiftly in coming days to detach the contentious question of immobilising assets from the debate on raising loans for Kyiv backed by the frozen Russian funds. That funding question will be left to EU leaders next week. The move to vote within the coming week, overriding the principle of unanimity on sanctions decisions, risks enraging Hungary and other countries that oppose the measure. Past instances of EU countries outvoting other member states on critical issues — such as Poland and Hungary on migration policy — have caused bad blood between capitals for years. The European Commission last week proposed using €210bn of Russia’s foreign assets immobilised under sanctions in the EU to fund a loan to Kyiv, initially for €90bn that would be disbursed in the next two years. For the loan scheme to work, the underlying assets need to be immobilised indefinitely, rather than for six-month periods that can only be renewed with unanimous agreement of all EU27 countries… To bypass the risk of the sanctions being lifted, the commission has proposed using emergency powers reserved for dealing with economic crises to indefinitely impose the sanctions on the assets. Enacted under Article 122 of the EU’s treaties, it can be passed with just a majority of EU countries, circumventing potential vetoes. Mind you, there is no crisis. There will be a tsunami of litigation if the Commission and its allies manage to get this scheme implemented. And there would be a crisis due to their malfeasance if the plaintiffs were to prevail. So the plan is use emergency powers to contend with the emergency knowingly produced by entirely voluntary action decried by those best in the know (Euroclear) as illegal. Alexander Mercouris covered the circularity of this argument in his video on Wednesday, and earlier argued that the loud and clear objections by Euroclear and the Belgian government would be powerful ammo in litigation over any seizure attempt. As an aside, one has to think that a and perhaps the reason that Ursula von der Leyen has pursued this scheme so manically is that it is far and away her best opportunity to greatly expand the Commission’s powers. She’s been on a massive land grab ever since she took office. This morning’s Politico European newsletter seemed less bullish than the prior day pink paper account, and also corrected the barmy idea that Orban was the big baddie: GROUNDHOG DAY ENVOYS DISCUSS ASSETS SUPERFREEZE: EU ambassadors will today weigh up whether to hand the Commission emergency powers to keep Russia’s state assets frozen indefinitely. Envoys will examine updated legal texts after Wednesday’s inconclusive discussion, three EU diplomats told POLITICO’s Gregorio Sorgi. What’s that: The mechanism is a cornerstone of the Commission’s plan to mobilize €210 billion in frozen Russian assets for Ukraine — most of which are held by the Belgian-based Euroclear. It would overhaul the current system that compels EU countries to unanimously reauthorize the sanctions every six months. That means Kremlin-friendly countries such as Hungary and Slovakia would lose the power to release the sanctioned money with a simple no vote, leaving EU capitals on the hook to repay the loan to Russia. The light at the end of the tunnel: The diplomats said late Wednesday that the proposal could be “stripped down” in a bid to win Belgium’s support and adopt the plan by the end of the week. Hopefully. Yes, it’s still all about Belgium: PM Bart De Wever is holding out over concerns that Belgium could be financially exposed if the money needs to be repaid and has now asked for more safety nets. In an interview with VRT NWS Wednesday, De Wever even refused to rule out legal action if the EU moves ahead with seizing the assets… More stick than carrot: Europe’s strategy to sway Belgium may be to warn the kingdom that it could be treated like Hungary if it doesn’t come on board — with its diplomats, ministers and officials losing their voice around the EU table, reports Zoya Sheftalovich. The Politico entry contains this amusing section: . “No jurisdiction”: A legal memo circulated among diplomats Wednesday by law firm Covington & Burling rejects Belgium’s argument that it would face major legal retaliation from Russia. The four-page document says the risk of litigation is “minimal,” insisting Russia wouldn’t be able to challenge an EU reparations loan in the International Criminal Court or “any comparable international adjudicative body.” Legally-sophisticated readers know that if you look long enough, you can find a lawyer who will bless pretty much anything.3 And I don’t think of Covington as premier firm in financial or international litigation. I would have thought one of the top New York “white shoe” or London firms would be the go-tos on this topic. A ranking by Chambers of US firms alone for Disputes (International & Cross-Border) | Global of US firms confirms this notion, putting Covington well down on the list. I hope our expert commentariat will pipe up with their views. Even though von der Leyen and her fellow conspirators are laboring mightily to get her long-sought “seize not freeze” scheme across the line, note the Politico signposting: Groundhog Day. They are of the view this will be another episode of motion playing at progress. But even then, simply keeping the matter in play bolsters Zelensky domestically, as in continuing to keep alive the fantasy that there will be more money and weapons for Ukraine. European leaders are as committed as every to fighting to the last Ukrainian. _____ 1 BlackRock never committed to invest in this scheme, contrary to some claims. 2 The total amount reported has varied, in part because the EU has been stealing the interest, and some accounts may include the assets of sanctioned Russian entities and individuals along with the central bank holdings. The Financial Times on Wednesday reported that Euroclear held €185 billion of Russian frozen assets. 3 For instance, recall Linklaters blessing Lehman’s use of Repo 105 to engage in accounting fraud, which pretty much every legally responsible adult derided when it became public. Just a little quibble: “Ukraine’s grid runs on old Soviet standards, as does Russia now. Western businesses simply are not going to set up production capacity to make want amounts to a very large special order of the needed repair and replacement kit. Russian firms are in that business and could be persuaded or induced to gear up for the needed big but time-limited output surge.” Crazy but true: I happen to know for a fact that ABB (a company headquartered in Switzerland but production mostly in the EU) delivers huge amounts of electrical equipment to Russia. Supposedly the delivery is to Hungary or Switzerland. As an insider joke workers in Germany put a “Z” on deliveries to Russia. Mind you: industrial workers in Germany vote 50% for AFD. With a little modification anything produced for the European grid will also work in Russia. What do you mean by “electrical equipment”? That covers a multitude of sins. I have been told the reverse as far as the transformers are concerned. Ukraine was having to scavenge former Warsaw Pact states for replacements early in the electricity war. They would presumably not have needed to do so if they could be manufactured readily by friendlies. Apparently most utilities do have a lot of spares, they are pretty long-lived, so it may be only with the increased intensification of the grid attacks that Ukraine is now short on/out of gear. There are no transformers on the market. Not for Ukraine and not for anybody. Delivery times are in years. The reason being the expansion of the grid caused by renewables. ABB is delivering all kinds of electrical fuses. Which shows the Russian market is humming. Lot’s of building as a few hundred thousand soldiers from formerly depressed areas are getting huge payments for serving in Ukraine. When you look at Russia war you should look at Russia casualty rate. That will say how long Russia can continue this war until Russia people start feel pain. We also have to count how long can people afford 16% interested rate. I still don’t get how that central bank can still keep her job. Russia have lost about 100k soldiers and same amount of injured. All this spell Russia will accept USA peace deal but the only stopping it is Ukraine. Putin was wrong in his calculation that he would get a good deal from USA by dragging this war slowly Russia regards this war as existential. So your metrics do not apply. Look as WWII for how much pain Russia can take, This conflict is not in the same universe. I doubt that Russia could take as much pain as in WWII. Already 20 years ago every conscript was given a SIM card so he could phone home to mom once a week. Inconceivable in Stalin times. But Russia doesn´t have to take such pain. The “kontraktniki” are paid handsomely. There are no conscripts at the front. Another story is that it is the ethnic minorities and the poor (which mostly overlap) that are doing the dying. Not your single son of a middle class family in Moscow or St. Petersburg. Russia is closer to us than we think. Another story is that it is the ethnic minorities and the poor (which mostly overlap) that are doing the dying. Not your single son of a middle class family in Moscow or St. Petersburg. This is based on purposeful reading of the statistics, by comparing the percentage of kontraktniki of the eligible population of the region. In the reality, Moscow and St. Petersburg regions provide the bulk of the contract soldiers – as in several hundred thousand, just because they are so huge population centers. Especially after the liberation of the Kursk oblast the St. Petersburg region has constantly exceeded it’s recruitment quota. Also, at least a year or two ago, several Duma members, governors, mayors and other members of regional administration volunteered for the SMO. Mostly those with military experience, but anyway. You’re right this war is existential for Russia, and I think a lot of Russian people have come to that conclusion, including the young soldiers fighting on the front lines. But is the war being fought as if it were existential for Russia? In my view, no. Two strategies come to mind one where Putin forces the Russian population to accept a Minsk style peace deal, or another where Putin believes the West will eventually come to the negotiating table to agree on a new security arrangement. A new security deal won’t happen but Russia might be able to secure a Minsk 3 agreement with the USA However, the EU and the UK would never allow that to happen. This war will likely drag on until the Democrats return to power in the USA There’s no way the Republicans will hold onto the House or the Senate. So now you have an EU implementing austerity on steroids just so it can keep sending billions to Ukraine, and the USA doing the same. Scott Ritter said just a few days ago that Ukraine will collapse soon and its people will freeze but none of that really matters, because for Russia to capitalize on such a collapse, it would need the troops to actually take Ukraine. And right now, Russia doesn’t have those troops. Nor will the Ukrainian population rise up in support. Instead, everyone will either wait their turn to be sent to the front or try to escape the country. I just think people are struggling to accept what’s coming because it’s so unprecedented. I hope you’re right but sadly, I fear we’re heading toward a very dark place in this world. I may be wrong, but I think this is the consequence of the lesser evil strategy finally coming home to roost. These politicians in the west they have no morals. So US sued for peace after Antietam, I guess? All this spell … … differently in Cyrillic. They even have a word meaning non-agreement-capable*. * See for example https://www.moonofalabama.org/2022/06/how-russia-can-and-will-de-nato-size-europe.html The retaliatory response of Russia confiscating European assets would be an adequate deterrent to the theft of Russian funds if the EU leaders were sane, but that is a big if. If I were Belgium (things you never thought you’d write!), I would seize the Russian assets *and* European Commission assets to the same value as collateral for the indemnity *and* the Euroclear and SWIFT servers and IT personnel for long enough to place them under Belgian control. When the rules are broken, the rules are broken and all that counts is leverage. Remember poor Greece and its attempt to leave the Euro Hotel California? No leverage. But controlling Euroclear would give Belgium the next best leverage to controlling Target 2…. Since an ongoing fantasy about Russia is to crash Putin’s credibility in his home country, via tempting Putin to go along with US/European schemes, Trump’s home peanut gallery wants to pretend that Ukraine is close to victory… a song that is sung by the media (and arms merchants) that have played along for so long. After all, having pushed Ukraine into suicidal choices, don’t “we” the West owe Ukraine and ourselves some dignity amidst the rubble? Well, The Financial Times is not alone on demonizing Orban (no matter if he is good or bad I am not opining on this) put he is the preferred excuse for many to stay silent when in reality they do not align with the General Stupidity now in charge. Today I found an article written by a retired Spanish councelor for the EU titled “Europe and The Accounting Miracle of The Century: The “Reparation Loan” and Other Legal Fictions” (in Spanish) which explains the (false) equilibriums that the EU pursues to seize the Russian assets while at the same time claiming they are not touching them and at the same time assuming fiscal obligations for EU countries which are out of EU’s reach and treaties. This is all incredible stupid and there are many more governments (more than Just Orban’s) which are absolutely not wanting to become indebted for this unlimited support to Zelenski. I would mention the Spanish government even if they do not say it when being forced to reduce debt and at the same time being wanted to increase debt… because Zelenski. If somehow the EU Commission manages to force their financial games I anticipate this as the beginning of the end of the EU. I guess we will know by the 18th of December. The interesting angle here is that the US has pitched this goofy idea to EU officials, since they control the bulk of the frozen Russian central bank assets which has been reported most recently as 140 billion euros worth in Euroclear. The timing coming so soon after the Belgians took fright at the seizure means this is probably an effort to cajole them with a US blessing. Now the real question is: Is the EU/UK trying to bribe Trump to support the asset seizure, or in reality was the asset seizure a US lead directive all along? Sorry, this is an incorrect reading. 1. The US wants Russia to contribute Russian assets, not steal them, so there would be no risk to Brussels if Russia goes along. 2. The EU is opposed to this scheme. This is off point utterly to what the EU intends. It wants the money to be used to continue the war. Does anyone have figures for the Russian assets owned by US, European and other investors at the time of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? Many of which are now likewise frozen, and written down, but have great underlying value if not endangered by the proposed theft? The lack of discussion ofwhat is at stake for western investors (including pensioners & other indirect holders) seems extraordinary. I hate sounding harsh, but you are awfully late to that party. And you seem to be suggesting that was Russia that could or did take hostile action, when Russia bent over backwards in the early years of the SMO not to abrogate agreements with the West. For instance, Russia kept supplying the EU with gas until the EU made it a point of pride to go without. It was the US, EU and UK investors that imposed shock and awe sanctions in February 2022. Western owners of Russian securities and ETFs at the time were very shortly barred from trading. Their balances were written down to zero at US brokerage firms. Now there has been wrangling about recovery. For instance, the BlackRock Russia ETF is trying to complete its liquidation by year end. It last traded at $8.06 but I cannot tell quickly how much investors recovered: https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/239677/ishares-msci-russia-capped-etf#/ As a holder of Gazprom, Sberbank and Polyus, not only frozen and effectively zero, but getting none of the dividends as well. There was a point I believe, where sale at a huge discount was possible to a too big to fail bank that was allowed to keep access to the Moscow exchange. What Covington does a heck of lot of in Brussels is lobbying, esp. on behalf of tech giants. To my eyes, that’s what’s behind the stupid memo. Mutual hand-washing. Aha! Thanks! …Kaja Kallas, are as deluded, but less flamboyantly so, since they are having to labor mightily to paint a veneer of legality over a theft that puts the budgets of EU member states in jeopardy. Part of von der Leyen’s scheme is grandly to apportion liability to each and every member state that is made to participate in this heist, even if it is fiercely opposed. And Italy’s share of the estimated 185 billion euro at Euroclear would come to some 25 billion euro. YS: I add a couple-a edits, with your indulgence. First, I’ll add the polite word “jeopardy” instead of “pasticciaccio,” that is, omnishambles. Second, I’m reading here in Italy the figure of 185 billions euros parked at Euroclear, too, which may come from Financial Times (or another source). What is this current bout of tripping over one’s wee-wee to wreck things stemming from? As Yves Smith has consistently pointed out, as well as the other writers at Naked Capitalism, what we are now witnessing is elites running helter-skelter to try to cover up their complicity and criminality in the proxy war in Ukraine (one million dead Ukrainians, mainly men sent to the slaughter) and the genocide in Palestine (minimum acceptable estimate, in my not so humble opinion, is 400 000 slaughtered in the West Bank and Gaza). Here in Italy, the formidable philosopher Donatella di Cesare and ex-ambassador Elena Basile have been elaborating the same line of thinking. So we have a case of convergent evolution (take that, anti-Darwinists): Trump and von der Leyen are acting pretty much alike. The law is for the little people. Their carefully defined constitutional roles don’t matter anymore — what matters is our chance to witness their lust for power. Hmmm. I wonder if Dr. Guillotine’s marvelous invention can be trundled out for a double salami slicing. Or am I overestimating the severity of the symptom? (To which I will add in my argument for failed elites avoiding consequences Hillary Clinton’s recent spewings, Marco Rubio and resentments, the timeless Kaja Kallas, Pete Hegseth, Mark Rutte, and the thoroughly egregious Friedrich Merz.) PS: I am no fan of Vladimir Putin, but the line chart of GDP growth explains much. Not to be overlooked. Is Covington & Burling a premier firm in international litigation? And does their listing as a Band Four national firm on the Chambers list support that they are not? I don’t know who at Covington wrote the memo referenced above and I haven’t read the memo. That being said I worked at Covington as a litigator and at one of the higher ranked firms listed on the Chambers ranking for international litigation. I’ve also advised law firms about how to be recognized by Chambers, both as law firms and as individual attorneys (which Chambers also ranks). My overwhelming experience is that any firm mentioned by Chambers and many law firms not recognized by Chambers do very careful work, especially when litigation departments send memos about the law to clients. Covington has been around since 1919. If their lawyers write a memo that they think the risk of litigation is low because of lack of jurisdiction, there is a very high probability that there is at least a colorable argument supporting that conclusion. That doesn’t mean the conclusion in the memo will prove correct, but it is unlikely to be just made up to tell a client what it wants to hear. And there is no difference between a Band One firm and a Band Four firm in Chambers in this regard. Chambers has its quirks, but it’s people interview law firm clients as the basis of creating their rankings. If you are a band four firm nationally in a given practice area, that means you are in the top 10 to 15 firms in the whole country. That is a signal to in-house lawyers at large corporate law departments that you are very good in that practice area. Again I don’t know specifics about this particular memo, but it’s a stretch to conclude that a law firm just manufactured a legal opinion desired by a client because of its Chambers ranking. Band 4 out of 5 is low, not high, relative to the other big firms. It means they are in the running as a reasonable choice and might be good on a horses-for-course basis All the firms in the higher bands are above them. And the ranking was for what amounted to their international practice compared to other big US firms, not international litigation and not international financial service. As indicated there are very strong UK firms in international legal works, such as Freshfields in arbitration And I have been a Covington client, as in I retained them when I was head of M&A at Sumitomo. They are not all that strong in litigation. There are specialist firms (and not small ones, BTW) that are the killers in that field. You asked for the commentariat to provide perspective on your comment about Covington’s litigation prowess. So, I did. I understand that, based on your experience as a client of the firm, you weren’t that impressed. Suffice it so say that some folks have reached a different conclusion. Their litigation department has been recognized many times as an elite department. See, e.g.: https://www.cov.com/en/about/firm-honors None of this speaks directly to the specific memo that was referenced in the post above. I asked for reader experience. You did not indicate you had any as a client and instead tried to argue from the same link I provided. You did not even bother finding other sources that could perhaps be more germane. You are not in a position to judge Covington on any sort of comparative performance basis as an ex-employee. Chambers is limited, as I indicated, by covering only US law firms. My gut is London being a much more international finance center (and also having until recently been in the Union) would be more likely to have the best counsel for this sort of matter. I did not say I was not impressed. I was a client of Gene Ludwig, who I imagine you have heard of. I went to Covington rather than a NYC firm because I knew a Japanese bank would be way down the food chain for a white shoe NYC firm while Covington would (and did) value having Sumitomo as a client more than they would have. So I got a good seasoned M&A partner while with a NYC firm, I would be at risk of being fobbed largely off on a 5 year associate. I knew generally that what I needed ought to be within their capabilities. And they did a fine job on my particular matter. Being good in one area (negotiating a fairly simple but cross border M&A deal) does not extend to other areas. They ran up a huge and unwarranted bill on some international tax structuring, basically reinventing the wheel. The awards list you linked to prove my point, not yours. The awards were nearly all onesies, from years back and very narrow sub-fields of litigation. I have also had the privilege of sometimes working with top M&A and securities lawyers (the top M&A counsel at Cleary and Cravath, Rodgin Cohen at S&C before he became managing partner, for instance) and so know what a very top tier counsel looks like. And so I have also been lucky enough to occasionally find less illustrious representation that was excellent, such as a biomedical engineer who first worked at the NIH and drafted the first US intellectual property agreement. 80% of her language is still in use. Later general counsel at a public company, so both 3/4 of the way to being a securities lawyer as well as an IP lawyer. Drafting a bit rough but effective, and a fantastic negotiator. No you did not ask for reader experience with Covington, you asked “I hope our expert commentariat will pipe up with their views.” Well EnigmaWrappedInBacon piped up with their views. You may not agree with them but they did specifically what you asked and you jumped down their throat. Not to doubt your comment or Covington’s expertise, but Covington has represented Ukraine and Ukrainian companies in disputes with Russia. I assume they wrote the memo for Ukraine that wants reparations, not for Everclear or European companies or banks that might be on the hook if Covington’s opinion is wrong. No, please re-read the Politico quote. It was very clearly about the Euroclear fracas, see the reference to the ICC, which would never come up in a commercial dispute. In keeping, it also referenced the Russian state retaliating, not corporate entities. But that is another useful tidbit on Covington. Putting aside the fact that this whole scheme doesn’t make much sense, I could see a reason for Russia to go along with it (or at least not oppose it publicly). They’ve already likely written off those assets and if this works out to be a “free” card to play to deal with Trump, why not. It would also create even more conflict between the US and the EU because they both want the assets for their own goals. Alexander Mercouris has said the reverse, that informed contacts have told him it would suit Russia for the West to seize the assets because they could very legitimately make a monster stink, which would create more sympathy in the Global South. Recall that one big reason Russia has had to go slowly in the war is not just its practice of attrition (that is the big driver) but also that its economic allies are not happy with Russia gobbling up Ukraine, no matter how legitimate the reasons, and would prefer a negotiated settlement. The seizure would be further grist for the case that the West is untrustworthy, does not respect agreements, and there is therefore no sound basis for trying to reach a settlement with them. Tweets in May (with links to sites in Asia) said Russia was contemplating suing Euroclear in Hong Kong. See also: Euroclear has refused to comply with any plan to hand over frozen Russian assets for use by the EU. The company maintains that such a move would amount to confiscation, with major legal and financial risks, and insists it doesn’t have a procedure for it. https://t.co/myGzF8ZyNx — Nynke Feenstra (@DutchMindset) December 9, 2025 The seizure would be further grist for the case that the West is untrustworthy, does not respect agreements, and there is therefore no sound basis for trying to reach a settlement with them. The Western countries have been doing a bang-up job making this case themselves throughout their entire histories! Everyone from native Americans in the 1600s forward can help testify to this case if it’s needed. Ultimately, I don’t know because I don’t know what Russian officials are thinking. It’s just that using those assets to damage relations between the EU and the US could be a viable option. We’ve seen public statements threatening legal action (or worse) over EU confiscation, but nothing (yet?) about the US “proposal”. Maybe they just don’t take it seriously or maybe it suits Russia just fine to have the US and EU fighting over that money. Personally I have lost track of the number of loans that have been taken out using the interest of those frozen Russian assets as collateral. It was like every month a new loan like this was being made. So of course the Europeans will not allow those assets to be swiped by the Americans – nor will the Russians. About half would be used in repairing the damage in the Ukraine and a red line for Russia is “reparations.” The Russians will have to spend huge amounts of money to rebuild the Donbass alone. And if Donny thinks that the Russians will hand over one of their major power plants, well, America is more likely to hand over one of theirs to the Russians. I think that Jared Kushner had a big role to play in that so called peace plan as it tries to make sure that America in the end wins this conflict while making huge pots of money. for Trump and his team, it is always about making money and nothing else exists. Politico yesterday had the following explication: According to the document, the extra cash buffer [for Belgium] should be financed by the windfall profits that Euroclear collects in interest from a deposit account at the European Central Bank, where the Kremlin-sanctioned money is currently sitting. The proceeds amounted to €4 billion last year. The bulk of this revenue is currently being funneled to Ukraine to pay down a €45 billion loan from G7 countries, with Euroclear retaining a 10 percent buffer to cover legal risks. In order to better protect Euroclear, Belgium wants to raise this threshold over the coming years. So if Politico’s read of it is right, there is no “loan” backed by the interest on Russian assets. Rather, the interest is taken directly (legal mavens may chime in on whether this constitutes theft) to pay for some other extant obligation. To G7, so the Americans are getting some of that money too… That whole last paragraph is utterly fascinating. Starting with the fact that Euroclear is already building up a contingency reserve for “legal risks”, which is kind of telling in and of itself. Parenthetically. I know everyone’s been focused on the possibility of a lawsuit against Euroclear. I seem to recall the Russian government, possibly in the form of Lavrov, dropping an off-hand comment recently that European private companies still have several hundred billion euros worth of assets inside Russia. Meaning, a reciprocal action could be the seizure of these assets (I assume a majority of these are equity stakes in joint ventures or Russian subsidiaries). Yet it seems the European business community is utterly silent on the question, at least in public. Do they simply not want to admit that these assets still exist? Do they hope and pray that the Russians would exercise leniency and go after Belgium and Euroclear instead (which they very well might)? Is this simply yet another completely, utterly unexpected and thoroughly surprising move that no-one ever expects the Russians to make? Who knows… “Yet it seems the European business community is utterly silent on the question, at least in public.” This is a continuation of an attitude that the European business community adopted almost a decade ago. It was silent on the question of Brexit — despite all the evidence that the way the British government was mishandling matters would have devastating consequences (practical, commercial, financial). It was silent when the EU forced the renunciation of Russian energy imports (oil, gas, coal), and silent when Nord Stream pipelines were sabotaged — despite knowing very well the devastating consequences all this would entail regarding energy prices and the availability of raw materials for industrial processes. There was the supine way the EU reacted to the tariffs imposed by Trump, and no big outcry from the business community — if there was one, I do not remember it to be followed by concerted actions to put pressure on the EU Commission and on the European governments. Now it is again silent while the EU considers measures that will entail not only dire losses regarding investments in Russia, but also the ruin of Europe as an international financial centre (plus a possible collapse of the €). My opinion has always been that large, internationally active firms do not care — they will just relocate their activities somewhere else if conditions become unbearable; they do not have any loyalty to Europe anyway — while SMEs lack influence — they are too small to lobby successfully when governments only take big players seriously. But this is now going a bit far. No matter what foolishly destructive measures the politicos envision, industrial, commercial, and financial circles never put their foot down; it is getting very disconcerting. What I’m wondering is that in 2022 it was reported that most of those Russian assets were debt securities (likely Eurobonds), so basically IOUs by EU, not actual money. How much has this changed in a few years, I can’t seem to find out. Anyway, to me it seems that Eurozone countries not honoring their debts would cause even more economic havoc than just breaking the Euroclear and the kingdom of Belgium or the Russian countermeasures. High quality bonds are financial assets and easily monetized. I don’t understand your point. In general, large balances are put into securities. A bank deposit is a liability of the bank and is also not money. It’s guaranteed only up to very low limits. Depositaries like Euroclear and the US DTC (Depositary Trust Company) are full of securities, not cash balances. My point is that if we’re talking about debt owed to Russia by, say, EU Commission and some Eurozone countries, and they now go and decide they will just resell this debt and take the money, it’s not just theft of Russian assets, but also defaulting on the “original” debt. I really, really don’t know how this works (thus the word “wondering” in the original post), but if this is as I understood, would there really be market for bonds under such a serious legal predicament? And given the risk, I’d assume they’d have to be (re)sold with a significant undervaluation. No, Eurobonds are not “debt owed to Russia”. They are bonds that Russia bought. The EU Commission does not issue bonds. Nor does Europe. Eurobonds are issued both by companies, banks, and states. They are legal obligations to pay interest and principal irrespective of who owns them at the time. That is why seizing them from Euroclear = stealing. EU Commission indeed issues bonds. The European Commission is empowered by the EU Treaties to borrow from the international capital markets on behalf of the European Union. It is a well-established name in debt securities markets, with a strong track record of successful bond issuances over the past 40 years. All EU-Bond issuances executed by the European Commission are denominated exclusively in euro. The estimated value of the outstanding bonds is €1 trillion for the Commission alone. Another trillion of outstanding bonds has been issued by other EU institutions, according to CEPR. I expect that RU has long ago written off those frozen central bank assets (which is not to say that RU won’t litigate ferociously to get them back…..even if RU loses in court, the bad publicity surrounding the litigation might cause irreparable damage to the EU). Seizing and spending the stolen assets (assuming weapons and the trained UKR manpower to use them are readily available, which I very much doubt) will only serve to prolong the conflict for a few more months. The real issue here is the potential long-term consequence to the EU if Ursula succeeds in grabbing (and spending) RU’s money. I think the reputational damage will be enormous. Of course Ursula (et al) will be long gone by the time the legal chickens come home to roost (the wheels of justice grind slowly), so she likely doesn’t care. This does not bode well, methinks. No, see the comment above re what Mercouris’ sources say. Russia has every incentive to litigate for geopolitical reasons. Look at how (in a very different sort of case) the US tried to prosecute Internet Research Agency, the bot farm part or totally owed by Prigozhin, that famously won the 2016 election for Trump with $200,000 of Facebook ads…half of which appeared after election day and 25% of which were viewed by no one. The DoJ filed criminal charges v. the IRA to advance its Russiagate narrative (I forget whether v. individuals or the company). They showed up to defend the case. The DoJ immediately dropped it. So as the Covington memo suggests, methinks the Eurocrats are similarly over-relying on the idea that the Russian government or individuals won’t act. Oh, of course RU will litigate; perhaps I wasn’t clear enough. My point was that they will do so not in any expectation of getting their assets back, but simply for the fun of it (knowing that the awful publicity will torch the EU’s reputation and cause dissension both inside the EU, and between the EU and the USA). Shredding western unity (and possibly shattering the EU itself) is arguably worth more to RU than 200bn clams (or whatever the exact amount is), and in any case RU will offset much of this 200bn loss by seizing EU assets inside RU. has anyone in he west calculated the value of western assets in Russia that could be seized in retaliation for this bizarre scheme? it can’t be a small number. “The documents detail plans for U.S. financial firms and other businesses to tap roughly $200 billion of frozen Russian assets for projects in Ukraine—including a massive new data center to be powered by a nuclear plant currently occupied by Russian troops.” As if, after all of this, the first thing on the minds of the people remaining in Ukraine is some damn data center. Putin signed a decree in 2024 that allows Russians to claim US assets in Russia, if Russian assets were seized by any member of the G7. Some online estimates (no link) have been as high as $1 Trillion. Aha, good intel! But not European? I believe the decree in question obligated the government to prepare legislation to allow Russian subjects who’s property or assets have been confiscated by a G7 country to go to a Russian court to receive compensation from similar property or assets of the said country’s subjects holding within Russian jurisdiction. Sort of a counter to the REPO act, but covering all G7 countries and over $80 worth invested in Russia by them. And right on cue, the Central Bank of Russia today announced it is suing Euroclear in the Moscow Court of Arbitration for recovery of losses caused by action of Euroclear.

Sputnik News 20251210 MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Negotiations on the Ukraine settlement revolve around discussions on three documents, namely a US-proposed peace plan, a security guarantees agreement, and an economic recovery plan for the post-conflict period, The Washington Post newspaper reported, citing US and Ukrainian officials. The talks remain far from concluded, the report said on Tuesday. Ukraine and its European allies plan to present further revisions to the plan on Wednesday, it added. Additionally, US officials are in discussions with Larry Fink, CEO of financial giant BlackRock, about reviving the company's proposal for a Ukrainian reconstruction fund that could raise $400 billion, The Washington Post reported. The World Bank may also be involved, the report said. Since mid-November, the US has been promoting a new peace proposal for Ukraine. On December 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin received US special envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in the Kremlin. The US representatives' visit to Russia was related to the discussion of the US peace plan for Ukraine. US President Donald Trump said later that he was disappointed that Volodymyr Zelenskyy had not read the peace proposal for the Ukraine conflict. On Tuesday, the Financial Times newspaper reported that Witkoff and Kushner gave Zelenskyy "days" to come up with a response to the peace plan. Zelenskyy reportedly told his European allies that Witkoff and Kushner pressured him during a two-hour phone call on Saturday to respond to the plan that demands Kiev accept territorial losses in exchange for US security guarantees, with Trump aiming to finalize the deal "by Christmas."

Title: Ukraine Considers Legal Path To Elections Under Martial Law As US Pushes For Vote

By RFE/RL December 11, 2025 President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he held a "substantive discussion" with members of Ukraine's parliament on the possibility of holding an election, amid pressure from the United States to hold a vote despite wartime legal restrictions. Addressing Ukrainians in a nightly video on December 10, Zelenskyy said strong security guarantees from Kyiv's allies -- especially Washington -- are needed to hold a vote. "If partners, including our key partner in Washington, speak so much and so specifically about elections in Ukraine, about elections under martial law, then we must provide legal Ukrainian answers to every question and every doubt," he said, responding to a suggestion by US President Donald Trump that Kyiv was using the war as an excuse to avoid elections. "It is not easy, but pressure on this issue is definitely not what we need...Security challenges depend on partners, primarily America. Political and legal challenges must be answered by Ukraine. And they will be," he added. The White House has been pushing for Ukraine to hold elections -- US President Donald Trump told Politico in an interview published on December 9 that "it's time"-- even though Ukraine's constitution doesn't allow for elections during wartime. In a shift from previous statements, Zelenskyy told reporters on December 9 that he would push parliament to draft legislation allowing for elections during martial law. A vote could follow in 60 to 90 days once there are security guarantees in place to make sure voting would be safe for Ukrainians. Zelenskyy's comments come amid intense negotiations aimed at ending Russia's all-out war on Ukraine, launched in February 2022. Ukrainian officials have been pushing back on a US-drafted peace plan that was seen as heavily favoring Russia. The possibility of holding elections has been regularly dismissed, with officials saying it would be impossible given daily Russian air strikes across the country, thousands of soldiers battling on the front lines, and millions of Ukrainians displaced. Opinion polls show most Ukrainians are against holding wartime elections, though with the last elections held in 2019 some want changes in the government to bring in fresh ideas. Widely popular, Zelenskyy's support has slipped in recent weeks amid a major corruption scandal that led to the resignation of an influential adviser, Andriy Yermak. On the battlefield and in negotiations, Russian officials believe they have the upper hand, and the 28-point plan proposed by the United States echoes most of the hard-line positions that Moscow has held since before the invasion. Ukraine's European allies, meanwhile, have been unenthusiastic about Washington's proposal. Before a planned meeting between the so-called Coalition of the Willing -- which includes Germany, France, Britain -- with Zelenskyy on December 11, leaders from the three countries held a phone call with Trump. Trump said said he exchanged "pretty strong words" with the leaders of France, Britain and Germany over Ukraine, another sign of a widening rift on how to end the war as it nears its fourth anniversary. "We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words," Trump told reporters when asked about the call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany Chancellor Friedrich Merz. "I think we had some little disputes about people, and we're going to see how it turns out. And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things," Trump added, noting the European countries talked about meeting this weekend in Europe. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said Ukraine had agreed on key points of a possible reconstruction plan in discussions with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other senior officials, including Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. "The principles of the economic document are completely clear and we are fully aligned with the American side," Zelenskyy said. "An important common principle is that for reconstruction to be of high quality and economic growth after this war to be tangible, real security must be at the core. When there is security, everything else is there too." Zelenskyy wrote earlier that he and and his European partners will soon present the United States with "refined documents" on the peace plan as well. There have been several major sticking points in the back-and-forth negotiations including the size of Ukraine's armed forces, Western security guarantees, and Russia's insistence that Ukraine be permanently barred from seeking NATO membership. The White House peace proposal, and the belief that it heavily favors Russian interests, has drawn criticism from some Republican lawmakers in Congress. President Vladimir Putin "is mocking President Trump and buying time to keep killing Ukrainian families," Representative Joe Wilson said.

Title: Bitcoin dips after Fed’s 25 bps cut – Is BTC’s 2026 rally at risk?

Weak bids and macro volatility cloud Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. The market is taking the Federal Reserve’s move with cautious optimism. The recent 25 bps rate cut to 3.50–3.75% by the Fed on the 10th of December marks the third cut of 2025. Consequently, traders are now eyeing a potential liquidity boost, putting Bitcoin [BTC] back on the radar. But that’s not all. One key point in the Fed’s statement is that they’ll start buying $40 billion in U.S. T-bills over the next thirty days. By doing this, the Fed injects extra short-term liquidity back into the banking system. Source: X Simply put, the U.S. economy is about to get a fresh wave of liquidity. With another 25 bps rate cut and $40 billion in Treasury bill buys from financial institutions, the Federal Reserve is clearly trying to push cheaper capital back into the system as labor-market risks start creeping higher. And yet, BTC has reacted with a 2.14% dip, breaking below $90k. Notably, this move is no fluke. The Fed may be boosting short-term liquidity, but it’s also stirring concern about longer-term risks, especially as markets start pricing in a pause in rate cuts heading into 2026. It appears investors were already prepared for Bitcoin’s volatility. From mining firms to BlackRock, millions in BTC were unloaded ahead of the FOMC. With inflation still running hot and the Fed split on how aggressively to cut rates next year, investors are clearly staying cautious. And that caution isn’t misplaced. Over the last four FOMC meetings, Bitcoin has repeatedly pulled back. In fact, after the October FOMC, BTC slid almost 30% to $80k, marking its first major flash crash of 2025. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) Against this setup, the question remains: Is history about to repeat itself? A recent Glassnode report highlights weak bids around $90k, reinforcing the cautious sentiment. Add aggressive selling by smart money, and Bitcoin is clearly in a supply-skewed setup, signaling potential downside pressure. Looking ahead, BTC’s base-building for a Q1 2026 rally is still uncertain. With investors reshuffling, macro volatility lingering, and weak FOMO, Bitcoin could repeat its post-FOMC breakdown, testing key support levels.

Title: State Street, Galaxy and Ondo join tokenized cash race with 24/7 sweep fund

Time Published: 2025-12-11T08:52:34Z
Full Content:
State Street Investment Management and Galaxy Asset Management are launching a tokenized private liquidity fund on Solana, with Ondo expected to invest $200 million. State Street Investment Management and Galaxy Asset Management are joining forces with Ondo Finance on a tokenized liquidity fund that will push cash “sweep” balances directly onto public blockchains, creating a potential source of 24/7 onchain liquidity. The planned State Street Galaxy Onchain Liquidity Sweep Fund, or SWEEP, is designed to take in and pay out PayPal’s (PYUSD) stablecoin for accredited investors, the companies said on Tuesday. Ondo is expected to seed the fund with $200 million, tying a major tokenized real-world asset (RWA) issuer directly into State Street’s tokenization stack. The fund will be powered by Galaxy Digital infrastructure, while State Street Bank and Trust Company, an affiliate of State Street Investment Management, will act as custodian. SWEEP is set to launch on Solana in early 2026, with rollouts on other networks, including Stellar and Ethereum, to follow, using Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). Related: Solana and Coinbase’s Base connect together using Chainlink The move drops another heavyweight into an increasingly crowded race to define what “onchain cash” looks like for institutions. BlackRock and Franklin Templeton already run tokenized cash‑management vehicles, including money‑market and other short‑term fixed‑income funds, on public blockchains. For its part, Ondo has built a business around wrapping Treasurys and other credit exposures into onchain vehicles that can plug into crypto markets. “By partnering with Galaxy, we will push the envelope together and drive the evolution of the TradFi landscape onchain,” said Kim Hochfeld, global head of cash and digital assets for State Street Investment Management. “Tokenization is rapidly becoming the connective tissue between traditional finance and the onchain economy,” said Ian De Bode, president of Ondo Finance. “Our planned investment would not only anchor this innovative fund – but also supports the continued growth of Ondo’s fund that offers institutional investors exposure to short-term US Treasuries with 24/7 instant mints and redemptions.” Related: Blockchain trial on Canton Network tests collateral reuse with tokenized US Treasurys The launch comes as tokenized funds and tokenized equities are starting to resemble components of an emerging onchain capital markets stack more than isolated pilots. Superstate opened up onchain capital raising for US Securities and Exchange Commission‑registered public companies via its Direct Issuance Programs on Ethereum and Solana Wednesday, targeting the equity side of that stack by letting issuers sell new stock directly for stablecoins and settle immediately to investor wallets. State Street’s partnership with Galaxy and Ondo also highlights how the roles are shaping up as traditional finance and crypto firms share the same products. State Street brings Big Four regulatory cover and custody, Galaxy contributes digital‑asset infrastructure and tokenization expertise, and Ondo provides both capital and an existing RWA distribution network. Related: Galaxy expands into UAE as part of Middle East push Solana’s role as the initial venue highlights a second competitive race unfolding beneath the product arms race. The chain has become a favored home for tokenized assets and high‑throughput trading, from tokenized public shares to experiments in onchain liquidity funds, as issuers look for lower fees and fast settlements. Some of the largest institutions in the world have chosen the Solana blockchain for their digital assets play, including Western Union, which processes over $100 billion in remittance volume every year, and Pfizer, which processes $2 trillion of merchant payment volume annually. Physical staked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Solana have reached almost $1 billion in assets under management. Launching on Solana first, with plans to expand to Stellar and Ethereum, will allow SWEEP to tap into multiple ecosystems where stablecoins and RWA tokens are already part of the infrastructure.

Title: Americans barely own gold — and that means prices could climb even further, Goldman says
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/gold-price-today-us-ownership-upside-goldman-sachs-outlook-forecast-2025-12
Time Published: 2025-12-11T07:13:21Z
Full Content:
Gold's record rally this year has grabbed headlines, but American investors barely own any of it, which means the yellow metal's price could have more room to run, according to Goldman Sachs. Even with gold hitting repeated highs, US ownership hasn't budged much. Gold ETF exposure is still six basis points, or 0.06 percentage points, below its 2012 peak since the launch of gold ETFs in the mid-2000s, according to Goldman's analysis published on Wednesday. The low gold allocation is simply because "portfolio growth has outpaced gains in gold prices and volumes over the past decade," Goldman's analysts wrote. And while gold has surged to new all-time highs in 2025, Goldman's analysis shows that the rally hasn't translated into meaningful increases in actual US ownership. Gold ETFs make up just 0.17% of private US financial portfolios as of the second quarter — a microscopic slice of the roughly $112 trillion Americans hold in stocks and bonds, according to Goldman's analysis. Goldman's data also shows that fewer than half of large US institutions managing over $100 million hold any gold ETF position at all. Among those that do, allocations typically sit between 0.1% and 0.5%. For major long-term investors, only about 0.2% of their portfolios are in gold. Despite the social media buzz around Costco gold bars and US Mint coin sales, the report notes that physical gold demand in the US is tiny compared with ETF flows — just 11 to 15 metric tons year-to-date, versus roughly 400 tons of net ETF buying. That low ownership stands in sharp contrast to recommendations coming from major market voices, including Citi, UBS, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, advising investors to add gold to their portfolios. The gap between those recommendations and reality is exactly what Goldman says could push gold's next leg higher. The bank estimates that every 1-basis-point, or 0.01 percentage point, increase in gold's share of US financial portfolios would push gold prices up by about 1.4%. Goldman argues that if households or institutions meaningfully boosted their gold exposure as a diversifier — especially amid global macro uncertainty, including concerns about the fiscal outlook — such inflows could "substantially raise prices" in the small gold market. The bank forecasts gold to reach $4,900 by the end of 2026, but says that forecast carries "significant upside risk" if private-sector buying broadens beyond the central banks that have dominated demand in recent years. The spot gold price hit a record high near $4,400 per troy ounce in late October and has since pulled back to around $4,220 per ounce. Prices are up 60% so far this year.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto statue lands on NYSE in sign of changing times

Time Published: 2025-12-11T06:13:26Z
Full Content:
There are five other Satoshi statues made by Valentina Picozzi located around the world, in Switzerland, El Salvador, Japan, Vietnam and Miami, in the US state of Florida. The New York Stock Exchange has become the sixth host of Valentina Picozzi’s “disappearing” Satoshi Nakamoto statue — a striking shift from just a few years ago when crypto was still taboo on Wall Street. Long seen as a bastion of traditional finance, the NYSE called the installation “shared ground between emerging systems and established institutions” in an X post on Wednesday. The statue was installed by Bitcoin (BTC) firm Twenty One Capital, which began trading this week. The design itself is the work of Picozzi, who wrote on X under her Satoshigallery handle that seeing her latest piece in such a high-profile setting is “mind-blowing.” “This is such an achievement, even in our wildest dream we wouldn’t think about placing the statue of Satoshi Nakamoto in this location! The 6th/21 statues of Satoshi Nakamoto found its home in the NYSE,” she added. It also happens to coincide with the anniversary of the Bitcoin mailing list, which Nakamoto launched on Dec. 10, 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto mined the genesis block on Jan. 3, 2009, minting the first 50 Bitcoin in history and planting the seeds for the crypto industry we see today. Over a year later, on May 22, 2010, programmer Laszlo Hanyecz made the first documented purchase of goods using Bitcoin, paying 10,000 Bitcoin for two Papa John’s pizzas. In the intervening years, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency faced many challenges, as institutions and banks shunned them, and governments allegedly attempted to suppress them through efforts such as Operation Chokepoint 2.0. However, it has since turned a corner, as skeptics, such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, have changed their minds about the technology, and institutions and Wall Street have scrambled to invest through vehicles like exchange-traded funds and directly by holding Bitcoin in their treasuries. Public and private companies, countries and ETFs now collectively hold more than 3.7 million Bitcoin, according to Bitbo, worth more than $336 billion. Picozzi has five other Nakamoto statues around the world, located in Switzerland, El Salvador, Japan, Vietnam, and Miami, Florida. Related: Disappearing Satoshi statue in Lugano took 21 months to create, says artist Picozzi, under her Satoshigallery handle, said she is committed to placing 21 around the world, a possible reference to the theoretical 21 million Bitcoin maximum supply. Speaking to Cointelegraph last year, she said Nakamoto is one of the most intriguing and fascinating figures of this era, and the statues stand as a tribute to the person behind Bitcoin. “The statue itself wants to give to the viewer this feeling of disappearance, and the sense that the inventor stays between the lines — as of today, Satoshi exists in the lines of the Bitcoin code, allowing humanity to have the first decentralized payment system,” she said.

Title: Ukraine sends US new plan to end the war as Trump blasts Europe

A man goes up the steps from an underground passage next to the memorial for the fallen Ukrainian and foreign fighters on the Independence Square in Kiev, on Dec. 10, 2025, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. (Photo by Roman PILIPEY / AFP) Ukraine has sent Washington an updated plan for ending Russia's invasion, Ukrainian officials told AFP Wednesday, as U.S. President Donald Trump laid into European leaders in the latest sign of a growing transatlantic rift. A first U.S. plan that involved Ukraine surrendering land that Russia has not captured was seen by Kiev and its European allies as caving in to too many of Russia's hardline demands, and has since been revised. A Ukrainian official briefed on the latest version told AFP that it "takes into account Ukraine's vision — it is a further proposal for adequate solutions to problematic issues". "We are not disclosing the details pending the reaction of the American side," the official added. But Trump, who has been pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to agree to a U.S. plan, swiftly expressed impatience with both Kiev and its European allies in France, Britain and Germany. His comments come amid a growing divide with Europe after he described it as "decaying" and "weak" on immigration and Ukraine, days after a new U.S. national security strategy said the continent risked "civilisational erasure". "We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words," Trump told reporters when asked about the phone call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz. On Monday, Ukraine's European allies put on a show of support for Zelensky as they expressed scepticism about parts of the latest U.S. proposal to end the war launched by Russia in February 2022. Trump added that the Europeans wanted to hold fresh talks this weekend but warned that they risked "wasting time". "I think we had some little disputes about people, and we're going to see how it turns out. And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things," Trump added. "They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we'll make a determination depending on what they come back with. We don't want to be wasting time". 'Let people fight it out' Talks between U.S. officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin last week also failed to reach a breakthrough. The threats of a full Trump pull-out have come at a delicate time for Zelensky, whose army is on the back foot in the war-torn eastern Donbas region while a corruption scandal engulfs several of his close associates. The Ukrainian leader — who Trump has accused of not reading the plan — said on Tuesday the plan had been broken down into three documents — a framework 20-point agreement, and two separate papers: one on security guarantees and another on Ukraine's post-war recovery. Earlier on Wednesday, Zelensky said he had held an online meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss Ukraine's recovery. "This could be considered the first meeting of the group that will work on a document concerning reconstruction and economic recovery of Ukraine," Zelensky said on social media. "We have also updated our reflections on the 20 points of the framework document for ending the war. It is overall security that will determine economic security and underpin safe business environment," he added. But U.S. leader gave the latest in a series of hints that he may walk away from a conflict he blames on his predecessor Joe Biden, and which he once said he could end within 24 hours of returning to office in January. "Sometimes you have to let people fight it out and sometimes you don't," Trump said on Wednesday. "But the problem with letting people fight it out is yet you're losing thousands of people a week. It's ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous." Former Iraqi President Barham Salih, who once fled Saddam Hussein’s persecution, has been named the next U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, marking a break from the long-standing practice of choosing leaders mainly from major European donor countries. Türkiye’s current account posted a net surplus of $457 million in October, according to Central Bank data released on Dec. 12. A high-stakes showdown in Norway awaits as Brann hosts Turkish giant Fenerbahçe on Dec. 11, with both clubs battling for critical positioning in the UEFA Europa League league phase.

Come for the politics, stay for the snark. by Adam L Silverman| December 10, 20259:57 pm| 17 Comments This post is in: Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Military, Open Threads, Russia, Silverman on Security, War, War in Ukraine Just a quick housekeeping note: last night in comments, Gin & Tonic had a very good and important response to my remarks regarding whether Ukraine is losing. There’s not enough time tonight to get to the important strategic issue that it raises, which is how to win the war AND secure the peace. I will try to get to this tomorrow. Before we start, here’s Ukraine’s outgoing fires this evening/overnight: Ukrainian channels report that over 400 drones flew to Russia. [image or embed] — WarTranslated (Dmitri) (@wartranslated.bsky.social) December 10, 2025 at 4:37 PM President Zelenskyy and Ukrainian leaders continue to go through the motions with the US to demonstrate that they’re not being obstructionist, which has led to the emergence of a twenty point proposal. The Ukrainians are doing this because they know that Russia has already rejected any agreement that doesn’t reward Russia by giving them everything Putin wants. Ushakov was quoted by Russian media on Sunday as saying that the United States would have to “make serious, I would say, radical changes to their papers” on Ukraine. He did not clarify what changes Moscow wanted Washington to make. The Kremlin has said it expects Kushner to be doing the main work on drafting a possible deal. David Ignatius provides the details at The Washington Post: The negotiating package involves three documents, a Ukrainian official told me: the peace plan, security guarantees and an economic recovery plan. The talks are far from over, with Ukraine and European supporters planning to release a joint set of amendments Wednesday. But here are some of the ideas being explored, as described to me this week by U.S. and Ukrainian officials: • Ukraine would join the European Union as early as 2027. This rapid accession worries some E.U. powers. But the Trump administration thinks it can overcome opposition from Hungary, which has been Kyiv’s biggest E.U. opponent. Membership would foster trade and investment. But perhaps most important, it would force Ukraine to control its pernicious culture of corruption in state-owned businesses. At bottom, this war has been about whether Ukraine can become a European country. President Vladimir Putin detests that idea, with his mystical belief in the oneness of Russia and Ukraine. Quick E.U. membership for Kyiv looks to me like victory. • The United States would provide what are described as “Article 5-like” security guarantees to protect Ukraine if Russia violates the pact. Ukraine wants the U.S. to sign such an agreement and have Congress ratify it; European nations would sign separate security guarantees. A U.S.-Ukrainian working group is exploring how the details would work — and how fast Ukraine and its allies could respond to any Russian breach. The reliability of the U.S. guarantees is arguably undermined by language in the National Security Strategy that seems to erode the NATO alliance, on which the guarantees are modeled. But the Trump team says it’s committed to continuing U.S. intelligence support for Ukraine, which is the sine qua non of security. • Ukraine’s sovereignty would be protected from any Russian veto. But negotiators still seem to be struggling with delicate issues like limits on Ukraine’s army. There’s talk of raising an initial U.S. proposal for a 600,000-soldier army to 800,000, which is roughly what Ukraine would have anyway, postwar. But Kyiv refuses any formal constitutional cap, as Russia wants. Whatever the nominal size of the army, officials say there might be supplements like the national guard or other support forces. • A demilitarized zone would be established along the entire ceasefire line, all the way from the Donetsk province in the northeast to the cities of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson in the south. Behind this DMZ would be a deeper zone in which heavy weapons would be excluded. This line would be closely monitored, much like the DMZ that divides North and South Korea. • “Land swaps” are an inescapable part of the deal, but Ukraine and the U.S. are still haggling over how the lines would be drawn. Russia demands Ukraine give up the roughly 25 percent of Donetsk it still holds; the Trump team argues that Ukraine is likely to lose much of that in battle over the next six months, in any event, and should make concessions now to spare casualties. U.S. negotiators have tried various formulas to make this concession more palatable for Zelensky. One idea is that the withdrawal zone would be demilitarized. Zelensky insisted Monday that he has “no legal right” to cede territory to Russia. One way to finesse this issue is the Korea model — to this day, South Korea claims a legal right to the entire peninsula and North Korea asserts the same. • The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe, would no longer be under Russian occupation. Negotiators are discussing the possibility that the United States might take over running the facility. Strange as it may sound, that appeals to some Ukrainian officials because it would provide an American tripwire against Russian aggression. • The Trump administration would seek to foster investment and economic development in Ukraine. One source of funds would be the more than $200 billion in Russian assets now frozen in Europe. Trump’s negotiators already proposed making $100 billion of that stash available to Ukraine for reparations. The amount might be increased. More at the link. This is not just going to continue to be a non-starter for Ukrainians, we already know, as the quote above indicates, that anything other than full capitulation is unacceptable to Putin and Russia. Republican Congressman Joe Wilson noted that Ukraine agreed to all six proposals that Trump presented this year, while Russia did not support any of them.

Moreover, Trump has adopted a new demand as a result of his regular and ongoing phone calls with Putin: Zelenskyy has to go because Ukraine isn’t a democracy because they haven’t held elections during the war. ⚡️US needs ‘answers’ before next meeting with Zelensky, Trump says. Trump did not discuss specific conditions of the peace deal but said Zelensky needs to be “realistic” and asked when Ukraine would hold presidential elections. [image or embed] — The Kyiv Independent (@kyivindependent.com) December 10, 2025 at 5:32 PM From The Kyiv Independent: (emphasis mine) European officials want to arrange a meeting this coming meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky and American leadership to discuss peace in Ukraine, but the White House first needs “answers,” U.S. President Donald Trump said on Dec. 10. Trump told reporters that he spoke with the leaders of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom on Dec. 10. “We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words, and we’ll see what happens,” he said. “I mean, we’re waiting to hear answers.” According to Trump, the European leaders want to hold a meeting involving both him and Zelensky in Europe this weekend, but the White House requires further persuasion before agreeing to attend. “They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we’ll make a determination depending on what they come back with,” he said. “We don’t want to be wasting time.” Trump did not discuss the details of any proposed peace framework but said Zelensky needs to be “realistic.” He also mused aloud about Ukraine’s next round of presidential elections. “I think (Zelensky) has to be realistic and I do wonder about, how long is it going to be before they have an election,” Trump said. “It’s a democracy. It’s been a long time.” On the same day, Zelensky told reporters that Ukraine could be ready to hold elections during Russia’s full-scale war if the U.S. and European allies work to ensure security. Zelensky then said he discussed the issue with members of the Ukrainian parliament on Dec. 10. “I will not allow any speculation against Ukraine,” the president said in his evening address. “If our partners, including our key partner in Washington, talk so much and so specifically about the elections in Ukraine, about elections under martial law, then we must provide legitimate Ukrainian answers to every question and every doubt.” Presidential, parliamentary, and local elections in Ukraine are banned under martial law, which went into effect after Russia’s full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. While Kyiv has previously held firm on the need to postpone elections until the end of the war — or at least a ceasefire — Trump’s emphasis on elections in the latest push for a deal have brought about a shift. Polling also shows Zelensky’s popularity to have hit a low point in the fallout of a major corruption scandal that saw his second-in-command, Andriy Yermak, resign from office. Though Trump has expressed impatience with Ukraine for slow progress on a peace agreement, the Kremlin meanwhile has given no sign of easing its maximalist demands — including calls for Ukraine to cede territory it still controls.

Video below, English transcript after the jump. 10 December 2025 – 20:52 I wish you good health, fellow Ukrainians! Today was an extremely busy day, and the coming days will also be serious. We spoke with the American team on economic matters – on reconstruction matters. I want to thank Secretary Bessent, Jared Kushner, and Larry Fink of BlackRock for being fully constructive. The key principle we share is that, to ensure reconstruction is of high quality and economic growth is tangible after this war, real security must form the foundation. When there is security, everything else follows. The 20 points for ending the war form a fundamental document. We are actively working on the key steps – and they must be doable steps. From this fundamental document, we are developing two additional ones – at least two. And the first is on security – regarding security guarantees for Ukraine with the United States, and the second is on the economy – covering reconstruction and joint investments. Today, we focused specifically on the economic document. And on the Ukrainian side, I was accompanied by Ukrainian government officials: Prime Minister of Ukraine Yuliia Svyrydenko, Deputy Prime Minister Kachka, Ministers Sybiha and Sobolev, and First Deputy Foreign Minister Kyslytsya. Our defenders were also represented in all discussions; today, General Hnatov joined us in the economic talks. The principles of the economic document are absolutely clear, and we are fully aligned with the American side on this – I want to thank them for today’s video meeting. An economic action plan will follow. Europe will also be involved in reconstruction, certainly. In the near future, we plan to move forward on the other two documents as well. Rustem Umerov will continue the discussions. For tomorrow, we are preparing a Coalition of the Willing meeting – over 30 countries working with Ukraine to ensure security on land, in the air, and at sea. Next week, we will coordinate with Europe in bilateral formats. Ukraine is working swiftly; every visit and every negotiation we conduct always yields practical results for our defense and for our resilience. Today, our combat aviation has been reinforced – thank you. Details are not yet public, but we continue to strengthen our forces in the sky. Today, there is also an additional sanctions step in Europe – more sanctions will target Russian tankers and the entire Russian oil transport infrastructure – and this is right. In December, Ukraine will present its own package of sanctions against the tanker fleet working for the war, and we will extend this pressure through joint formats with our partners. There will be new steps against Russian propagandists as well. Today, I also received a report from the Head of Ukraine’s Foreign Intelligence Service – including on the enemy’s economic situation and Russia’s growing dependence on China. Throughout Russian history, no one has ever surrendered sovereignty so much to China or any other major power. And it is astonishing how much Putin is paying just to avoid ending this war. Yet the world still has sufficient strength to end this war – to force Russia into doing so. Peace is needed. I want to thank everyone who is helping. And one more thing. Today, I spoke with representatives of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. We had a substantive discussion. I will not allow any speculation against Ukraine. If our partners – including our key partner in Washington – are speaking so much and so concretely about elections in Ukraine, about elections under martial law, we must provide legal Ukrainian responses to every question and every doubt. This is not easy, but we definitely do not need any pressure regarding this. I expect that the People’s Deputies of Ukraine will present their perspective. Security challenges depend on our partners, primarily the United States, and political and legal challenges must be addressed by Ukraine. And they will be. Glory to Ukraine!

Let us embrace that. Britain should lead this hybrid campaign for Europe. Our world-class intelligence services, special forces and cyber force can deliver strategic effects through precision operations. 1/3 www.independent.co.uk/voices/russi… [image or embed] — Marika Mikiashvili 🇬🇪🇺🇦🇪🇺 (@marikamikiashvili.bsky.social) December 10, 2025 at 10:40 AM From former UK National Security Advisor and Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill at The Independent: (emphasis mine) Yet again this week, President Trump set Europe’s strategic challenge. Despite reaffirming US commitment to Euro-Atlantic defence once allies pledged to invest more ourselves, his new national security strategy pivots to the Pacific while his Ukraine peace plan negotiates European security without European input. Europe might not be on our own, but we need the capability to be self-reliant. And fast. As national security adviser, I dealt with the Salisbury poisonings, about which Lord Hughes’s inquiry reported last week. It was a turning point. After years of inadequate responses to Syria, Crimea, MH17, Litvinenko and Russian subversion, we decimated Russian intelligence capability with the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history and imposed genuinely painful sanctions. Yet even that success was fundamentally defensive. We responded to an attack that had already been executed. We established consequences but not deterrence. The truth is, we are already at war: conventional war in Ukraine, hybrid war elsewhere. Putin certainly believes he is at war with us. As I told parliament recently, Russia could bring Britain to a standstill with a cyber attack on our food distribution system, coupled with an information operation to create panic buying and public disorder. No missiles or troops required. Sun Tzu wrote: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected”. Nato too should manoeuvre in this grey zone. We could target Russian vulnerabilities, including ageing energy infrastructure, dependence on Western systems, an isolated Kaliningrad enclave, and concentrated military-industrial facilities. We should deny insurance to Russia’s shadow fleet, impound vessels in Nato waters and pass extra-territorial legislation enabling Nato navies to respond to cable attacks in international waters. We should demonstrate our capability to mount cyber attacks against Russian energy and military infrastructure. And we should apply systematic pressure to its Kaliningrad enclave, which relies on land and sea access via Nato territory. Won’t this provoke Russian escalation? Putin invaded Ukraine, uses chemical weapons, shoots down civilian aircraft, sabotages infrastructure, assassinates dissidents and subverts democracy, all without facing severe consequences. Yet Nato is mesmerised by fear of retaliation, while Russia follows Lenin’s doctrine of continuous escalation until met with steel. The risk is not that we provoke attacks. They are attacking us already. The risk is that failing to impose a price invites further aggression. Some argue this requires unanimous European support we cannot secure. Wrong question. Several allies – Nordics, Baltics, Poland – who understand the threat are ready. France and Germany will follow once we demonstrate resolve. Coalitions of the willing have repeatedly moved the Nato consensus. Waiting for permission guarantees continued Russian aggression. Putin regards the UK as Russia’s most implacable adversary. Let us embrace that. Britain should lead this hybrid campaign for Europe. Our world-class intelligence services, special forces and cyber force can deliver strategic effects through precision operations. Our strategic culture is not paralysed by fear. We understand that credible deterrence is offensive, not just defensive, striking where Russia is vulnerable, forcing them to defend everywhere, imposing costs through means difficult to predict. This is a hybrid war of manoeuvre. Europe needs a nation willing to spearhead it. Britain should be that nation. This is all strategically sound. It would be easier if Britain could make up its mind over whether it is in or out of Europe. And if the current Labour government wasn’t busy self immolating by attempting to implement the centrist commentators and consultants recommendations the goal of which is to make Ezra Klein and Matt Yglesias spontaneously orgasm. Denmark: The world is upside down 😐 [image or embed] — Kate from Kharkiv (@kateinkharkiv.bsky.social) December 10, 2025 at 10:40 AM From CNN: Denmark has labeled the United States as a potential security concern for the first time in an annual report released by one of its intelligence agencies, offering more evidence of the increasingly fraught transatlantic alliance between Europe and the US. The report, compiled by the Danish Defense Intelligence Service (DDIS), warns that the US “uses economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to enforce its will and no longer rules out the use of military force, even against allies.” That assessment forms part of the service’s wider analysis that “great powers increasingly prioritize their own interests and use force to achieve their goals.” CNN has reached out to the US Embassy in Copenhagen and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in Washington for comment. Apart from its warning relating to the US, the report largely focuses on strategic threats posed by Russia and China, as well as instability brought about by China’s rise and the resulting global shift in power. It points out that the “military threat from Russia to NATO will increase,” a concern magnified for the Danes since “there is uncertainty about the role of the United States as a guarantor of Europe’s security.” Denmark’s normally friendly relationship with its NATO ally grew strained earlier this year when US President Donald Trump expressed an interest in taking control of Greenland, an autonomous, resource-rich, strategically significant Arctic island that is legally part of the Danish kingdom. That relationship is once again under scrutiny as the differing strategic priorities of the US and Europehave been exposed in the recent Ukrainian peace talks and, most dramatically, in the national security strategy released Friday by the Trump administration, which adopted an unprecedented confrontational posture toward Europe And for Denmark, the threats posed by Russia and the US are intertwined. The report argues that “Russia will try to exploit the US desire for a quick end to the (Ukraine) war to sow division between the US and Europe.” The threat of Russian sabotage groups infiltrating Ukraine from Transnistria is growing. Sources in Ukraine’s military intelligence tell 24 Kanal that Moscow is rapidly stepping up activity in the region to stretch Ukrainian resources and create a new front.

YY_Sima Qian December 11, 2025 at 12:02 am I don’t think Putin has surrendered any sovereignty to the PRC (on the parallel of Muscovy to the Golden Horde, for example), but he has certainly allowed the PRC to gain enormous leverage over Russia. HumboldtBlue December 11, 2025 at 12:21 am I’d like to clarify that I just realized I posted a link last night that I didn’t properly quote, and it may have led a commenter to think that was me. Pfft, my cat has more cogent comment on current affairs than I do. That is Paul Warburg. Many people say that Ukraine can’t possibly win its war against Russia, because Russia is a much larger opponent. But this doesn’t match even with Russia’s own recent history. In this video, I talk about the growing Ukrainian insurgency movement in the occupied Donbas region, and how it is making a meaningful difference on the battlefield. I map this to the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan, a war that they ultimately lost due to insurgency. I then talk about why this matters for any peace deals between Ukraine and Russia, showing why failing to understand these dynamics will almost certainly lead to a peace that doesn’t last. Here is his latest post from earlier today. Also, while we’re on the subject of the horrors of war, here is Peleliu: Guernica of Paradise, based on a manga by Kazuyoshi Takeda, joins films like “Grave of the Fireflies” and “In This Corner of the World” in using anime to portray the horrors of the war. Grave of the Fireflies, like Come and See, will break one down, and are at the top of the list of movies you may not wanna watch again. bad Jim December 11, 2025 at 12:38 am I found the piece by Mark Sedwill pretty thrilling. Any mention of threatening Kaliningrad gratifies my black heart. Jay December 11, 2025 at 1:27 am As always, thank you, Adam. Jay December 11, 2025 at 1:47 am Anton Gerashchenko @Gerashchenko_en 16h War historian Antony Beevor explained in an interview with The Telegraph why Russia commits such atrocities in Ukraine: He argues that Russia has historically developed a belief that conspicuous cruelty is a necessary weapon of war. According to the historian, while Europe went through the Enlightenment and attempted to “civilize” war by creating the Red Cross and similar attitudes. Russia, however, did not embrace this evolution. ◾️ Beevor links modern cruelty not only to army traditions, but also to deeply rooted violence within Russian society. Putin’s soldiers, he emphasizes, often become victims of abuse themselves. The historian recalls how, in the 1990s, while working in Russian archives, he learned that “there were up to 5,000 suicides a year” among conscripts in the Soviet Union, and Soviet generals found this funny. Now, Beevor notes, Russian conscripts are killing themselves because they are subjected not only to bullying but also to persecution and torture. The command often approves of this ‘tradition’ of treating recruits. ◾️ Beevor calls this phenomenon a “knock-on theory of oppression”: having experienced violence themselves, soldiers then take it out on the defenseless. This is what happened in Germany in 1945, and it was repeated in all wars in which Soviet and then Russian troops participated. When asked whether cruelty is considered legitimate in Russia, the historian replied that Russians “don’t give a damn about legitimacy, to be perfectly honest.” ◾️ The war will end someday, and hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers will return home. What will happen when people accustomed to violence, looting, and murder find themselves among the civilian population? “We’ve already been hearing anecdotal evidence of appalling crimes being committed,” Beevor said. He highlighted the Russian command’s inhumane treatment of its own troops: mobile crematoria at the front, the use of convicts in “punishment” units for demining and suicide attacks – all of which are a continuation of old practices. “They’ve certainly been using the idea of punishment battalions that Stalin actually copied from the Germans,” Beevor added. ◾️ The historian warned that if the Kremlin considers its campaign in Ukraine successful, the Baltic states could be the next target. He recalled the lessons of the past: after World War I, the British and French could not believe that anyone would want another war, and therefore underestimated Hitler. “We’ve seen a similar thing in the 2000s Nobody believed that anyone would want to have another ground war on the European landmass again. [Under Putin], the sheer brutality of the Russian way of war could well be reapplied on the European landmass,” Beevor concluded. 📹: Chechen poet Apti Bisultanov on the Russian army, March 2006 Dec 10, 2025 · Anton Gerashchenko @Gerashchenko_en 12h Those who believe or claim that “if Ukraine gives up part of its territory – or even the whole country – peace will come” either do not understand how the Russian state operates or are deliberately misleading others. It’s enough to look at what Russia does wherever it manages to entrench itself: each occupied territory is turned into a space where land, infrastructure and people are either destroyed or repurposed to serve Russia’s economy and war effort. And this is not a “new course” for the Kremlin. Historically, Russia has never stopped at what it seized: it incorporated, subdued, and exploited. In the early 20th century, during the civil war and “Sovietization” of Ukraine, the same pragmatic formula applied: control of territory = control of the population. Registration, coercion, mobilization, repression, “re-education.” The war was not only for land – it was to turn society into a resource. Russia’s wars in Chechnya demonstrated the very same logic: the defiant were killed, the rest became fully controlled. Today, in the occupied Ukrainian territories, we see the same steps: ▪️ First, “legalization” of control through passportization: a Russian passport equals survival. Access to healthcare, employment, property, social benefits, education, and even movement is tied to having Russian documents. This is not bureaucracy, it is a mechanism to force people to “fit into” the occupation order. A century ago, the Bolsheviks used registers, commissariats, certificates and supply control for the same purpose: if you wanted to survive, you had to be registered and kept under the system’s control. ▪️ Second, the repressive framework. Occupation brings with it filtration, detentions, torture, “cases” for disloyalty – and systematic hunting for those capable of organizing resistance: veterans, activists, journalists, civil servants, teachers. In 1918-1921, the Bolsheviks consolidated power in exactly the same way – not through persuasion, but through punitive infrastructure: first crush the elites and alternative institutions, then “rewire” society. ▪️ Third – the most terrifying: turning people into “human resources” for war. In the occupied territories, Russia is pulling Ukrainians into its draft system through registries, military commissariats, and forced “status changes”; expanding contract enlistment through blackmail and dependency; and using places of detention as channels of coercion. According to data from the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, presented by Dmytro Usov at Crimea Global, from February 2022 to July 2025 Russia forcibly mobilized 46,327 Ukrainian citizens from the occupied territories; it was also reported that former Ukrainian servicemen were being used, that units were formed (two battalions and two detachments), and that 62 contracts had been signed. The historical parallel is direct: in 1918, the Red Army quickly became a mass conscription machine, and the Ukrainian population was used as a mobilization reserve for the imperial center; even during the Winter War of 1939-1940, formations from Soviet Ukraine (notably the 44th and 70th divisions) were sent to the Finnish front, and Ukrainian sources estimate up to ~40,000 Ukrainians killed in that war. ▪️ Fourth, long-term planning – children and identity. Under Russian occupation, “patriotic” and military upbringing, cadet programs, preparation for service in Russian structures, and pressure on the Ukrainian language and curriculum are launched. Early Soviet rule operated in exactly the same way: to raise a “new person,” impose one history, one loyalty – and create a generation more easily mobilized and controlled. ▪️ And finally – economy and territory as a staging ground. Occupied lands are reconfigured to fit Russian supply chains and wartime needs, while the territory itself is repurposed for military logistics and basing. A hundred years ago, the imperial center viewed Ukraine the same way – as a critical resource base for grain, industry, transport hubs – and subordinated all of it to war. Today the principle is the same, only the tools are more modern. ‼️ This is why the occupation of Ukraine that Russia dreams of is not the “end of the war” for Russia. It is a resource that Putin wants to obtain for future wars: • human (draft and contracts); • territorial (a forward operating platform); • economic (restructured production and logistics); • ideological (re-educating children and normalizing violence). History shows a simple truth: when Russia gains control of a territory, it converts it into control over people – and into the capacity to wage further wars. nitter.poast.org/Gerashchenko_en There is more,………………….

Title: Divided Fed cuts rates, hints at a pause and just one cut next year as growth rebounds

New policymaker projections issued after the U.S. central bank's final two-day meeting of 2025 showed a median expectation for a single quarter-percentage-point cut next year, the same as in September. But it was accompanied by a wide range of estimates that starkly illustrated the depth of disagreement about where to take monetary policy in 2026 and beyond in an economy being reshaped by President Donald Trump's policies and an artificial intelligence investment boom. "In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data," the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a policy statement that was tweaked to add language that in the past has been used to signal a pause in policy actions - an outlook at odds with market expectations still leaning toward two rate cuts in 2026. Policymakers' refreshed estimates - hindered by incomplete data about the economy after a six-week government shutdown - also showed they expect inflation to slow to around 2.4% by the end of next year even as economic growth accelerates to an above-trend 2.3% and the unemployment rate remains at a moderate 4.4%, an outlook that should dispel worries about potential stagflation that have persisted this year. The wide disagreement on the appropriate policy for such an environment also showed how challenging it could be to build a consensus in a policymaking body about to experience a leadership change, with Trump expected to nominate a successor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell within the next few weeks. In a press conference after the meeting, Powell said: "I would note that having reduced our policy rate by 75 basis points since September and 175 basis points since last September, the fed funds rate is now within a broad range of estimates of its neutral value, and we are well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves." Powell, who repeatedly referenced being in a strong position to wait on the next move, added, though, that Fed officials have made no decision about what to do with rates at their next policy meeting in late January. Major U.S. stock indices closed higher, while the dollar weakened against a basket of currencies and Treasury yields dropped. "The 25-basis-point rate cut was widely expected and the economic projections remain optimistic. I would view this as a semi-dovish, cautious statement," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. "The markets are applauding this decision." Other analysts pointed to the wide range of policymaker views on the outlook for rates. "It's definitely a hawkish cut, not so much in the fact that we had two dissenters that wanted to stand pat, but if you look at the 'dot plot,' there were six of them that penciled in no rate cut at this meeting," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. The dot plot graphic of Fed policymaker rate-path projections showed six "dots" at 3.9%, where the policy rate was before the rate cut on Wednesday. The decision to lower the benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to the 3.50%-3.75% range drew three dissents, with Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee joining Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid in arguing the policy rate should be left unchanged, and Fed Governor Stephen Miran again advocating a larger half-percentage-point reduction. How monetary policy evolves from here, heading into a U.S. midterm election year that could revolve around the performance of the economy and with Trump urging sharper rate reductions, will now hinge on data that is still lagging from the impact of the 43-day federal government shutdown in October and November. The projections are in a sense optimistic: Interest rates may remain higher than anticipated, but the economy is seen growing faster even as inflation falls and the jobless rate also eases lower. But the latest policy statement and projections were crafted without the benefit of recent job and inflation reports, and instead relied on "available indicators," which Fed officials have said include their own internal surveys, community contacts and private data. The most recent official data on unemployment and inflation is for September, and showed the unemployment rate rising to 4.4% from 4.3%, while the Fed's preferred measure of inflation also increased slightly to 2.8% from 2.7%. The Fed has a 2% inflation target, but the pace of price increases has risen steadily from 2.3% in April, a fact at least partly attributable to the pass-through of rising import taxes to consumers and a driving force behind the central bank's policy divide. Job and inflation data for November will be released next week, followed later by a detailed report of economic growth for the third quarter. "Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace," the Fed's policy statement said. "Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up through September," it said, dropping a reference to the jobless rate as "low." The updated projections showed a core of six policymakers preferring no rate cut this year, and seven anticipating no further cuts in 2026. The median projection is for one additional quarter-percentage-point cut in 2027 as well, as inflation continues to subside towards the central bank's 2% target. "Given the lack of consensus on the Committee displayed today, along with the slow release of traditional economic data, and the arrival of a new Fed chair early in 2026, we think the Fed is likely to remain on hold for a while, although continued softness in some of the labor indicators can certainly bring another 25-basis-point cut into the mix for January," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for global fixed income at BlackRock and one of the five finalists Trump is considering as a successor to Powell.

Title: Congress Advances Historic Crackdown On American Cash Fueling China

A long-sought crackdown on U.S. funding of China’s military and strategic industries is on the verge of becoming law after House lawmakers successfully embedded sweeping outbound-investment restrictions into the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The House passed the massive $900 billion defense policy bill Wednesday, setting the stage for a Senate vote next week before the measure heads to President Donald Trump’s desk. Backers of the outbound investment curbs — including Republican Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky — call it the “strongest framework in history” for safeguarding American capital and strengthening national security. “This legislation takes President Trump’s America First Investment Policy to the next level and puts Beijing on notice,” said Barr, who introduced the Foreign Investment Guardrails to Help Thwart (FIGHT) China Act included in the House version of the NDAA. “Congress is sending a clear message: no more American money for the [Chinese Communist Party] to build missiles aimed at our troops, the next spy balloon that will fly over our communities, or any other product that could harm Americans.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: US Nuclear Bomber Fleet Shares Fence With Trailer Park Linked To Chinese Intel-Tied Fraudster) WASHINGTON, DC – MAY 7: Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) speaks with Rep. Warren Davidson (R-OH) before a House Financial Services Committee hearing on May 7, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Pete Marovich/Getty Images) If enacted, the provision would prohibit U.S. investments in sensitive Chinese technologies, require domestic firms to notify the Treasury Department of certain transactions in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and empower the Treasury secretary to sanction Chinese entities tied to the country’s military or intelligence services. Lawmakers attempted to attach similar language to defense funding bills in both 2023 and 2024 but were ultimately unsuccessful. Notably, the measure ran into resistance in 2023 from then-House Financial Services Committee chair and Republican North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, who said that more U.S. private investment in China would prevent Beijing from taking state control of them. The push now has broad bipartisan support and strong backing from China hawks who warn that billions in American capital have fueled PRC critical-technology firms, including those linked to the Chinese military, the surveillance state and the CCP’s genocide against Uyghur Muslims. In 2023 alone, major American financial institutions like BlackRock steered $6.5 billion into 63 Chinese companies blacklisted by the U.S. government for supporting the CCP military or human-rights abuse, according to the House Select Committee on the CCP. The restrictions would also extend to investments in other nations that are U.S. adversaries, including Iran and North Korea. “President Trump has made clear the past few decades of investments propping up Communist China’s aggression must come to an end,” said Speaker Mike Johnson, calling the inclusion of investment restrictions an “important step to protect our nation’s national security and economic competitiveness.” Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who sponsored the Senate version of the FIGHT China Act, also said he is pleased the effort is nearing the finish line. “This landmark legislation would prohibit and require notification of U.S. investments in certain technologies in countries of concern, ensuring American ingenuity, innovation, and investment do not end up in the hands of adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party to be weaponized against us,” said Cornyn. Republican Rep. Brian Mast of Florida likewise called the measure a “huge win” for national security, cutting off “American investors to feed the Beijing military machine.” The investment curbs also have Democratic backing, including from Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who co-sponsored the Senate bill and called it an “important step toward ensuring the United States remains the world’s leader in advanced technology.” Among the other victories for China hawks in the NDAA is the BIOSECURE Act, which limits federal contracts with biotechnology firms linked to foreign adversaries such as the PRC. The provision was previously sidelined in 2024 after Democrat Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts — then chair of the House Rules Committee — intervened to protect jobs tied to one of the targeted Chinese companies in his district. Despite the NDAA’s new restrictions on China, the president announced Monday that the U.S. will allow Nvidia to ship its advanced H200 AI processors to approved customers in China in exchange for a 25% surcharge. Critics argue the move risks eroding America’s technological edge and undermining long-term national security, noting that China is unlikely to produce a domestic equivalent before at least late 2027. While the defense bill cleared the House, it drew objections from several Republicans who criticized the authorization of additional security assistance to Ukraine and other foreign countries, the omission of provisions to ban a central bank digital currency, and the inclusion of certain DEI-related provisions.

UKRAINE HAS SENT Washington an updated plan for ending Russia’s invasion, Ukrainian officials have said, as US President Donald Trump laid into European leaders in the latest sign of a growing transatlantic rift. A first US plan that involved Ukraine surrendering land that Russia has not captured was seen by Kyiv and its European allies as caving in to too many of Russia’s hardline demands, and has since been revised. A Ukrainian official briefed on the latest version told AFP that it “takes into account Ukraine’s vision – it is a further proposal for adequate solutions to problematic issues”. “We are not disclosing the details pending the reaction of the American side,” the official added. But Trump, who has been pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to agree to a US plan, swiftly expressed impatience with both Kyiv and its European allies in France, Britain and Germany. His comments come amid a growing divide with Europe after he described it as “decaying” and “weak” on immigration and Ukraine, days after a new US national security strategy said the continent risked “civilisational erasure”. “We discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words,” Trump told reporters when asked about the phone call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz. On Monday, Ukraine’s European allies put on a show of support for Zelenskyy as they expressed scepticism about parts of the latest US proposal to end the war launched by Russia in February 2022. Trump added that the Europeans wanted to hold fresh talks this weekend but warned that they risked “wasting time”. “I think we had some little disputes about people, and we’re going to see how it turns out. And we said, before we go to a meeting, we want to know some things,” Trump added. Advertisement “They would like us to go to a meeting over the weekend in Europe, and we’ll make a determination depending on what they come back with. We don’t want to be wasting time”. Talks between US officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin last week also failed to reach a breakthrough. The threats of a full Trump pull-out have come at a delicate time for Zelenskyy, whose army is on the back foot in the war-torn eastern Donbas region while a corruption scandal engulfs several of his close associates. The Ukrainian leader – who Trump has accused of not reading the plan – said yesterday the plan had been broken down into three documents – a framework 20-point agreement, and two separate papers: one on security guarantees and another on Ukraine’s post-war recovery. Earlier today, Zelenskyy said he had held an online meeting with US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to discuss Ukraine’s recovery. “This could be considered the first meeting of the group that will work on a document concerning reconstruction and economic recovery of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said on social media. “We have also updated our reflections on the 20 points of the framework document for ending the war. It is overall security that will determine economic security and underpin safe business environment,” he added. But US leader gave the latest in a series of hints that he may walk away from a conflict he blames on his predecessor Joe Biden, and which he once said he could end within 24 hours of returning to office in January. “Sometimes you have to let people fight it out and sometimes you don’t,” Trump said on Wednesday. “But the problem with letting people fight it out is yet you’re losing thousands of people a week. It’s ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous.” - © AFP 2025 To embed this post, copy the code below on your site 600px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-sends-us-updated-plan-to-end-war-with-russia-6900074-Dec2025/?embedpost=6900074&width=600&height=460" ></iframe> 400px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-sends-us-updated-plan-to-end-war-with-russia-6900074-Dec2025/?embedpost=6900074&width=400&height=460" ></iframe> 300px wide <iframe width="600" height="460" frameborder="0" style="border:0px;" src="https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/ukraine-sends-us-updated-plan-to-end-war-with-russia-6900074-Dec2025/?embedpost=6900074&width=300&height=460" ></iframe> Create an email alert based on the current article

Ukraine struck an oil tanker belonging to Russia’s so-called shadow fleet in the Black Sea on Wednesday, according to an official in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). A Ukrainian security source told CNN that Sea Baby maritime drones were used in a joint operation by the SBU and the navy. It was the third attack against Russian tankers in two weeks. Russia has been using hundreds of tankers, flying different flags, to clandestinely ship its oil to customers in defiance of Western sanctions. The Dashan tanker, which was flying the flag of the Comoro Islands, suffered “critical damage,” with preliminary information indicating the ship was “disabled,” the source said. There was no immediate comment from Russia. Video obtained by CNN shows a Sea Baby drone diving under the tanker before a series of explosions in the vessels’s stern area. Thick plumes of smoke then engulf the tanker. It was not immediately clear what cargo the vessel was carrying or whether the strike caused an oil spill. The ship was traveling at top speed through Ukraine’s exclusive economic zone, with its transponder turned off, when it was hit, the SBU source said. The vessel had been moving toward Russia’s Novorossiysk port terminal, a key Russian oil hub, the source added. The port was hit last month, when Ukraine struck one of Moscow’s largest oil export facilities. The attack, acknowledged by officials from both countries, marked an escalation of Kyiv’s efforts to target a key source of Russian war revenue. “The SBU continues to take active measures to reduce oil dollar revenues to the Russian budget,” the source said. The Ukrainian military operation follows a similar strike on two Russian shadow fleet tankers in late November. The SBU said the strike dealt a “significant blow to the transportation of Russian oil.” The latest Ukrainian assault followed US President Donald Trump claim Tuesday that Moscow has the “upper hand” in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine and that Kyiv is “losing” the war. Multiple Ukrainian and European officials have disputed Trump’s claims, although Ukraine’s position is acknowledged to be challenging. There are no new US or European assessments to suggest there have been significant changes on the battlefield that indicate Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces will triumph anytime soon, the officials told CNN. Meanwhile, talks over a US-proposed peace deal between Ukraine and Russia are continuing but have not achieved a breakthrough. US and Ukrainian delegations met virtually Wednesday to discuss plans for the reconstruction and economic development of Ukraine after the war with Russia ends, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a post on X. The US delegation included Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent; Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of BlackRock, according to the Ukrainian leader. “We discussed key elements for recovery, various mechanisms and visions for reconstruction. There are many ideas that, with the right approach, could succeed in Ukraine,” Zelensky said. The Ukrainians also “updated our reflections on the 20 points of the framework document for ending the war,” he said. Zelensky thanked Trump and his team “for their substantive work and support.” CNN’s Jim Sciutto contributed to this report. © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Title: US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates again as labour market risks grow

A divided US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates on Thursday for a third consecutive time this year, but signalled that it could hold off further reductions in the coming months. Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank is “well positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves from here”. The Fed’s statement on its decision also brought back language used in late-2024 to signal a pause in more rate cuts. Powell stressed that officials are in a good position to determine the “extent and timing of additional adjustments based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks”. Wednesday’s reduction by a quarter percentage point brings rates to a range between 3.50% and 3.75%, the lowest in around three years, a move aligned with market expectations. The Fed pencilled in one more rate cut next year, and flagged heightened risks to employment as it announced its latest decision. But a rift within the central bank deepened with three officials voting against the modest reduction. Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee joined Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid to support keeping rates unchanged. Fed governor Stephen Miran again backed a bigger, half-percentage-point cut. The Fed’s rate-setting committee has 12 voting members - including seven members of the board of governors, the New York Fed president and a rotation of reserve bank presidents - who take a majority vote in deciding on rates. Powell noted that some disagreement was expected, pointing to tensions between inflation risks and a weakening jobs market: “It’s a close call.” “Inflation is well above the Fed’s target, but the job market appears to be softening,” said Mortgage Bankers Association chief economist Mike Fratantoni in a statement. “Thus, there is ammunition for both sides of the debate” within the Fed, he added. For now, Powell said, the Fed is “in the high end of the range of neutral” rates, with neutral being a level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. The Fed has previously described interest rates as “modestly restrictive” - “neutral” could suggest less justification to lower levels quickly. “We expect the Fed will want to pause for a while to allow time to for this and prior cuts to feed through the economy,” said economist Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics. Powell added that the US economy needs several years where wages are higher than inflation for “people to start feeling good about affordability.” On Thursday, Fed officials also lifted their 2026 growth forecast, while easing inflation expectations and keeping their unemployment rate projection unchanged. These forecasts could shift as the central bank grapples with a delay in federal economic data releases after a record-long government shutdown. This week’s gathering is the last before 2026, a year of key changes for the bank. A new chief will arrive after Powell’s term ends in May, while political pressure mounts. On Thursday, Trump said the Fed could have “at least doubled” its rate cut. The president also signaled in a Politico interview published on Wednesday that he would judge Powell’s successor on whether they immediately slash rates. Interviews for his choice are entering the final stages, and Trump’s chief economic adviser Kevin Hassett is among top contenders. Miran’s term expires in January, creating an opening among the Fed’s top leadership. Trump has sought to free up another seat by attempting to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook too. Cook has challenged her ousting and the case remains before the courts. EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco noted that Hassett’s potential appointment and a “more hawkish rotation of voting members” focused more on taming inflation means a growing dispersion in views. “Policy deliberations are likely to become even more divided next year,” he said. - Agence France-Presse Are banks putting profits ahead of NZ's economic recovery?

PHOTO: EPA Summary AI generated Published Dec 11, 2025, 03:42 AM Updated Dec 11, 2025, 03:24 PM WASHINGTON – A divided US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates on Dec 10 for a third consecutive time in 2025, flagging labour market concerns even as inflation remained elevated as President Donald Trump’s tariffs bite. But the Fed pencilled in just one more rate cut in 2026 as chairman Jerome Powell signalled a higher bar for future reductions. Mr Powell told a press briefing that officials are in a good position to determine the “extent and timing of additional adjustments based on the incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks”. The Dec 10 cut by a quarter percentage point brings rates to a range between 3.5 per cent and 3.75 per cent, the lowest in around three years, a move aligned with market expectations. But a rift within the central bank deepened with three officials voting against the modest reduction. Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee and Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid instead sought to keep rates unchanged. Fed governor Stephen Miran backed a bigger, half-percentage-point cut. The Fed’s rate-setting committee consists of 12 voting members – including seven members of the board of governors, the New York Fed president and a rotation of reserve bank presidents – who take a majority vote in deciding the path of rates. Mr Powell noted that some disagreement was expected, pointing to tensions between inflation risks and a weakening jobs market. “It’s a close call,” he said. The most recent official data on unemployment and inflation is for September, and showed the US unemployment rate rising to 4.4 per cent from 4.3 per cent, while the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation also increased slightly to 2.8 per cent from 2.7 per cent. The Fed has a 2 per cent inflation target, but the pace of price increases has risen steadily from 2.3 per cent in April, a fact at least partly attributable to the pass-through of higher US tariffs to consumers and a driving force behind the central bank’s policy divide. Job and inflation data for November will be released next week, followed later by a detailed report of economic growth for the third quarter. For now, Mr Powell said the Fed is “in the range of neutral” rates, with neutral being a level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. The Fed has previously described interest rates as “restrictive” – “neutral” could suggest less justification to lower levels quickly. Job and inflation data for November will be released next week, followed later by a detailed report of economic growth for the third quarter. Mr Powell added that the US economy needs several years where wages are higher than inflation for “people to start feeling good about affordability.” Fed policymakers’ refreshed estimates also showed they expect inflation to slow to around 2.4 per cent by the end of 2026 even as economic growth accelerates to an above-trend 2.3 per cent and the unemployment rate remains at a moderate 4.4 per cent, an outlook that should dispel worries about potential stagflation that have persisted in 2025. These projections could shift as the central bank grapples with a delay in federal economic data releases after a record-long government shutdown. A contentious meeting that has multiple dissents is a “normal and healthy” sign, said Mr Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics. Still, “more cuts now imply fewer later”, he added in a note before the latest announcement. “The central bank will want time to gauge how past cuts are impacting the economy,” he said. This week’s gathering is the last before 2026, a year of key changes for the bank. A new chief will arrive after Mr Powell’s term ends in May, while political pressure mounts. Dr Miran’s term expires in January, creating an opening among the Fed’s top leadership, and Mr Trump has sought to free up another seat by attempting to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook. Dr Cook has challenged her ousting and the case remains before the courts – she continues to carry out her role in the meantime. In a Politico interview published on Dec 9, Mr Trump signalled he would judge Mr Powell’s successor on whether they immediately cut rates. Interviews for his choice are entering the final stages, with Mr Trump’s chief economic adviser, Mr Kevin Hassett, among top contenders. Others include former Fed official Kevin Warsh, Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and Mr Rick Rieder of BlackRock. “The challenge facing the Fed next year is the potential jobless expansion, when GDP (gross domestic product) increases but employment gains are modest, at best,” Mr Sweet said. “This leaves the economy vulnerable to shocks because the labour market is the main firewall against a recession,” he said.

Thursday, 11 Dec 2025 Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy attends a news conference, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine August 23, 2022.REUTERS/Gleb Garanich Dec 10 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiysaid on Wednesday Ukraine had agreed on key points of a reconstruction plan for his country rooted in principles of solid security in discussions with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other senior U.S. officials. Zelenskiy, accompanied in the discussions by Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, other officials and senior military officers, said the talks focused on an "economic document". Also taking part from the U.S. side were President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. "The principles of the economic document are completely clear and we are fully aligned with the American side," he said. "An important common principle is that for reconstruction to be of high quality and economic growth after this war to be tangible, real security must be at the core. When there is security, everything else is there too." Zelenskiy said work was proceeding on the "fundamental document" of 20 points aimed at ending the war now approaching the fourth anniversary of Russia's 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbour. He said two other associated documents dealt with security guarantees and economic issues. The leaders of Britain, France and Germany held a call on Wednesday with Trump to discuss Washington's latest peace efforts to end the war in Ukraine, in what they said was "a critical moment" in the process. Members of the "Coalition of the Willing" group of nations backing Ukraine, led by European Union member states, are to meet on Thursday, the French presidency said.

The BitMine Immersion Technologies chairman—also the chief investment officer at Fundstrat—said the Ethereum treasury firm has been “putting its money where its mouth is” of late, adding heavily to its balance sheet at Ethereum’s current prices. “BitMine believes Ethereum has already bottomed,” said Lee during a video interview with Farokh Sarmad, president of Dastan, Decrypt’s parent company. “Compared to two weeks ago, the amount of Ethereum we’re buying is more than double.” The Ethereum treasury firm has massively added to its position of late, acquiring more than 138,452 ETH last week, or about $460 million worth of the prominent crypto asset. That marks BitMine’s largest purchase since it added more than 200,000 ETH in October—all part of its stated quest to acquire 5% of the circulating Ethereum supply. As of Wednesday, the firm holds around 3.864 million ETH, or about 3.2% of the circulating Ethereum supply, a haul that makes it the largest publicly traded Ethereum treasury and the second-largest crypto treasury of all with $12.85 billion worth of ETH. In terms of all crypto treasuries, BitMine trails only Bitcoin behemoth Strategy, which holds more than $61 billion worth of BTC. BitMine also holds 193 Bitcoin valued around $18 million, and $1 billion in cash. While both assets have fallen from all-time highs, Ethereum is leading the recent rebound, jumping about 8% in the last seven days to change hands at $3,376. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is roughly even over the last week, recently trading at $92,248. The BMNR frontman said he thinks both assets could have big moves before year’s end. Previously Lee had predicted as high as $150,000 for BTC before the end of 2025, though he softened his stance in the final week of November as BTC continued to trade below $100,000, adding that it could “maybe” still reach the $150,000 mark. Regardless, Lee and BitMine are more excited about Ethereum’s future over the next 10-15 years, particularly as Wall Street has embraced the layer-1 network and its place in the future of finance. “The reason to be excited about Ethereum is Wall Street is choosing to use the blockchain for the future,” said Lee. “It started with stablecoins, and it was a big ‘aha’ moment for Wall Street… but that’s just tokenizing a dollar. Now Wall Street wants to tokenize everything, and they’re not going to build it on Bitcoin—they need a smart contract platform.” That mirrors the narrative being shared by Larry Fink and Rob Goldstein, executives from global investment firm BlackRock, who said last week that tokenization is “the next major evolution in market infrastructure.” Ethereum is at the forefront of that trend, home to $12.1 billion in tokenized real world assets or nearly 66% of the distributed asset share, according to data from RWA.xyz.

Vanguard’s decision to open access to spot crypto ETFs marks a major shift from its earlier anti-crypto stance and gives more than 50 million clients a regulated path to gain exposure to digital assets. The firm will allow trading of approved third-party ETFs tied to BTC, ETH, XRP and SOL while avoiding memecoins or unregulated tokens and choosing not to launch its own crypto products. The move brings significant institutional legitimacy to crypto and shows that even traditionally conservative asset managers cannot overlook sustained demand for regulated exposure to digital assets. Vanguard’s embrace of crypto reflects a broader institutional trend. Major financial institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Bank of America have already integrated crypto products as part of diversified investment offerings. In a major boost for digital assets, Vanguard is set to grant its large client base access to spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The move gives more than 50 million investors a convenient on-ramp and adds institutional legitimacy to cryptocurrencies. Vanguard’s decision to support regulated crypto products signals how the asset class has matured. This shift could contribute to broader interest in crypto and may influence how some investors evaluate their portfolio options. As one of the most conservative firms in traditional finance expands access to digital assets, the broader market may view crypto as a more accepted and stable part of diversified investment strategies. This article discusses the crypto ETFs now available through Vanguard, why this change in Vanguard’s policy is significant, how it reflects a broader institutional trend and how the move could influence global crypto markets. Vanguard has altered its policy of staying away from crypto ETFs. The asset manager will now give its clients access to third-party crypto ETFs and mutual funds that invest in selected underlying cryptocurrencies. These include Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP) and Solana (SOL). The products are traded on regulated crypto exchanges, much like ETFs backed by gold. As of early December 2025, Vanguard will refrain from issuing its own crypto ETFs or mutual funds. The firm’s approach is consistent with its policy of providing but not creating gold ETFs. It will not offer products linked to memecoins or unregulated tokens, which it continues to regard as overly speculative for its platform. In a client advisory, Vanguard noted that the chosen ETFs have endured market volatility, operated as intended and preserved liquidity. Vanguard’s educational resources continue to describe cryptocurrencies as a highly volatile asset category and emphasize that investing carries risks. According to a Vanguard spokesperson, the company serves millions of investors with diverse needs and risk profiles and aims to provide a brokerage platform that gives clients the ability to invest in products they choose. Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, quoted Vanguard on how the ETFs have performed as designed through multiple periods of volatility. This policy shift by Vanguard is likely to impact the core strategies and long-term returns for millions of investors. The change could also redefine the accessibility and structure of popular diversified portfolios. As of Oct. 31, 2025, Vanguard was offering 224 funds in the US, including variable annuity portfolios, and 228 funds in international markets. Offering crypto ETFs on such an extensive platform will have two key consequences: It broadens the number of investors who can gain exposure to cryptocurrency prices without leaving conventional brokerage services. It signals that regulated crypto offerings are becoming difficult for major financial firms to overlook. Vanguard’s action comes across as a cautious initial step rather than full adoption. The firm notes that availability through Vanguard may lead to more demand for BTC and other prominent assets. This does not imply that more than 50 million individuals will immediately purchase crypto ETFs. Access does not equal investment. It does, however, reduce barriers for interested investors who want regulated access to crypto ETFs. Did you know? Crypto ETFs allow investors to gain price exposure to digital assets without holding the coins directly. They track cryptocurrencies and offer a regulated way to enter crypto markets through familiar brokerage accounts instead of crypto wallets or exchanges. Until early 2025, Vanguard was a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance. Former CEO Tim Buckley often argued that spot Bitcoin ETFs “do not belong… in a long-term portfolio” for retirement savers and described Bitcoin as “too volatile,” “not a store of value” and a “speculative asset.” In 2024, Buckley stated that Vanguard would not support crypto products until Bitcoin changes as an asset class. In light of this perspective, the current policy change under new management stands out. It reflects a positive response to ongoing client demand as Vanguard investors watched competitors such as BlackRock and Fidelity receive significant inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock’s physical Bitcoin ETF made history on March 1 by reaching $10 billion in assets under management. It set a new record as the fastest ETF to reach that milestone. Less than three weeks later, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF climbed even higher and held $15.9 billion in assets under management. These figures illustrate how crypto ETFs have operated during their early adoption phase. They provide daily liquidity and integrate into standard portfolio processes despite the volatility of the underlying assets. According to a Bloomberg report, Vanguard’s head of brokerage and investments said that crypto ETFs and mutual funds have operated exactly as intended. They continued to function smoothly even during periods of significant market volatility. Hunter Rogers, co-founder of global Bitcoin yield protocol TeraHash, said, “Naturally, that could accelerate the further legitimization of crypto as part of diversified portfolios.” Did you know? Crypto ETFs can trade on major exchanges just like stock or gold ETFs. This means investors can buy or sell them during market hours and benefit from intraday liquidity. Vanguard’s shift aligns with a broader trend in late 2025: Bank of America has expanded crypto access for its wealth management clients, with internal analyses recommending modest 1%-4% allocations for suitable risk-aware investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have drawn tens of billions of dollars in total inflows since early 2024 and rank among the most successful ETF debuts ever. Their performance confirms sustained demand from both individual and institutional investors. These developments show that some investors are beginning to treat cryptocurrencies as potential thematic allocations. Expanded access could also heighten price fluctuations during major economic events, as ETF investments will carry conventional market views into cryptocurrency trading. Did you know? Institutional adoption of crypto ETFs has surged because they fit into compliance-friendly frameworks. Pension funds, asset managers and advisory platforms can access cryptocurrencies without building compatible custody systems. Vanguard’s decision to offer access to crypto ETFs may influence how retail and institutional investors approach the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The move may also alter market dynamics and liquidity across major digital assets. Cryptocurrency markets may react as Vanguard clients explore the new ETF options. The move could draw additional attention from investors who choose to allocate a portion of their portfolios to crypto ETFs. However, many Vanguard clients are conservative, retirement-oriented savers who may not welcome the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies. For clients who are willing to invest in crypto ETFs, adding these assets to their portfolios may expand available choices. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Some 2,500 homes and businesses still without power Around 90 flights cancelled or delayed across all Irish airports yesterday, while all ferries were suspended during the storm Status Orange wind alerts lifted from all areas last night as clean-up operation got into gear Storm Bram causes disruption, damage and power cuts across the country Forecasters have issued a fresh wind warning for three counties as the Storm Bram recovery and clean-up continues. Crews are currently working to restore power to the remaining 2,500 homes and businesses left without connection. Almost 60,000 premises were left without power at the height of the storm and thousands of commuters were hit by cancelled flights, ferries and trains as well as road closures. The south Atlantic storm significantly strengthened as it approached the Irish coast early yesterday morning and struck with powerful wind gusts of almost 120kmh. Now, forecasters have issued a Status Yellow wind warning for Galway, Mayo and Kerry. The warning will be in place overnight from midnight tonight until 7am on Thursday morning. Forecasters are warning of “strong and gusty southerly winds mainly affecting coastal parts.” Ireland is now on high alert for flooding amid fears the heavy rainfall associated with Storm Bram – combined with torrential rainfall over the weekend – will cause rivers and streams to break their banks. Irish Rail has said that all routes are back operational today. “A full schedule of services will operate on all routes today,” an Irish Rail spokesperson said in a statement on X. Flight operations at Dublin Airport are also "largely back to normal" this morning after what was described as a "day of significant disruption" yesterday. More than 100 flights were cancelled by airlines yesterday, and 20 flights were diverted to other airports. Today will be busier than usual for the staff, with more passengers at terminals due to their rebooked flights departing today. Meanwhile, a number of flights were also cancelled this morning following the disruption yesterday. A spokesperson for Dublin Airport, Graeme McQueen, told the Irish Independent: "Flight operations at Dublin Airport are largely back to normal this morning following a day of significant disruption yesterday due to Storm Bram." "In total, more than 100 flights were cancelled by airlines on Tuesday, while 20 flights diverted to other airports, before returning later in the day once the challenging winds had eased." Mr McQueen continued: "The Dublin Airport team worked hard through the night to help airlines prepare for this morning's busy first wave of flights, which has departed as normal, with only a very small number of cancelled flights on the departures board." "Today will be busier than it normally would have been in the terminals with many passengers who were discommoded on Tuesday being re-accommodated on flights leaving today. "We thank passengers for their patience and understanding yesterday in what were challenging circumstances due to the adverse weather conditions. "As always, passengers seeking updates on the status of their flight today should contact their airline directly," he added. Fortunately, major flood damage was avoided at high tides yesterday despite the sea surge associated with Bram as flood defences nationwide proved effective. Cork city suffered the worst of the flooding with some city centre quays closed and a number of low-lying roads outside the city proving impassable though no major property damage was reported. Flooding hit Waterford’s Plunkett railway station where operations had to be suspended after the tracks became totally submerged. Coastal flooding was also reported in Tramore and Dungarvan in Waterford as well as Blackrock in Louth and Clontarf in Dublin. Crews work to clear a fallen tree from Killarney Road in Bray during Storm Bram. Photo: Owen Breslin Waterford City and County director of services Gabriel Hynes told RTÉ the storm had brought an “extremely hazardous day”. He said there were coastal surges and overtopping, but storm barriers had been put up in the centre of Waterford city, which had protected the area. However, areas such as Tramore and Dungarvan had experienced flooding and waves overtopping but no significant damage. ESB Networks said crews have been working since first light to restore power to all homes, farms and businesses affected by Storm Bram. As of 5.00pm today, approximately 2,500 customers remain without supply predominately in the Southeast region. "ESB Networks moved crews from other areas of the country today to assist colleagues in the Southeast region to reconnect customers as fast as they safely can,” a statement said. "Crews will continue to work late into the evening to restore supply but due to the damage to the electricity network, a small number of customers in the region will be without power overnight and we apologise for the particular difficulty this causes. “Customers without power can check for real-time updates on when their fault is expected to be repaired at www.powercheck.ie. “If you come across fallen wires or damaged electricity network, never, ever touch or approach these as they are LIVE and extremely dangerous. Please report any damage to electricity infrastructure by calling 1800 372 999. Customers should have their MPRN available to access recorded information specific to their location." Status Orange wind alerts were lifted from all areas last night as the clean-up operation got into gear. Wind gusts of almost 120kmh were reported in some coastal waters as a Status Red alert was in place for all marine areas, with the south and west feeling the worst of Bram’s fury. This was later downgraded to a Status Orange marine alert. Sea swells caused extensive damage to the carpark at Doolin Pier in Co Clare. Photo: Press 22 A total of 70 schools remained closed or shut early because of the storm, all in exposed coastal areas of Munster and Connacht. The Department of Education said the decision to close rested entirely with local school boards of management who made such decisions based on local advice and the safety of school transport operations.

Photo: Gerry Mooney Multiple public attractions were closed yesterday because of the safety threat posed by Storm Bram including the Cliffs of Moher in Clare. Many outdoor Christmas lights attractions will undergo safety checks before re-opening today. The Punchestown race meeting planned for yesterday will now be staged tomorrow. Water Safety Ireland and the Coast Guard urged people to avoid exposed coastal areas and to exercise extreme caution near lakes, rivers and streams over the coming days as most waterways will be transformed into raging torrents. Met Éireann warned Ireland will experience unsettled weather over the coming days in the wake of Storm Bram. “This mobile Atlantic regime will continue to bring unsettled and mixed conditions over the coming days with spells of wet and windy weather but also some drier and brighter spells,” a forecaster said.

Tether, the company behind the $186 billion USDT stablecoin, is moving further beyond its crypto roots with a privacy-focused health and wellness app. On Wednesday, the firm rolled out QVAC Health, built on its AI development platform and designed to bring control to users tracking their fitness, nutrition and biometric data across devices. The app lets users monitor their health data — like step counters, sleep trackers, workout apps — and keep them offline and encrypted on their personal devices without passing through commercial servers or being harvested for advertising, the firm said. "QVAC Health reflects the company’s commitment to privacy-preserving local intelligence," Tether CEO Paolo Arodino said. "You shouldn’t have to choose between using the best hardware on the market and maintaining your privacy. We are breaking down the walls between Big Tech ecosystems so you can own the full picture of your health." The move marks Tether’s latest push into decentralized technology infrastructure and artificial intelligence (AI), expanding beyond finance and digital assets. Tether has built QVAC, a decentralized AI platform to deploy agents and applications that can fully run on devices, bypassing centralized cloud infrastructures. Earlier this week, Tether said it invested in an Italy-based company Generative Bionics as part of the startup's 70 million euros ($81.5 million) fundraising round. The firm develops intelligent humanoid robots with advanced artificial intelligence, with plans for industrial deployment as early as next year. Before that, Tether bought a majority stake in Blackrock Neurotech, a brain-computer interface company, for $200 million.

Title: Bitcoin Roars Back To $94K — Traders Rush In As FOMO Explodes: Data

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin climbed to a three-week high on Tuesday before slipping back, a move that has traders and analysts watching closely. According to TradingView data, Bitcoin price topped out at $94,600 late in the session — its highest level since November 25 — then eased to about $92,450 at the time of reporting. Santiment, a blockchain analytics firm, said social chatter calling for “higher” and “above” exploded during the spike, but market action remained uneven. Reports have disclosed that the surge drew heavy retail attention and a flurry of social-media posts urging more buying. Some market watchers questioned how organic the rise was. A well-known long-term investor using the handle “NoLimit” told his 53,000 X followers that the $94,000 push looked engineered: big buys packed into a few minutes, thin order books, then little follow-through. 🤑 Bitcoin enjoyed a much needed rebound back to $94.6K today, reinvigorating traders, causing them to FOMO back in and expect higher prices. According to our social data scraping X, Reddit, Telegram, & other data, calls for “higher” & “above” exploded. 🟦 High bars indicate… pic.twitter.com/o3U3yWkwkk — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 9, 2025 That pattern, he argued, is how larger traders can create short-term fear of missing out so they can sell into strength. Santiment also highlighted a behavioral twist: smaller traders appear to pile in after spikes, often leaving them on the wrong side of moves. Volatility followed the high, as prices pulled back by a couple thousand dollars within hours. Exchange order depth and timing of large blocks, analysts say, matter a lot when liquidity is shallow. The US central bank meeting this week is a key wildcard. Market pricing on CME Group futures showed an 88% chance of a 0.25% rate cut, which many traders think helped fuel the rally. Yet some analysts warned that any sign of hesitation about future cuts could dampen risk appetite. Beyond US policy, next week’s potential Bank of Japan rate action is being watched because a tighter stance there could lift yields and pull capital back to Japan, tightening global liquidity. That kind of flow can pressure risky assets across markets. Meanwhile, long-term holders pared back supply after a 36% correction from the all-time high, and some addresses now hold levels seen in March. Jessica Gonzales, an analyst cited in reports, said M2 money supply sits at about $22.3 trillion and stablecoin reserves remain elevated, suggesting there is capital around but not necessarily evenly distributed in markets. Institutional moves also feature: big firms such as BlackRock and Strategy have expanded crypto exposure, which could add a steadier buyer base — or simply shift where risk sits. Short-term traders should track order-book depth, large trade clusters, and how price reacts to any Fed wording about future cuts. The next 25 days were flagged as especially important by several observers because liquidity swings and regulatory updates could flip the narrative fast. If a true broad-based bid forms, prices could move quickly. If the Fed signals caution, the opposite could happen.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects.

Title: Trump’s final round of interviews with Fed chair candidates set to start this week — as markets bet on Kevin Hassett: reports

President Trump is slated to start his final round of interviews this week for a new Federal Reserve chairman to replace Jerome Powell, with top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett viewed as the frontrunner, according to reports. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent were set to conduct the first of the interviews on Wednesday, starting with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, two sources told CNBC. “We’re going to be looking at a couple different people, but I have a pretty good idea of who I want,” the president told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday. Along with Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, the top candidates for Fed chair reportedly include Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, along with BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder. Markets are heavily betting on Trump to pick Hassett as the president looks for someone to slash rates at a speedy pace. A CNBC survey in December showed 84% of respondents believe Trump will choose Hassett. Prediction markets like Polymarket also show Hassett in the lead – though most bettors are placing money on Trump not naming any candidate by the end of the year. Having held key White House roles in both Trump administrations, along with working for Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner’s private equity firm, Hassett is widely viewed as the contender with the closest relationship to the president. “Personnel decisions to be made by President Trump will be announced directly by President Trump himself,” White House spokesman Kush Desai told The Post in a statement. “Any discussion until then is pointless speculation.” The upcoming round of interviews comes after a handful of meetings with potential candidates were abruptly canceled last week. Earlier this month, Trump told reporters that he knows his top pick to replace Powell, so it’s unclear if this week’s interviews are just the last step in the process or if the president has changed his mind. Trump, who nominated Powell during his first term, has railed against the chairman for months for not slashing interest rates quickly enough. Powell’s term expires in May 2026. Investors have been concerned about Hassett taking the position over fears that he would simply follow Trump’s orders. But the candidate said this week that he would not make his interest-rate decisions based on political pressure. When asked this week if he would listen to orders from Trump on Truth Social to slash rates, Hassett said: “You just do the right thing.” “Suppose that inflation has gotten from, say, 2.5% to 4%. You can’t cut,” Hassett said during a Wall Street Journal event on Tuesday. He said he would rely on his own “judgement, which I think the president trusts, and the firm commitment to not being partisan.” Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. “Powell is likely going to become a lame duck fairly quickly,” Christian Hoffmann, head of fixed income at Thornburg Investment Management, said in a note Wednesday. “Hassett appears to be the preferred candidate … and an announcement should come early in the new year, potentially less than a month from now,” Hoffmann added. “That introduces the concept of a ‘shadow Fed,’ with a prospective chair offering opinions or taking potshots from the sidelines.” The Fed is largely expected to cut interest rates again during its meeting on Wednesday. It would be its third consecutive cut so far this year. But investors and economists expect Powell to urge caution ahead. The Fed’s forecast in September only called for a single interest-rate cut in 2026. And policymakers are grappling with a mixed bag of economic data, including stubbornly high inflation, over 1.1 million layoffs planned for this year and a hiring slump. Central bankers are also missing some key economic reports after the record-breaking autumn government shutdown placed a halt on data collection. Advertisement

Title: PNC Bank just launched direct Bitcoin trading, but one specific restriction effectively holds your digital assets hostage

PNC's agency model with Coinbase spotlights a secure path for Bitcoin adoption amid complex regulations. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. PNC Bank, a US banking giant with more than $569 billion in assets under management (AUM), has embedded spot Bitcoin trading into its private banking platform, marking a distinct pivot in the institutional adoption cycle. This makes it the first top-10 US lender to allow clients to buy, sell, and hold digital assets directly alongside their checking accounts. The integration, powered by a partnership with Coinbase, arrives nearly two years after the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs fundamentally altered the market’s structure. Since early 2024, products from BlackRock and Fidelity have dominated flows by offering low-fee, liquid exposure wrapped in a familiar brokerage structure. PNC is offering an alternative route. They are wagering that mass-affluent and high-net-worth clients will value the operational cohesion of a single banking dashboard over the razor-thin efficiency of an ETF. William S. Demchak, PNC’s chairman and CEO, said the bank is positioning Bitcoin not as an outlier asset requiring a separate app, but as a component of a holistic financial life. He added: “As client interest in digital assets continues to grow, our responsibility is to offer secure and well-designed options that fit within the broader context of their financial lives.” The immediate question for market observers is where this new offering fits in the existing distribution map. Spot ETFs have successfully commoditized Bitcoin exposure, driving fees down to the 20-basis-point range. Historically, bank-integrated trading has operated under a different economic logic. While PNC has not disclosed its fee schedule, bank-facilitated access to volatile asset classes typically carries a premium—a cost borne by the client in exchange for convenience and integration. This becomes a live experiment in how far convenience can stretch pricing power. If PNC’s wealth clients adopt the service despite costs that may exceed ETF access, it would imply that the real barrier has never been fees, but the procedural drag of opening outside accounts or maintaining separate crypto wallets. However, the scale of this experiment should not be overstated relative to the ETF market. The spot ETFs are highly liquid instruments integrated into the daily workflows of thousands of Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) and institutional trading desks. A private bank offering, by definition, is a “walled garden.” It is an additive channel, likely serving a specific demographic of wealthy investors who prefer relationship-based management over self-directed trading, rather than a direct challenger to the ETF complex’s dominance. The strongest argument for the bank model lies in workflow integration. For high-net-worth individuals, financial fragmentation is a genuine risk. Holding assets across a constellation of fintech apps, legacy brokerages, and bank accounts creates “dashboard blindness,” making it difficult to assess total liquidity or rebalance risk effectively. By folding Bitcoin execution into the primary banking interface, PNC addresses this visibility gap. It allows wealth advisors to view the client’s digital asset exposure in real-time alongside real estate, cash, and fixed income. This could theoretically elevate the conversation from simple access (“How do I buy Bitcoin?”) to strategic allocation (“How does this position affect my overall portfolio volatility?”). The integration also leverages a “trust premium.” While trust in crypto-native intermediaries has fluctuated, the banking sector retains a perceived safety advantage for older and more conservative capital. Although PNC’s arrangement is strictly agency-based, keeping Bitcoin off the bank’s balance sheet, the institution’s imprimatur still carries weight. Clients are, in effect, leaning on PNC’s vendor-risk machinery to assess Coinbase, shifting the due diligence burden that often keeps family offices and endowments at a distance. Structurally, the deal highlights the pragmatic path US banks are carving through a complex regulatory landscape. Direct balance sheet exposure to Bitcoin remains expensive under current Basel III capital rules, which assign punitive risk weights to crypto assets. Consequently, PNC has adopted an agency model, effectively white-labeling Coinbase’s infrastructure while retaining the client relationship. The arrangement suggests that US regulators, specifically the OCC, are willing to tolerate banks acting as gateways to the asset class, provided strict separation exists between the bank’s deposits and the crypto assets. Meanwhile, this is not an endorsement of crypto by federal regulators, but rather an acknowledgment that consumer demand is persistent and perhaps safer when routed through regulated banking entities. For Coinbase, this reinforces a strategic pivot from a consumer-focused exchange to a B2B infrastructure utility for traditional finance. If this model proliferates, liquidity could increasingly concentrate among a few massive custodians serving a network of bank front-ends. While the launch is significant, the utility of bank-held Bitcoin remains constrained compared to the crypto-native ecosystem. Pierre Rochard, CEO of The Bitcoin Bond Company, observed that while the current functionality is limited to buy, hold, and sell, “eventually PNC clients will demand deposit and withdrawal.” Currently, the product’s “walled garden” nature means assets cannot be easily moved on-chain or transferred to self-custody without liquidation. Furthermore, while the narrative of “bank-grade” Bitcoin implies future utility, such as collateralized lending, no major US bank currently offers Bitcoin-backed lines of credit, and regulatory clarity on such products is nonexistent. For now, PNC has opened a new door for a specific type of capital—money that was never going to navigate a crypto exchange or perhaps even a self-directed brokerage account. As Bitwise analyst Juan Leon termed it: “[This is the] Mainstream era: crypto x tradfi integrations.” Whether that integration generates meaningful volume or remains a niche service for the ultra-wealthy will depend entirely on whether the bank’s convenience can justify the price of admission.

Today’s top news: Bitcoin has been sliding, sentiment has been deep in Fear mode, and Crypto Twitter has been panicking. But one major bank isn’t concerned. JPMorgan analysts published new guidance pushing back against the idea that the latest drawdown marks a return to crypto winter. In fact, the bank says this is just a “meaningful correction,” not the start of a new bear market. They pointed to several short-term drivers behind the recent sell-off: The bank stressed that none of these dynamics signal a structural breakdown in crypto demand. And importantly, they noted that institutional interest, real-world adoption, and tokenization efforts remain intact. “The sell-off this past month triggered worries throughout crypto media and markets that the crypto ecosystem may be entering the next crypto winter. While we don’t anticipate the end of the current bull cycle, we do acknowledge this November pullback as meaningful.” “Overall, we struggle to see these recent market pullbacks as emblematic of broader structural degradation within the crypto ecosystem, and thus we continue to be positive on the space.” - JPMorgan analysts “This time really is different. We think crypto winters are a thing of the past.” - Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets JPMorgan’s overall message is pretty simple: prices may have dropped, but the crypto bull thesis hasn’t changed. They remain laser-focused on the major forces playing out in the crypto sector - ETF inflows, tokenization initiatives, bank participation, stablecoin growth. All of those big-picture fundamental indicators are still moving forward (and one could argue that they’re accelerating). And more broadly, both JPMorgan and BlackRock are bullish stocks (especially AI) into 2026, with BlackRock going full risk-on mode. So their macro view is bullish as well. That means the only real crypto bear case remaining is four-year cycle seasonality. Unfortunately, this latest drawdown lined up nearly perfectly with a 4-year cycle view and thus bears are in control. Until they aren’t. If/when prices do grind back up to near ATHs, the bull case that JPMorgan (and many others) has laid out will be shining brighter than ever. And 4-year truthers will have a hard decision to make. And with the Fed meeting on deck today, that catalyst to ignite the run back to ATH could be here sooner than later.
