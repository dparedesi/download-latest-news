This could be construed as something of a dead rubber. There is certainly not as much on the line as has been the case in recent last-day Six Nations meetings, most notably a year ago when Ireland’s taut 15-12 triumph over Scotland in Belfast secured third place and as a result automatic qualification for both the World Cup and WXV 1. There would be a world of difference in securing third place with a commanding third win out of five games 12 months on and rubber-stamping the huge strides taken by this Irish team in the last year. Finishing third a year ago was a welcome upgrade on losing all five matches and earning the wooden spoon in 2023, but for starters it was achieved with two wins out of five and was indebted to Italy beating Wales on the final day in Cardiff. There will be no good fortune or favours required to finish third this year if Ireland secure a third win out of three away games in this year’s Six Nations. What’s more, were Ireland to win as convincingly as they did against Italy in Parma in round two, especially, and Wales in Newport last Sunday, it would emphatically endorse their standing as “the best of the rest” and the biggest challengers to the upper strata of England and France. In truth, Ireland need to be more clinical than they were against Wales when leaving at least two or three tries behind through handing errors. This is no more than they would have said among themselves and it was reflected in the palpably anticlimactic reaction immediately afterwards of Scott Bemand, who previously worked with an English side that is nearly always ruthlessly clinical in such circumstances. Although the defeats to France and England hurt, the disappointment was relative, not least as Ireland were significantly more competitive in both fixtures than they had been in the corresponding fixtures in recent years. In its way, last week’s lack of satisfaction despite posting more than 40 points away from home was the first bump in the road in this Six Nations and is also a reflection of the huge progress this team has made in the last year and a half. Ireland are making serious progress but nowhere is this belief more important than among the players and staff themselves. There will be a long four months to stew on this Six Nations before Ireland play their World Cup warm-up games in August, and how they sign off in Edinburgh will go some way toward determining how they view this Six Nations and how real the advances have been. Even a laboured performance and win could serve to undermine the team’s self-belief and call into question the strides taken up to now on an almost game-by-game basis through the wins over Australia, New Zealand and the USA and in this championship. [ UL Bohemian duo Aoife Corey and Jane Clohessy in line for first Ireland caps against ScotlandOpens in new window ] By contrast, were Ireland to be more clinical in the Scottish 22 than they were a week ago and thus complete a convincing, statement win against opponents who have caused them issues and even some pain in recent years, it would fuel the team’s self-belief over the ensuing months and into the World Cup build-up. With the World Cup in mind, a six-day turnaround is always an issue and, coupled with injuries, is beginning to highlight Ireland’s lack of real depth were Bemand and co required to dig much deeper, but this is still a good side. The loss of the hugely influential Erin King for this Six Nations and the World Cup is a cruel blow, not least for the player herself. Even so, Ireland can still field a fairly complete backrow in Dorothy Wall, Edel McMahon and Brittany Hogan. There’s also enough quality on a bench featuring Cliodhna Moloney, a second potential debutant in Jane Clohessy, daughter of Peter, Emily Lane, Eve Higgins and Stacey Flood, who will feel she has a point to prove; it looks well equipped to add impact and see the team through. Ireland exorcised a few demons in Parma and need to do so again having lost here by 36-10 two years ago. Scotland will be fired up after their results to date. But Ireland have won 15 of their last 17 Six Nations matches against Scotland and reasserting that authority with a third win in the championship for the first time since 2020 would seal the most positive season in years.

Title: How To Price Bitcoin? BlackRock Exec Explains

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin should be valued as “an uncorrelated asset that benefits when the world gets messier,” BlackRock’s US Head of Equity ETFs Jay Jacobs told CNBC in an interview on Thursday. “Crypto over the long run is decoupled from US tech stocks,” Jacobs said, stressing that short-term market stress can mask the difference but that “the long-term correlation between US stocks and Bitcoin is more like two or three percent.” He argued that what pushes equities higher—“higher growth, higher certainty, lower geopolitical risk”—is the mirror image of the forces that move Bitcoin. “Bitcoin thrives when you have more uncertainty and are looking for something that’s going to behave differently, so fundamentally they should behave like an uncorrelated asset.” BTC was changing hands just under $94,000 during Jacobs’ appearance, extending a rally that has added roughly 150% since spot-ETF approvals early last year. Jacobs tied price behaviour directly to flows. “We would think over the long term, if this trajectory of greater uncertainty around the world continues, things like gold and Bitcoin should continue to go up.” He noted that investors are repositioning accordingly: “We’ve seen significant inflows into gold ETFs; we’ve seen significant inflows into Bitcoin, and this is all because people are looking for those assets that will behave differently.” The biggest beneficiary has been BlackRock’s own iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which on 23 April absorbed $643 million of net creations—its largest one-day haul since January—lifting the fund’s assets to roughly $54 billion. Jacobs framed the rush into hard assets as part of a longer geopolitical realignment. “If you look at central banks around the world, a continued movement towards diversification beyond just holding dollars is something that’s been happening for decades… the switch from just holding dollars to holding gold to looking at other types of assets like Bitcoin is a trend that’s been years in the making.” Central-bank gold purchases illustrate the shift: net buying topped 1,044 tonnes in 2024, the third consecutive year above the thousand-tonne mark, double the average of the previous decade. He linked those reserve moves to BlackRock’s 2023 “mega-forces” framework, which identified geopolitical fragmentation as a secular driver of returns. “That mega force is materialising in policies like reshoring in the United States and, I think, directly related to that fragmentation has been the rise of things like Bitcoin, as people see more destabilisation in geopolitics resulting in the need for more alternative assets.” BlackRock’s influence is difficult to overstate: the firm ended the first quarter with a record $11.6 trillion under management. By pairing that scale with a public thesis that Bitcoin’s fair price rises as uncertainty deepens, the asset-manager is effectively codifying a valuation model in which scarcity and sanction-resistance—not discounted cash flows—set the marginal price. As Jacobs put it, the market is “looking for alternatives—parts of the portfolio that are going to behave separately from stocks and bonds.” With IBIT now swallowing more BTC each day than miners can produce post-halving, his remarks may offer the clearest blueprint yet for how the world’s largest asset manager thinks about pricing the world’s largest cryptocurrency. At press time, BTC traded at $94,510. Jake Simmons, a dedicated crypto journalist, has been passionate about Bitcoin since 2016 when he first learned about it.

Title: LIC, GQG, MFs LIC, lead $3.7 billion investment surge in Adani Group post-Hindenburg

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai: Investor confidence in Adani group companies appears to have climbed significantly following a generally favourable verdict from India’s Supreme Court on the Hindenburg matter, and the subsequent closure of Hindenburg’s operations. During the fiscal year ended 31 March, Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners, Indian mutual funds (MFs), and domestic retail investors together injected approximately $3.7 billion or ₹32,571 crore into the group’s 10 listed companies, an analysis by Mint of data from BSE showed. To be sure, during the same fiscal, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold shares worth ₹33,945 crore across Adani group firms, except in Adani Energy Solutions, AWL Agri Business and Adani Total Gas Ltd. In January 2023, US-based Hindenburg Research made a host of scathing allegations in a report against Adani group and its dealings while tagging the group for pulling the “biggest con in corporate history". However, following an apex court-monitored probe by market regulator Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) last year, the Supreme Court gave a largely favourable verdict for Adani group in January 2024. Subsequently, Hindenburg’s announcement of closure of its operations in January 2025 led to the rush by domestic investors to buy shares of Adani group companies, the analysis by Mint suggests. Also read | Adani Ports’ latest deal raises growth concerns—markets aren’t impressed Some other factors might have also helped in the resurgence of domestic investment in the group’s companies, according to experts. “Hindenburg shutdown, correction in valuation and, potentially, the progress in execution of Adani's key projects in power and infrastructure have played a major role in attracting investors," the head of equity capital markets at a large global financial services firm said on condition of anonymity. Several Adani companies saw their stocks lose between 12% and 50% in market value after an allegation by the US Department of Justice or DoJ of a New York district court in November 2024. The DoJ had alleged that Gautam Adani and a few other promoter family members and group officials had bribed Indian government officials $250 million to secure solar energy contracts and that it had not disclosed this to investors while raising money from American and international investors. Adani Group had refuted these allegations. Who bought how muchDuring the fiscal, LIC bought shares cumulatively worth around ₹3,575 crore across Adani Enterprises Ltd, Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd (APSEZ), Adani Energy Solutions Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and some others. Domestic MFs purchased shares worth at least ₹20,226 crore in almost all Adani group companies except in ACC Ltd and NDTV Ltd. GQG Partners, which indulged in a buying spree of Adani company shares after the Hindenburg attack in 2023, also resumed its purchases. In FY25, it increased its holding cumulatively by about 10% in Adani Enterprises, Adani Energy Solutions, Adani Green Energy Ltd (which was named in bribery allegations by the US Department of Justice or DoJ) and Adani Ports, worth at least ₹2,467 crore. Read this | BlackRock buys nearly third of Adani group promoters’ $1 bn private bonds Domestic retail investors together bought shares worth ₹6,303 crore in Adani group companies, increasing the most in Adani Green during the fiscal. In absolute terms, across all classes of investors, the most shares were bought of Adani's holding firm (Adani Enterprises), Ambuja Cements, and the group's ports (APSEZ) and power transmission (Adani Energy Solutions Ltd) businesses during the fiscal. Adani Group controls most of the major airports in India along with a large infrastructure portfolio managed through eight listed group companies. Breaking it downMFs increased their holding the most (in terms of value) in Adani Ports ( ₹5,464.92 crore) and Ambuja Cements ( ₹3,453.6 crore) during the financial year, which saw several acquisitions by the group in the ports and cement space. LIC and GQG, on the other hand, purchased the most in the group’s flagship Adani Enterprises, while retail investors bought the most in Adani Green Energy Ltd. Also read | Adani Green is weighing its biggest equity sale ever All four classes of investors put together purchased at least 51.91 million shares in Adani Energy Solutions, 50.84 million shares in Adani Ports, 19.19 million shares in Adani Enterprises and 39.7 million shares in Adani Green during fiscal 2025, according to the Mint study. Together, these investors bought shares worth ₹6,003 crore in Adani Green and ₹6,721 crore in Adani Ports alone. Earnings made a differenceAccording to a veteran market analyst who requested anonymity, MFs may have started seeing more value in Adani group stocks due to their earnings growth despite external events such as the allegations by DoJ in the US. He said in Adani's holding firm, the growth may have come from two incubation businesses—solar energy equipment manufacturing (under Adani New Industries Ltd or ANIL) and airports (under Adani Airport Holdings Ltd). “While ANIL's operating income was up 121% in the April-December period of FY25, the airports business operating profit went up 42% in the first nine months of FY25. The upcoming 500ktpa copper smelter will also add close to 10-15% to the existing operating income of Adani Enterprises," said the analyst. He said in the case of Adani Ports, the company's operating income grew by 19% for the April-December period, while the company increased guidance to ₹18,000 crore for FY25 after commencing operations at Vizhinjam, Kerala—India’s first trans-shipment port. Recently, the company commissioned a major ship terminal in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

The group's cement capacity increased from 78.9 mtpa last year to over 100 mtpa now. The capacity of Adani Green, which saw maximum investment from retail investors, grew 30% in FY25—14.2 GW from 11 GW, but the stock fell steeply after DoJ’s allegations. “Typically, the advantage of such businesses is that it can provide consistent cashflow, which by leveraging can be re-invested in similar projects. Also, the correction in stock prices of the group firms due to the DoJ allegations may have provided a good entry point for all investors," said the analyst. During fiscal 2025, prices of most Adani group firms corrected significantly on the bourses, with Adani Green stock falling by 48.25%, Adani Total Gas Ltd by 35%, Ambuja Cements by 12% and Adani Enterprises by 27.3%. Adani Energy Solutions, whose order book tripled since 31 March 2024 to ₹57,561 crore, saw its stock falling by 15% in fiscal 2025.

Title: Bitcoin ETF inflows hit $442M on April 24 as IBIT leads – Institutional demand fuels BTC rally

Could this underdog ETF soon rival Wall Street’s biggest giants? Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs are regaining momentum as the broader crypto market rebounds. According to data from Farside Investors, spot BTC ETFs witnessed a significant inflow of $442 million on the 24th of April alone. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) accounting for a massive $327.3 million of that total. This marks a consistent streak of inflows since the 17th of April, signaling renewed institutional confidence in Bitcoin. Riding this wave of optimism, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor has made a bold forecast, predicting that IBIT could outpace every other ETF to become the world’s largest within a decade. While such a claim might sound ambitious in a market still dominated by S&P 500 titans, it’s emblematic of Saylor’s long-standing conviction in Bitcoin’s ascent. Echoing similar sentiments, ETF Store President Nate Geraci noted, Source: Nate Geraci/X While BlackRock’s IBIT is still far from matching the scale of ETF giants like Vanguard’s VOO, which boasts over $573 billion in assets, its rapid ascent is hard to ignore. SPY and IVV remain comfortably above the $500 billion mark, but IBIT is gaining traction fast, with BlackRock now holding more than 582,000 BTC, valued at over $54.2 billion. This positions it just outside the top 35 ETFs by AUM, yet it’s already generating daily trading volumes exceeding 45 million shares. In a space where Bitcoin was once barely acknowledged by institutions, this surge signals a transformative shift. Adding to the momentum, U.S. spot BTC ETFs collectively saw a net inflow of 11,898 BTC in a single day, the highest since the 11th of November 2024. While Saylor’s bold predictions of Bitcoin reaching $13 million per coin may seem far-fetched, his history of early, unwavering conviction gives such statements unusual weight. After a period of muted flows, the recent spike in institutional Bitcoin activity signals a decisive shift in sentiment. Daily inflows that once averaged just 23 BTC in 2025 have now surged dramatically, reflecting renewed confidence from large-scale investors. This revival is vividly illustrated by Glassnode’s charts, where bold green bars have replaced the prior red streak, marking a clear break from the stagnation. The resulting uptick in demand has fueled Bitcoin’s price momentum, with BTC climbing to $93,734.12, up 10.86% over the past week. Such data underscores a strong institutional return, likely laying the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next major leg upward.

Title: ‘Forget about glamour’: Jonathan Anderson offers advice to would-be fashion designers

Jonathan Anderson, the newly appointed creative director of Dior men’s wear in Paris, made history on Friday when he became the first fashion designer to be made an Honorary Patron of Trinity College Dublin’s University Philosophical Society. At a packed ceremony, the Irish designer was presented with the Gold Medal by the society’s treasurer Perin Winders, who outlined Anderson’s career and achievements. The award is given by the 340-year-old society to individuals who have excelled in their given fields. In this case it acknowledged Anderson’s contribution to the world of fashion as one of the most influential designers of his generation. Previous recipients of this award include film director Martin Scorsese, former US president Joe Biden, actors Al Pacino, Dame Helen Mirren and Whoopi Goldberg, Tim Cook of Apple and most recently comedian Stephen Colbert. Anderson (41), from Magherafelt, Co Derry, who studied in Blackrock College, is the elder son of former Irish rugby captain Willie Anderson and his wife Heather, a teacher. Anderson said it was a huge honour to receive the award in Dublin, where he had come out as gay and where he first fell in love with fashion, “having blagged my way into a job in Brown Thomas”. Dressed casually in a brown leather jacket and jeans, Anderson also described how he had applied to every fashion college he could find “and every single one turned me down, one offer finally coming for a new men’s wear course at the College of Fashion in London” which kick-started his career. “I am a big believer in failure, and those I look up to are people who have failed and kept going,” he said. There is an incredible amount of work. I think you have to be able to get up every morning and learn something new every day and push yourself out there In a free-ranging question and answer session with Winders, issues such as collaboration, his work in film, the changing role of designers, social media and the fashion world in general generated thoughtful responses. “Life and society have become faster and faster because of social media and we are exposed to so much now that everything is becoming a blur and anonymity is the biggest luxury today,” he said. “Fashion’s big questions – how we deal with the planet, with what we make, but we want to fix everything tomorrow. Government and business have to work together and long-term goals are important.” Anderson also spoke about his pride in having set up the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize during his 11-year tenure at the Spanish luxury brand, which he turned into a global superstar now worth nearly $3 billion. The award is an annual one recognising excellence among makers. Asked what advice he would have for young people interested in a fashion career, he was very clear about its demands. “Forget about glamour, there is an incredible amount of work. I think you have to be able to get up every morning and learn something new every day and push yourself out there,” he said. [ Fashion at the Louvre: Spectacular exhibition sees modern masterworks meet art and historyOpens in new window ] “Even as a child I could never sit still and I always try to do a better job every time I get up in the morning. If you are good and believe in yourself, you can go anywhere, but (in fashion) you have to be a bit of a performer and you have to be quite ruthless and fight your way in.” His annual workload has involved 16 collections – eight for his namesake brand and eight for Loewe. His first men’s wear show for Dior will be at the end of June; he is delving into the Dior’s archives and wants to “be able to explore a different language”. “I like a challenge, and I come with more experience to the job,” he said. Anderson concluded his remarks by saying how proud he is to be Irish and highlighting the need for what he called “more crossing of the aisles” in the current debate about unity. “I am so proud of where I grew up. But growing up in the ’90s was shocking in Northern Ireland and I have seen horrifying things. “Today, however, it is like Disneyland with the Titanic Centre and everything else,” he said, to laughter and applause from the audience.

Title: Saylor Predicts BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Will Be The Biggest ETF In 10 Years

At Bitwise’s Bitcoin Standard Corporations Investors Day, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor set an audacious marker for the entire exchange-traded fund landscape, declaring that BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (ticker: IBIT) will become “the biggest ETF in the world in ten years.” The remark instantly rippled through the ETF community, where practitioners are well-aware that the current asset-class hierarchy is dominated by broad-based equity funds rather than single-asset vehicles. IBIT already occupies a rarefied tier within digital-asset finance: according to Bitcoin Treasuries, the trust now custodies more than 575,000 BTC, an estimated $54.3 billion. That asset haul places it as the best-ever ETF launch in history. Skepticism, however, was swift—and data-driven. “Just for some context on this… Largest ETF, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) has taken in over $51 bil just this year. IBIT’s total assets = $54 bil. Would be [a] Herculean feat for IBIT,” wrote Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store and host of ETF Prime, in a post on X. Geraci’s framing underscores the magnitude of the gap: VOO’s $51 billion of 2025 net inflows alone nearly matches IBIT’s entire asset base. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas offered a similarly tempered outlook. “I would never say never re IBIT bc it broke every conceivable record its rookie year but… King VOO is curr 10x bigger and hauls in 5x more cash every day = would take a flat or negative decade for US stocks while btc moons,” he posted, pointing to the entrenched scale and relentless cash generation of the Vanguard fund. Balchunas elaborated that for IBIT to close the gap organically it would need “well north of $1 b/day, like $3 b or $4 b/day if it hopes to gain ground,” concluding that “some extraordinary sht would have to… happen but it’s poss.” When asked whether investors might absorb bitcoin’s “perfect savings” narrative more rapidly, Balchunas distilled his answer to “Two words, two syllables: cash flow,” highlighting the gravitational pull that dividend and earnings streams exert on portfolio construction. Saylor’s forecast lands in a market environment already primed by BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink’s own headline-grabbing Bitcoin thesis. On 22 January 2025, during a World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Fink told Bloomberg that widespread institutional allocation—“2% or even 5%” of portfolios, he said, citing a recent discussion with a sovereign wealth fund—could propel Bitcoin to “$500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” Describing the asset as a “currency of fear,” Fink argued that Bitcoin’s borderless design provides a hedge against “the debasement of your currency, or the economic or political stability of your country.” For Saylor, whose corporate-treasury Bitcoin strategy has made Strategy a leveraged proxy on the token’s price, Fink’s framing offers macro-level validation: if sovereign wealth funds follow through on exploratory conversations, demand could eclipse the finite supply captured inside IBIT. The question—posed implicitly by Geraci’s and Balchunas’ numbers—is whether that demand can outpace the relentless inflows into equity index stalwarts during a decade in which global investors remain wedded to cash-generative, regulation-familiar assets.

Title: What to expect as Iran and US head for more nuclear talks in Oman
URL: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/25/what-to-expect-as-iran-and-us-head-for-more-nuclear-talks-in-oman
Time Published: 2025-04-25T15:22:45Z
Full Content:
The expert-level technical talks could determine the specifics of nuclear and sanctions commitments by the two sides. Tehran, Iran – Iran and the United States are expected to hold more nuclear negotiations mediated by Oman amid efforts to shape an agreement to avoid the US attacking Iran. The Iranian delegation will arrive in Muscat on Friday evening in advance of political and, for the first time, technical talks on Saturday. Let’s take a look at what we can expect, as well as all the latest developments and context. Like the two previous rounds of talks in Italy and Oman, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and White House special envoy Steve Witkoff will lead the delegations. But the experts leading the technical talks are also crucial, as they will iron out the details and wording of any agreement. For Tehran, Araghchi’s political deputy, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, and deputy for legal and international affairs, Kazem Gharibabadi, are heading the expert-level delegation. Takht-Ravanchi is a Western-educated diplomat who led Iran’s mission to the United Nations and was ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Gharibabadi led Iran’s representative office to international organisations in Vienna and represented the Iranian judiciary internationally. He was also involved in indirect nuclear negotiations between the administrations of late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and former US President Joe Biden. The chief technical expert whom US President Donald Trump selected is Michael Anton, the newly appointed director of policy planning at the US Department of State. Anton was a speechwriter for New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice during the George W Bush administration. He also held managerial roles in the private sector, including at Citigroup and BlackRock investment firms. During the first Trump administration, he served on the National Security Council to shape government messaging. Anton’s work may be eased by the fact that he has not yet publicly adopted a stance on Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran has emphasised it will not discuss its defence capabilities or regional influence, but is ready for an agreement that ensures it won’t build a nuclear bomb, which it has repeatedly stated it doesn’t want. The technical talks aim to set the steps Tehran would take to curb its nuclear programme, and how Washington and Europe would lift their devastating sanctions, which have continued despite the US calling the talks with Iran “constructive”. Iran, for its part, wants to lift at least part of the comprehensive sanctions against its oil, banking and related industries, some of which are imposed under multiple designations. A deal could unfreeze some of Iran’s billions of dollars of export revenue that remain blocked in foreign banks by sanctions. Negotiators may also attempt to nail down waivers, orders to allow Iran to sell oil or access the global payments system. Iranian officials like President Masoud Pezeshkian have gone a step further, saying Iran would even welcome direct, large-scale investment by US companies in its market, which is brimming with financial opportunity. On the agenda will also be a cap on Iran’s uranium enrichment, which is now at up to 60 percent, a short step from the 90 percent required for a bomb. Under the terms of an earlier nuclear agreement with world powers (the JCPOA), Iran had committed to a cap of 3.67 percent enrichment, sufficient for civilian uses like power generation. However, when Trump unilaterally abandoned the JCPOA in 2018 and slapped punishing sanctions on Iran, Tehran started enriching at much higher levels and using more advanced reactors than those specified in the JCPOA. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN watchdog that will again monitor Iran’s commitments, is expected to send a team to Iran in the next few days for talks. While likely to advance the positive atmosphere surrounding the talks, Saturday’s meetings are only a step among many required for any deal. But time is of the essence, especially in the months leading up to an October deadline, when the 2015 nuclear deal’s “snapback” mechanism expires. It allows any of the signatories to initiate a process to reinstate all UN sanctions on Iran in the case of significant noncompliance, like enriching uranium at levels higher than 3.67 percent. Iran wants to avoid snapback. Iran’s Araghchi has visited China and Russia to coordinate a position, while accusing Israel of “undermining” the negotiations. Witkoff was also in Moscow on Friday to discuss the talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Araghchi has said he is ready to visit Paris, Berlin and London for direct talks with the three European JCPOA signatories. “I was ready to do it before Iran commenced its indirect dialogue with the U.S., but the E3 opted out,” he wrote on X. Meanwhile, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei signalled to his followers, using religious symbolism, this week, that they must not refuse a deal with the US. He recounted how Jafar al-Sadiq, the sixth imam revered in Shia Islam, made a deal with his enemy some 1,300 years ago, adding that any deal would not indicate the “dominance of disbelief and deceit” over Muslims.

Title: Why is Germany's next chancellor, Merz, so unpopular?
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/why-is-germanys-next-chancellor-merz-so-unpopular/a-72355492

Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz and his CDU won Germany's election, yet his personal popularity is low — and getting lower. Most Germans don't trust him, not least because of his approach to the far-right AfD. If all goes to plan, Friedrich Merz will become the Federal Republic's 10th chancellor on May 6. The two remaining hurdles appear to be formalities: On Monday, his conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will convene for a special party conference to approve the coalition contract with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD). Then, a few days later, the SPD's members — some grumbling notwithstanding — are expected to approve the alliance in a vote, with the results announced on April 30. But Merz won't have long to enjoy the congratulations. Even though he won the national election in late February, the 69-year-old's personal popularity seems to be on a permanent slide: According to an April poll by research institute Forsa for Stern magazine, just 21% of respondents consider Merz trustworthy — nine percentage points lower than in August, and down three points from January. The same poll found that only 40% of respondents consider the incoming chancellor a strong leader, and 27% think Merz "knows what moves people," both of which represent nine-point falls since January. On the plus side — indeed, the only leadership criteria in which Merz scored a majority in the survey — about 60% of respondents believe that Merz "speaks understandably." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video It's no shock that Merz isn't exactly the most popular chancellor-in-waiting Germany has ever seen. But Ursula Münch, the director of the Tutzing Academy for Political Education in Bavaria, told DW that it's not all his fault. "The circumstances are very different than they used to be," Münch said. "We have a government that has a relatively small proportion of support among voters." Merz has not picked the most fortunate moment in history: In traditional political parlance, a coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD is called a "grand coalition," because for many decades these two parties represented an overwhelming majority of Germany's voters (sometimes well over 80%). In the fragmented landscape of 2025, in which parties have splintered and splintered again over the past 20 years, the two big centrist parties can only claim to represent 45% of voters, going by the February election results. There are two obvious reasons why the perception of Merz's trustworthiness might have fallen in the past few months. In January, Merz broke his own word when he became the first CDU leader to pass a motion through the Bundestag with the support of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), whole factions of which are deemed by intelligence agencies to be a threat to Germany's democratic order. For CDU supporters, however, that seemed like a less-egregious U-turn than the one Merz performed a few weeks later: In March, the party leader agreed a debt brake reform with the SPD and the Greens that paved the way for €1 trillion ($1.14 trillion) in new loans, something he had expressly ruled out throughout the election campaign. Unsurprisingly, many of his voters felt betrayed. In a "Politbarometer" poll carried out by public broadcaster ZDF at the time, some 73% of Germans agreed that he had deceived voters — including some 44% of CDU/CSU supporters. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Merz has problems that go much further back than his recent U-turns. Surveys have shown that he is particularly unpopular among women. A Forsa survey from March 2024 found that only 9% of women aged 18 to 29 saw Merz as their preferred chancellor candidate. The incoming chancellor has been dogged with accusations of misogyny. In 1997, as is often brought up, he was one of the Bundestag members who voted against recognizing rape within marriage as a crime. In October last year, he was criticized for rejecting the idea of gender-balanced Cabinets, and this reputation was not helped by a photo released in February showing that the main negotiators of the CDU/CSU bloc were all middle-aged men. Merz is also unpopular in eastern Germany, where he regularly polled behind both the AfD's Alice Weidel and the SPD's Olaf Scholz in the run-up to the election — partly, it seems, because of his belligerent attitude toward Russia. Merz's calculation appears to be that, with right-wing populism apparently on rise around the world, what people want is straight-talking leadership. But populism does not appear to be making him more popular. In November 2018, when he first announced his candidacy to re-take the leadership of the CDU, Merz posted a tweet that seems to age worse with every month: "We can once again reach up to 40% and halve the AfD. That is possible!" he wrote. "But we must create the preconditions for it. That is our task." Almost the opposite has happened. Since Merz eventually re-took the CDU leadership in January 2022 (on his third attempt), the party's poll ratings have stayed at 24%, while the AfD's have not halved but doubled: From 11% to 24%. Germany's far-right and center-right parties are now neck and neck. But, of course, Merz has not had a chance to be chancellor yet, and Münch said he might yet be able to make good on his AfD prediction — if his government runs without the internal strife that dogged Scholz's coalition, and if it is not hit by an external crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic or escalating war in Ukraine that would requires the chancellor to take more U-turns and lose even more trust. Those are big ifs. "The best way to keep the AfD small isn't making some random announcement about big changes in refugee policy that you can't implement," Münch said. "It's concrete measures that people also notice. But that's not something that a new government can just turn around overnight. People need to be given confidence again, and that will only be possible when the economic forecast turns more positive and the refugee numbers fall." Merz was initially considered a strong candidate precisely because of his business background (he was on the board at the investment company BlackRock for several years), which was supposed to signal his economic acumen. In the past few years, however, his populist statements have increasingly been about immigration, and that hasn't helped him shake off the AfD.

But, of course, Merz has not had a chance to be chancellor yet, and Münch said he might yet be able to make good on his AfD prediction — if his government runs without the internal strife that dogged Scholz's coalition, and if it is not hit by an external crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic or escalating war in Ukraine that would requires the chancellor to take more U-turns and lose even more trust. Those are big ifs. "The best way to keep the AfD small isn't making some random announcement about big changes in refugee policy that you can't implement," Münch said. "It's concrete measures that people also notice. But that's not something that a new government can just turn around overnight. People need to be given confidence again, and that will only be possible when the economic forecast turns more positive and the refugee numbers fall." Merz was initially considered a strong candidate precisely because of his business background (he was on the board at the investment company BlackRock for several years), which was supposed to signal his economic acumen. In the past few years, however, his populist statements have increasingly been about immigration, and that hasn't helped him shake off the AfD.

Title: The Jobs That Will Fall First As AI Takes Over The Workplace

ByJack Kelly ByJack Kelly, Senior Contributor. Artificial intelligence will soon dominate the job market. Artificial intelligence is advancing at breakneck speed. The big question is how long it will take until technology dominates the job market. You should start thinking about your own career. Will you be caught up in the change? With the U.S. navigating a $36 trillion debt, tariff tensions, and economic uncertainty, the specter of disruption from AI adds urgency for workers to protect themselves. Artificial intelligence is expected to fundamentally transform the global workforce by 2050, according to reports from PwC, McKinsey, and the World Economic Forum. Estimates suggest that up to 60% of current jobs will require significant adaptation due to AI. Automation and intelligent systems will become an integral part of the workplace. o remain competitive, invest in skills like critical thinking and digital fluency. Target AI-resilient sectors like healthcare or education. Advocate for retraining programs to reinvent your career. As macro investor and founder of the Bridgewater hedge fund Ray Dalio warns, the economy’s future hinges on balancing AI’s power with human potential. He says those who prepare now will shape the world of tomorrow. Estimates vary, but experts converge on a transformative window of 10 to 30 years for AI to reshape most jobs. A McKinsey report projects that by 2030, 30% of current U.S. jobs could be automated, with 60% significantly altered by AI tools. Goldman Sachs predicts up that to 50% of jobs could be fully automated by 2045, driven by generative AI and robotics. Additionally, Goldman Sachs previously estimated that 300 million jobs could be lost to AI, with 25% of the global labor market being automated. On the bright side, AI is least threatening to labor-intensive careers in construction, skilled trades, installation and repair, and maintenance. Dalio warns of a “great deleveraging” where AI accelerates productivity but displaces workers faster than new roles emerge, potentially within two decades. Larry Fink, the CEO of Black Rock, speaking at the Economic Club of New York this month, cautioned that AI’s impact is already visible in sectors like finance and legal services, predicting a “restructuring” of white-collar work by 2035. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, in his shareholder letter, estimates a 15-year horizon for AI to dominate repetitive tasks. The actual pace depends on technological breakthroughs, regulatory frameworks, and economic incentives. Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who runs Pershing Square, argues that corporate adoption of AI is accelerating due to cost pressures, potentially shrinking timelines. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent counters that AI could bolster U.S. competitiveness if paired with retraining, delaying mass displacement. By 2040, AI will likely automate or transform 50% to 60% of jobs, with full dominance (80% and higher) possible by 2050, assuming steady innovation. AI’s impact will not be uniform. Some jobs will fall quickly, while others resist longer. Jobs like data entry, scheduling, and customer service are already being overtaken by AI tools like chatbots and robotic process automation. A 2024 study by the Institute for Public Policy Research found 60% of administrative tasks are automatable. Fink notes that BlackRock is streamlining back-office functions with AI, cutting costs. These roles, requiring repetitive data processing, face near-term obsolescence as AI’s accuracy and scalability improve. Bookkeeping, financial modeling, and basic data analysis are highly vulnerable. AI platforms like Bloomberg’s Terminal enhancements can already crunch numbers and generate reports faster than humans. Dimon warns that JPMorgan is automating routine banking tasks, with 20% of analytical roles at risk by 2030. Paralegal work, contract drafting, and legal research are prime targets, as AI tools like Harvey and CoCounsel automate document analysis with 90% accuracy, according to a 2025 Stanford study. Dalio highlights AI’s ability to parse vast datasets, threatening research-heavy roles in academia and consulting. Senior legal strategy and courtroom advocacy, however, will resist longer due to human judgment needs. Graphic design, copywriting, and basic journalism face disruption from tools like DALL-E and GPT-derived platforms, which produce content at scale. A 2024 Pew Research Center that report notes 30% of media jobs could be automated by 2035. Ackman, commenting on X, predicts AI-generated content will dominate advertising soon but argues human creativity in storytelling and high art will endure longer, delaying full automation. Software development, engineering, and data science are dual-edged: AI boosts productivity but also automates routine coding and design tasks. A 2025 World Economic Forum report flags 40% of programming tasks as automatable by 2040. Bessent sees growth in AI-adjacent roles like cybersecurity, but standardized STEM work will gradually cede to algorithms. Complex innovation, like breakthrough research and development, will remain human-driven longer. Diagnostic AI and robotic surgery are advancing, but empathy-driven roles like nursing, therapy, and social work are harder to automate. A 2023 Lancet study estimates 25% of medical administrative tasks could vanish by 2035, but patient-facing care requires human trust. Teaching, especially in nuanced fields like philosophy or early education, and high-level management job rely on emotional intelligence and adaptability, which AI struggles to replicate. A 2024 OECD report suggests only 10% of teaching tasks are automatable by 2040. Dimon and Ackman stress that strategic leadership, navigating ambiguity and inspiring teams, will remain human-centric.

Title: These 7 European And Asian Stocks Are Crushing It And Still Cheap

ByHank Tucker ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. London-based BAE Systems makes the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet and is benefitting from European nations turning away from U.S. defense contractors. Portfolio managers investing in non-U.S. stocks have been trying to get investors’ attention for years, pointing out that valuation multiples overseas have grown much cheaper than stocks in the U.S. since the Financial Crisis, and this year their patience has finally been rewarded. The MSCI EAFE index, covering stocks in 21 developed markets excluding the U.S. and Canada, is up 7% this year, significantly outperforming the 7% decline for the S&P 500 index in the U.S. It represents a small dent in the decades-long disparity between the two—JPMorgan reports that from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2024, the S&P 500’s annualized total return was 11.9%, versus 3.6% for the MSCI EAFE. That amounts to a seven-fold return on investment for the former, while the international portfolio hasn’t even doubled. Some of that dominance is because U.S. stocks have produced much stronger earnings growth, but some is also because the S&P 500’s average P/E multiple has swelled to 21.7x, while EAFE is only at 14.0x after starting in a similar position, according to the JPMorgan report. With fears swirling that tariffs and broader uncertainty will compress earnings in the U.S., international investors are hoping that gap can narrow even more. Asset management giants like Vanguard, BlackRock and Franklin Templeton offer dozens of low-cost international funds to choose from. Active managers that are outperforming the indexers are primarily doing so by zeroing in on European defense stocks and domestically-focused companies that are perceived to be insulated from the effects of Trump’s tariffs in nations like Japan and China. “We’re at the lowest relative weight of the U.S. in quite some time,” says Travis Prentice, chief investment officer of the Informed Momentum Company, which manages $2.5 billion in momentum-based strategies. “In aerospace and defense, particularly in Europe, momentum not only persisted, but accelerated through all this tariff turmoil.” Graeme Forster, a portfolio manager at Orbis overseeing $4.5 billion in its International equity strategy, agrees, singling out airplane engine maker Rolls-Royce, London-based BAE Systems, Europe’s largest defense contractor, and German defense firm Rheinmetall as good bets. Orbis’ international strategy has returned 10.8% annually since inception at the end of 2008, beating its index by four percentage points, and produced a 10% return net of fees in the first quarter this year. Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems are each up more than 30% this year already. Rheinmetall has soared 150% thanks largely to the German parliament’s commitment in March to create a fund to spend more than $500 million on defense and infrastructure over 12 years, a stark departure from the nation’s longstanding frugal spending policies. Trump has been critical of NATO on several occasions, attacking European nations for not paying enough to support the alliance, and paused U.S. military aid to Ukraine in March. That prompted the European Commission to unveil a “Readiness 2030” plan in March enabling $900 million in spending to defend Ukraine and protect themselves from Russia’s aggression. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission’s president, cautioned that “the security architecture that we relied on can no longer be taken for granted” and urged nations to “buy more European.” That’s contributed to U.S. defense firm Lockheed Martin, which makes F-35 fighter jets, sinking 15% since Trump’s election, while BAE Systems, which also produces fighter jets, has soared. “Sometimes there’s news and sometimes there’s noise, and we’ve always had to figure out how to sift through it, but 2025 has been a particularly newsy year,” says Alaina Anderson, portfolio manager for William Blair’s $1.1 billion International Leaders Fund, which recently added positions in BAE Systems and French cybersecurity and defense firm Thales. “It’s been news that speaks to a change in the structure of markets, the nature of relationships between countries and the durability of long-established institutions.” Anderson’s fund is also adding positions in China despite its status as the chief target of Trump’s trade war, focusing on stocks like Trip.com, the country’s largest online travel company with more than 50% market share within China. “We think there’s low geopolitical risk in that name, given that it’s really domestic-driven consumption,” says Anderson, with the stock up 50% since last August. Despite Trump’s pressure in ratcheting up tariffs on China to as much as 145%, the Shanghai Composite index has lost a mere 1.6% in 2025. Prentice references Beijing-based electronics firm Xiaomi as one stock with momentum after tripling in the past year. It sells everything from smartphones to electric vehicles and could be poised to benefit if America’s largest tech companies face harsher tariffs on imports into China. Orbis’ Forster is more enthralled by opportunities in neighboring Japan, where the Nikkei 225 has roughly mirrored the S&P 500’s losses so far this year. The yen has weakened substantially in the last five years, helping Japanese companies hire skilled workers cheaply in U.S. dollar terms, and Forster thinks the prospect of higher interest rates, which the Bank of Japan raised in January to their highest level in 17 years, could counterintuitively stimulate growth. “Everyone is a massive saver there. Everyone's paid off their mortgages and they've got a ton of money, and it just sits in bank accounts earning zero,” says Forster. From 2016 until last year, Japan had negative interest rates in place, but with inflation finally returning, the rate hikes could make the yen stronger, ease import costs and improve margins for retailers and domestic businesses. Forster likes real estate firm Mitsubishi Estate’s stock, with a valuable portfolio of real estate which trades at about half of its fair value, Orbis estimates. The developer owns most of the property surrounding Tokyo’s famed Imperial Palace—its stock performance has been middling for decades, but it’s rallied 25% so far this year, with rents rising meaningfully for the first time since Japan’s 1989 market crash. “The nice thing about a real estate business is as they push up rent, it’s not a wage-heavy business, so they’re not getting squeezed on the cost side,” says Forster. “That could be very sustainable, because real estate is quite cheap in Japan, and you’re getting it at half price.”

Manipulating research, using company funds to pay for private, in-room massages, asking junior staff to withdraw thousands of dollars for personal use, demanding senior management deliver a Nobel Peace Prize nomination. These are just some of the lurid allegations that pushed the World Economic Forum (WEF) to launch an investigation into its now departed founder, Klaus Schwab, after anonymous whistleblowers aired their concerns about the German octogenarian. The assertions – reportedly sent last week in a letter to the WEF, which organises the annual elite gathering of globalist devotees at Davos in Switzerland – accuse Schwab and his wife, Hilde, of financial and ethical misconduct. The family has vehemently denied each and every accusation even as he resigned as the WEF chairman, as Breitbart News reported The Guardian set out the course of events around the controversy that has swamped the unelected, unaccountable elitist organization: The accusations prompted Schwab’s resignation as the WEF executive chair on Monday after its board of high-profile trustees – which includes the BlackRock chief, Larry Fink; the IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva; the former US vice-president Al Gore and cellist Yo-Yo Ma – held an emergency meeting to look into the claims on Sunday. Schwab, 87, is said to have argued against the board’s plan for an investigation, before he resigned. The founder had indicated he intended to step down in early April, but the whistleblower letter brought forward his exit. […] The whistleblower letter included a range of claims against the Schwab family, according to the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times. They include an allegation that Schwab used WEF funds to pay for private, in-room massages at hotels, asked staff to promote him for a Nobel peace prize, and instructed junior employees to withdraw thousands of dollars from ATMs on his behalf. The Guardian report noted allegations that academic research was also tampered with, as “The letter also accused Schwab of manipulating the WEF global competitiveness report in order to curry favour with certain governments. “The publication ranks countries based on criteria such as education, infrastructure, labour market and health systems, and is a point of reference for the annual Davos meeting.” Some allegations also extended to Schwab’s wife, Hilde, who formerly worked at the WEF. They suggested she scheduled “token” meetings using WEF money to justify luxury travel at WEF’s expense, according to the Guardian report. The letter claims Hilde also maintained tight control over the use of Villa Mundi, a grand property bought by the WEF overlooking Lake Geneva, while portions of the building were strictly reserved for the family’s own private access. File/The luxury Villa Mundi, owned and renovated by the World Economic Forum (WEF), in Cologny, near Geneva. The WEF has launched an investigation into allegations made against its founder Klaus Schwab that reportedly prompted his resignation.

(JOHANNES EISELE/AFP via Getty Images) The Schwabs have repeatedly denied all the allegations, saying they were unsubstantiated and would be challenged in a lawsuit. As Breitbart News reported, Schwab was born in Ravensburg, Germany, on March 30, 1938. He studied at Swiss universities and at Harvard in the United States, and holds doctorates in engineering and economics, along with more than a dozen honorary doctorates. He was a little-known business professor at the University of Geneva when in 1971 he founded the WEF’s precursor, the European Management Forum.

Title: As Trump Administration Considers Retreat on Tariffs, Will It Resort to Usual US Fallback Option?

With a big push from Washington, the traditional value chain pyramid that has supported the American economic house of cards for decades is under serious duress. So is its global trading system, already strained by geopolitical blowups coming from the empire in decline. Like so much with Trump, he is acting as an accelerant. All “these structural shifts have accelerated in recent months” according to Singapore Senior Minister Lee Hsien. Assessing the Damage So Far A brief look at the damage so far reveals that the century-high tariff levels imposed by Trump are expected to hammer global economic growth this year. The IMF downgraded its projection for global GDP growth to 2.8 percent, down from a forecast of 3.3 percent in January. Humiliatingly for Trump, US growth projections took the biggest hit among wealthier countries, dropping to 1.8 percent growth from 2.7 percent. (Although the EU could join the party if it doubles down on its China “de-risking.”) And as always, the pain will hit the poorest the hardest. Coupled with climate change (where Trump, aside from his degrowth tariffs, is also acting as an accelerant), these trends are heading towards a turning point where global trade growth no longer keeps pace with GDP. That could dramatically slow economic growth in many countries, which will cause more social and political problems. Singapore Minister Lee said “In that event, the world would truly enter a new epoch, which it has not seen since the Second World War.” While Team Trump might be reconsidering the breadth of the tariffs on China, they are still likely to remain high. Here’s the WSJ: One senior White House official said the China tariffs were likely to come down to between roughly 50% and 65%. The administration is also considering a tiered approach similar to the one proposed by the House committee on China late last year: 35% levies for items the U.S. deems not a threat to national security, and at least 100% for items deemed as strategic to America’s interest, some of the people said. To What End? The official line is simple enough. Here’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaking at the Institute of International Finance on Wednesday: China, in particular, is in need of a rebalancing. Recent data shows the Chinese economy tilting even further away from consumption toward manufacturing. China’s economic system, with growth driven by manufacturing exports, will continue to create even more serious imbalances with its trading partners if the status quo is allowed to continue. China’s current economic model is built on exporting its way out of its economic troubles. It’s an unsustainable model that is not only harming China but the entire world. China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change—because we need rebalancing too. China can start by moving its economy away from export overcapacity, and toward supporting its own consumers and domestic demand. Such a shift would help with the global rebalancing that the world desperately needs. That’s all well and good, and perhaps it would be best for China to “rebalance.” But the US refuses to accept that it doesn’t get to make that call. In attempting to use tariffs as a geopolitical bargaining chip, it is weaponizing trade and causing other countries to do the same. There are also indications that Washington is after more than just aiding the “global rebalancing that the world desperately needs.” On April 16 the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. plans to use global tariff negotiations to isolate China. The Irish Times on the same day had the scoop that any Washington-Brussels deal over tariffs will likely involve an agreement for the bloc to fully join the US in the economic war against China. In addition to the stated goal of reorienting supply chains outside of China via “friendshoring,” there are the more bonkers statements coming from Trump World. Donald Trump’s top economic advisor Stephen Miran let it be known that part of Washington’s rationale behind the tariffs is to force countries to pay the US tribute to maintain its global financial and military empire. Good luck with that. And there’s JD Vance admitting that the US wants China and the “Global South” at the bottom of the international division of labor, meaning that China has gotten too big for its britches. It was fine when it produce low value-added goods or higher-end, designed-in-the-West products, but absolutely not okay if China starts designing and making its own high end products surpassing the West. And so Washington wants to turn back time to the good old days when China knew its place. Good luck with that, too. The problem is the US simply doesn’t have the economic clout it thinks it does to affect this hierarchical vision anymore. The Dispensable Nation Other countries, of course, take issue with China’s ongoing dominance in low-tech manufacturing even as it moves higher up the value chain. Yet Washington’s typical heavy-handed shakedown approach has managed to alienate most of them and push them into China’s embrace: Singapore’s PM has laid it out. He knows the U.S. has abandoned the multilateral trading system, upon which Singaporeans wealth is based. There’s only one stable force with the heft to anchor multilateral trade in this episode of disruption. It’s China. https://t.co/Zb0sZnEOZq — Warwick Powell | 鲍韶山 (@baoshaoshan) April 5, 2025 Add to that the fact that China might also be more willing to relinquish control over low-end manufacturing if it wasn’t so deadset on autarky due to the all-to-reasonable concerns over US efforts to isolate it. Even if the mainstream press is starting to come to terms with the US inability to shape events. Here’s a good summary of the coalescing conventional wisdom from Alan Beattie, former economist at the Bank of England, writing yesterday in the the Financial Times: Bessent and other administration officials are now beetling around the world desperately trying to sign dozens of trade deals while fractious financial markets metaphorically hold a gun to their heads, and we’re asked to believe it is all a cunning plan. Obviously, Trump’s strategy is terrible: it’s not even clear what he wants. But a less inept administration would also be struggling. Over the decades, the US’s leverage to remake the global trading system — capital flows, advanced technology and access to its vast consumer market — has weakened relative to China. Barack Obama used to call the US the “indispensable nation”. In trade and tech terms that is increasingly untrue. During the post-second world war Marshall Plan, the US created a largely Atlanticist political economy in western Europe. It offered not just financial Marshall Aid but also advanced technology, and access to its growing consumer market. Those advantages have dissipated. US aid budgets have massively shrunk relative to China’s, and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency has more or less closed down their last vestiges in the US Agency for International Development. And while China dominates in fields like necessity items, clean tech, mineral processing. The US can offer market access to its increasingly impoverished populace drawing in credit card debt, but even that isn’t a given anymore. Beattie continues: Trump’s idea is to threaten to take market access away with high tariffs and then restore it in return for trade concessions. It’s all stick and no carrot. The credibility of his threat to impose permanently high import duties is subject to the whim of the financial markets, and his trustworthiness in keeping those taxes low following a deal exceedingly suspect. In the global game of trade poker, Trump inherited a weakening hand and is playing it extremely badly. Bessent and his other officials are in a precarious position. The US does not have the aid, the technology or the market access to exert control over global trade the way it once did, and Trump’s erratic behaviour is rapidly increasing the probability that it never will. Other US Options Despite the tariffs gambit blowing up in Trump’s face, the US is unlikely to stop trying, and even an aborted tariffs plan will still cause upheaval in global supply chains. If tariffs don’t force China to make a “deal,” what could Trump opt for instead? Washington is likely to continue with an attempt to weaken Chinese freight shipping and shipbuilding, as well as push ahead with the fight over strategically located ports. For example, there are still US fees for Chinese-built ships and the potential sale of ports in Panama and elsewhere. Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings in March announced that it was selling all its overseas ports, including two at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock in a deal worth $23 billion. The Trump administration was reportedly in close contact with BlackRock during the lead up to the sale and helped instigate it with its pressure on Hutchinson so this is essentially a US-led Western takeover. CK Hutchison currently operates 53 ports in 24 countries. Under the deal with BlackRock, the conglomerate would sell all of them except the 10 it operates in mainland China and Hong Kong. A a low profile Italian-Swiss family behind the Mediterranean Shipping Company is acquiring 41 of the ports in the deal, with BlackRock controlling the two in Panama. But the deal remains in question following China’s market regulator launching an antitrust probe into Hutchinson, which coincided with news that a final signing of the deal would not go ahead. While the Panama ports in the deal received the lion’s share of the attention in the US, it’s a deal that would have global implications, as the following map shows: Compare that to a map of global chokepoints, and it’s clear why Beijing is putting the kibosh on the deal: Where chokepoints and Hutchinson ports don’t overlap, such as the Cape of Good Hope, the US is in the midst of a pressure campaign on South Africa with an eye on a naval base there. Chief among China’s concerns with the Hutchinson deal is that the new ownership could, under pressure from Washington, refuse Chinese ships or militarize the ports and use them to enact a maritime blockade of China. Choke points one area we could expect to see US escalation in the face of a potential backtrack on tariffs—more pressure on South Africa, more US violence in Yemen and Somalia, and a further militarization of Panama. One of the driving forces behind Hutchinson’s decision to sell was the increasing pressure being put on its business by the US. From the WSJ: In the days before finalizing the deal, Fink held calls with Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and national security adviser Michael Waltz, ultimately garnering the administration’s blessing, according to people close to the deal. Behind the scenes, Hutchinson executives had grown uneasy that a hostile Trump administration could make life hard on their sprawling global conglomerate… Hutchinson executives had weighted selling these and dozens more ports before, but the timing wasn’t right. With Trump applying pressure — and Hutchinson shares trading at a substantial discount to the company’s underlying assets — that changed. …executives were surprised by Trump’s decision to revoke special trade privileges for Hong Kong, and Panama authorities had just announced an audit of Hutchinson’s contract. There was also the fact that U.S. Southern Command was/is partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces and drawing up plans to seize the Panama Canal by force—only if necessary, of course. Does the failure of the tariffs gambit and potentially the Hutchinson deal too make it more likely the US goes through with such threats? That’s how it often goes with Washington. Like an organized crime outfit, if its terms aren’t accepted, it turns to force. Thing is, even if the Hutchinson ports deal goes through, and even if Washington tried any funny business at them and global chokepoints, we’d still be back in the same spot we are today with the tariffs. The US would still be cutting off its nose to spite its face. We’ll have to wait and see if it’ll go that route again. According to the deal between CK Hutchison and BlackRock, both parties have 145 days to come to a definitive agreement. There are 95 days to go. I didn’t know about the Chinese antitrust move targeting Hutchinson. Fascinating stuff. Thanks, Conor. The talk may be of trade and tariffs and balances and overproduction but what it is really about is establishing American dominance in the 21st century. Consider. Suppose that the US and China decided that they only way to resolve their problems was an economic divorce. China ships nothing to the US and the US ships nothing to China. Trump gets what he wants while China loses only a very smaller percentage of it’s trade and no more headaches. Problem solved, right? Wrong. After this the US will demand that any country that trades with the US abandon all trade and economic links with China – which they are doing already – and you can see in this post how they are already trying to get a chock-hold on world trade. Mostly for China but maybe other countries as well. The DC policy wonks want China isolated from world trade and wrecked so that American dominance can be the name of the game. But for that to happen, China has to be degraded first. Wars have started over less. And this is why Trump wants out of the Ukraine. So that the US can go fully after China. The last two articles of John Helmer present the intelectual underpinnings of this approach. One was already posted by NC. The best way to isolate China internationally is to have it attack Taiwan. To achieve this, Trump will provoke Beijing in any way possible. He may even say something like putting a U.S. missile base on Taiwan. That is what provoked Russia to invade the Ukraine. Blinken told Lavrov that the US would be stationing nuclear missiles in the Ukraine and the only question was how many. The US is busy casting blame on others for its own dreadful domestic policy record of abject failure for 50 years or more where industrial policy in particular and distribution of the benefits of the global trade architecture (including the IMF and World Bank which it dominates) it created as part of its post-WWII neocolonial empire more generally are concerned. The premise that the poor countries of the global majority somehow have cheated Americans via the unequal terms of trade and debt bondage under which they have laboured primarily for the benefit of their comprador elites and US multinational corporations is laughable on its face. Unfortunately the American public is mostly just plain ignorant, so their (mis)leadership class will probably escape accountability yet again. Whether or not the rest of the world is prepared to continue to put up with it, on the other hand, remains an open question … 🤨 Well said. Imagine what would happen if the Chinese government put out a press release that said the US focuses too much on consumption and not enough on investment in productive facilities. This has led to perennial trade deficits and a national federal debt that is unsustainable. The country needs to cut its costs so and increase investments so that it can compete globally instead of just paying for its over-consumption with increased debt. “Does the failure of the tariffs gambit and potentially the Hutchinson deal too make it more likely the US goes through with such threats?” As fans of Mafia movies know organized crime operates in the shadows and when a rogue Don draws too much attention he gets bumped off. So all this blustering in public isn’t even good crime strategy. Here’s suggesting that making threats simply gives Trump a thrill up the leg. Perhaps he is going to attack some country–Iran, Mexico, Panama, Greenland, there’s a list–but why take the risk as long as people are taking him seriously? That may be fading fast. There is a reliance on massive amounts of low wage earners and at the same time a desire for more consumer spending by too many countries. All are in the trap and now fighting each other over access to high earners. Regards to the last sentence, being in the trap and working to earn one’s way up and out of the lowest rungs was seemingly or once upon a time , quite doable but then many things changed oh like 40 years back? Okay or understood if that’s not going back far enough, but really coming out of the stagflation era under Ford then Carter. That was followed by the Reagan and Bush terms brought a lighter approach to broad regulations which was then doubled down upon under Clinton. We’ve enjoyed the proverbial fruit of the inflationary unicorn that came or followed with the Volcker era but then as a country forgot to maintain our manufacturing prowess. Just looking at business headlines this morning, an iconic American technology stalwart like Intel has clearly grown into a mismanaged business, which happens slowly until someone in leadership wakes the heck up. Back to that last thought…just my view that science fiction has been righter all along. The Jackpot isn’t arriving instead it has already been played and continues to play out… “After this the US will demand that any country that trades with the US abandon all trade and economic links with China” China is the leading trade partner of 120 countries. It is totally impossible for them to abandon all trade with China. Just who would be manufacturing all of these things? Apple has already announced that they will be moving iPhone assembly to India but no idea if Trump will hit them up for tariffs from that country- https://www.rt.com/news/616322-ft-apple-to-shift-iphone-assembly-china-india/ But the whole idea of every country abandoning trade links with China for that of an unstable US will not fly. “That’s all well and good, and perhaps it would be best for China to “rebalance.” But the US refuses to accept that it doesn’t get to make that call.” LOL Right?! No more unipolarity … keep your currency hegemony … no more Monroe Doctrine. You don’t get to call sh**!! “So drink your rock, and smoke your pot, and chill where it’s shady … “ ::MusicInterlude (via YouTube):: US Empire is truly gettin’ it on to the grave spot.

Full Content:
World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab and his wife Hilde are under investigation for alleged financial and ethical misconduct, including misuse of WEF funds for personal luxuries and cash withdrawals by junior staff. A whistleblower letter accused the Schwabs of blurring personal and organizational finances, such as billing luxury trips and private massages to the nonprofit. Klaus denies the claims, stating personal expenses were reimbursed. Following an emergency board meeting the day before, Klaus retired as WEF chairman "with immediate effect" on April 21, ending his 50+ year leadership amid escalating scrutiny. The scandal follows prior workplace culture allegations, including discrimination claims. Interim leadership falls to Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, a controversial ex-Nestle CEO. Schwab's departure marks the end of an era, but critics argue the WEF's technocratic agenda (e.g., the "Great Reset") will persist, maintaining its influence over global governance.

Schwab's departure marks the end of an era, but critics argue the WEF's technocratic agenda (e.g., the "Great Reset") will persist, maintaining its influence over global governance. Klaus Schwab, founder of the globalist World Economic Forum (WEF), is under investigation for ethical and financial misconduct alongside his wife Hilde. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Tuesday, April 22, that the WEF's board had opened a new probe into the Schwabs. It followed a whistleblower letter from current and former staff accusing the couple of misusing WEF funds for personal luxuries, including travel and private massages. Moreover, the letter also accused Klaus, 87, of directing junior employees to withdraw cash on his behalf. The allegations upended his planned transition and cast a shadow over the organization he led for more than 50 years. They also triggered his sudden retirement as the WEF's chairman "with immediate effect" â a decision announced Monday, April 21. According to the whistleblower letter, the Schwabs blurred personal and organizational finances by using the nonprofit's resources for private benefits. Among the claims were that Hilde scheduled token meetings to justify luxury trips billed to the WEF and that Klaus requested employees withdraw thousands in cash for unspecified purposes. A spokesperson for the Schwabs denied all allegations, stating that Klaus would sue those spreading "mistruths." Any personal expenses charged to the WEF were later reimbursed, the spokesperson added. Schwab steps down, but will anything change? The WEF's board, which includes figures like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, held an emergency meeting Sunday, April 20. They voted unanimously to open an independent probe, with Klaus stepping down the following day. His departure marks the end of an era for the WEF, which he founded in 1971 as the European Management Forum before rebranding it into a platform for global elites to shape economic and political agendas. The controversy follows another recent investigation into the WEF's workplace culture, prompted by an earlier WSJ report alleging discrimination against women and Black employees. While the WEF disputed those claims at the time, the new whistleblower allegations accelerated Schwab's exit. Interim leadership now falls to Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, former Nestle CEO and a controversial figure known for advocating water privatization and genetically modified foods. (Related: Klaus Schwab STEPS DOWN as World Economic Forum executive chairman.) Schwab's legacy is deeply intertwined with the WEF's evolution into a hub for global governance, where business leaders, politicians and activists converge annually in Davos. Critics have long accused the organization of promoting technocratic elitism, particularly after Schwab's "Great Reset" initiative, which called for restructuring economies post-pandemic through digital and biological integration. His 2022 warning of future global crises reinforced perceptions of the WEF as a self-appointed architect of humanity's future. Despite Schwab's departure, analysts doubt the WEF's direction will change. "Schwab is a megalomaniac, but his resignation won't alter the WEF's mission," said Michael Rectenwald, author of a critical book on the organization. Others, like journalist Tim Hinchliffe of The Sociable, warn that the WEF will continue pushing a technocratic agenda merging corporations, governments and digital identities. As the investigation unfolds, the WEF faces scrutiny over its governance and the conduct of its leadership. For now, Schwab's sudden exit closes a contentious chapter, but the questions surrounding his tenure â and the organization's influence â remain unresolved.

His 2022 warning of future global crises reinforced perceptions of the WEF as a self-appointed architect of humanity's future. Despite Schwab's departure, analysts doubt the WEF's direction will change. "Schwab is a megalomaniac, but his resignation won't alter the WEF's mission," said Michael Rectenwald, author of a critical book on the organization. Others, like journalist Tim Hinchliffe of The Sociable, warn that the WEF will continue pushing a technocratic agenda merging corporations, governments and digital identities. As the investigation unfolds, the WEF faces scrutiny over its governance and the conduct of its leadership. For now, Schwab's sudden exit closes a contentious chapter, but the questions surrounding his tenure â and the organization's influence â remain unresolved.

Title: Leinster’s James Culhane hoping for a change of fortune to consistently deliver on his talent
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/04/25/leinsters-james-culhane-hoping-for-a-change-of-fortune-to-consistently-deliver-on-his-talent/
Time Published: 2025-04-25T05:00:01Z
Full Content:
James Culhane may at one point have watched a black cat walk across his path from right to left – left to right is lucky apparently – spotted a single magpie, spilt salt, broken a mirror, and perhaps inadvertently witnessed many more harbingers of bad luck. It might explain his ridiculously unfortunate injury profile that dates to his teenage years. There are invariably two conversation topics when chatting to the talented 22-year-old Leinster backrow, his prowess on the pitch and his resilience in the face of periodic setbacks that might have broken players of lesser character. He’s got a lovely sense of gallows humour that’s evident in his assertion that “this will last a long time”, when asked to discuss his injuries. Culhane explained: “The worst one was in fourth year [in Blackrock College]. I started getting really bad lower back pain, got a scan and [it revealed] a stress fracture in my L5. They weren’t really sure if it was genetic from when I was born or if it had developed over time. “I was in a back brace for six months to let it heal. Then they re-scanned me, and the same defect was there, so it was pretty much genetic from when I was born. That had me out for about 11 or 12 months, pretty much all of fourth year. “I came back in fifth year and I was healthy but, unfortunately, we got knocked out in the first round of the Senior Cup by Gonzaga, so I didn’t play a huge amount of rugby. Sixth year was okay. “In first year in the [Leinster] academy I injured my ankle and had ankle surgery. Then the year after I obviously had that bad injury in Galway” (a reference to a torn hamstring and fractured shoulder suffered in the same match). “I’ve probably had about three surgeries in two years.” The fact that Leinster gave him a professional contract on a, relatively speaking, slim body of rugby – 16 appearances since making his debut against Cardiff in 2023 – speaks volumes for the esteem in which the 22-year-old is held by the coaches. It’s not as if they’re taking a punt. When Ireland won an under-20 Grand Slam in 2022, Culhane was voted the Six Nations player of the tournament on the back of several brilliant performances. Even then, he couldn’t shrug off a medical jinx as he spent a month in hospital with a severe kidney infection. He was nominated for RTÉ’s Young Player of the Year. What’s immediately obvious in watching him is his athletic prowess honed by a cross pollination of sports growing up from mini rugby in DLSP, through school, Gaelic football with Kilmacud Crokes and playing left back for Enniskerry, Wayside Celtic and Cabinteely soccer clubs. He was selected for the Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa last year and captained the team in their final game against the Cheetahs. His return to the country recently with Leinster didn’t quite meet the same success, as he was concussed five minutes in that first game against the Bulls. Breaking into Leinster’s backrow requires not only a set of disparate qualities but also the capacity to play right across the unit. “Yeah definitely you can’t really be one dimensional, you can’t just be able to play number eight, you have to play seven and six, especially when you’re trying to break into a team,” said Culhane. “It’s important. If you’re breaking into a team, you’re probably starting on the bench, and you have to cover many positions, so it is so important to be versatile. I’ve been working on how I’m viewed as a player by the coaches, so they don’t see me as one type of player you know.” Part of that process includes picking the brains of his team-mates. Culhane continued: “I think Caelan [Doris] especially and Josh [van der Flier] they’re just very easy to talk to, they’ve so much knowledge and they’re willing to give it to you as well. “I have been asking them a lot of questions about how they approach the game, especially around the contact area and ball carry and just that element which is especially important for my position. “It is taking that opportunity when you get it, especially when you’re involved with the team of internationals. On the weekend I was delighted to be playing with just so much talent around me, and the way they play elevates your game as well. When you get an opportunity to get your way into that team, you take it.” Culhane certainly honoured that goal in the victory over Ulster, 25 tackles, one turnover and leading the team in successful carries. It’s more than the metrics though; his effectiveness is just as easy to spot with the naked eye. Top of his wish list: consistent game time.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday that his role at the White House DOGE office will be secondary as he devotes more time to the EV company. Some large Tesla stakeholders and state officials criticizing the company's leadership told Business Insider that they are still concerned. "The company's disappointing earnings were proof that his lack of focus has indeed hurt the company and has permanently damaged the brand value of Tesla," Michael Frerichs, treasurer for the state of Illinois, said in a statement on Wednesday to Business Insider. "It is helpful to hear that Mr. Musk may actually do his job as Executive of Tesla, but we cannot miss the fact that he has caused long-term damage to this company." Frerichs is one of seven state treasurers who sent a letter on April 17 demanding that Tesla's board chair, Robyn Denholm, ensure that Musk devotes "adequate time to the company," given Tesla's recent performance. Depending on the state, treasurers may participate in managing their state's pension funds, which could contain positions in Tesla. "The company's success or setbacks have significant implications for workers, regional industries, and innovation ecosystems in our states," the letter, which was signed by seven state treasurers and the California comptroller, said. Tesla, Musk, and Denholm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They aren't the only large stakeholders who have expressed concern. Even before his role with the DOGE office, some institutional shareholders had urged Musk to pay more attention to Tesla because they were concerned that the chief executive was juggling too many hats with his Twitter acquisition. In May last year, a group of institutional shareholders submitted a letter to the SEC demanding that Musk and the Tesla board stay more vigilant of the company's long-term growth. Those criticisms have only grown since then. Retail traders and even the most bullish analysts have urged Musk to stay on track as Tesla continued to miss expectations. Tesla reported in its latest first-quarter earnings that total revenue fell 9% from the same period last year. The company's stock dropped 41% on Wednesday from its peak in January. Business Insider contacted the state treasurers who signed the April 17 letter and several institutional shareholders who previously expressed concerns about Tesla's governance. Here's what they said. The New York City Comptroller oversees the city's five public pension funds and has been vocal about his misgivings on Musk's leadership. Last year, he joined the coalition of shareholders who called to vote against Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package. In April, Lander urged the Adams Administration and the New York City Law Department to pursue a securities lawsuit against Tesla. "Elon Musk's pledge is far too little, too late," Oluwatona Campbell, a spokesperson for the comptroller's office, told BI in an email. "Tesla shareholders deserve a full-time CEO dedicated to leading the company, not a part-time lackey for an authoritarian climate denier. Musk must be accountable to Tesla's shareholders and the millions of current and future customers who believe in a green transition." The comptroller's office said in April that the city's five public pension systems held more than 3 million Tesla shares worth about $1.26 billion on December 31, 2024. As of March 28, the shares were worth $831 million, according to the office. Young told BI in an interview that Tuesday's earnings showed the company underperforming expectations. He said he was concerned about Musk's insistence on staying on DOGE for at least the remainder of the month. "I think that's haphazard leadership and it endangers the market and the stability of the government at the same time," said Young, one of the state treasurers who signed the April 17 letter. Young added that Musk should "step back now" from the White House office. He said he was speaking solely in his official capacity as state treasurer and not as a fiduciary to the state. Colorado state employees could have some exposure to Tesla since the state's Public Employees' Retirement Association (PERA) offers a large-cap stock fund with holdings in major US companies, including 2.3% of its holdings in Tesla. PERA's reporting as of December 2024 showed that the fund held about $2.8 billion in assets under management, which means the fund's position in Tesla could be around $64.4 million as of Wednesday. "Yesterday's earnings call from Tesla offered plenty of promises, but what the American people need is performance," Goldberg, who signed the April 17 letter, said in a statement to BI. "It is time for the board to step up and ensure this company delivers and realizes its full potential. We will be watching for meaningful progress over time, not just ambitious words." Goldberg sits on the nine-member board of the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management, which oversees the state's pension benefits. A spokesperson told BI that the Pension Reserves Investment Trust Fund has about $315 million of passive exposure to Tesla stock, given its holdings in the S&P 500. Russell signed the April 17 letter and, as the principal fiduciary of the state's Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, told BI, "Musk has put Tesla employees, customers, and investors at financial risk." "While we are cautiously optimistic about the market's positive response to Elon Musk's pledge to refocus on his day job, we await concrete actions and will ultimately judge him on performance. The reputational damage he has caused Tesla may never fully be repaired, and his efforts to shift blame onto protesters and recast his role in DOGE as part of his fiduciary responsibility to Tesla are misleading diversions that risk further alienating customers." A spokesperson for the treasurer's office said Tesla represents about $230 million in passive investments of the state's Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, which have about $60 billion in assets under management. KLP, a Norway-based pension company that holds about 900,000 shares of Tesla, was one of the institutional shareholders that criticized Musk's pay package. In a statement to BI, Embu said Musk may have breached his fiduciary duty as Tesla's CEO by prioritizing personal interests over the company's best interests. "His involvement with DOGE appears to offer little strategic value to Tesla, as his association with the Trump administration has arguably harmed Tesla's brand image and sales outlook," he said. Frerichs, who joined the group of state treasurers criticizing Tesla's leadership in the April 17 letter, told BI he was "glad" that Musk committed to spending more time on his company and looks forward to hearing more details to repair the "damage he has done." "Tesla's earnings report was a testament to what happens when a CEO does not have his eye on the ball," he said in an email, adding that "we can call the last three months what it is — a failure by Elon Musk to the duty and care that all shareholders expect from any CEO." A spokesperson for Frerichs' office said the treasurer doesn't manage the sprawling network of pension funds in the state. Pellicciotti told BI in a statement that "the board of Tesla needs to take seriously the severe damage their CEO is doing to the company's performance, brand, and commitment to bringing needed supply and innovation to the EV market." "If Musk's plan is to be a part time CEO and part time Trump surrogate, I'm far from convinced there is a path to recovery, let alone success, in either endeavor," he said. As treasurer, Pellicciotti is a member of the Washington State Investment Board, which manages the state's public retirement and trust funds. However, he does not speak on behalf of the board. As of December 31, the WSIB's top 10 holdings included Tesla at 1% of the $45 billion in assets under management, or roughly $450 million. In February, the American Federation of Teachers — a group of trustees who serve on public pension funds holding positions on Tesla stock — urged major asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard to review their investments in the EV company, as the stock plunged earlier this year. The group said the pension funds amount to about $4 trillion, including a "material amount" invested in Tesla shares. In a statement to BI, Weingarten said that Tesla's first-quarter earnings were "disastrous" but expected. "On the earnings call, Elon Musk dismissed the problems facing his company and claimed real full self-driving is still just around the corner," Weingarten said. "Tesla continues to be a huge risk to pension portfolios and retirement security. What will Tesla's board do to address this?" Jump to

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Go ‘Pac-Man’ Mode, Gobble Up $1.2 Billion In 1 Week

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Capital poured into US-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds this week, with Tuesday alone witnessing nearly $1 billion in fresh cash. The rush propelled weekly inflows to $1.2 billion and total assets under management (AUM) to $103 billion, based on Bloomberg data. The investment deluge occurred while Bitcoin’s price rose above $93,000, reaching $93,700 – its highest since early March. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) remains at the forefront with year-to-date inflows of $2.7 billion. The fund took in another $346 million last week alone. Ark Invest’s ARKB and Grayscale’s Bitcoin funds lag behind with significantly smaller year-to-date inflows of $410.41 million and $385.31 million. Not everything is coming up roses, however. Grayscale’s GBTC has seen $1.18 billion of outflows since January, going against the overall positive tide. The spot bitcoin ETFs went Pac-Man mode yesterday, +$936m, $1.2b for week. Also notable is 10 of 11 of the originals all took in cash too. Good sign to see flow depth vs say $IBIT doing 90% of the lifting. Price up $93.5k. Pretty strong all things considered IMO. pic.twitter.com/HeLwffgT8F — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 23, 2025 Ten of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of fresh funds this week, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported. They’re going “Pac-Man mode”, the analyst said on X. That broad-based involvement indicates institutional players are diversifying their bets into several funds rather than focusing on one or two. The value traded across all Bitcoin spot ETFs totaled $496 million, while net assets in them now represent nearly $57 billion – equivalent to around 2.80% of Ethereum’s market cap. As Bitcoin-linked investments thrive, Ethereum products simply can’t seem to get a break. According to reports from CoinShares, investment products centered around Ethereum lost yet another $26.7 million last week. This takes their eight-week outflow amount to a mind-boggling $772 million. Even in the face of this continued outflow, Ethereum remains in second place for year-to-date inflows at $215 million. Short Bitcoin products are experiencing the squeeze. Short BTC products had their seventh consecutive week of outflows, with $1.2 million exiting these funds. CoinShares data show that these short bets have now lost $36 million over seven weeks – 40% of their assets under management. The ongoing outflows from short positions are consistent with Bitcoin’s recent price strength. XRP is the only exception among alternative coins, and its investment products attracted over $37 million last week, the third highest for year-to-date inflows on $214 million. This defies the trend observed in most of the other altcoins, which still face selling pressure. Certainly, all of this new money being poured into Bitcoin ETF investments is perhaps the clearest sign yet that traditional financial institutions are coming around to cryptocurrency as an asset class. We’re talking almost $1 billion coming into the market in just one day: this looks like the dawn of a new era in which acceptance of the asset class by the mainstream is even greater. Featured image from Wallpapers.com, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

The protocol proposed a discussion on structuring approaches that would allow for the compliant issuance and distribution of tokenized securities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ondo Finance and legal counsel from Davis Polk & Wardwell met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Crypto Task Force on April 24 to discuss regulatory pathways for tokenized versions of publicly traded US securities, according to a memorandum reviewed by the agency’s staff. The meetings focused on structuring options and regulatory considerations for issuing tokenized securities, particularly those referencing assets such as US equities and fixed-income instruments. The topics listed revealed that Ondo’s presentation addressed regulatory challenges, including registration requirements, broker-dealer obligations, market structure rules, financial crimes compliance, and the application of state corporate laws. The firm proposed a discussion on structuring approaches that would allow for the compliant issuance and distribution of tokenized securities while exploring possibilities for participating in a regulatory sandbox or targeted relief. Additionally, Ondo’s legal team outlined key considerations around investor protection, anti-money laundering compliance, and the application of the Exchange Act to token-based issuance models. The initiative marks another step in Ondo’s broader push to integrate traditional financial assets into blockchain-native environments. The firm currently manages over $1 billion in tokenized products, representing 16.4% of the $6.15 billion tokenized US Treasuries market. The Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG) is a blockchain-based fund that tokenizes exposure to short-term US Treasuries. Its primary backing is the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), and the fund aims to deliver yield while maintaining liquidity at all times. Meanwhile, a combination of short-term Treasuries and demand deposits held with banks secures Ondo’s US Dollar Yield Token (USDY). Designed to mimic the accessibility of stablecoins, USDY targets non-US investors seeking exposure to US dollar-denominated returns without using traditional financial intermediaries. Both products represent a growing asset class within tokenized finance, consisting of applying blockchain infrastructure to wrap and manage real-world securities in a digitally native format. The meeting represents part of a broader industry effort to seek clarity on regulatory guidelines since SEC leadership changed in January. Since creating its Crypto Task Force on Jan. 21, the regulator has held 81 meetings with key figures from the crypto industry. The meetings involved discussions around a wide range of subjects, including implementing staking in exchange-traded products (ETPs) and the impact of market manipulation on centralized platforms. These movements highlight how the regulator is now open to engaging with the crypto industry under the President Donald Trump administration.

Title: Greenlane’s flagship electric charging truck stop is now online [update]

Time Published: 2025-04-24T20:18:18Z
Full Content:
Greenlane, which is rolling out a US EV charging network for big rigs, just switched on its first electric truck stop in Colton, California. April 24, 2025: The flagship facility, at the intersection of Interstates 215 and 10, was completed eight months after breaking ground. It’s got 41 OEM-agnostic chargers with 12 pull-through lanes and CCS 400 kW dual-port chargers with liquid-cooled cables. They’re built to handle big Class 8 electric rigs with ease. Twenty-nine bobtail lanes feature CCS 180 kW chargers. Colton offers a spacious lounge with food and drinks, a water refill station, and restrooms. There’s free wifi, mobile charging stations, and 24/7 customer support. Security includes round-the-clock on-site attendants, security cameras, gated access, and enhanced lighting. Office space is available for leasing, and there’s overnight truck and trailer parking. It’s the first of several electric charging truck stops planned for the company’s I-15 commercial EV charging corridor. Greenlane plans to expand its network with future sites expected roughly every 60 to 90 miles in Long Beach, Barstow, and Baker, California. Greenlane has also secured its first commercial fleet customer, fully electric truckload carrier Nevoya, which will begin operating its fleet of electric trucks out of Colton early next month. Nevoya will use the charging infrastructure and occupy on-site office space. The two companies plan to scale the partnership to include up to 100 of Nevoya’s electric trucks. March 11, 2025: Builder and developer Mortenson is constructing the commercial EV charging facility in Colton, which broke ground last September. It will include more than 40 chargers when it comes online for heavy, medium, and light-duty EVs. In its next phase, Greenlane plans to deploy solar panels and battery storage to enhance grid stability, manage peak loads, and increase energy efficiency. Greenlane’s pull-through lane chargers will be equipped with Alpitronic CCS 400 kW dual-port chargers featuring oil-cooled cables. That means faster charging without the bulk—these cables stay lightweight and easy to handle. For bobtail charging, eFill CCS 180 kW chargers will be available, bringing smart energy management to keep fleet operations running smoothly. To keep everything in check, ABB’s SCADA system will handle remote monitoring and breaker management, boosting reliability and efficiency. Plus, Greenlane’s sites are built with Trenwa precast cable trench, making it easier to expand EV charging infrastructure and upgrade to megawatt charging as fleet demand grows. Greenlane, a joint venture between Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy, and BlackRock, also debuted its branded digital technology suite as part of its ongoing development of the I-15 Commercial EV Charging Corridor. The products will be rolled out in phases. Greenlane’s Chief Technology Officer, Raj Jhaveri, said, “Our technology helps maximize uptime and operational efficiency by ensuring vehicles are charged efficiently and ready to meet the demands of their freight schedules.” The tech rollout includes an app that allows drivers to check charger availability and make reservations in advance, a fleet portal that enables fleet managers and dispatchers to plan and manage routes for their electric fleets, and a new Greenlane website. I've never seen a charger site with such an expanse of solar panels. I think it is a very important message to send to to the public to pair solar panels with EV charging. Back of the envelope calculations, however, show that the panels can at best only provide a full charge for maybe 3-4 trucks per day. The vast majority of electricity must come from the grid (hopefully from giant wind/solar farms). Greenlane also now has OnRamp Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that integrate with existing fleet solutions, providing fleet managers and drivers access to optimized routes, efficient charging and refueling schedules, and related charging data and emissions savings.

April 24, 2025 13:00 ET | Source: DelveInsight Business Research LLP DelveInsight Business Research LLP New York, USA, April 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Neuroprosthetics Market Expanding Rapidly at a CAGR of ~13% by 2032 Amid Surge in Demand for Advanced Neurological Treatments | DelveInsight The neuroprosthetics market is experiencing significant growth, driven by advancements in neuroscience and technology. The increasing prevalence of neurological disorders, along with rising demand for more effective treatments, is boosting market expansion. Innovations in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and implantable devices are also contributing to the growth. Additionally, greater investment in research and development, alongside improved healthcare infrastructure, is expected to fuel the market's potential in the coming years. DelveInsight’s Neuroprosthetics Market Insights report provides the current and forecast market analysis, individual leading neuroprosthetics companies’ market shares, challenges, neuroprosthetics market drivers, barriers, trends, and key market neuroprosthetics companies in the market. Neuroprosthetics Overview Neuroprosthetics refers to the development and use of devices that interact with the nervous system to restore or enhance lost sensory or motor functions. These devices are typically designed to replace damaged or nonfunctional parts of the nervous system, enabling individuals with neurological impairments, such as paralysis or sensory loss, to regain some level of function. Neuroprosthetic devices can range from simple, external devices like cochlear implants, which restore hearing, to more complex systems like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which enable direct communication between the brain and external devices. These systems are designed to decode neural signals and translate them into actionable outputs, which can then control a prosthetic limb, assistive technology, or even restore vision. The field of neuroprosthetics holds significant potential in revolutionizing the treatment of a wide range of neurological conditions, including spinal cord injuries, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases. Advancements in materials science, microelectronics, and neural engineering are driving innovations in more sophisticated, functional, and minimally invasive devices. Researchers are exploring neural interfaces that could allow for greater precision in restoring lost functions, as well as approaches that integrate with the brain's natural neural pathways. The goal of neuroprosthetics is not only to improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities but also to enable a deeper understanding of how the brain and nervous system function, potentially leading to breakthroughs in treating neurological disorders.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin stash grows to $103B – Should we be concerned?

What if Satoshi breaks the decade-long silence and sells? Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin [BTC], has once again found their dormant fortune thrust into the spotlight as BTC prices surge past $94,000. With an estimated 1.1 million Bitcoin under their control, untouched since the protocol’s earliest days, Nakamoto’s holdings have now soared past the $103 billion mark, dramatically reclaiming billionaire status. This rally, which marks a 27% rebound from Bitcoin’s recent five-month low, has sparked both celebration and unease within the crypto community. As the asset approaches uncharted highs, speculation is intensifying around the one question that has lingered for years: what happens if Satoshi ever decides to sell? Source: Meta Gorgonite/X Echoing similar sentiments, was another X (formerly Twitter) user – Dan Lucro, who added, “The question is, will he ever sell… and when?” As expected, another user put it best when he said, Source: Nate Ryan/X Even as Bitcoin’s price continues its upward trajectory, falling to $92,357.57 at press time, following a 1.44% daily drop, Satoshi Nakamoto’s legendary Bitcoin holdings remain untouched. The estimated 1.1 million BTC attributed to Bitcoin’s mysterious creator were mined in the network’s infancy using what is now known as the “Patoshi Pattern,” a distinct mining fingerprint that has helped trace these early coins. Despite growing market speculation and price momentum, Nakamoto has never moved a single coin from this massive stash, further fueling the mystique surrounding their identity and long-term intentions. As Bitcoin’s institutional adoption continues to grow, entities like BlackRock and MicroStrategy now collectively hold more BTC than Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated stash. While Tesla’s 11,509 BTC may not rival these giants, its steadfast commitment to holding Bitcoin as a corporate asset reflects a broader shift among public companies embracing digital currencies. Yet, the absence of fiduciary responsibility sets Nakamoto’s untouched holdings apart, unlike corporations whose Bitcoin reserves are subject to regulatory oversight and shareholder scrutiny. Interestingly, MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor recently floated the idea of permanently removing access to BTC by destroying private keys after death. Hence, in a market shaped by both institutional control and mythical origins, the tension between utility and ownership continues to define Bitcoin’s evolving narrative.
