The new ETF will track the "performance of the price of Bitcoin while providing premium income through an actively managed strategy of writing (selling) call options on IBIT shares and, from time to time, on indices that track spot bitcoin exchange-traded products ('ETPs'), including [iShares Bitcoin Trust] (such indices, 'ETP Indices')," the issuer said in its SEC filing. In practice, this means the fund sells options that give other investors the right to buy its IBIT shares at a set price and collects the option premiums as income. Shares in the ETF will represent fractional beneficial interests in that income and the fund's Bitcoin, IBIT shares, and cash. A BlackRock spokesperson told Decrypt the firm cannot comment further on how the new fund will compare to competitors or when it will share details about the expense ratio for the new ETF. It's normal for initial S-1 registrations to leave out details like tickers, custodians, and management fees. But for the sake of context, there are a few similar Bitcoin income or covered-call ETFs already trading. The NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF has traded under the BTCI ticker on the Cboe BZX Exchange since its October 2024 launch. As of Friday, it had $1.09 billion worth of assets under management. The expense ratio for BTCI is approximately 0.99% of assets annually. That means investors pay just under 1% of their invested assets each year to cover the fund's operating and management costs. The new BlackRock fund will also compete against the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF (YBTC) and YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF (YBIT), which account for $225 million and $74 million in assets under management, respectively. Actively managed ETFs, like BTCI and the new iShares offering, charge higher fees to cover the costs of implementing their option-writing strategy. A passive spot Bitcoin ETF, like IBIT, keeps its operating costs lower because it doesn't trade derivatives, time markets, or make discretionary strategy decisions. The structure reflects a higher-risk, higher-fee strategy that also offers the potential for higher income than a passive spot Bitcoin ETF.

All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ Bloomberg Audio Studios, podcasts, radio News. This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio. Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, I have yet another extra special guest. Zach Buckwald is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Russell Investments. They run about $370 billion. I found this to be a fascinating conversation. Russell has been at the forefront of a number of really interesting innovations, indexing and outsource, CIO and smart beta. They were way ahead of the rest of the investment world. Now they’re putting together really interesting active portfolios, including private investments. They work with both wealth clients as well as institutions. You may not know Zach’s name, but he’s got an absolutely fascinating background at BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers. I thought this conversation was fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with Russell Investments. Zach Buckwald. Zach Buchwald, welcome to Bloomberg. Zach Buchwald: Delighted to be here, Barry. Thanks for having me. Barry Ritholtz: Thank you so much for joining us. I spoke to your predecessor about three years ago, right after the pandemic, but let’s start talking a little bit about your background. Undergraduate bachelor’s degree at Harvard. What were you studying there? Zach Buchwald: I Studied English, so this was not on the, on the docket that I was gonna have a career in finance. Barry Ritholtz: Not, not the plan, huh? So, so you come outta school in 96. What was your first gig? Zach Buchwald: So outta school, I applied to law, law school, not sort of knowing where I was going. And I, and I decided to have a little break before I, before I went back to school. And I got recruited by, by Lehman Brothers. So I spent two years working in structured finance at, at Lehman Brothers, and it became apparent to me right away, I didn’t wanna become a, a corporate lawyer ’cause I worked with lawyers. And that was, that was not the job for me, but I had a knack for it. I enjoyed it. I always liked math, even though I was an English major. And, you know, you can find other ways to put your writing and your reading acumen to, to work as well. Barry Ritholtz: And I’m gonna say late 1990s, nobody had any clue what was coming a decade later. Zach Buchwald: Not at all. No. Lehman Brothers was a great place to, to start my career, but after two years, I went to Morgan Stanley and that, that’s how I think at the beginning of my career. ’cause I spent 10 years at Morgan Stanley, I was very invested in the firm, and the firm was, was invested in me. I learned about, you know, the capital markets top to bottom. And I, I had a, a career there that took me from, you know, from a starting associate role to running a business that became the CLO business, which now is like a real, you know, really important part of capital markets. What, Barry Ritholtz: What were your titles there? What’d you do there? Zach Buchwald: Yeah, well I started as an associate within, within fixed income. I, you know, I was in sales, I was in trading, I was in structuring. I always worked within the credit derivative space. And then ultimately credit derivatives started getting wrapped up in different ways. And I, and I worked on the CLO platform and Morgan Stanley had a leading CLO platform that by the end of my my time there, i, I ran. And that was about, you know, I think about the role that CLOs play in the, you know, in the, in the markets today. It’s a, an enormous origination function that helps, you know, finance a lot of corporate America. Barry Ritholtz: John Mack was CEO at the time, is that right? Zach Buchwald: I was there for Phil Purcell and I was there for John Mack. Barry Ritholtz: Wow. Those are two legends in, in the industry. What inspired you to head over to BlackRock? Zach Buchwald: I went to BlackRock with the guy that I was working for at Morgan Stanley. And we created a business that was essentially an advisory practice. This was 2008. And BlackRock was hired to work on a lot of these situations that were, you know, at the, at the start of the crisis. So we worked with the Federal Reserve, we worked with the treasury, a lot of the big financial institutions that had, you know, problematic portfolios. And BlackRock was very well positioned as a buy-side firm, as a company that sort of had an underwritten a lot of like the problematic derivative products. Barry Ritholtz: I mean, did they, they, did they even have an investing banking division back then? Zach Buchwald: No, we, I mean, we called it advisory, but essentially it was like an investment banking function. I mean, it was really consultative providing advice, running portfolio analytics, thinking about, you know, if you can separate like the liquidity crisis from the actual credit risk and, and, and the, you know, sort of the expected cash flows on these securities, what could you expect to get back? And we, you know, we created a roadmap for, for the government on how to invest in these securities that they took away. You know, that they essentially backstopped from these big organizations and tried to create a roadmap to bring them back to par to repay all the taxpayers with interest. And, and in almost every respect over, over time, the government was successful in doing that. And BlackRock really played a very special role in, in creating those roadmaps. And, you know, it wasn’t what I would think of as like a highly profitable business, but in terms of like the aura that was created around BlackRock as being like a solutions provider, you know, sort of a force for good in the world. That’s, that’s what we did. And it was a, it was a, it was a great role for me. Barry Ritholtz: I recall that era that BlackRock essentially had become the street’s bond desk. Like every brokerage firm used to have a fairly substantial bond desk. And it seemed like BlackRock has just sucked up all that paper and, and all those traders. Zach Buchwald: Well, that sounds like an HR strategy and I don’t, I don’t know that I had any, anything, any part of that, but, but there was a lot of talent for, for sure. And there continues to be a lot of talent. You know, some of those, you know, some of the folks that worked on those, you know, on those assignments are, are essentially running BlackRock now. And it was, you know, it was the consultative nature of thinking about, you know, thinking about the challenges, how we can create solutions to those challenges, thinking about the aspirations and the ambitions and, you know, that doesn’t just apply to workout situations. That applies to all, you know, kind of all the clients. And it’s something that I’ve tried to import, you know, into my current role at, at Russell. Barry Ritholtz: So you’re there for 15 years, eventually you become head of their institutional business. Yep. That’s, that’s a $2 trillion silo. And you also helped establish BlackRock Retirement Solutions. Explain what these groups do. Yeah, Zach Buchwald: Barry Ritholtz: So after, after the consulting practice, I, I went on to run the insurance business at BlackRock. That was a $200 billion business at the time. A little sleepy, not, you know, what I would say is like a growth center. And, and it was housed with the, the business itself was housed with true insurance experts, asset liability experts, people who really understood like the nuts and bolts of, of insurance companies. And I, I did not have an insurance background and, you know, for the first year, I had an insurance guy sort of stapled to me every time I went to a client, make sure I didn’t get out over my skis. But, you know, but you know, this, being an outsider sometimes can actually really, you know, help you think, think externally about some of the things that might be impacting the, the, the, the clients, the industry, the sector, the business itself. And early on when I was in that role, we ran an analysis of the whole US insurance industry. Every company that was bigger than a billion dollars of general account assets. And we asked ourselves the question, what are some of the external factors that could impact these companies that they might not be expecting or prepared for? And, and where could BlackRock play a role in helping them deal with those kinds of challenges? And we came up with seven situations, Barry, that we thought were gonna have like seismic type impacts on the companies. And four of them happened. And in three of those cases, BlackRock went on to, to play a really big role and, and run the general accounts. And that was more than a hundred billion dollars of assets. And we put on another a hundred billion dollars along the way. So that was the case where the business started growing like very meaningfully. And I think BlackRock sort of paid a lot of attention to that and realized, gee, we could play a bigger role with these insurance companies. They’re gonna do a lot more interesting things than just invest in, you know, sort of high quality fixed income over time. You also had some interesting stuff happening with Apollo and Athene. They were kind of remaking the model a little bit. And, and BlackRock, you know, pays a lot of attention to what’s going on in the, in the outside world. And we, we, we grew the business Barry Ritholtz: To say the very least, what are they, 12, $13 trillion now in assets. Zach Buchwald: It’s a good business. Yeah. Barry Ritholtz: So 10 years at Morgan Stanley, 15 years at BlackRock, what lessons did you take from those experiences to Russell Investments? Yeah, Zach Buchwald: Well, first and foremost, it’s all about the client. And if you lose sight of that understanding the, what the client is dealing with, their challenges, their ambitions, their aspirations, being a consultative provider, if you start from a push out, like, here are the products that I have, here are the things that I’ve done before, it almost never works. And it also, that’s not the, the age that we’re living in today. The age that we’re living in is how can I, how can I help you achieve the outcomes that you’re trying to get to? How can I anticipate some of the challenges that you’re gonna experience? How can I help you learn from some of the things that I’ve, you know, I’ve seen in the sector or the industry? And you start from there and it builds a foundation with the client that is just ir sort of irreplaceable. So that’s, I mean, that was one really important learning. Now, I, I, I came into Russell because Russell had like, first of all, it’s a 90 year legacy. Thank you for starting with that 1936. Barry Ritholtz: that’s a, that’s a, you’re coming up on a century soon. Zach Buchwald: Yeah, exactly. I’m really proud to, to run, I’m the eighth CEOO by the way of, of in 90 years of Russell Investments. I mean, that’s, so for a US asset manager that’s old. And I think about the things that Russell has done in that time, Barry, I mean, it’s been a real innovator and category creator. Everybody knows the Russell indexes, which were, you know, sort of cultivated and innovated in all sorts of cool ways. And we all have it in our pensions and our 4 0 1 Ks. You know, Russell was the original pension investment consultant. We created that category. Rus Russell was the original OCIO and we’re still a, a leader in, in OCIO. These are, these are really, you know, sort of important categories that have a big impact on, on the investment ecosystem. And what was, what was special to me about Russell, and the reason I wanted to join is Russell’s approach to doing all of these solutions is it’s entirely open architecture. So the view is we build and implement portfolios at Russell, which is, you know, something I worked on at BlackRock and to some extent in Morgan Stanley too. But the idea is we use best of breed managers and strategies from around the whole investment universe. So if I put together an OCIO portfolio at Russell, I’m building, you know, fixed income manager, you know, the best quality fixed income managers, the best private assets managers, the best cash and, and so on, and best index products. You know, we can kind of, it’s, it’s, we can kind of go everywhere within the ecosystem. And that was a model that I was very excited about because it became more about, like, thinking through the lens of what the client is looking to achieve and how can I use all of the tools and the ingredients available as opposed to sort of a set, you know, set of tools that I, that I had at, at hand from the company that I worked for. Barry Ritholtz: We’re gonna talk about pensions. OCI we’re gonna talk about a little later. I didn’t realize this till I started doing my homework. Russell is effectively credited with inventing smart beta. I mean, who, who knew that? I think of a, a couple of other firms as taking the leadership in that recently. But 40 years ago you guys were on the, on the cutting edge of that. What is it like running a firm that has a near century long legacy? How does that affect how you think about risks and opportunities? Zach Buchwald: Yeah, it, I mean, the legacy is a, is a wonderful thing. But you know, you can’t rest. Like we all know we can’t rest on our laurels. It’s, you know, the, the, the job for me is to make sure that I’m taking sort of the best parts of the history and the legacy, the innovative spirit, all these cool things that we’ve done, and then evolving them for the world that we’re in today, our, our, our mainline business, we have, we have sort of two central businesses. It’s OCIO and it’s model portfolios that we do on the retail side, which is essentially same kind of ideas of the institutional business, building great portfolios and implementing them. 90% of our business is those, is falls into those two categories. What I need to do today is make sure that I’m using all of the tools available. So as the market moves from, you know, active products to passive products, as the market starts integrating private assets with public assets, all of that is part of our portfolio today. And, and so the goal, you know, as the leader is to make sure that the strategy is incorporating, we’re open architecture. It’s, it’s truly incorporating the entire ecosystem into the, into what we build for our clients. Barry Ritholtz: I want to get your feedback on a quote of yours. I found in my, in my homework quote, financial security is a central challenge for this industry. How did your experiences at BlackRock, at Morgan Stanley and way back when at Lehman Brothers, how did it affect your, your concept of financial security, Zach Buchwald: Financial security and retirement security especially? Took me a little bit of time to hone in on Barry. I mean, I think back to my years at Morgan Stanley, and, you know, the job there was very much about sort of like finding the arbitrage and the markets. It’s where can we make money on as a sales and trading function? And we help clients along the way, you know, by delivering the products and services that they want. But first and foremost, it was about the investment bank. And, and that changed for me. I had a, I had a review with my boss at the time, and she said to me something that she meant as a compliment. She said to me, Zach, you can really smell the money. And I went away. And that was not the legacy that I wanted from my career. And, you know, I moved to BlackRock shortly after that where I was helping, you know, the, the government, the taxpayers deal with like, really critical issues, like really big thorny problems that were gonna have an impact on, you know, on the quality of life of the people in this, in this country. And it, it was a complete reset of my perspective. You know, now we build portfolios at Russell, but you know, if I’m working for a pension or a 401k or an insurance company, at the end of the day, I’m serving individuals. I’m helping them. And we don’t lose sight of that. I’m helping them have a secure retirement. Now, by the way, they have to do their part too, because it’s also about, you know, saving, early, contributing, making sure that you’re, you know, learning about the, the plan and making the right decisions. But the role that we play within the industry is a make or break in terms of whether they’re able to, whether they’re able to achieve that. Now you also have something going on in the background that’s, that’s gonna have a very big impact in the next couple of decades with retirees in America. And, and that is that really the risk has shifted. Now, the retirement security risk has shifted from, you know, organizations like the companies and the government Barry Ritholtz: Companies in defined benefits, correct. To defined contributions to defined contribution. Zach Buchwald: So the standard model, the standard pension model is shifting to the 401k and today still about half of retirees have access to a pension. And that plus, plus social security, more or less gets the job done. But in another decade it’s gonna be less than a third. And in another two decades it’s gonna be very little at all. So that means that now the 401k is the staple that’s gonna, you know, result in a, a secure comfortable retirement or, or not. And you know, the, the, the big challenge with a 401k is that the risk of saving, investing and also decumulation, taking that pot of money and knowing how long, you know, the longevity risk, knowing how, thinking about how long you’re gonna live and how to allotted over time, all of that risk will now be borne by the individual. And we have not fully processed that in the, you know, within, within the country that this is a crisis that’s coming, that people aren’t prepared to, to own that responsibility. And the system today isn’t set up in such a way that sort of, the decisions are very easy to, you know, to make at the, the onus is really still on the individual. Barry Ritholtz: So that’s really fascinating. H how does that affect what you see within your role as CEO at Russell Investments? Yeah, Zach Buchwald: Well thanks Barry. Our whole mission is built around helping people achieve financial security. And we do that on the institutional side by partnering with corporate sponsors and helping to, you know, ensure that the plans that they’re, you know, putting in place and the role that they play through matching through, you know, providing lifetime income, whatever the set of benefits are is gonna be, is gonna serve the participants in the way that we think is gonna help them have, you know, retire with confidence and with with security. But as the, you know, as the machine shifts and it moves more toward a, a 401k and then, you know, a lot of folks end up with a nest egg that they have to manage on their own. The goal is to make sure that on the wealth side, we also have sort of the right kinds of products and services and solutions that help them, you know, understand the income, help them understand decumulation, help them get the right diversification, help them get fair fees. I mean, the goal is to make sure that we’re, we’re really delivering sort of a set of products and services that’s gonna allow them to live the kind of retirement that they all they’ll hope for. 00:16:12 [Speaker Changed] Hmm, really, really interesting. So whenever I talk to people about Russell, everybody knows the Russell 2000. The question is, what does Russell do? How do they make money on they, they must do something more than the Russell 2000. Tell us a little bit about the different business lines at, at Russell Investments. Sure. 00:16:31 [Speaker Changed] So the index business is now owned by London Stock Exchange, and they, they do a magnificent job with it. And we still have a little bit of the, you know, the aura. Every time I’m in the elevator I see the advertisements for Russell and I think I didn’t have to pay for that ad. We get, we get the benefit. The business is predominantly an a, it’s an active asset management business. And, and we really have one main function, Barry. It’s about building and implementing great portfolios. And we do it for institutional clients and we do it for retail clients. So building the portfolios is really about sort of, you know, it’s portfolio construction, it’s strategies and managers. For 90 years we’ve done manager research at, at Russell we have, you know, a huge team of people. Now it’s augmented by AI and technology helping us look at 16,000 different managers and figuring out, we invest with about 225 of them, you know, figuring out which managers and strategies we think make sense in the different portfolios we create. And then the implementation is one of the coolest parts. ’cause that’s, we actually do the investing on behalf of the managers. They, they typically give us model portfolios and, and then all the things around the portfolio that can, you know, be very incremental. It’s the, the transitions, it’s the, the hedging completion exercise, completion mandates, overlays, and, you know, those things can be alpha generative, they can be very important for risk management. You can add a values overlay for for clients. And so it’s a, it’s a full portfolio delivery at the end of the day. 00:17:54 [Speaker Changed] Coming up, we continue our conversation with Zach Buckwald, chairman and CEO of Russell Investments discussing exactly what Russell Investments does for its clients. I’m Barry Ritholtz, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. I’m Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Zach Buckwald, he’s chairman and chief executive officer of Russell Investments. The firm was founded in 1936 and runs about $370 billion. Zach joined Russell in 2023 coming from his previous career at BlackRock. So you mentioned you’re researching 16,000 different managers and internally you’re generating just a fire hose of data. How do you analyze that? What value is that data to the firm? 00:18:59 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I mean, the data is everything and we, we have, we do have a, you know, historical trove of, of data, but it changes quickly. You think about how quickly the, you know, the investment ecosystem e evolves and, you know, managers have strategies that make sense on one day and then things change and, and those strategies don’t make sense. So it’s, it really has to stay current even though we, you know, we certainly value the, the historical data and, and performance and use it. We start with 16,000 and the first layer is largely technology driven. So it’s, you know, we have huge feeds that take into, you know, that, that take in and analyze all of the available information that’s provided to us by managers directly. And also that we can find out there in the, in the public domain. 00:19:44 [Speaker Changed] When you say managers, are these mutual fund managers, ETF managers, private managers, or all the above? 00:19:50 [Speaker Changed] It’s, it’s all of the above. I mean, typically because of our size and scale, we don’t, we don’t invest in a ton of direct like shared products. We do much more sep sort of separate accounts and, but we do invest in mutual funds. We do invest in ETFs or index products where, where that makes sense and that can help, you know, drive down cost or, you know, help with the diversification. But, but the managers is for the act, the active strategies and active represents, I’m gonna guess probably 85% of the assets in that that we manage overall. Remember we’re using different active strategies as the building blocks to create these portfolios. So predominantly it’s not Russell managed, although, you know, we can talk about the smart beta that you, you, you brought up predominantly. These are externally managed strategies that we bring together and then we collapse the whole thing together in one portfolio. And we look enterprise wide because you might have, you know, three active equity managers and they’re not paying attention to what the other ones are doing. And so you can end up with outsized positions or underweights, you can end up with, you know, people on opposite sides of trades and we look to, you know, to correct or make adjustments where it makes sense. 00:20:57 [Speaker Changed] So you guys were very innovative and helped create the concept of outsource chief investment Officer o CIOs. Tell us a little bit about that business line. Who are the clients and, and h how much assets are, does that run? 00:21:13 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so OCIO represents the lion’s share of the 370 billion that that we manage. And it’s a fast growing segment, not just at Russell, but it’s growing because a lot of companies are, are outsourcing their pensions or their 4 0 1 ks to, you know, folks that live and breathe the markets and that think about retirement security like we do all, all day long. So, you know, a typical day at Bloomberg might have one top story about a big corp, you know, big US corporate that’s chosen to outsource their retirement portfolio. Now we work with a lot of in-house teams as well. We help by bringing in, you know, any of those implementation services like transitions and hedging. We do that for a lot of, a lot of companies that have internal teams. But sometimes sponsors decide to, you know, to hire retirement experts to, to run their, to run their retirement portfolio and that’s when they would bring in an outsourced chief investment officer. We’re a top five provider and it’s some of the big, you know, the other big asset managers that, that also provide that we’re the ones who do it with an open architecture framework. So the goal is not to, you know, have Russell run the whole portfolio. It’s to bring in best of breed managers and to bring those together. 00:22:16 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really kind of interesting. When you talk about hedging, are you hedging equity, hedging fixed income? What, what is the hedging business like? 00:22:25 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it can be all of the above. Also a foreign, you know, foreign currency, you know, it can be hedging individual sectors. You might have a sponsor that’s in the technology sector and they feel like they already have enough exposure to technology. And so you can, you know, make some adjustments to the portfolio. That way you can also build in a values orientation for, you know, organizations that have a particular, you know, view of the world that they wanna express in their investment portfolios. 00:22:50 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about smart beta, which Russell helped pioneer in 1985 way before your time or my time for that matter. Is this still something that’s a key part of what you’re doing? 00:23:03 [Speaker Changed] So we still have a strong footprint within systematic Barry and you know, Russell manages on average between 10 and 20% of the portfolios that, that we look after. And systematic typically is within that, that 10 to 20% we use it not to make, you know, credit decisions or stock picking decisions. Like that’s not, that’s not our game. That’s why we hire external managers who are, you know, true experts in that we use it to like round out the portfolio to make adjustments to make sure that the portfolio is complying with why the client hired us or whatever their investment, you know, their stated investment strategy says. But smart beta is, you know, one of the many places where Russell was an innovator and you know, these things can sort of take on a, a life of their own as the, as the industry adopts those practices. 00:23:46 [Speaker Changed] We mentioned artificial intelligence earlier. Tell us how you’re using AI and either risk management portfolio construction or just data analytics. 00:23:55 [Speaker Changed] So Barry, we have a list this long of sort of, you know, desired use cases that we’re working on for, for ai. And I, I think we’re still in, in early innings here, but the kinds of things that we use AI for today very effectively are more task oriented. You know, we have it fill out our RFPs, we have it build pitch decks. We have actually, we use AI to, you know, read 500 page filings, you know, which we used to have a human being do back in the day. And it’s very effective at that. The real goal for, you know, for this company is that I want AI to actually help us with investment insights, with manager research insights that’s gonna actually drive performance at the end of the day. And I think we still have a fair amount of, we’re making progress, but I think we still have a fair amount of work before, before that happens. But, you know, that’s the view where having, you know, having a, a portfolio where we look after 16,000 different strategies and, and managers, we’re starting from a place where we, like, as you said, we have troves of, of information, of historical information that we’re relying on and that we’re using AI to sort of help build out that framework. 00:24:59 [Speaker Changed] So I’m, I’m always fascinated by, you know, the old joke is no one’s ever seen a bad back test and AI and those sort of things are o only capable of looking at what’s already occurred and built into all, all of those back tests and to some, some degree built in to AI is that the future is gonna resemble the past. How do you navigate around that? Because sometimes the future doesn’t resemble the past, just look at AI and how it’s changing so many aspects of, of various businesses. Yeah, 00:25:34 [Speaker Changed] Well that’s a place where, you know, I’m still pretty optimistic that there’s an enormous amount of value creation to come Barry, because the, you know, what we’ve seen from AI so far, at least how it’s, how it’s shown up in terms of, you know, in the, in the market performance has been almost entirely Harvard in the technology sector. It’s where, you know, sort of where ai, EEE exists. What we haven’t seen yet is all of the other sectors that we know are gonna be sort of enormously impacted by the proper use of ai, the creative and innovative use of ai. So, you know, you see a little bit of it in like healthcare and life sciences, but you know, logistics and shipping and consumer goods and in investments, asset management, they’re all gonna get transformed by AI because it’s changing things. And you know, this is where I’m, I’m really optimistic that we have a lot more room to run in, in, in the markets today is because you’re still not seeing like all the, you know, the potential and the benefits of, of AI showing up in some of these, you know, what we think of as sectors that are peripheral to technology. 00:26:37 But you know, in truth technology is like critical to how we, you know, how we all exist. 00:26:42 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Makes makes a lot of sense. Let’s talk about private markets. How can Russell Investments help their clients access private markets between AI and privates? Those are probably the two hottest topics we’ve been talking about this year. 00:26:57 [Speaker Changed] So privates represents about 7% of the portfolios that we manage. It’s heavier in, in the institutional portfolios. It’s lighter right now within wealth portfolios. There’s a lot more growth that’s, that’s gonna happen, especially in wealth. I think the average wealth client has something like one or 2% of their portfolio outside of their real estate holdings about one or 2% in private. And that number is going to grow and, and should grow, right? Because this is a really important source of, you know, re return and risk diversification. And if you rely on the historical precedence, it’s been an enormous outperformer writ large. And so, you know, kind of delivering, you know, access is a, it’s a very important, you know, function that we do at Russell, but also that we work with our financial advisor partners to, to figure out the best ways. ’cause it’s, you know, how you deliver privates to to, to institutional investors is, is different, right? 00:27:48 There’s tax considerations and reporting considerations, liquidity considerations that all need to be considered with, with individuals. So we’re trying to do this, you know, really judiciously within wealth portfolios, wealthy people, wealthy families, there’s a lot of room to run here. You know, I’m being extra cautious when I think about, you know, sort of 4 0 1 ks or you know, 401k graduates, you know, middle class people nest eggs. ’cause that’s where, you know, I think about are these appropriate investments? Do they help with financial security? Can you get your money back when you need it? Are the fees, you know, fair and appropriate? And, and so I think you need to be extra careful with, with, you know, sort of true working people, working families and their, their retirement nest eggs. But wealth at large, there’s a, there’s a ton of room for, for private markets. 00:28:36 [Speaker Changed] So, so you mentioned 7%. Where could this possibly go? Is this 10%, 15%, 20%? I, I’ve heard people say 60 40 is out, it’s now 50, 30, 20 or whatever the numbers add up to. 00:28:52 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know where it gets to. It’s certainly gonna be north of, of 7%. You know, I think it’s, I think you have to think not only about what’s appropriate for the portfolios. Listen, if you do a backward looking analysis of private equity and private credit, you know, which I, outside of, you know, specific real estate investments that people choose themselves. Those are like the two biggest food groups. If you run an analysis of what those investments looked like over the last 20 years, Barry, it’s gonna be different than what you’re gonna get in the next 20 years for a lot of reasons. But, you know, I’ll tell you from my personal perspective right now, you know, in the last two years my vet’s office has been bought by private equity. Wow. My landscaper, my garbage collection, my dentist, they’re all owned by private equity now. 00:29:36 And you know, they’re doing these rollups and there’s lots of efficiencies to be created on bringing these, you know, these practices together. But, you know, that’s a pretty different investment than buying a company, right? And making a company better and selling that company, which historically is, you know, where, where private equity made its name and its reputation and the, and the return stream that we’ve seen. So, you know, another thing I think about is how am I gonna make sure that the, you know, risk and return profiles I’m putting into these portfolios that we can, you know, reasonably predict what they’re gonna look like and that we can manage them, you know, sort of appropriately given that the asset pools might look a little different than what we were, you know, what we were investing in 10 years ago. 00:30:16 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, really interesting. So let’s talk a little bit about some of the things that are going on in the market today. Fee compression has been a giant factor really since the financial crisis. You recently decided to reduce some of the fees on your flagship fixed income products. Tell us a little bit about what drove your decision and what are you thinking about in terms of fees generally? 00:30:44 [Speaker Changed] I mean, the governing precept Barry is always to make sure we’re providing value to the clients. And, you know, we do that by charging a fair and appropriate fee for what it is we’re doing. If, if I’m gonna focus on anything, it’s less about what’s the fee that I can charge and more about making sure that I’m invaluable to these clients and that we’re really, you know, helping them achieve their goals. When you, the truth is, when you do a great job for the client, the fee almost becomes not an issue. Now having said that, we have some businesses that are scaled businesses and that I compete with, you know, with other good providers and I have to make sure that we’re staying competitive. So we’re not in any way immune to fee compression. But, you know, but if you can provide a really good value proposition, it’s not such a big deal. 00:31:28 [Speaker Changed] So this has been an ongoing factor in, in the industry, particularly for active managers. And, and Russell is primarily an active manager. Are you seeing any changes in this trend globally? I mean it started very much in the United States with, with entities like BlackRock and, and especially Vanguard, your global firm. What does this look like overseas? 00:31:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, fee compression in our space is, you know, it is, comes through in different ways globally. O-O-C-I-O is the place where we’ve been sort of most susceptible to, you know, to fee compression Barry. And, you know, if I think about who we compete against, the landscape has changed for us over the last 10 years. You know, 10 years ago I competed largely against like the consult the traditional consultants. And we had a very different offering. We actually implemented the portfolio. We weren’t just doing manager research sort of on paper. We were actually trading the portfolio and, you know, doing the risk management and the overlays and the completions things that were a very big value add. And we were unique in that respect. And then along came the really big asset managers that saw OCIO in, in part as sort of a distribution function. You know, if I can deliver the entire portfolio, I can put a lot of my own underlying products into that portfolio. And by the way, that can be a great business for you if you have. But 00:32:45 [Speaker Changed] That, that’s a closed architecture. You guys run a very open architecture. 00:32:48 [Speaker Changed] We run a completely open architecture and we’re unique in that it’s true open architecture, 80 plus percent and sometimes a hundred percent of the assets come from third party managers. But we still have to compete against organizations that are running their own version, which might be closed or semi, semi closed. And you know, if you have a whole lot of underlying products you’re putting into the portfolio, it gives you a lot of leeway to change the fee or to compress the fee at the OCIO level because you’re making money in all sorts of other ways. Russell doesn’t do that. So it does mean that we were susceptible to some of the fee compression and our fees have narrowed. But the way I see the solution here is just to make sure that the value proposition that we’re offering, the way we go about building an OCIO, the costs that it, you know, it takes the, the, the, the human capital that’s required. You know, we put over a hundred million dollars into our technology system that allows us to build these open architecture portfolios. When clients understand what it is that they get from us. Paying a slightly higher fee doesn’t seem to be a big deal. 00:33:47 [Speaker Changed] What about the private markets that we’re looking at? We were talking about private equity, private credit. Yep. First, is it possible that those sort of things can be indexed and then second, they’ve always been pricier than public markets? Are we started to see any fee compression along those lines? 00:34:06 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so we haven’t seen a ton of fee compression. I mean, those are cases where I think the value proposition is crystal clear and, you know, the high performing managers can charge higher fees or, you know, substantial fees because they’ve really delivered. And you know, in general, they continue to deliver. I think if they stop delivering and the, or, you know, and, and we start seeing what look more like public markets performance or even weak public markets performance, it’s gonna be much harder for them to charge those, those fees. But that hasn’t happened yet. You know, especially within private credit and, and private equity. There’s been, you know, real outperformance, especially at the top of the heap versus the public markets. So it becomes easier to, to justify those fees. 00:34:47 [Speaker Changed] Makes a lot of sense. So let’s, let’s venture into the world of public policy a little bit. You’ve proposed national account programs to help young people start investing early. The most recent big bill that passed in this administration has these accounts for babies e every kid that’s gonna be born is gonna get, what is it, 1500 or $3,000? I don’t know what number? 00:35:11 [Speaker Changed] Thousand 00:35:11 [Speaker Changed] Dollars. A thousand dollars. All right. Better than nothing. But where do you see these sort of programs going? And if you start investing at age one day, what potential compounding can we see 50, 75, a hundred years later? 00:35:28 [Speaker Changed] Now you’re really talking my language. When Trump was elected, I wrote a piece that we put into Barron’s that Barron’s published saying that we should give a thousand dollars to every kid in America and open an investment account and let them actually learn about the power of compounding. Because it’s different when you actually own the assets. And you know, when, when you give people an investment account, you can find lots of ways to create some education, you know, investment education that goes along with it. And 00:35:51 [Speaker Changed] Lemme just interrupt you ’cause it sounds like a lot of money. There are 3 million kids born a year. It’s $3 billion. Yeah. Which to a $31 trillion economy and a six or $7 trillion government spend is, is a rounding error. 00:36:07 [Speaker Changed] It it, it’s nothing in the grand scheme of things. And you know, the, you know, you’re onto something because it got actually got criticized by both the right and the left and the right said, oh, this is another entitlement program. Oh. Anyway, we put this thing into Barron’s and to my surprise and delight, it ended up in, in the big beautiful bill. And it actually got, it actually passed. It 00:36:24 [Speaker Changed] Became passed and funded, right? 00:36:26 [Speaker Changed] It became legislation and, you know, treasury is working hard now thinking through, you know, the implementation and we’re, we’re helping along the way. It’s, it’s an awesome program because fundamentally what it does is it makes investing universal. You know, all of these families in the United States that think that investing is not for them or they never had any exposure to it. And that’s, by the way, most of America right now, to the extent they have a a, you know, have a kid, they’re going to have an investment account that that’s, you know, there is a, there is a thousand dollars to, to kick kickstart it from the government. But there’s gonna be lots of avenues for families to make continued contributions for employers to make contributions for philanthropies to make contributions over time on, on hopefully a tax advantaged basis. And folks are gonna see the way compounding really works. 00:37:17 So it’s not the $1,000 contribution, which as you said is kind of a drop in the bucket, at least as a, you know, as a, as a burden on, on society. It’s the, it’s, you know, what can you pull together from all of the different constituents that are gonna wanna contribute to a program like this. So we’re, we’re really excited. And you know, I think that ultimately, I hope this will dovetail with retirement security. You know, you, you said it when, when you asked what can happen in 50 or 75 years, I think initially, you know, the thought is these might help fund college education. And by the way, with a little bit of contributions on an ongoing basis, it will fund a college education with, with the compounding. But over time there’s six or seven of these programs and eventually, you know, maybe we can pull them all together and create a, a national program that actually funds people’s retirement 00:38:06 [Speaker Changed] Coming up. We continue our conversation with Zach Buckwald, he’s chairman and chief executive officer of Russell Investments discussing the state of markets today. I’m Barry Riol, you’re listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. 00:38:35 I am Barry Ritholtz. You are listening to Masters in Business on Bloomberg Radio. My extra special guest this week is Zach Buckwald, he’s chairman and chief executive officer of Russell Investments. The firm was founded in 1936 and runs about $370 billion. Zach joined Russell in 2023 coming from his previous career at BlackRock. I, I’m a fan of using milestones as an excuse to give some sort of a gift. You can see sweet sixteens or kid turns 13 or whatever it is. Yep. Grandma and grandpa write a check and put it right into their account. Here’s some Eli Lilly or here’s some whatever s and p 500. Knock yourself out. And that’s gonna just appreciate over the next, you know, x number of decades. It, it could really make a substantial difference in, in the retirement of environment people who have yet to even be born. 00:39:33 [Speaker Changed] It’s absolutely true. And, and by the way, it’s investing in, in the US stock market, right? And 00:39:38 [Speaker Changed] Yes, so I’m assuming the s and p 500 would count and any of the Microsoft or Lilly or whatever, apple, Amazon, whatever big tech company you’re enthusiastic about, I would recommend a broader, more diversified approach than a single stock. Right? I mentioned Lily ’cause I just know a friend just put a bunch of Lily stock in his nephew’s account and I’m like, oh, what are you doing that for? He is like just doing a transfer. It’s tax free and I don’t have to worry about it. 00:40:06 [Speaker Changed] Well, I’m, I’m not a stock picker, but, but Lilly’s a great company. Having diversified exposure in these, in these accounts is, is, is is the way to go. And, you know, listen, a, a generation ago Barry, the version of that was not so much Lilly stock, it was very typically a, a US treasury bond. Right? That’s what you got when you turned 13 or 16 or had that milestone birthday and a treasury bond in the long term. You know, you, you, you’d rather be in the stock market, you get, 00:40:32 [Speaker Changed] You don’t want two, two and a half percent ahead of a above inflation That doesn’t excite you. 00:40:37 [Speaker Changed] I’d rather, I’d rather have the long-term return of the, the s and p for sure. 00:40:41 [Speaker Changed] Especially if it’s a newborn or even a teenager. Their investment window is 60, 70 years. 00:40:48 [Speaker Changed] That’s, that’s exactly right. And and the trick here is you have to get people to actually understand because that 16-year-old, when they’re 22, they’re gonna get a job that’s gonna have a 401k and they have to understand why am I taking 6% out of my, you know, out of my paycheck when, you know, my starting salary might not even be enough to get, you know, to pay my rent and my other bills. Why would I wanna do that? And and they really, if they understand the power of compounding and the long-term implications of that, they’re gonna, they’re gonna buy into it. 00:41:17 [Speaker Changed] I I really didn’t think about my 401k until I was in my thirties. Right. But if I actually had money put in account when I was born, by the time you’re 25, you’re gonna see some impact from compounding. 00:41:31 [Speaker Changed] A hundred percent. Well, I, I’m not too worried about you Barry. 00:41:34 [Speaker Changed] I, I’ll, I’ll be all right. You’ll 00:41:35 [Speaker Changed] Be, you’ll be all right. But you know, but think about all those folks that don’t, you know, the average income in America is still $70,000. Right. All those folks that don’t have access to, to in investments and they’re not thinking about am I gonna be able to make my contribution at age 22? Right. ’cause they’re thinking about can I, can I pay my rent, afford to pay my rent? Right. 00:41:54 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. The bottom half of the economic strata in this country, and we’re having this conversation on election day right. In New York where it looks like at least the leader up until up until today has been someone who describes themselves as a socialist and has made affordability their, their key campaign theme. This is gonna be an ongoing issue, especially for the bottom half of, of earners and savers. 00:42:19 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. We’re, we’re not a political organization at Russell, but I do concur affordability is the issue. And I think it’s not a left issue. I think it’s an issue for, for everybody, almost everybody in this country. And we’re gonna be hearing a lot about it from, from all sides. You know, I wrote a piece after, after the, the, the baby accounts, which they call the Trump accounts, by the way, after that became part of the legislation, I wrote a piece that the Washington Post published that essentially described what these accounts are and the impact that it can have in terms of helping to educate our population about the power of investing and compounding. And it was very interesting to see the commentary, you know, when you publish something in the journal or the post, sure. You get a lot of, you get a lot of comments and by and large, the, the, the vast majority of the comments said, why wouldn’t you just write us a refund check? Which is what we got during COVID, by the way. Right? Like stimulus type checks. Right. And it was the opposite of the point that I was trying to make. 00:43:15 [Speaker Changed] Right? Right. We don’t want you to spend this. Correct. We want you to save this. That’s 00:43:17 [Speaker Changed] The want you to save it and to understand what the difference is from a savings account or a treasury bond and versus investing it into the markets and getting to see long-term, long-term compounding. So it, it, it was honestly, it was a little bit of a, a refresher for me that we have a lot of work to do to help people understand why a program like this can actually help them. 00:43:35 [Speaker Changed] So as someone who’s been writing in public for nearly 30 years, my best advice to you is, is simply never read the comments. There, there was a golden era of blogs in like the early to mid two thousands where the comments were these like fantastic communities. All of that is kind of migrated to Reddit. If you wanna see lightly moderated intelligent debates with some nonsense thrown in along the way, that’s, that’s what’s left of that sort of issue. I, I think even YouTube used to do a better job at moderating the comments, the, the spam and the bots still slip in every now and then. It 00:44:17 [Speaker Changed] Does give you a perspective on what’s on people’s minds though, even though some of the comments are like unhinged, right? You can tell like the what’s coming through, what, what are people’s, you know, fears and worries and concerns. If you can, if you can read it through the, you know, the craziness Yeah. 00:44:31 [Speaker Changed] You have to, you have to fight your way through it. It’s kind of fascinating because I’m gonna just digress for a moment. We all are subject to these cognitive errors and these behavioral biases and, and it very much shows up in, in people’s portfolios and the decisions they, they make. I, I wake up on a day like today where Nasdaq is down 1.5%, I know I’m gonna see a bunch of emails, ah, you told us to stay long and look, we’re down one point a half percent today. I know I should have gotten out of the market. What are you talking about? We’re up 17% for the year and the NASDAQ’s up 23%. This is the price of admission. That’s right. Have to deal with some volatility. 00:45:15 [Speaker Changed] I mean, this is a place, by the way, where technology has not actually served people in their retirement portfolios. Because if you can pull up your phone and in three seconds, you know, you, you work as a teacher or a nurse or, or whatever, and you pull up your phone and in three seconds you see your portfolio is down 1.5% and, and at some level it flips a switch and you think my portfolio is, is, is is in trouble or I should sell. Like, that’s how you get to really bad decisions because we all, you know, we all know long term, like if you’re man, if you’re, do 00:45:42 [Speaker Changed] We all know that? ’cause I’m not sure everybody does. And that’s right, there’s such an inherent bias towards action. Don’t just sit there, do something, right? That, that just seems to be human nature. 00:45:55 [Speaker Changed] It’s anathema to how you’re supposed to manage a retirement portfolio though. You, you, you by the way, you can make adjustments over, over time, but the goal is not to pull out when you think the market is gonna be down. We all know that the bounce backs, by the way, happen faster and stronger than ever. I mean, you’ve, you, you think about like what the bounce back looked like during the financial crisis or during the.com bus, it took years to bounce back. And then you think about COVID or, or 00:46:19 [Speaker Changed] Even April Liberation 00:46:21 [Speaker Changed] Day, right? The bounce back happens. It’s a weak Yeah. Almost instantly and stronger than before. So, you know, this is a case where the phone really does not help you, right? If you’re gonna make a decision to pull out, because you see something going on in the markets on, on an off, on an off day. And, you know, as we’re, as we’re thinking through how to implement new programs like the, the Trump accounts, you know, my goal is you wanna have like lots of transparency, but you don’t wanna make it easy for people to make bad decisions. You have to help them make good long-term decisions. 00:46:47 [Speaker Changed] A a a little bit of choice architecture that prevents those sort of things. Last question before I get to the standard questions. We ask all of our guests, what do you think investors are not talking about, but perhaps should be? What, what are the important overlooked topics, assets, geography, policy, whatever, that, that should be getting a little more following? Yeah. 00:47:08 [Speaker Changed] Well, Barry, I’m still really positive on, on AI and how much more room to run we have, you know, there’s been so much to talk about, about how we haven’t seen a broadening in the markets. You know, most of the value capture has happened within the, the technology industry. But, you know, but I think every sector is gonna be transformed. Almost every sector transformed by AI as much as it was by, by the internet. And we just haven’t seen that come through yet. But I can tell you every company that we invest in is thinking about this and working on it behind the scenes, even if it’s not showing up yet in their, in their quarterly earnings reports. But it’s all happening and you’re gonna start seeing, by the way, you’ll see winners and losers, both, you know, sort of specific companies and sectors, but there’s gonna be enormous amounts of efficiency gains and enormous amounts of, you know, sort of value creation that happens as a result of that. Now, I don’t think it’s gonna be a straight line, but I do think it’s coming shorter term rather than, rather than just longer term. 00:48:04 [Speaker Changed] Back in 2019, I interviewed Joe Davis, who’s the chief economist at Vanguard. Yep. And they had this fascinating research report. Eventually it became a book that all technological innovations take place in two phases. The first phase is kind of what we’re experiencing right now in ai, which is wild prices. Couple of hand, everybody knows a handful of companies, very boom, boom. Like some people have been too many, a lot of people have been calling it a bubble. The second phase is where the value creation spreads out. That’s right. To the rest of, rest of, rest of the market, rest of the industry, rest of the economy. I see it the same way you do. Right? This is just gonna make all of us more efficient, more productive, more profitable. 00:48:50 [Speaker Changed] Right. That’s exactly how I see this playing out. And you still have to pay attention because, you know, we all remember during the, the first, the first.com phase before every company started incorporating, you know, the internet into its business strategy and, and its operations. There were winners and they were losers and, and the winners are still around and they’re, you know, they essentially, you know, run global commerce today and, and the losers went away. We’re gonna see some of that across sectors and you know, that’s something that investors need to pay close attention to. But, you know, writ large, I see a lot of value creation, huh? 00:49:20 [Speaker Changed] I I, I’m, I’m always like to hear that sort of stuff. So let’s jump into our favorite questions that we ask all of our guests, starting with, tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 00:49:32 [Speaker Changed] Sure. I had a great mentor at BlackRock, a guy called Mark McComb, who’s a, a vice chairman of the company. And he put me into a, a couple of jobs and he nurtured me and supported me, but he also, he encouraged me to, you know, think like the outsider that I am, you know, when he put me into the insurance job without having an insurance background, he sort of said, bring, you know, bring all the capabilities and the perspective that you have from all the other things that you’ve done, and that, you know, really helped us, you know, think like an external provider and, and, and grow that business. By the way, I’m a, I’m, I’m a, a gay guy in finance, so I, I, I come at it from a, from an outsider’s point of view, kinda looking in and, and that has informed just about everything that I do at, you know, at Russell. And, and, and before that is thinking about what’s working, what isn’t working, what do I think we might be able to do better, what have we not, you know, the question that you asked, what are people not talking about? What have we not asked about? And that’s, you know, often my, my starting point. And I think if I had come in with the insider status, it would’ve been harder for me to take that perspective. 00:50:36 [Speaker Changed] Huh. That’s really interesting. It, it’s affected your perspective. You, you see the world both as a participant but also an outsider. Yeah, 00:50:45 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. And, you know, this is the first time I’ve been to Bloomberg in a, in a couple of years, but when I, when I took the job at, at Russell, even before I’d started Bloomberg invited me to come speak at a conference, and I was, you know, flattered and, and excited. And then I learned it was their diversity conference, and I, I was the, the KCEO and, and I said, invite me back five times to talk about investing in retirement. And on the sixth time, I’ll come talk about diversity. 00:51:08 [Speaker Changed] Huh. That’s interesting. You know, in all the research we we do that did not come up in anything. It’s not, it’s not anything that bubbles up to the top of search. Although the old joke is, if you, if you wanna hide something, disclose it at the end of an hour long podcast, no one will hear it. But you know what it’s like with all the YouTube, there’s a, there’s a drop off, but I always find that, that amusing. Let’s talk about books. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? Yeah, 00:51:37 [Speaker Changed] So I read a lot of fiction, like, you know, Cormack McCarthy and Tyler. I’m reading a book called The Inheritance right now, which is like a family drama. It’s a escapist for me to get away from. I don’t read a lot of finance books. 00:51:50 [Speaker Changed] I’m the same way every now and then, something will, you know, come across that I have to read that’s finance related. I have a big stack of fiction waiting to go on vacation with me next month. Let’s talk about streaming. What are you watching or listening to you? What’s keeping you entertained? It’s either on Netflix or Amazon or whatever. Yeah, 00:52:09 [Speaker Changed] It’s all toddler fair right now. I’ve got two, three year olds in the house. So we’ve got twins. Twins, yeah. It’s, you know, all full-time. Moana and Frozen and Right. Daniel Tiger Bubble Guppies, that sort of stuff. 00:52:21 [Speaker Changed] Huh. So, so a lot of Moana. That’s, that’s my idea of a nightmare. Just 00:52:27 [Speaker Changed] Moana’s pretty awesome actually 00:52:28 [Speaker Changed] The first three times you see it, the 00:52:30 [Speaker Changed] First three times and frozen about twice 00:52:33 [Speaker Changed] Our So our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interest in a career in either finance or investing? What would you tell them? 00:52:45 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. First, like, you know, be yourself. Like, we look for people at Russell from all different kinds of backgrounds, not just economics or finance backgrounds. Study what you wanna study, do well, and, you know, be committed. But, you know, if you come at it from an outsider’s, you know, station or point of view, em, embrace that. That’s, you know, this is a, a world where we, we want folks that have different kinds of backgrounds and, and approaches. You know, I studied English Barry, and one advantage that that actually gave me early on in my career was that I knew how to write. And, you know, you think about how much of our, of our business is done through writing, through email and, and, and other ways. Everything you write, this is the advice now. Everything you write is a reflection of you. And it can come up in, you know, something you put down on paper can come up again and again in all sorts of different ways. We all know that when, when you put something on the internet, it lives forever, truly. And you know, your careers are long. You wanna make sure that you’re, you’re, that you’re properly reflecting the image that you want to create. Hmm. 00:53:43 [Speaker Changed] Good advice. And our final question, by the way, that advice applies not only to writing. Yes. But my wife is a recently retired teacher, and she used to always warn the kids all the stuff you’re putting on Facebook and Instagram and TikTok, be aware the colleges you’re applying to are looking at that and the jobs you’re gonna apply to, they’re gonna find that. That’s right. Especially as you work your way up the, up the corporate ladder, that stuff never goes away. 00:54:12 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. And now I’ll give you a counterpoint. You know, we, we do 360 reviews at, at Russell, and sometimes, you know, people that are relatively new in their careers, 25 or 28-year-old will write a review on somebody that they work for, or a couple levels up that I, that I read. And when I read a review that somebody has put a lot of thought into, and there’s some, you know, praise and constructive criticism, how to make things better, I say to myself, this person would make a good manager. And I, and I think about how can we use them in other places in the company. So it’s not just about like, when you’re writing about avoiding the things that you don’t want out there in the world that can harm you. It’s also making sure that you’re putting the time and the effort into writing things that are really gonna help you. 00:54:51 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. Really, really interesting observation and, and, and good advice for people just entering the workforce. Final question. What do you know about the world of investing today that would’ve been useful 30 years ago when you were first getting started? 00:55:07 [Speaker Changed] I wish that 30 years ago I had the confidence to know that, you know, that as an outsider, as a gay person, as an English major, someone coming at it from a different background that, that I could make it in, in, in this business that I didn’t have to constantly think about how am I gonna prove myself, but just by being a good productive contributor by raising my hand, you know, and, and, and, and showing a little bit of ambition by finding ways to help that, that can be enough. And sometimes that being an outsider can actually be a good thing. You know, that it can help you re-underwrite situations and come at it from a different angle. And if you know that and you’re confident in it and you use it to your advantage, it can really help you in your career. I figured that out along the way. It would’ve been helpful to know when I first started. Huh. 00:55:56 [Speaker Changed] Really, really fascinating stuff. Thank you, Zach, for being so generous with your time.

Title: BlackRock files S-1 to launch Bitcoin income-focused ETF

Time Published: 2026-01-26T15:29:47Z

The latest filing comes as BlackRock's IBIT fund maintains its lead in the crypto ETP market. Powered by Gloria BlackRock, through its iShares entity, has filed a registration statement with the SEC seeking approval to launch the iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF, a new fund that would provide exposure to Bitcoin while generating recurring income through a covered call options strategy. The ETF will be structured as a Delaware statutory trust and will hold bitcoin, shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), and cash, including premiums generated from options activity, according to the filing. The fund’s objective is to provide exposure to Bitcoin price movements while delivering enhanced monthly income. This will be achieved through an actively managed covered call strategy that primarily involves writing call options on IBIT shares and, periodically, on indices linked to spot Bitcoin ETPs. Coinbase Custody Trust Company will serve as the Bitcoin custodian, with Anchorage Digital Bank as an available alternative custodian. Bank of New York Mellon will handle cash and securities custody as well as trust administration. BlackRock’s latest filing arrives as its IBIT fund continues to dominate the crypto ETP space. The fund, despite recent market fluctuations, now holds nearly $70 billion in assets under management. The latest filing comes as BlackRock's IBIT fund maintains its lead in the crypto ETP market.

Title: BlackRock doubles down on bitcoin fund offerings with income-focused filing
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/26/blackrock-doubles-down-on-bitcoin-fund-offerings-with-income-focused-filing
Time Published: 2026-01-26T15:13:18Z

BlackRock (BLK) is moving deeper into the cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) market with a plan to offer income from bitcoin BTC$88,326.08 exposure. The world's largest asset manager, with an estimated $12.5 trillion in assets under management, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a Form S-1 to list the iShares Bitcoin Premium Income ETF. The proposed fund would actively manage exposure to bitcoin, either directly or through shares of BlackRock’s existing iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), while generating income by selling call options on that exposure. This “covered-call” approach is already common in stock-based income funds, and some fund managers have already applied it to the crypto market. Through a covered-call strategy, the fund would generate income by selling a counterparty the right to purchase its underlying at a fixed price. The fund, which doesn’t yet have a ticker or fee defined, would actively manage this covered-call strategy and would distribute the generated premiums to investors as income. The tradeoff here is it effectively trades potential upside for income. Funds with similar strategies to generate income from options include the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF (YBTC), Amplify Bitcoin Max Income Covered Call ETF (BAGY), and the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF (BTCI). Still, BlackRock’s entry stands out for its scale and ties to IBIT, already the dominant spot bitcoin ETF with over $69.7 billion in assets according to SoSoValue data. IBIT and other bitcoin funds offered by BlackRock have been so successful they have become the firm’s top revenue source. Some covered-call ETFs tend to dilute net asset value (NAV) as they offer higher yields to investors, partly through the return of capital. YBTC, for example, currently shows it has a 35.87% distribution rate, while BTCI shows its distribution rate is at 27.25%. BAGY’s distribution rate is at 37.1%. Excluding distributions, which are often in the double-digits given the underlying asset’s volatility, bitcoin-focused income ETFs have so far underperformed BTC, something they’re often designed to do given the higher yields offered. Over the last 12-month period, BTCI is down by around 31.3%, while YBTC lost 45% of its value, compared to the cryptocurrency’s 14% drawdown. BAGY, which launched in late April 2025, is down 25% since its debut.

Title: Robinson calls for law to block fossil fuel investments flowing through Irish-based firms
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2026/01/26/robinson-calls-for-law-to-block-fossil-fuel-investments-flowing-through-irish-based-firms/
Time Published: 2026-01-26T14:57:48Z
Full Content:
Former president Mary Robinson has said the Government should consider enacting law preventing fossil fuel investments flowing through financial firms based in the country. Mrs Robinson told Irish funds industry representatives that money must shift from fossil fuels to clean energy. “Literally it’s all about the money,” she said of the climate crisis. “Some of you will know more than others about how we could begin to shift the money. That’s the action that would give the whole world hope.” If the industry didn’t do it, governments should consider regulating for it, she said. “Countries should think about needing a law for disinvestment. The trouble is, it’s the Government itself that is so supportive [of the financial industry]. Will there be the political will to bring in legislation? “It should be legislation that moves us towards a just transition. I don’t think we can suddenly divest in an abrupt way,” Mrs Robinson said. “That wouldn’t be appropriate because we have to remember there are workers in the various sectors.” The Fossil Fuel Divestment Act 2018 took public money out of fossil fuels by prohibiting the State-owned Irish Strategic Investment Fund from buying shares in them. However, it does not apply to private companies that invest in fossil fuels or act on behalf of investors. Mrs Robinson said clear national roadmaps to end fossil use could prove even better than legislation. They needed to include an end to fossil fuel subsidies such as the tax breaks on fuel enjoyed by airlines that meant air travel was cheaper than trains. She hoped the inaugural International Conference on the Just Transition away from Fossil Fuels to be hosted by Colombia and the Netherlands in April would lead to roadmaps. Mrs Robinson was speaking at an event hosted by Green Teams Network (GTN), a group of staff from companies in the Irish Funds Industry Association who work together on reducing their personal and workplace emissions. A number of those companies facilitate investments in oil and gas exploration. Analysis by Trócaire and ActionAid Ireland last year found Dublin-based operations of international financial firms had €30 billion in oil, gas and other fossil fuel investments. Suzanne Senior, cofounder of GTN, is also a funds director with BlackRock, a firm with large fossil fuel investments. She said there was a strong appetite among employees for GTN activities even if their companies were still involved in fossil fuel investments. “Like Mrs Robinson said, it’s a transition and it’s not something we can turn off overnight,” she said, speaking as a GTN representative and not on behalf of BlackRock. “We all know that there needs to be a journey away from fossil fuels but that is something that has to be a transition.” From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Greenland, Donald Trump, Technocracy and the Globalist New World Order By David Skripac, January 26, 2026 As a pilot who frequently travelled to Greenland while serving in the Canadian Armed Forces, I can say with assurance that Greenland is already fully integrated into the American Empire’s network of strategic possessions—and has been since the early 1950s. The World Economic Forum on a Course of Self-Destruction By Peter Koenig, January 25, 2026 Word has it that the 2026 World Economic Forum (WEF) Davos event went down as the worst ever in WEF’s history. Maybe it has to do with Trump’s showing up and everybody, including the Swiss Government, falling on their knees to please the emperor without clothes; and / or because Larry Fink, the BlackRock Chair, now literally owns the WEF and calls the shot on everything. Everyone below him, even the co-chairs, are YES-people. Europe Towards an Uncertain Future By Stephen Sefton, January 26, 2026 From 1950 until the end of the Cold War in 1990 about 300,000 US troops occupied bases throughout Western Europe. Today, there are only 80,000 US military personnel left in Europe, but the financial and commercial dependence and interrelationship are still very much in force. The Legacy of Martin Luther King Lives: Of Utmost Relevance Today By Abayomi Azikiwe, January 26, 2026 Every January on the third Monday of the month is designated as MLK Day where federal office buildings and other public entities are closed in recognition of the contributions of Dr. King as a historical figure integral to the struggle for Civil Rights and peace in the United States. Davos Proclaims End of Western Order: Carney Speech Shows Europe and Canada Are “Third World” Now By Uriel Araujo, January 26, 2026 Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered what may well go down as one of the most revealing speeches ever given at the World Economic Forum in Davos. In unusually straightforward terms, Carney conceded that the so-called “rules-based international order” has not merely weakened but has effectively collapsed, insisting that we are “in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.” “Public Relations War”: Pathological Lying Will Cost Donald Trump the Mid-Term Elections By Helena Glass, January 26, 2026 Pathological liars exaggerate events, fabricate stories, or present completely false incidents as true. In the case of the two ICE executions, the lying has been elevated to pathological. When media influencers join the fray of lying they are essentially ‘inciting’ mass anger. When the truth sets you free – lying imprisons you. The Global Billionaire Steal: Wealth, Authoritarianism and Media By Dr. Binoy Kampmark, January 26, 2026 It’s official. This tormented, heated, traumatised planet is now home to over 3,000 billionaires. (That number was reached last year.) In October 2025, Elon Musk became the first man to have wealth exceeding half a trillion dollars. These developments could still take alongside the fact that one in four people across the globe face hunger.

Title: Sinclair Locks In Its Q4 2025 Earnings Reveal Date

The company that is shepherding the broadcast television industry toward ATSC 3.0 digital broadcasting services, which owns a group of over-the-air stations that very much seeks to merge with The E.W. Scripps Co. despite that company’s insistence the unwanted overtures end, has announced when it will report its Q4 2025 earnings results. Sinclair Inc. C-Suite executives including Chief Executive Officer Chris Ripley will be discussing the company’s fourth quarter fiscal health report in an conference call scheduled for 4:30pm Eastern on February 25. Analysts, shareholders and other interested parties will have no more than 30 minutes prior to the call to glance over the results, as Sinclair intends to release them following the Closing Bell on the Nasdaq markets for that day’s trading session. The results reflecting the final three months of 2025 come at a period of relative stability for “SBGI,” the company’s Nasdaq GlobalSelect market-traded stock. Sinclair shares finished January 23’s trading session at $15.05, and that’s all but flat from one year ago. While that’s better than a steep year-over-year decline, the lack of meaningful growth could be concerning for long-term shareholders, as “SBGI” is off from a five-year high of $38.41 attributed to an early March 2021 surge in valuation. Over the next 12 months, “SBGI’ remained between $28 and $38, in March 2022 began a two-year dip. The good news? Sinclair’s stock has avoided dipping to below $10, a price nearly reached in October 2023. What are analysts forecasting for Sinclair in Q4 2025? Just one analyst reporting to Yahoo! Finance chimed in with earnings per share estimates, putting Sinclair at -$0.06 on very difficult comps tied to strong political revenue at the end of 2024.

Will this Arctic island, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, continue to run its own affairs domestically and remain constitutionally linked to its parent country—or will it be appropriated by the American Empire? To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Español, Русский, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. As an increasing number of strapped families throughout the world struggle to put food on the table and pay for ever-rising living expenses, the internet crowd seems more concerned with US President Donald Trump’s talk of seizing Greenland than with what’s happening to average peoples’ ability to survive. Greenland? Where’s Greenland? For those whose knowledge of geography is slim: Greenland is an island located between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans—northeast of Canada and northwest of Iceland. At 822,700 square miles, Greenland is by far the earth’s largest island. By contrast, the second-largest, New Guinea, is only 303,381 square miles. . . These days, in light of Trump’s tantalizing statements, both the mainstream media and the alternative media are posing some interesting, though irrelevant, questions about Greenland, such as: Why do I call these questions irrelevant? As a pilot who frequently travelled to Greenland while serving in the Canadian Armed Forces, I can say with assurance that Greenland is already fully integrated into the American Empire’s network of strategic possessions—and has been since the early 1950s. Besides being part of NATO, Greenland has played a crucial role in securing the northern flank of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). This role was established when Denmark and the United States signed the 1951 Greenland Defense Agreement, a bilateral treaty that made Greenland host to some of America’s most important and sophisticated surveillance technologies and military bases. Take, for example, Pituffik Space Base, formerly named Thule Air Base. It is a US Space Force base located on the northwest coast of Greenland. Although the number of service members stationed at Pituffik has been greatly reduced since the end of the Cold War, there are approximately 150 troops still stationed permanently at the base. When needed, this number can be greatly increased on short notice by simply flying in thousands of US military personnel and equipment on C-17 Globemaster and C-5 Galaxy aircraft. Pituffik has a 9,995-foot runway that can easily accommodate all US fighter jets and transport aircraft. . 74th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-89s, Thule Air Base, Greenland, 1955 (United States Air Force / Public Domain) . Moreover, Pituffik is home to the 12th Space Warning Squadron, which operates phased array radar sites at known and secret locations throughout Greenland. This computer-controlled type of radar can detect and track Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) and satellites. The same base also hosts Detachment 1 of the 23rd Space Operations Squadron, which is part of Space Delta’s global satellite control network. Space Delta, the primary operational unit within the US Space Force, manages specific critical global satellite missions, from military communications to missile tracking. In addition, the US military maintains numerous Over-the-Horizon radar systems at radar sites such as Pituffik and other, classified locations in Greenland. OTH radar can listen to, monitor, and track military activity thousands of kilometres away, including in Russia, on the east side of the North Pole—Greenland is on the North Pole’s west side—and beyond. Therefore, if the US government were to acquire Greenland, either through military action or diplomacy, little would change. Annexing Greenland would be a mere formality, acknowledging something that has already been a reality for more than seventy years. Greenland has always been integral to the American Empire’s global control grid.Washington insiders have long understood that Greenland’s geographic location is strategically indispensable if the US is to keep a close eye on the Arctic Northwest Passage—the sea route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through the Arctic Ocean—as well as a close eye on that region’s vast mineral, oil, and natural gas deposits. Thus, claiming that an invasion of Greenland by the US would mark the end of NATO is a moot point on at least two counts: If Greenland is already solidly in America’s sphere of influence, why is Trump talking about adding this island to “his” Empire’s acquisitions? Aside from rich and largely untapped natural resources—huge, unproven, and unexploited oil deposits (potentially 7.3 billion barrels), natural gas reserves (estimated to be anywhere from 50 trillion to 150 trillion cubic feet), and extensive mineral deposits—there is, I believe, one other main reason for this sudden attention being paid to Greenland. My hunch is that Trump is being leaned on to annex Greenland by certain highly influential individuals who contributed handsomely to his second presidential election campaign. These men—namely, Elon Musk ($292 million), Howard Lutnick ($9 million), Peter Thiel ($1.25 million), and Sam Altman ($1 million)—are now in a position to steer the President in whatever direction they desire for the purpose of fulfilling their primary goal. They are chomping at the bit to form what is known as the North American Technate, the linchpin to a full-blown and ultimately worldwide Technocracy. Musk, Lutnick, Thiel, Altman, and a number of their equally obsessive technocratic colleagues have ensconced themselves in positions of power in Trump’s current administration. They are the modern-day technocrats carrying out the dream of Howard Scott, an engineer who, with Thorstein Veblen, co-founded in 1919 the Technical Alliance, based in New York City. For those readers new to the term “Technocracy” and its history, a brief explanation is in order. The Technical Alliance was reorganized in 1932 and was moved to Columbia University, also in New York, under the name “Committee on Technocracy.” In 1933, Scott joined forces with economist M. King Hubbert—whom he had met two years earlier—to found Technocracy, Inc. Scott was the Technocracy movement’s driving force—its engineer, ideologue, innovator, intellectual—while Hubbert, a geologist, played a major supporting role as the organization’s secretary, researcher, and writer. In 1937, these two technocrats and some other lesser-known figures came up with a concise definition that explains the technocratic philosophy: Technocracy is the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism to produce and distribute goods and services to the entire population of this continent. For the first time in human history it will be done as a scientific, technical engineering problem. Though Technocracy, Inc. disappeared (went underground?) for half-a-century, it has resurfaced in recent years. Today’s Technocracy movement is run by an equally radical group of scientists and engineers who, thanks to advancements in technology, finally have the ability to catalogue, surveil, track, trace, monitor, subjugate, and manipulate—or, to put it in one word, control—an entire population and thereby achieve specific scientific, social, geopolitical, and economic ends. Representative government, national sovereignty, the nation-state structure, politicians, capitalism, and even currencies are regarded as nonessential in a technocratic dictatorship. The 1930s vision of Technocracy’s behavioural control system is fast becoming a reality. What we are witnessing with regard to the recent events in Venezuela and the recent discussions about Greenland is a step or two closer to the completion of the North American Technate as it was envisioned and presented in 1940 by Technocracy, Inc. . The 1940 Map of the “Technate of America” . The 1940 “Technate of America” map (see above) represents one of the primary pillars that support the canopy of the multi-pillar New World Order. I picture five pillars holding up a square canopy. In the center I envision the strongest and highest pillar. From its peak and to its peak—in both directions—flow all closely coordinated events, activities, and processes that the world’s powerful institutions and individuals plan together and carry out simultaneously. This pillar is in the middle (the center) because it is unique and of primary (central) importance to the whole structure. In the four corners I visualize four pillars of equal proportions. If the center pillar has primacy—which it does, and if it is preeminent—which it is, then these four pillars are of secondary stature and scope. Each of these smaller pillars props up its respective corner of the square canopy. What do all five pillars reflected in my mind’s eye represent in the real world? The central, or center, pillar, represents the 1940 Technate map. It is the highest and the strongest pillar because it is where the largest and militarily strongest empire in history, the American Empire, resides. It is here where Technocracy had its roots. And it is here where many US-based globalist think tanks—the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Club of Rome, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Open Society Foundation, to name a few—were founded and continue to function. The central pillar is also home to the United Nations(UN) and to the agencies that operate under its umbrella: the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank Group, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. [Note: Although the WHO is based in Geneva, Switzerland, it nonetheless answers to the UN, which is headquartered on Rockefeller-donated land in New York City. The same holds true for the World Economic Forum (WEF), based in Geneva but connected to the central pillar by way of its adherence to the philosophy and principles of Technocracy.] It is through the UN and its offshoot organizations that the five key objectives of the one-world technocratic convergence are being advanced. These five key objectives are: (1) digital biometric IDs, (2) thought-crime laws, (3) social credit systems, (4) carbon credits, and (5) Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). When all five objectives have eventually been met, it is safe to say that the walls of a digital gulag will have been erected around each pillar—not only the central pillar of the American Empire but also the four other pillars, which we shall identify momentarily. But first, we should mention that the strongest component within—the dominant powergoverning—the American Empire is the US Department of War (DOW). Housed in the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, the DOW encompasses six branches of the armed services. Combined, these branches arguably have the most advanced technology, the heftiest financial resources, the widest global reach, the best logistical capabilities, and the highest degree of operational readiness on the planet. The US military’s role is not so much to defend the country as it is to maintain and protect the interests of the Wall Street money center banks. The Pentagon is also devoted to extending, beyond the US, the biosecurity medical industrial complex. For instance, it can at any point create another Operation Warp Speed with its fraudulent “vaccines.” Second, we should also mention that the State of Israel has long been the leading recipient of US foreign aid, much of it in the form of military assistance. For this reason, we can accurately claim that Israel’s government and its intelligence and military assets are intimately connected with the central pillar, the American Empire.And we can safety predict that Israel will continue to obligingly serve the US by keeping a watchful eye on the rest of the Middle East, including the region’s vast oil and gas reserves. In one of the four corners of the square we have the second pillar: the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth of Nations. Atop the UK pillar is Chatham House, which formulates the UK policy agenda. The agenda is then distributed to the UK government’s various arms, which in turn promote the policies to all UK citizens. The United Kingdom is an especially crucial pillar because after it pushes, tests, and implements the five objectives of its technocratic agenda in the UK, it does the same thing in its 56 Commonwealth nations, which span Africa, Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania. Although the UK has thus far met only one of the five objectives—thought-crime laws—the government is desperately seeking ways to execute the other four plans so it can meet all five targets. In another corner we have the pillar of the Brussels-based European Parliament. This pillar is the focal point for disseminating the technocratic plan throughout all of Europe. The European Parliament is a directly elected legislative arm of the European Union (EU), based on the Soviet system of government and without the encumbrance of democratic oversight. Thus, it effectively forms the perfect structure to extend the digital gulag’s five objectives to each member country in the EU. Holding up the New World Order canopy in another corner is China and its multi-titled technocratic leader, Xi Jinping. Since 1978, when one of Xi’s predecessors, Deng Xiaoping, became “paramount leader,” Chinese technocrats have been engineering every economic and social initiative, transforming that communist country into the world’s first Technate. Having met all five objectives—that is, having all five elements of Technocracy securely in place—China is now poised to export its technocratic know-how to client states in Africa and in Asia and to some other nations that belong to the informal, intergovernmental BRICS grouping—namely, the nations of Brazil, India, and South Africa. In the fourth and final corner of the five-pillared square we have Vladimir Putin’s Russia. [Note: Russia belongs to BRICS, but it is its own pillar.] On the heels of China, all five of whose control systems are in place, Russia has implemented four of them: digital IDs, thought-crime laws, CBDCs, and carbon credits. Now the Russian Federation is attempting to rapidly deploy the remaining element of its control grid: a social credit system. Observe that all five pillars act in unison to support the all-inclusive canopy of the techno-feudalistic New World Order. If one of the pillars were to separate from the edifice, the entire structure would collapse. Therefore, the notion that we live in a “multi-polar” world order, made up of separate poles, is a fallacy. Rather, it is one world order, with each of its pillars dependent upon the others, and vice versa, with all of its pillars dependent upon each one. Put another way, no nation is an outlier or will last long if it tries to be. The world’s 193 sovereign countries (voting UN members), plus the Vatican City and the State of Palestine (non-UN members, having observer status only), plus possibly Taiwan and Kosovo (some sources list them as sovereign nations; others do not) coalesce under one pillar or another. Each and all of the five pillars are needed to support the canopy of the one-world technocratic state. The bottom line is that regardless of whether or not a nation is recognized by the others, every jurisdiction on the planet is, to one degree or another, at one pace or another, building digital prison walls. However, it’s not quite enough to have pillars covered by a canopy. The entire structure must be anchored to a single, solid foundation. That foundation is a global monetary and financial system. Importantly, the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS) plays a central role in that underlying system. Without the support of the BIS and its sixty-three member central banks and monetary authorities—plus the extraordinary influence of enormous investment firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street—nothing I have described above would be possible. In other words, without the worldwide network of central banks, the entire assembly of New World Order pillars would collapse in a matter of days—and with it, all of its presumed power and its assumed authority. Isn’t it high time we resist the technocrats and abandon their dictatorial “science” of social engineering? After all, we have no need for self-inflated rulers, be they corporate or governmental, to tell us how we should—or shouldn’t—lead our lives. We do have a need to assert our sovereign rights, be they individual or national. (Denmark and Greenland, are you listening?) We do have a need to intelligently focus on finding fair-minded, peace-producing solutions to our problems. And we do have an innate, mutual desire to provide brotherly aid to and receive aid from our neighbours, be they next door or on another continent. When we are truly considerate of our neighbours, near and far, we do not infringe on their autonomy, as the tyrannical Trump is trying to do with Greenland and every other territory he covets. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

These real problems are being ignored by the fake “climate change” crowd, who hide their mercenary motives behind euphemisms like “sustainable development goals” (SDGs) and “environmental, social, and governance” benchmarks (ESGs) and florid phrases such as the “Great Reset” and “Build Back Better.” Featured image source Global Research is a reader-funded media.

The dollar extended its selloff on Monday as speculation swirled that the US could coordinate intervention with Japanese authorities to support the yen. Gold topped $5,000 an ounce. The greenback fell for a third day, losing ground against all major peers to hit the lowest since September. The yen rallied to its highest level in two months. US stock futures fluctuated. Precious metals extended their breakneck rally as gold hit a fresh record and silver surged 6%. The volatility in foreign-exchange markets follows signs that Tokyo and Washington coordinated on rate checks, a step that can be taken to prepare for direct intervention. Joint US-Japan action would give authorities greater power to deter speculators after the yen hit an 18-month low earlier this month. “The bigger signal is policy coordination,” said Daniel Baeza, senior vice president at Frontclear. “If markets interpret coordination as a willingness to tolerate easier global dollar conditions, especially alongside a dovish Fed reaction function, that could reinforce short-term dollar downside.” Treasuries rose across the curve as traders added to bets for 2026 interest-rate cuts after BlackRock Inc. executive Rick Rieder's candidacy to helm the Federal Reserve gained momentum. With an announcement on the next Fed chair possible as soon as this week, rate expectations will be in focus as current Chair Jerome Powell delivers the latest decision on Wednesday. Earnings will also be in the spotlight as the busiest week of the season gets underway, with four of the Magnificent Seven tech giants due to report. The group has driven market gains for much of the past three years, but that leadership faltered in late 2025 as Wall Street grew skeptical of whether massive AI spending will deliver returns. “The main focus from investors will likely be comments around AI-capex,” said Stephan Kemper, chief investment strategist at BNP Paribas Wealth Management. “Any sign of a slowdown could be seen as hyperscalers loosing trust in the possibility to monetize those investments in a timely manner.” In another possible risk for markets, traders are monitoring whether growing opposition to the Department of Homeland Security's handling of Trump's immigration crackdown could prompt a partial government shutdown.

Title: BTC price 'bottoming phase' ends: Five things to know in Bitcoin this week

Bitcoin price analysis forecasts a long-term BTC price bottom in the coming days as geopolitics and macroeconomic mayhem seize markets. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin (BTC) heads into the January close in dangerous territory as macro volatility factors ramp up. Bitcoin closes the week below key support in a move that opens the door to new lows. FOMC week dawns, but markets are focused on Japan, tariffs and geopolitical instability. Precious metals smash historic records while crypto fails to match them. Bitcoin short-term holders show signs of record capitulation at current price levels. “Tactical” Bitcoin selling pressure is ongoing, with liquidity able to absorb the distribution. Bitcoin dropped to $86,000 around Sunday’s weekly close — a target already on the radar for traders. Data from TradingView showed buyers defending that level into the week’s first Asia trading session, with $90,000 still out of reach. “There’s so much volatility ahead of us coming week. Not only on the Bitcoin & Crypto markets, but also in forex, commodities & bond markets,” crypto trader, analyst and entrepreneur Michaël van de Poppe said in a post on X. After closing the week below $86,500, BTC/USD is in a thoroughly bearish position, per Material Indicators cofounder Keith Alan. In his latest analysis, Alan warned of consequences in the event of a weekly close under the 2026 yearly open level near $87,500 and the 100-week simple moving average (SMA) at $87,250. Pay close attention to the weekly close for $BTC! The only thing more bearish than a weekly close below the Yearly Open Timescape Level at $87.5k, would be a weekly close below the 100-Week SMA. pic.twitter.com/WjMitP2Ez6 “Wicks don't count, it's the close that matters,” he added in a separate post showing exchange order-book liquidity data and whale orders. Data from monitoring resource CoinGlass confirmed 24-hour cross-crypto liquidations of nearly $750 million at the time of writing. “Based on Bitcoin losing the mid-range; HTF liquidations to the downside; and the possible US Gov. shutdown, we still think that the most likely scenario is that Bitcoin drops back to low $80s in the coming weeks,” trader CrypNuevo forecast over the weekend. In a bold prediction, meanwhile, trader, analyst and commentator BitQuant went on record to announce an inflection point for BTC price action. “The coming week is significant in that it marks the end of the bottoming phase,” he told X followers. BitQuant retains the view that a long-term high for Bitcoin has not yet been reached, with this due at $145,000. The Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates forms the week’s key macroeconomic event, but traders have multiple volatility sources to contend with. These include worries over the Japanese economy and the Fed’s move to buy yen, along with international trade questions still hanging in the air. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will announce any changes to its benchmark rate, with Chair Jerome Powell delivering guidance in an accompanying speech and press conference. Markets will be watching Powell’s language in particular for signs of policy change. Expectations for the meeting itself have long been that rates will stay the same. At the same time, tensions between him and US President Donald Trump remain, along with a legal investigation into Fed building renovations that Powell dismissed as a pretext for changing his policy trajectory before his imminent replacement. “The Chief Investment Officer of BlackRock is now expected to be the next Fed Chair. And, Trump says cutting rates is a ‘requirement’ for the next Fed Chair and is actively calling for 1% interest rates. 2026 is going to be a wild year,” trading resource The Kobeissi Letter commented on X. Macro data itself has given mixed signals over US inflation. Regardless, stocks continue to enjoy a strong start to 2026, while crypto languishes. “Loose monetary policy and an expanding global money supply are key drivers behind bullish financial conditions. But if those conditions also deliver stronger than expected economic growth, inflation could become more problematic in the year ahead,” trading outfit Mosaic Asset Company wrote in the latest edition of its regular newsletter, The Market Mosaic. Mosaic warned that a rebound in inflation this year would trigger moves seen during the 1970s. This week, meanwhile, will also see the December print of the Producer Price Index (PPI). November’s release came in above expectations. In a predictable milestone, gold and silver crossed historic thresholds to start the week, passing the $5,000 and $100 marks, respectively. XAU/USD reached $5,111 per ounce, with XAG/USD hitting $110 for the first time during Monday’s Asia trading session. The relentless rise in precious metals continues as Bitcoin and altcoins fail to catch a bid, having been stuck in a narrow range for several months. That inverse relationship is now beginning to make waves beyond the crypto trading community. “Where is Bitcoin?” The Kobeissi Letter queried in a dedicated X post on the phenomenon. Kobeissi suggested that the threat of another US government shutdown, which it described as “likely,” was “adding fuel to the fire” across precious metals. Van de Poppe captured the pro-crypto mood around BTC versus gold. “Bitcoin vs. Gold is the cheapest it has ever been. At least, the gap between the two has never been this big in terms of fair value. The 2-Week RSI is the lowest ever. Lower than in 2022, lower than in 2018,” he wrote Sunday. At the same time, Van de Poppe revealed an unprecedented potential bullish divergence on BTC/XAG. “What does this say? This does say that the coming week is going to be extremely volatile and could indicate a bottom on this metric and therefore, Silver is likely to peak and money is likely rotating towards other assets,” he said. BTC price action may be rangebound, but onchain activity shows that newer investors are as sensitive as ever to sudden moves. Uploading data to X from onchain analytics resource Checkonchain, the analytics account named after famous economist Frank Fetter wrote that loss-making trades were making history. “Short-term holders are realizing losses at historic levels on the bitcoin CRASH to $86k,” it said. The data showed the realized profit/loss ratio for Bitcoin’s short-term holder (STH) cohort — the group of wallets holding a given amount of BTC for six months or less. The proportion of transactions from STH wallets in which BTC was moving at a lower price than that at which it last moved was higher than ever. The ratio was lower than during the 2022 bear market bottom, when BTC/USD hit $15,600 after a near 80% drop from its old 2021 all-time highs. Continuing, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant confirmed that the overall BTC supply had crossed a bearish profit threshold of its own. Supply in profit stood at 62% — the lowest level since September 2024, when Bitcoin traded at around $30,000. “When Bitcoin Supply in Profit drops below 70% and fails to recover above 80%, it is historically a sign of a potential further decline and often a confirmation of a bear market,” contributor El Crypto Tavo wrote in an accompanying Quicktake blog post. Discussing the weekend’s drop to $86,000, CryptoQuant appeared unalarmed.

Volume delta reached a relatively modest $59.6 million on Binance during the dip, indicating only slight dominance of sellers over buyers. “Numerically, this represents significant selling pressure; however, its true significance becomes apparent when compared to price action,” Arab Chain explained. Volume delta z-score readings, it added, represented “short-term tactical selling pressure rather than a phase of panic or widespread forced liquidation.” Last week, Cointelegraph reported on split intentions among the professional Bitcoin investor base amid unclear price trends heavily influenced by external factors. “These values reflect genuine but controlled selling pressure, characterized by elevated selling liquidity, limited imbalance, and moderate statistical deviation,” Arab Chain concluded.

Title: Austrian politician demands end to all Ukraine payments
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/631521-austria-halt-ukraine-payments/
Time Published: 2026-01-26T10:11:50Z
Full Content:
A senior Austrian politician has demanded the immediate cessation of all financial aid to Ukraine, denouncing Kiev as a corrupt “bottomless pit.” The call comes after the Foreign Ministry in Vienna announced additional humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Austria has provided nearly €2.9 billion ($3.4 billion) in aid to Kiev since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Last week, Vienna revealed a plan to deliver an additional €3 million in financial aid to several humanitarian organizations working in Ukraine. “Not a single euro should be allowed to flow anymore,” the Austrian Freedom Party’s secretary-general, Michael Schnedlitz, said in a statement on Sunday, calling for an “immediate halt to all payments to Ukraine.” He also demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger, arguing that “anyone who, despite the crisis, takes money from the Austrian people to give it to a corrupt system should resign as a representative of the Austrian people.” The MP’s demands come amid a wave of high-level corruption scandals in Ukraine that have forced the resignation of several senior officials close to Vladimir Zelensky, including his chief of staff. Western-backed anti-corruption agencies also recently charged five Ukrainian MPs with operating a bribery ring, while a separate $100 million kickback scheme in the state energy sector implicated a former Zelensky associate late last year. Despite these issues, Western financial commitments to Ukraine have continued, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently announcing he is working on an $800 billion plan for Ukraine’s post-war economy. Last week, Zelensky went on a tirade during his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, chastizing his European allies for indecisiveness and insufficient support. His comments sparked fierce backlash across the EU, with Western officials labeling him as “unfair,” “ungrateful,” and having “crossed the line.” Meanwhile, Russia has consistently argued that Western aid to Ukraine only prolongs the conflict without altering its ultimate outcome and has cautioned that all EU budget assistance to Kiev will eventually just end up being stolen.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “It’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.” — Mark Twain Number of the Week: Reduced 2.4% ********************* THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW discusses the process of measuring Earth’s Radiation Budget by the CERES project. TWTW discusses some shifts in thinking that were brought out at the World Economic Forum as well as shifts in thinking by the administration on matters such as the Linear No Threshold model and radiation. TWTW briefly discusses the poor market design argument often used by those who want the market to reflect their wishes; as well as major criticism of a paper claiming microplastics are accumulating in human brains. ********************* Measuring Earth’s Radiation Budget (ERB): As AMO physicist Howard Hayden explained in his series “”Basic Climate Physics”, assuming no significant volcanic activity such as that that formed the Siberian Traps, Earth’s Energy Balance is explained by three variables: changes in solar radiation to Earth; changes in Earth’s albedo changing solar radiation absorbed by Earth’s surface; and changes in greenhouse gases concentrations changing outgoing long wave radiation from Earth to Space. Changes in Earth’s albedo (reflectivity) include changes in cloudiness, snow and ice, leaf coverage, dust, etc. Earth’s primary greenhouse gases, water vapor and carbon dioxide, are highly saturated. They already absorb and emit all the outgoing radiation from Earth’s surface in the frequencies (wavelengths) which the specific gases can readily absorb infrared radiation. Thus, a major increase in greenhouse gases is required to cause any meaningful increase in Earth’s temperatures. Since 1997 NASA has used satellites to monitor Earth’s energy balance in a project known as CERES, Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System. Located at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, its website states: “Climate is controlled by the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth and the amount of infrared energy emitted to space. These quantities–together with their difference–define Earth’s radiation budget (ERB). The Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) project provides satellite-based observations of ERB and clouds. It uses measurements from CERES instruments flying on several satellites along with data from many other instruments to produce a comprehensive set of ERB data products for climate, weather, and applied science research. [Boldface added] The goals of the CERES project are to: The CERES team has been collecting ERB data since 1997, when the first CERES instrument was launched aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Since then, CERES instruments have launched aboard the Terra, Aqua, Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP), and NOAA-20 satellites. The CERES instruments provide direct measurements of reflected solar radiation and emission of thermal infrared radiation to space across all wavelengths between the ultraviolet and far-infrared. CERES measurements, together with measurements from higher-resolution imagers on polar orbiting and geostationary satellites, are used along with other input data sources to produce data products that describe the ERB at the top-of-atmosphere, within the atmosphere and at the surface. The CERES data products capture variations in ERB at hourly, daily, and monthly timescales and at spatial scales ranging from 20 km to global. The CERES data are used by the climate, weather, and applied science research communities to address a range of research topics that involve the exchange of energy between the Earth and space and between the major components of the Earth system. CERES is the only project worldwide whose prime objective is to produce global climate data records of ERB from instruments designed to observe the ERB.” The presentations at the CERES Science Team Meetings are posted on the website. From reviewing them it is very clear that clouds are a big problem. Clouds can both cool Earth by blocking sunlight and warm Earth by acting as a greenhouse effect. The formation and dissipation of clouds have not been worked out. As Nobel Laureate John Clauser has asserted the global climate models cannot be relied on for prediction as long as the uncertainty of clouds remains an important issue. At the May 7-9, 2023, CERES Science Team Meeting researcher Norman Loeb gave a presentation titled “Observational Assessment of Changes in Earth’s Energy Imbalance Since 2000.” Loeb split the Absorbed Solar Radiation (ASR) data and the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) data into two groups: 1) from March 2000 to February 2010; and 2) from March 2013 to February 2023. Both the Absorbed Solar Radiation (ASR) of Earth and the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) from Earth increased, and the net effect is a doubling of Earth’s Energy Imbalance (EEI) from the 2000 to 2010 period to the 2013 to 2023 period. In the slide “Trends in Daytime SW [Short Wave (sunlight)] flux, –OLR Flux and Cloud Fraction by Cloud Type (07/2002-12/2022)” Loeb asserts: Loeb’s conclusions are: Large ASR trend primarily driven by reductions in low and middle clouds. Ocean mixed layer heating (and SST) variations primarily associated with ocean heat fluxes as opposed to surface heat fluxes. Implies rate of increase in planetary heat uptake is relatively insensitive to internal climate variability during CERES.” From this physical evidence we can assert that the warming from 2000 to 2023 was not caused by changes in the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the increase in greenhouse gases. The major cause was a decrease in daytime cloud cover. [As a sidenote, those who assert that the decline in daytime cloudiness is from the banning of the use of bunker fuel for maritime transport should note that the vast bulk of shipping lanes are in the Northern Hemisphere while the reduction in cloudiness is in both Hemispheres.] See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy and for Hayden’s essays on Basic Climate Physics https://www.sepp.org/science_papers.cfm?whichyear=2022. ********************* Shifting Winds: The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum took place in Davos, Switzerland, where President Trump created a disturbance. According to Lifesite News: “Donald Trump has called ‘green energy’ and the Green New Deal the ‘greatest hoax in history’ in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. During his special address on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum (WEF), Trump said the ‘Green New Scam’ (a reference to the ‘Green New Deal’) is ‘perhaps the greatest hoax in history.’ Trump noted that countries like Germany, which have embraced so-called ‘green’ energy, produce less energy now than they did years ago, have higher energy prices, and have less energy security.” Commentator Jo Nova caught a significant shift in a video of one of the question-and-answer periods at Davos. A few years ago, Larry Fink CEO of BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, was the darling of some political groups because he firmly supported the dangers of climate change (global warming) and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) political goals. Since then, BlackRock has quietly abandoned DEI goals. Nova writes: “Way back in his 2021 annual CEO letter, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, wrote: ‘No issue ranks higher than climate change.’ It will reshape global capital flows, he said, and declared ‘…anyone can see the impact of climate change in the natural disasters in California or Florida.’ Now though, never mind about global extinctions and flash floods. Fink just spoke at the Davos ski club for billionaires and declared that we need ‘trillions of dollars’ of investment for AI. Data centers, he said, are rapidly expanding — one technology company he spoke to said that ‘its data centers currently use about 5 gigawatts, but by 2030 it expects to need 30 gigawatts.’ But like a true banker, he doesn’t see a backflip; he sees only investment opportunities — the world is short of power he says. (He doesn’t say that this is in large part because BlackRock leaned on companies and countries all over the world to abandon fossil fuels.) Fink helped create the energy shortage that he now calls an investment opportunity. BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world, controlling $10 Trillion dollars in assets, or five times Australia’s GDP. When that much money talks, everyone listens. Now Larry Fink throws wind and solar under the bus He’s matter of fact, with a straight face, almost like he never pushed intermittent generators: Fink: ‘At the same time, this represents a huge investment opportunity. The world is going to be short of power. And to supply these data centers, you cannot rely solely on intermittent sources like wind and solar. You need dispatchable power because these data centers cannot simply turn on and off.’ Larry Fink slides the bomb in after 45 mins 30 seconds: This man probably did more than any single person to pump up the Great Renewables Bubble that peaked in 2022. He presumably has taken his profits long before this speech — leaving mums and dads and pension funds holding the bag with investments in unreliable, expensive generators.” See links under Questioning the Orthodoxy (Nova includes the video). ********************* Linear No Threshold Model: One of the biggest travesties of physical science is applying the linear no threshold model (LNT) when physical evidence does not exist. People die of water intoxication, drinking too much water too fast which dilutes the body’s electrolytes. Applying the LNT, one can claim that drinking any amount of pure water is deadly to humans. Steve Milloy has frequently exposed entities such as the World Health Organizations using the LNT to claim millions of deaths from particulate matter of 2.5 microns or smaller (PM2.5) without any physical evidence such as corpses or even death certificates. In alerting the public that the current administration is addressing this travesty Milloy writes: “The evaluation of a proposed rule’s costs and benefits has been a commonsense administrative requirement before setting new regulations since the Reagan administration. Until the Clinton administration, so-called cost-benefit analysis was an effective tool in stopping costly overregulation, particularly at the EPA. But the Clinton EPA figured out how to game the cost-benefit analysis process in order to issue its most expensive regulations – air quality rules that were eventually used by the Obama EPA to destroy half of the U.S. coal industry. After failing in its first effort to implement an anti-fossil fuel agenda through a ‘BTU tax,’ the Clinton EPA moved to issue more stringent air quality standards for ozone. The problem is that the monetized benefits of the tighter ozone standard (possibly fewer asthma attacks triggered by outdoor air) paled in comparison to the economy-wide compliance costs of the regulation (tens of billions of dollars). The Clinton EPA’s solution was to pair the ozone proposal with another proposal to regulate, for the first time, a newly invented air pollutant called ‘fine particulate matter’ or ‘PM2.5,’ which is microscopic dust, soot, or pollen in outdoor air. As described in great detail in my 2016 book ‘Scare Pollution,’ the Clinton administration developed the false and junk science-based notion that normal levels of PM2.5 in outdoor air could cause people to die prematurely. How did this help the ozone proposal? The EPA claimed that regulating PM2.5 would prevent 20,000 premature deaths per year. Each prevented death, the EPA claimed, provided economic benefits of $5 million. When you multiply 20,000 premature deaths prevented by $5 million dollars, you get $100 billion in economic benefits, which the EPA claimed would be much greater than any possible compliance costs. So, the EPA’s proposed air quality rules passed the required cost-benefit test since the benefits outweighed the costs. By the time of the Obama administration, the EPA was claiming that PM2.5 was responsible for 570,000 (i.e., about one in five) deaths per year in the U.S. and the value of preventing a premature death had risen to $9 million. Given that EPA determined there was no safe level of inhaling PM2.5, the cost-benefit analyses for its rules could beat back over $5 trillion in claimed compliance costs futilely spent trying to eliminate PM2.5 from the air. The problem, though, is that the EPA’s claims were all chicanery. Both the alleged deaths caused by PM2.5 and the monetized value of a premature death were each invented out of thin air. I have been in federal court with the EPA about its scientific claims on PM2.5, where it admitted that its primary line of evidence – i.e., epidemiology data – does not in fact show that PM2.5 outdoors has killed anyone. The EPA has also experimented on real people, including the sick and elderly, with high exposures to PM2.5. Those didn’t harm anyone either. The monetization of premature deaths is truly bizarre. The $5 million value of a premature death avoided was derived through a type of economic research called ‘willingness to pay,’ in which people are polled for how much they would pay for something of value. In the case of PM2.5, EPA nonsensically asked people how much they would be willing to pay to reduce their risk of premature death by 1-in-100,000. Let’s say, for example, that your risk of dying prematurely is 50%. Per the results of the EPA’s survey, people would pay $50 to reduce that risk to 49.99999%. That sum multiplied by 100,000 is where the $5 million came from. EPA has arbitrarily raised the willingness-to-pay figure to $9 million per life saved. Now let’s say you are a 99-year-old who, because of PM2.5, dies ‘prematurely’ today instead of tomorrow, as EPA assumes otherwise would have happened. Because you died ‘prematurely,’ according to the EPA, PM2.5 caused an economic loss of $5 million. Contrast that EPA fantasy with the realistic situation of a 21-year-old young soldier being killed on the battlefield. The U.S. government’s standard valuation of that soldier’s life, paid out in real dollars, is $100,000. The Trump EPA has now merely decided that it will no longer consider the monetization of imaginary PM2.5 deaths in the cost-benefit analyses of EPA air regulations. This will ensure that air pollution regulations make sense and are not pointlessly burdensome – a welcome change after 30 years of EPA just making things up.” The Linear No Threshold Model was first applied to the nuclear industry and has been used to shackle innovation is nuclear power plants. In “DOE Dumps ALARA: Will the NRC Follow Suit?” Duggan Flanakin writes: “When Secretary of Energy Chris Wright on January 12 announced that the DOE had ended the use of the ‘As Low as Reasonably Achievable’ (ALARA) principle for radiation safety directives and regulations, he was following both a directive from President Trump and a recommendation by scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory. President Trump, in Executive Order EO 14300, criticized ALARA and the linear no-threshold (LNT) model on which it is based, stating ‘Those models lack sound scientific basis and produce irrational results, such as requiring that nuclear plants protect against radiation below naturally occurring levels.’” No doubt many entities will announce that such actions are dangerous for public health. But unless they produce physical evidence, they have nothing but their empty claims. See links under EPA and other Regulators on the March, ********************* Poor Market Design? The free market is the product of untold billions of voluntary transactions by billions of people for thousands of years. However, often politicians and their collaborators think they understand what is important to people better than the people themselves. One example is replacing reliable electricity generation with wind and solar. When the system does not work the proponents often blame poor market or system design. Tilak Doshi effectively demolishes one such advocate who claimed that the market must be updated to accomplish what he desires it accomplish. However, with a “modern market” design, will the wind blow constantly, and the sunshine 24/7? See link under Energy Issues – General. ********************* Microplastics: One of the recent fears spread using poor studies is the fear of microplastics accumulating in human brains. Somehow microplastics get by the blood-brain barrier. A paper asserting microplastics accumulate in human brains was published in February 2025 in Nature Medicine. In WUWT, Charles Rotter highlights a new paper (Matters Arising) published in November 2025 in Nature Medicine that questions the first paper. According to the second paper: “The study as reported appears to face methodological challenges, such as limited contamination controls and lack of validation steps, which may affect the reliability of the reported concentrations. In this Matters Arising, we highlight methodological limitations that have general relevance for advancing robust and reproducible MNP detection in human biomonitoring studies.” See links under Other Scientific News. ********************* Number of the Week: Cut of 2.4%: Bloomberg News had a headline “Key US Power Grid Cuts Demand Outlook on Overstated AI Boom.” The article stated: “The biggest US grid operator dialed back its forecast for power demand growth, offering a reality check to the frenzy around the artificial intelligence boom. PJM Interconnection LLC, which manages the 13-state eastern grid from the mid-Atlantic to the Midwest, cut its peak demand forecast for the summer of 2027 to about 160 gigawatts. That’s down from a previous outlook of about 164 gigawatts.” A reduction from 164 gigawatts to 160 gigawatt is 4 gigawatts or about 2.4%. The 2025 actual peak summer load was about 161 gigawatts in June. This reduction in forecasts is big news to Bloomberg News?

Saban; John J. Wiens, The Royal Society, B, Oct 15, 2025 From Morrison: When the history of the great Net Zero climate hoax comes to be written, pride of place will be given to the terrifying sixth mass extinction scare. Mainstream media barely question the idea that human-controlled climate is wreaking havoc with the life chances of millions of animal and plant species around the world. In November 2024, the Guardian reported that “as the planet warms up, scientists predict a series of ‘extinction cliffs’”. We are in danger of forgetting what the climate crisis means: extinction, was the cheerful article headline. Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science Climate change fuels disasters, but deaths don’t add up By Laurent Thomet, Phys.org, Jan 21, 2026 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Climate change is turbocharging heat waves, wildfires, floods and tropical storms, but how deadly have extreme weather events become for people in their path?… Discerning an annual pattern is tricky, as a single disaster can make one year much deadlier than another. In an annual report last week, Munich Re said deaths from floods, storms, wildfires and earthquakes rose to 17,200 last year, distinctly higher than the 11,000 fatalities recorded in 2024. Thousands of deaths from major earthquakes in Myanmar and Afghanistan caused the death toll to spike year-on-year. But the Munich Re figure was below the 10-year average of 17,800 deaths and 30-year average of 41,900 fatalities. The data excludes droughts and heat waves. There is “no clear trend” when it comes to deaths from natural disasters, Grimm said. [SEPP Comment: The author does not understand the basis for fierce weather. Heat does not create fierce storms; temperature and pressure gradients do. Fierce storms are common in the Antarctic in winter, particularly along the coasts.] Claim: Climate Change Causes Deadlier Disasters with Fewer Deaths By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Jan 22, 2026 Link to: The 2025 Global Report of the Lancet Countdown By Staff, The Lancet, 2025 [SEPP Comment: The biased, alarmist report calls for strengthening science-based communication to counter misleading information.] Questioning the Orthodoxy The Problem with ‘Peer Review’ By James Alexander, The Daily Sceptic, Jan 17, 2026 And if that was not pithy enough, here is Eric Voegelin, one of those great émigre scholars who went to America.

Heilman and Eric Voegelin: A Friendship in Letters, 1944-1984, p. 312: “If you place money in the hands of academic mediocrities, it will hardly improve scholarship or advance science but rather increase the social power of mediocrity.” The Great Climate Reset What comes next? By Roger Pielke Jr., His Blog, Jan 20, 2026 Noah Kaufman, researcher at Columbia University, strikes the right note in my view in a recent essay in the Atlantic. Here he discusses economics specifically, but his message is more broadly applicable to claims across disciplines about the climate future: High-profile economic studies claim to quantify the global damages that will be caused by climate change centuries into the future and have produced estimates that range from modest to catastrophic. They have lent a veneer of scientific authority to arguments for both complacency and alarm, even though these studies are far too limited to support either position. . . [SEPP Comment: Generally, these studies and comments about them do not recognize that the greenhouse effects of water vapor and carbon dioxide are highly saturated. In the wavelengths (frequencies) that water vapor and carbon dioxide readily absorb infrared energy, there is nothing left to absorb. Thus, future great damages from increasing CO2 are not based on physical evidence.] Watch Those Assumptions!

By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Jan 15, 2026 Video Tidbits By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Jan 21, 2026 Global Warming is Only A Modest Problem By Cliff Mass, Weather Blog, Jan 19, 2026 Why are so many groups hyping and exaggerating the impacts of global warming? Claiming disaster and existential threats without a factual basis. Whatever the reason, climate change hype and exaggeration are both destructive and counterproductive, often hurting the very people advocates claim to be concerned about. World Economic Forum Elites Should Focus on Economics, Not Climate Change, Climate Change News By Linnea Lueken, Climate Realism, Jan 20, 2026 Can You Be Too Clever For Your Own Good? Apparently so, but only if you are a climate sceptic! By John Ridgway, Climate Skepticism, Jan 23, 2026 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] In fact, if there has ever been a professional group that uses its intelligence to protect its own values, it must surely be the behavioral scientists. There is more than a hint of hypocrisy here, and I have to say that there is nothing more ironic than a bias blind spot that involves a professional group accusing others of being uniquely susceptible to bias blind spot. Energy & Environmental Review: January 19, 2026 By John Droz, Jr., Master Resource, Jan 19, 2026 Problems in the Orthodoxy Climate Retreat: Economic, Natural, Positive By Robert Bradley Jr. Master Resource, Jan 22, 2026 Bad ecology is also at work. Wind and solar are the epitome of little-from-much, as in low-capacity factors, land sprawl, and transmission sprawl. Local environmentalists (versus Big Green) are protesting more and more. After Paris!

Coelho, Misis Wire, Jan 16, 2026 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] In a free society, science is messy. It is argumentative, decentralized, and often embarrassing. That’s not a flaw; it’s how error correction happens. Bureaucratic science is tidy. It produces unified messaging, authoritative “guidance,” and a clear line between insiders and cranks. Science information versus science narration If America is going to have a functional future on subjects as diverse as climate and sexual differences, we must get ideology out of the laboratory.

The world is in water bankruptcy, UN scientists report – here’s what that means By Kaveh Madani, The Conversation, Jan 20, 2026 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Opening sentence: The world is now using so much fresh water amid the consequences of climate change that it has entered an era of water bankruptcy, with many regions no longer able to bounce back from frequent water shortages. [Boldface added] Water bankruptcy signs are everywhere, from Tehran, where droughts and unsustainable water use have depleted reservoirs the Iranian capital relies on, adding fuel to political tensions, to the U.S., where water demand has outstripped the supply in the Colorado River, a crucial source of drinking water and irrigation for seven states. [SEPP Comment: Human caused climate change has nothing to do with it. Areas undergo periods of rainfall and lack of rainfall. The problem in Tehran, Iran, was caused by the government not maintaining a system providing adequate water. The Colorado River Compact was agreed upon during a period of high water, a foolish basis.] Communicating Better to the Public – Use Propaganda The Perpetual Climate Panic Machine ‘Collapses’ By Tim Graham, The Daily Signal, Jan 18, 2026 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] If the perpetual climate panic machine has collapsed, it’s because the facts never lined up to prove any reason to panic. Their authoritarian “solutions”—banning everything from gas-powered cars to gas stoves and grills—needed the fuel of panic to be forced on the public. The bloom is off their poisoned rose. Questioning European Green British Climate Crusade Creates Economic Disaster By Vijay Jayaraj, CO2 Coalition, Jan 21, 2026 Nowhere is the insanity more visible than in the North Sea. For decades, offshore oil and natural gas were the crown jewels of the British economy, providing cheap, reliable energy and revenue to fund public services. Today, this resource is being sacrificed at the altar of climate theology. The Prime Minister’s punitive windfall taxes and refusal to issue new licenses have effectively killed North Sea energy development. Investors have fled. Rigs are decommissioning. Thousands of skilled jobs are evaporating. Bank of England warns Net Zero is slowing growth Four-minute Video Peter Cardwell and Mourice Cousins of Net Zero Watch “What is the … Plan for Gas?”: Even the Guardian has Slammed Mad Miliband’s Latest Green Energy Brainstorm By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Jan 17, 2026 But maybe The Guardian group is thinking ahead. When Britain’s electricity grid inevitably falls in a heap, a possibility which is becoming more likely with each passing year, a track record of pointing out the problems might give The Guardian maneuvering room to claim the failure was because of flaws in Mad Miliband’s energy plans, not the fault of renewable energy.

Maybe ten days a year if that. The basic point is that we now have standard Judicial review of a major Administrative order. There is no winner or loser at this point. It is the American balance of powers. How Louisiana’s Legal Gambit Endangers U.S. Energy Security By Rob Maness, Real Clear Energy, Jan 21, 2026 One of the key points of contention in these ongoing legal disputes is a fundamental jurisdictional question: should companies that acted under federal wartime authority be judged in federal court or state court?

[SEPP Comment: In the UK, the Contracts for Difference (CfD) subsidy assures revenue stability to the wind and solar generators. If market prices for electricity are lower than the “strike price” then the government (consumers) pay the difference. If market prices are higher than the “strike price” then the generator pays back the surplus revenue. As reliable generation is being driven out of the market by guaranteed returns wind and solar generators have (often subsidized), how high will the “strike price” go? The generators of reliable electricity will not remain in the game unless they can be assured high prices for providing so-called wind and solar “back-up.” The game does not benefit the consumer who desires reliable and affordable electricity.] Taxpayers to Pay £15bn for Miliband’s Green Tech Blitz By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Jan 22, 2026 EPA and other Regulators on the March STEVE MILLOY: Trump EPA Gets Fraud Out Of Air Pollution Rules By Steve Milloy, Daily Caller, Jan 18, 2026 DOE Dumps ALARA: Will the NRC Follow Suit?

Simultaneously, the world saw a 2% annual rise in total energy demand, reaching a new high of 592 EJ. From Ring: For example, in 2024, oil, natural gas, and coal still amounted to 82 percent of total worldwide fuel consumption. Among various countries that percentage didn’t differ by much: USA 81%, China 82%, India 88%, and all of the African nations in aggregate 90%.

Europe’s Outrage Over Maduro Arrest Reflects Poor Understanding of Oil Industry By Samuele Furfari, WUWT, Jan 17, 2026 Energy Issues – Europe Constraint Payments Soar To New Record By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Jan 22, 2026 From the Telegraph: Britain’s wind farm turbines wasted enough energy to power all of London’s homes last year, new figures show. A record 10 terawatt hours (TWh) of wind power went to waste in 2025, according to a report from energy analyst Montel – costing billpayers a total of £1.4bn in “curtailment costs”. From Homewood: Wind is currently supplying 43% of our electricity. Miliband wants to triple that, which will give us 51 GW and 129% of total demand. Add the 8% from nuclear, which cannot be switched on and off, and we get 137%. It’s hard to think of a more crackpot way to run an energy system! Britain to extend life of ageing nuclear plants to keep the lights on By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Jan 22, 2026 Homewood: It is all very well keeping them going till 2030, but what happens after that? German Chancellor admits shutting nuclear plants was a “serious strategic mistake” — will rebuild nuclear By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Jan 20, 2026 Germany to build 10GW of baseload gas plants (disguised as “future” hydrogen plants) By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Jan 17, 2026 Facing industrial death, Germany has finally decided it needs dispatchable reliable electricity. But they can’t announce that they suddenly need to build 10 gigawatts of fossil fueled gas power plants. It would be like admitting the sacred Energiewende had been a ghastly mistake that wasted billions of dollars on a reckless vanity quest to change the clouds. So instead, these new “power plants” with a focus on “gas-fired sites” must be convertible to run on hydrogen by 2045. Of course, they may never run on hydrogen, given that makes pipes brittle, leaks, and costs four times as much as natural gas, but it makes a good cover story. [SEPP Comment: Will they design it to handle hydrogen, look at the costs of the special materials, then quietly forget hydrogen?] As German Gas Storage Dips Dangerously Low…Shortage Hardly Avoidable By P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Jan 21, 2026 Energy Issues – Australia Aussie Coal Closure Delayed, to Lower Prices and Stabilise the Grid By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Jan 20, 2026 I know you will all be surprised as I am that $10s of billions spent on renewables has failed to produce a viable replacement for a single coal plant. I’m confused. If renewables are cheaper than coal, how can keeping a coal plant open help reduce wholesale prices? And if coal is a far greater threat to grid reliability than renewables, as our Aussie federal energy minister has assured us, why does our reliable renewable grid need backup from an unreliable old coal plant? The next Aussie federal election is due mid to late 2028, so maybe the plan is to shut down the coal plant early in the next election cycle, just in case there are a few minor teething problems with Australia’s Net Zero power grid. How to back away slowly from Net Zero while pretending not to: Step 1 – keep extending largest coal plant By Jo Nova, Her Blog, Jan 21, 2026 The Zombie coal plant lives again Energy Issues – Elsewhere non-US South Korea’s Developing Net Zero Debacle Germany, the continent’s model of green virtue, finds itself deindustrializing at a rate of 4.5% in 2024 By Vijay Jayaraj, California Globe, Jan 21, 2025 Germany, the continent’s model of green virtue, finds itself deindustrializing – at a rate of 4.5% in 2024, on par with a multi-year downward trend. The same year, the U.K.’s industrial energy consumption fell by 1.2% from 2023 to record what the government notes was “the lowest industrial consumption for over 50 years.” The Bank of England has warned: “Net zero policies are slowing the global economy.” The World Bank predicts that “the 2020s will be the weakest decade for global growth since its records began in the 1960s. Whether this decline is by design or daft incompetence, the effects are predictable. In a renewables-dominated Korean grid, bulk material industries like POSCO’s steel mills and Lotte’s petrochemical plants could be the first casualties, competing as they do on razor-thin margins. [SEPP Comment: According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the Real Gross Domestic Product for Germany is now about the same as it was in the third quarter of 2019 (before Covid) after peaking in 2022.] Energy Issues — US Red States Have Reliable Power Because They Embrace an All-of-the-Above Strategy By Greg Brophy, Real Clear Energy, Jan 21, 2025 The report reviewed 10 rural and conservative-leaning states – Arizona, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming. It concluded the power grids in those states are 2 to 7 times more reliable than the national average, according to data on electrical outages from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. [SEPP Comment: If the states eliminate wind and solar will it reduce reliability or increase it Presumably, the national average reliability of the grid is over 99%.

By Francis Meenton, Manhattan Contrarian, Jan 21, 2026 For a different take, you might wonder where The New York Times stands on this. Well, I have your answer. Yesterday, they gave over a big chunk of their editorial page to an op-ed by a guy named Bill Saporito, headlined “$25 Billion. That’s What Trump Cost Detroit.” The thesis is that EVs are wondrous products, and that American EVs would be conquering the world, and earning big profits for the automakers, but for a “war” against EVs instigated by President Trump.

It is logical to be guided by “shark logic”. If you never swim in the sea, you will never be taken by a shark. Owners of our block of 14 apartments have voted to prohibit all vehicles powered by Lithium batteries from entering our large under-the-building communal car park. “Climate is controlled by the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth and the amount of infrared energy emitted to space.” Surely, the CERES project is not so stupid as to rely on the above statement in calculating the “energy balance” of the Earth. About 40% of the energy of “sunlight” arriving at the Earth is in the visible spectrum, which is fortunate because it allows our eyes to “see” by sunlight. What our eyes also “see” from the space stations is a brightly-lit daytime Earth in full spectrum from white to nearly black. Even from the nighttime side we see bright lights everywhere – except in North Korea and “darkest” Africa. To claim that there should be a “balance” between all incoming sunlight and only outgoing infrared energy is beyond ridiculous. To think that “Climate is controlled by” the difference in those two measures is equally absurd. “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

January 25, 2026 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to my weekly report, issue number 39. Driven by our dual-engine EAI strategy, this week, I’d like to first share major progress on our EAI robotics business, along with a piece of good news from the capital markets: 1. The first FF EAI robotics product has completed U.S. regulatory certification and is about to officially enter sales. Regulatory approvals for the remaining products in our initial batch are advancing and are expected to be finalized soon. This progress brings us closer to realizing our ‘launch is sale, sale is delivery’ model, with the goal of starting product deliveries within the same month as the launch. Our robotics strategy focuses on creating real-world use cases and user value, directly addressing the industry’s current lack of true 'must-have' demand. By integrating Web3 and blockchain technologies, we aim to lead the industry into a new phase of commercialization driven by authentic user needs and value creation. Our goal is to become the first U.S. company to deliver humanoid robot products with positive contribution margins, and to rapidly scale deliveries to enter the ranks of leading EAI robotics companies in the U.S. 2. In terms of R&D, we are continuing to establish clear empowerment pathways from EAI EVs to EAI robots, aiming to transfer and apply the AI DNA and years of auto-grade AI capabilities that FF has built since its founding to empower the “brain” and “cerebellum” of our robots. In addition, FF is the only company in the U.S. market with the "EAI+Crypto" dual flywheel ecosystem, which has a natural advantage in cross-scenario, cross-domain, and cross-ecosystem technology feeding back, which will build up our core differentiated technology barriers in the EAI field. 3. The FF EAI Robotics Product Final Launch and the FF/FX Par Partner Recruitment Conference on February 4 will center around the theme of “Robot &Vehicle +”. We will provide a comprehensive introduction to how FF leverages its Dual-Flywheel, Dual-Bridge, and Dual-Public-Companies structure and applies an original AI innovation + bridge model approach to systematically address industry pain points across application scenarios, cost, user experience, and ecosystem development—leading the arrival of a new era of EAI.

Title: How BlackRock just lost control of the $10B tokenized Treasury market to Circle for one simple, mechanical reason

Full Content:
USYC hit $1.69B AUM on Jan. 22, narrowly topping BUIDL’s $1.684B. The real advantage is buried in collateral rails. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry. His expertise primarily focuses on the Brazilian blockchain ecosystem and developments in decentralized finance (DeFi). Tokenized US Treasuries crossed $10 billion in total value this week, a milestone that confirms the category has moved from proof-of-concept to operational infrastructure. Yet, something happening underneath this achievement is just as important: Circle's USYC has edged past BlackRock's BUIDL as the largest tokenized Treasury product, signaling that distribution rails and collateral mechanics now matter more than brand recognition in determining which on-chain cash equivalents win. As of Jan. 22, USYC holds $1.69 billion in assets under management compared to BUIDL's $1.684 billion, a gap of roughly $6.14 million, or 0.36%. Over the past 30 days, USYC's assets grew 11% while BUIDL's contracted 2.85%, a divergence that reads less like marketing success and more like net creation flowing in one direction while redemptions drain the other. This isn't a story about Circle beating BlackRock in a brand war. It's about collateral workflow design outperforming logo recognition. Additionally, it maps directly onto the infrastructure question that regulators and institutions are now asking out loud: who shapes the stack that turns idle crypto capital into productive, yield-bearing collateral? Tokenized RWAs are dominated by Ethereum, but one unexpected blockchain rival just surged 28% to outpace the leader. USYC's clearest structural advantage is distribution through exchange collateral rails. On July 24, Binance announced that institutional customers could hold USYC and use it as off-exchange collateral for derivatives, with custody handled through Banking Triparty or Ceffu and near-instant redemption into USDC. Binance added BUIDL to its off-exchange collateral list on Nov. 14, four months after USYC. That sequencing matters. If the cash collateral stack is built first inside prime brokerage and derivatives workflows, the product that integrates earlier captures the flow. USYC didn't just get listed, it got embedded into the operational layer where institutions manage margin and collateral automation. Circle positioned USYC explicitly as yield-bearing collateral that travels alongside USDC rails, meaning institutions that already route stablecoin flows through Circle's ecosystem can onboard USYC without building new operational pathways. BlackRock's BUIDL entered the market with brand authority but without the same plug-and-play integration into crypto-native collateral systems. BlackRock’s tokenization thesis puts 65%+ of tokenized assets on Ethereum, but newer RWA data shows share can drift. RWA.xyz labels the two products differently under “Use of Income.” USYC is marked as “Accumulates,” meaning interest accrues within the token balance. BUIDL is marked as “Distributes,” meaning returns are paid out separately. This distinction is mechanical, not cosmetic. Collateral systems, especially automated margin and derivatives infrastructure, prefer set-and-forget balances where value compounds without requiring operational handling of payouts. An accumulating structure integrates more cleanly into collateral automation than a distributing one. For institutions building collateral rails that need to scale across multiple venues and counterparties, the simpler the structure, the lower the operational drag. RWA.xyz lists materially different entry requirements for the two products. BUIDL restricts access to US Qualified Purchasers, requiring a minimum investment of $5 million in USDC. USYC targets non-US investors with a minimum of $100,000 USDC. The funnel difference is structural. Qualified Purchaser status in the US requires $5 million in investable assets for individuals or $25 million for entities, a narrow gate that excludes most crypto-native funds, prop desks, and smaller institutional players. USYC's $100,000 minimum and non-US eligibility open access to a broader set of offshore institutions, family offices, and trading firms that operate outside US regulatory perimeters but still need dollar-denominated, yield-bearing collateral. BlackRock's brand carries weight, but the brand doesn't override access constraints. If a fund can't meet the Qualified Purchaser threshold or operates outside the US, BUIDL isn't an option. USYC is. The addressable market for on-chain collateral skews heavily toward non-US entities and smaller institutions, exactly the segment USYC is designed to serve. New smart contract enables real-time, transparent BUIDL share transfers to USDC. The simplest explanation for the flip is the cleanest: flows moved. Market-moving headlines and context delivered every morning in one tight read. Free. No spam. Unsubscribe any time. USYC grew by 11% over the past 30 days, while BUIDL shrank by 2.85%. That's not a marketing differential. It's net issuance into one product, offset by net outflows from the other. The recent flip suggests a discrete event or allocation decision rather than gradual drift. USYC's Binance integration, its accumulating income structure, and its lower entry threshold all reduce friction. BUIDL hasn't added comparable distribution momentum in the same window. Tokenized Treasuries at $10 billion remain a small fraction of the $310 billion stablecoin market, but their role is shifting from niche experiment to operational default. The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) noted in recent guidance that tokenized money market funds are increasingly used as stablecoin reserve assets and as collateral for crypto-related transactions. This is precisely the interlinkages driving USYC's growth. JPMorgan framed tokenized money market funds as the next frontier after stablecoins, centered on portability and collateral efficiency. The bank's analysis treats tokenized Treasuries not as an alternative to stablecoins but as an evolution of them. They are programmable cash equivalents that settle faster, move across blockchains more easily, and integrate into collateral systems with less operational overhead than traditional custody arrangements. With stablecoin yields near zero, tokenized Treasuries offer a risk-free on-chain rate without requiring users to exit crypto rails. Instead of parking cash in non-yielding stablecoins or moving it off-chain to earn returns, institutions can now hold yield-bearing collateral on-chain that functions like cash but compounds like Treasuries. Tokenized US Treasuries grew from $2 billion to $9 billion in 18 months. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Circle now offer on-chain T-bills as margin collateral, DeFi building blocks, and stablecoin alternatives. The $10 billion milestone is less important than the capture rate it represents. Tokenized Treasuries currently account for roughly 3% to 4% of the stablecoin float. If that rate doubles over the next 12 months, which is a conservative assumption given current flow momentum and collateral integrations, tokenized Treasuries could reach $20 billion to $25 billion. If collateral flywheels accelerate and more venues replicate Binance-style off-exchange rails, the range stretches to $40 billion to $60 billion. The metrics that matter are all measurable: net issuance trends, collateral integration announcements, changes to eligibility requirements, and shifts in income-handling preferences. USYC's 30-day growth rate and BUIDL's contraction are early signals. The Binance integration timeline is another. The funnel gap is a third. USYC didn't flip BUIDL because Circle outspent BlackRock on marketing. It flipped because distribution, mechanics, and access constraints aligned with how institutions actually use on-chain collateral. The category crossed $10 billion not because one flagship product dominated, but because multiple products are now competing on infrastructure terms: who integrates faster, who reduces friction, who widens the funnel. Brand recognition opened doors. Collateral workflow design is keeping them open. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. A new comms lead, an institutions portal, and “Get in touch” CTAs suggest Ethereum thinks perception is becoming adoption. Collateral mobility is the pitch, yet delivery-versus-payment depends on an on-chain cash leg that isn’t fully ready.

Only two of the top six won on an unpredictable day in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League on Saturday, with Young Munster the prime movers as they climbed from sixth to third thanks to their 37-20 victory over Terenure at Tom Clifford Park. A key moment in the Cookies registering their fourth win in succession was a big defensive set in front of a large segment of the home crowd by the club house on half-time. This led to a scuffle and a relieving penalty in preserving a 17-6 interval lead after tries by Bailey Faloon and Stephen McLoughlin. After a try by number eight and man of the match Luke Murphy, Aran Egan responded for Terenure, and then another Munster academy player, scrumhalf Jake O’Riordan, scored a length-of-the-pitch intercept try as ‘Nure pressed to make it a one-score game. Oisín Pepper, the Cookies’ quick and skilful 21-year-old centre, who was released by the Munster academy, marked his second game after a six-month absence following shoulder surgery by scoring after good work by John Poland and Shane O’Leary. Pepper was one of 12 players from Limerick schools in the matchday squad. Jordan Coghlan scored a brace in Clontarf’s 10th consecutive win, overcoming an improving Nenagh 35-24 in their first ever visit to Castle Avenue. Second-placed St Mary’s were held to a 16-all draw at home by Ballynahinch, with Mick O’Gara converting Mick McCormack’s late try in taking his tally for the season to 115 points. UCD and Old Belvedere underlined the competitiveness of 1A with 20-15 and 18-12 home wins over Lansdowne and Cork Con respectively. Lansdowne led 15-7 at the break thanks to tries from Bobby Sheehan, his sixth of the season, and Harry van Eaden, but Evan Moynihan and Eoghan Walsh added to a first-half try by James Culhane as the Students completed a double over the visitors. Belvo are coming to grips with life in 1A, tries by Justin Leonard and captain Calum Dowling helping them establish an 18-5 interval lead. Con, missing the influential Jack Kelleher (hamstring), responded with Danny Sheehan’s seventh try of the season before Belvo withstood late pressure. In 1B Blackrock College were surprise 20-7 winners over Instonians, Old Wesley pulling 10 points clear with five second-half tries to beat Queen’s University 36-7. MU Barnhall and Galwegians remained unbeaten at the top of 2A and 2B thanks to 11-3 and 50-15 home wins over Greystones and Navan. ‘Wegians outside centre Rob Deacy, the leading try scorer across all five divisions, scored his 12th in nine games, the home side recording their 11th bonus-point win in 11 games before many among a big crowd at Crowley Park rolled down the hill to the unveiling of the Clan Stand and the interpro between Connacht and Leinster.

Title: XRP Charts Flash Familiar Signal As Analyst Calls For $11, Then $70

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A growing number of chart watchers are pointing to a long stretch of sideways trading for XRP and saying this setup has come before big rallies. According to a widely followed analyst known as CryptoBull, the current price action echoes earlier runs in the token’s history. The signal is simple: long quiet periods sometimes lead to sharp moves when buying pressure returns. That does not mean a jump is guaranteed. Markets can stay quiet for a long time, and timing is uncertain. Based on reports, XRP’s weekly structure shows a stretch of range trading after strong breakouts from earlier years. The comparison reaches back several cycles. In past examples, long ranges eventually gave way to impulsive runs that pushed the price far above prior highs. The next impulse will take #XRP to $11 and the last wave to $70. The price pattern is copying the previous bullrun, only difference is time, which makes sense, as we need longer accumulation for higher prices. pic.twitter.com/WJxzYDVRKT — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) January 23, 2026 CryptoBull argues the present consolidation has lasted longer than previous ones, which, he says, could compress price action and build fuel for a larger expansion when momentum flips. The idea rests on history repeating itself in broad strokes, not in exact moves. Some analysts see a sixfold move as plausible if the same pattern plays out. That kind of rise would put XRP near $11, a figure being discussed by multiple commentators. There is also talk of a further, final wave lifting the token much higher in a later stage — talk that reaches $70 in extreme scenarios. A bottom test—where price revisits support to confirm strength before a new push—has appeared in a few past cycles and is being watched closely now. The presence of such tests can either validate a base or warn that the range has more work to do. Timelines are vague, and a long accumulation period can stretch for years before any decisive breakout. Reports that BlackRock may use Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin have added fuel to the fire. News like that has pushed sentiment upward and sparked fresh technical calls, with some forecasts ranging from $6 to $14 in near- to mid-term scenarios. Other voices go far beyond, naming targets that would imply market caps so large they would be hard to reconcile with today’s market size. These more extreme numbers should be treated with caution, because they assume near-perfect conditions and massive capital flows that may never arrive. Still, adoption whispers can tilt sentiment and speed up moves when buyers pile in. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: The World Economic Forum on a Course of Self-Destruction

Word has it that the 2026 World Economic Forum (WEF) Davos event went down as the worst ever in WEF’s history. Maybe it has to do with Trump’s showing up and everybody, including the Swiss Government, falling on their knees to please the emperor without clothes; and / or because Larry Fink, the BlackRock Chair, now literally owns the WEF and calls the shot on everything. Everyone below him, even the co-chairs, are YES-people. What is playing out ever clearer is a digital-financial dictatorship, largely run by robotized humanoids. As long as the money flows – and flowing it does, better believe it – everything is allowed. President Trump was literally uprooting Davos, the Swiss Government, and foremost the Swiss air traffic – see below. He also uprooted the stock market, not by accident. When Trump first talked about his “sanctioning” the eight (8) EU countries and NATO partners that opposed his invasion of Greenland, the stock market slumped by record rates: The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 870 points (approx. 1.8%-1.9%), while the S&P 500 fell 2.1% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.4%. When shortly after his WEF speech, Trump reversed his decision on the 10% tariff for EU opposition, the stock market rebounded. Guess who are the main winners and losers of this algorithmically-driven game? Right, the ultra-rich, like the Elon Musks of this world. The common people as usual are the losers. On freedom of speech of the so-called democracy – which was and is a scam — has never existed, not even in Greece of 2,300 years ago, Delphi was a farce perpetuated to this day, as the Greek know very well – so, on freedom of speech, for example, Trump tried to block California’s Governor Gavin Newsom from attending Davos. Mr. Newsom came anyway – see this and this. Everything, including WEF’s treatment of staff, was horrible, although up-front the Davos organizing staff were praised for a good job. In reality, they were treated by WEF “superiors” like slaves, with insults, and disrespect. And that after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and Financial Times (FT) had already investigated the WEF in 2024 and 2025 for suspected “irregularities” – concerning especially Klaus Schwab, and for sexual harassment of female employees, regarding Schwab and WEF management. An investigation by lawyers hired by the very WEF vindicated Schwab and the WEF in 2025 from any wrongdoing, as could be expected. So, the WEF management starts on a new slate, so to speak. But the old dirt shines through the new slate, and becomes even worse, as Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, by far the largest financier of the WEF, has become one of WEF’s co-chairs, and now effectively owns the WEF. BlackRock and Vanguard, the two intimately connected and legally interchangeable financial behemoths, manage worldwide corporate assets valued between US$ 25 and US$ 35 trillion. They basically run and decide over every vital sector in the world, including food, energy, banking, production, military and services industries – you name it – with a majority ownership. Speaking at the WEF, Larry Fink, sounded like a polite financial autocrat, clearly pointing the way to an all-digitized monetary system, controlled by electronic IDs, insinuating to be monitored by BlackRock-Vanguard (although never mentioning Vanguard by name). In other words, Larry Fink and his ilk pretend to control your money, the way you spend it – or not – and whether you behave in style with the elite oligarchs’ narrative to continue being able to use your earned money, or have it blocked for misbehavior. We are in the hands of psychopaths, who are allowed covering a worldwide audience with their annual Davos event, another nail in the WEF’s coffin. To complement Larry Fink’s finance-digital ruling, Elon Musk made a surprise appearance in Davos on 22 January, engaging in a 30-minute conversation with Larry Fink. His remarks focused on technology’s role in securing humanity’s future through an absurdly promised abundance, multi-planetary expansion, and cautious AI advancement. The tech oligarch pointed to their companies’ shared goal: maximizing civilization’s probability of a great future by extending consciousness beyond Earth, adding that his SpaceX’s 9,000 satellites confirm that there is no evidence of aliens “out there”, that life is indeed a “rare tiny candle” in a vast darkness. Elon’s sci-fi mind aspired to die on Mars “just not on impact,” [hahaha]; and aging reversal seems solvable via a body-wide “clock”. Whatever that means. AI will probe existence’s mysteries. In brief, he painted the oligarch’s usual rosy “bla-bla-picture” that any thinking individual knows, means exactly the contrary. See this. Back to the 2026 WEF and Trump in Davos: what no mainstream will report — the airport in Zurich was blocked on Wednesday morning with numerous Trump planes, several cargos, C-130’s and the sort, for Trump’s limousine convoys and private helicopters flown in from Washington. The so called “plane spotters” at 6 AM on 21 January were crushing barricades at Zurich airport to see Trump arrive, whenever he arrived, later than he should have, due to a last-minute change of airplane. Several planes carrying heads of state to go to Davos, i.e., from Greece and Cyprus, could not land at Zurich airport. There was no more space, since in addition to Trump’s extra planes, there were an unprecedented 850 private jets also parked at the airport from WEF attendees. Compare this with 65 for the COP29 (November 2024) Summit at Baku, Azerbaijan. The politicians who could not land – and many others, of course — had to cancel their attendance in Davos. For sure, no big loss. Some of the 3,000 attendees in Davos, heads of State, highly educated (or one would think) corporate CEO’s, managing trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of people, caused literally a stampede to enter the room where Trump was blabbering for over 70 minutes – when normally heads of states are allocated 10 to 20-minute slots. These high-level WEF attendees were running – charging – into and over the organizing staff, crushing them against the walls, hurting one lady so badly she had to leave, so they could enter the special conference room where Trump was to speak. That demonstrates a conscience level of high-flying WEF attendee-billionaires comparable to football fans. Swiss military, two rows of them, were placed inside the room, instead of outside, to help prevent a stampede. Stupidity increasingly worldwide knows no frontiers. The entire WEF meetings had to be reorganized and last-minute restructured for Trump, and of course BlackRock calls the shots on everything. As Trump and BlackRock’s Larry Fink indicated, though not in words, in their WEF speeches – we are racing towards the goals of the 2030 Agenda which never left us. This 2030 agenda, also called the Great Reset, prepared for over 100 years, represents a complete destruction of civilization’s orders and laws, towards societal chaos and ever-changing values – from where they, the monsters behind the WEF, expect the emergence of a “New World Order”, under a “One World Government.” This One World Government may be based on “multiple pillars” [they call it multi-polar to once again deceive the public at large], pillars, represented by world powers other than the United States, like Russia and China. This explains why and how Trump could invade Venezuela on January 3, 2026, and kidnap President Maduro, killing over 100 people, without any material interference of Russia and China, at the time also present with their respective navies in the Caribbean. They were informed in advance. Their protests came in words, no actions. Words are blowing in the wind. These secondary thoughts and ideas are expressed in hidden messages by the WEF and its elite attendees, because they represent a worldwide Cult which is currently in control of our civilization. And you may guess, who is behind this Cult. According to Cult wisdom – call it Cult science – any actions or plans MUST be announced in one form or another to the populace concerned, so that it will be successful. Hence the many “predictive” monster and horror movies produced by Hollywood. Just look at the current list of the “10 best movies” as the 2026 Oscar nominees. See this. They all keep humanity on low vibrations which is a MUST for them manipulating human minds, preventing them from ascending to a higher level of consciousness. As an example, look at horror-vampire flick, “Sinners” which was literally nominated for every category of Oscars. The coordination between the WEF, those who pull the strings behind it, and all the 2030 Agenda agents and actors used to control humanity, among them Hollywood, is perfect. But there comes the point where the apparently limitless exuberance of sugar-charged energy brains, à la “We can do what we want, nobody stops us” – like Trump’s – will backfire. So, in the end, this horrifying organization called WEF is self-destructing. It MUST be. The faster the better. At the same time, think THE NOW gives humanity a chance for a new start outside of the slavehood of our digital monetary system and digital control-gulag. May there be soon an end to our dystopian Cult world. Instead, let us open our hearts and souls for Love and Light to emerge on our Blue Planet’s sentinel beings. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Tariffs, Treasuries and the Quiet Risk to America’s Financial Power

Standing in the Rose Garden last April, flanked by American flags, US President Donald Trump declared war on free trade. Nine months later, the most striking feature of that declaration is not how much commerce has collapsed, but how quickly it has rerouted. Trade did not stop; it flowed around obstacles. As a DHL Express company executive observed, trade “will find its way” — behaving, in effect, like water flowing around obstacles under high-tariff regimes. That image of water seeking a new channel captures the first-order reality of the Trump administration’s trade policy. Tariffs have risen sharply, and the costs are landing where economists would expect: higher prices for tariff-sensitive goods, stress on firms reliant on imported inputs, and an implicit tax on households and businesses. Yet the system has adapted. The US is buying less directly from China, but more from Chinese-owned factories operating in lower-tariff jurisdictions such as Vietnam. Mexico has emerged as an unexpected winner. And Beijing’s leverage over rare earth minerals has spurred new efforts to secure alternative supply — an industrial-policy subplot nested inside a tariff story. The second-order reality is more subtle: Trade policy uncertainty also influences the US Treasury market through financial market sentiment. Asset-manager commentary from institutions such as BlackRock and Amundi emphasizes that tariff escalation can increase macroeconomic uncertainty, raise bond market volatility and affect term premia. In this environment, investor demand for duration becomes more cautious, implying an indirect but economically meaningful link between trade policy uncertainty and Treasury yields beyond mechanical supply-and-demand effects. Understanding the Treasury channel requires starting with the obvious, then moving to the consequential. Obviously, tariffs raise revenue. Consequentially, the Treasury market is where America prices its future, and where policy uncertainty becomes a term premium that households and businesses end up paying. CAPTION: Term premium on a ten-year zero-coupon bond. Via Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Tariffs are blunt. When imposed broadly, they raise costs across wide swaths of the economy. A tariff on an imported refrigerator is not just a tax on the foreign producer; it becomes a higher landed cost for the importer, which becomes either a lower profit margin, a higher price for the consumer or a combination of both. Tariffs can also lift the price of domestic substitutes: If imported steel becomes more expensive, domestic steel producers can raise prices too, even if their cost base didn’t change as much. For consumers, the effect shows up in specific aisles: higher prices for furniture, toys and clothing; higher prices for some foods like beef, bananas and coffee; and price pressures that spread unevenly across regions and income groups. For firms, tariffs are less a doctrine than a daily problem to be managed. One small but telling example comes from the trade-law trenches. Dan Harris, a Seattle lawyer who recently began working on tariffs, now advises importers on how to legally reduce duty exposure. The methods are not dramatic — restructuring contracts, separating allowable costs, adjusting declared values within the rules — but they absorb time, capital and attention that would otherwise be spent on production or expansion. This logic repeats across supply chains. A buyer who purchases an injection mold outright avoids embedding that cost in the tariff base of every imported unit. The decision is rational and lawful, yet it underscores a broader pattern: tariffs redirect effort toward avoidance rather than efficiency. The same dynamic appears in Vietnam, where factories have seen sudden order surges as US buyers shift away from China — only to face capacity constraints and renewed uncertainty as tariffs spread. Supply chains adapt, but the adaptation itself is costly, unstable and rarely conducive to long-term productivity growth. The US budget deficit is large by historic standards — 6.2% of GDP in recent readings, roughly double the average pace from 1980 through the pre-Covid-19 pandemic era. Bigger deficits mean more Treasury issuance. If all else is equal, more supply requires either more demand or higher yields to clear the market. Tariff revenue can, in principle, reduce the borrowing needed at the margin. Customs receipts have risen sharply in the high-tariff world, creating what some policymakers see as a fiscal cushion. But the margin matters: If tariffs generate tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars in annual revenue, that is meaningful — yet it is not transformative against structural deficits driven by entitlement spending and debt service costs. The more important issue for markets is not just how much tariff revenue is collected, but how reliable that revenue is. Tariff receipts are unusually exposed to legal risk (court challenges to executive tariff authority), negotiation risk (trade deals that reduce rates or carve out exemptions) and macroeconomic risk (recessions or demand shifts that shrink import volumes). As the Bipartisan Policy Center explains, tariff revenue fluctuates with trade policy, legal outcomes and import behavior, making it an inherently volatile source of funding rather than a stable offset to deficits. That volatility matters because bond markets price expectations and risk, not static arithmetic. Even when tariff revenue rises into the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, it remains small relative to structural deficits driven by entitlement spending and rising interest costs. PBS NewsHour shows that claims of tariffs meaningfully stabilizing the fiscal outlook break down once the scale of federal spending and borrowing is considered. Treasury yields therefore respond less to the existence of tariff revenue than to uncertainty around the longer-term fiscal path. When investors believe deficits may widen — because tariff revenue falls short, spending rises faster than expected or borrowing needs surprise to the upside — they demand higher compensation to hold long-dated debt. Because Treasury yields anchor mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs, that repricing quickly tightens financial conditions across the economy. Tariffs may reduce borrowing at the margin, but by introducing uncertainty into revenue projections, they can also raise risk premia — offsetting part of the perceived fiscal “cushion.” If supply is one side of Treasury pricing, demand is the other — and trade policy influences demand most clearly through foreign investor behavior. Foreign investors hold roughly one-third of the US Treasury market, making their portfolio decisions central to US interest rate dynamics. During periods of tariff escalation, Council on Foreign Relations reports often raise concerns about a potential “sell America” trade, in which foreign official institutions reduce exposure to US assets as trade relationships deteriorate. Historically, however, such fears have rarely materialized in abrupt form. Even during episodes of trade conflict, foreign holdings of Treasuries have often remained stable or increased, reflecting Treasuries’ role as the world’s deepest and most liquid pool of safe collateral. In an environment of global uncertainty, investors typically prioritize liquidity and capital preservation, even when they are uncomfortable with the policy environment generating that uncertainty. The more relevant risk, therefore, is gradual erosion at the margin. Central banks and sovereign wealth funds rarely engage in headline-grabbing sales. Instead, they can diversify quietly over time by allowing maturing Treasury holdings to roll off and reinvesting incrementally elsewhere. Over years, these slow-moving adjustments can meaningfully affect demand conditions at the margin. Trade relationships matter in this process. Reserve composition has historically been influenced by trade networks, with countries tending to hold reserves in the currencies of their primary trading partners. If US protectionism leads to sustained shifts in global trade toward alternative hubs, reserve portfolios may adjust gradually in parallel — without a single triggering event, but with cumulative effects over time. From a market perspective, this distinction holds weight. Treasury demand remains deep and resilient, but it is not immutable. Persistent trade fragmentation can slowly reshape the composition of global reserves, subtly reducing marginal demand for US debt even in the absence of overt selling pressure. Such shifts are easy to overlook in the short term, yet increasingly relevant for long-term rate expectations and term premia. The third channel operates through the macro economy: how tariffs affect inflation and growth, and how those effects are ultimately priced into financial markets. Tariffs tend to raise prices directly by increasing import costs and indirectly by expanding domestic firms’ pricing power. At the same time, they can weigh on growth by raising input costs, disrupting supply chains and provoking retaliation. The resulting combination, higher inflation risk alongside weaker or more uncertain growth, is precisely the configuration that markets associate with elevated macro risk rather than a straightforward demand slowdown. Markets typically express this tension through the yield curve. When investors believe tariffs will push up near-term inflation while clouding the longer-term outlook for growth, productivity and policy stability, longer-dated yields can rise even as growth expectations soften. This reflects the role of term premia. The long end of the curve is not simply a forecast of future short rates; it also embeds compensation for inflation volatility, fiscal uncertainty and policy risk. Recent market behavior reinforces this interpretation. Gold prices have continued to rise even as US yields remain elevated, signaling that higher yields are no longer being read as a clean indicator of safety. Instead, both gold prices and long-term Treasury yields appear to be responding to the same underlying force: a rise in uncertainty and risk premia. When yields increase because investors demand additional compensation for fiscal, geopolitical and policy risk — rather than because growth prospects are improving — the opportunity cost of holding gold becomes less binding. In that sense, gold is not competing with Treasuries on yield, but reacting to doubts about their reliability as the world’s unquestioned safe asset. Geopolitical shocks can accelerate this dynamic. Recent US military actions involving Venezuela briefly pushed gold prices higher, not because they altered global trade flows in a material way, but because they reinforced perceptions of geopolitical fragility layered on top of trade and fiscal uncertainty. Such episodes matter less for their direct economic impact than for what they reveal about market psychology: When policy and geopolitical risks stack, investors demand protection that sits outside sovereign balance sheets. This framework helps explain why JP Morgan’s bullish outlook for gold remains intact even without aggressive Federal Reserve (or Fed) easing. As long as term premia stay elevated, central banks continue to diversify reserves and geopolitical flashpoints remain unresolved, higher US yields do not suppress gold prices. Instead, they reinforce incentives to diversify away from US financial assets altogether. In that sense, gold’s rise toward $5,000 per ounce by late 2026 would not represent an anomaly driven by temporary fear, but a new equilibrium consistent with a more fragmented and risk-conscious global financial system. The implications extend beyond gold. The same uncertainty that lifts demand for alternative stores of value also pushes up term premia in the Treasury market. Long-term yields rise not in anticipation of stronger growth, but as compensation for volatility and unpredictability. That repricing feeds directly into higher borrowing costs across the economy, tightening financial conditions even when the underlying trade shock itself appears manageable. For households and firms, this channel is where trade policy becomes tangible. The ten-year Treasury yield anchors borrowing costs across the economy, including mortgage rates, auto loans and corporate financing. If tariffs contribute to persistently higher term premia, it results in a durable tightening of financial conditions, often outweighing any localized employment gains associated with reshoring or import substitution. Higher yields also feed back into public finances. Rising interest rates increase government debt service costs, tightening the fiscal constraint and reinforcing deficit dynamics over time. What begins as a trade policy shock can therefore reappear as a budgetary one, amplifying longer-term sustainability concerns. Globally, higher US yields tend to transmit tighter financial conditions abroad through capital flows and exchange rate pressures, increasing stress in more vulnerable economies. In that sense, the macro consequences of tariffs are not confined to domestic prices or output; they propagate through global financial channels. For these reasons, Treasury yields are not merely an economic statistic. They are a strategic price — summarizing how trade policy, inflation risk, fiscal dynamics and global financial conditions intersect in real time. The industry stories from the tariff era are familiar by now: lawyers building compliance playbooks, factories booming in Vietnam, Mexico benefiting from trade diversion, grocery importers cancelling shipments, governments accelerating rare earth strategies. Together, they reinforce the comforting saying that trade behaves like water: Block one channel and it simply flows around the obstacle. That metaphor is only half true. Trade does reroute. The world does not stop trading because one country raises tariffs. But rerouting is not costless. It can be inflationary, as supply chains move to higher-cost locations. It can lower productivity by fragmenting production networks built for efficiency. It can shift bargaining power across firms, workers and countries. And most importantly for markets, it raises uncertainty. In financial markets, uncertainty comes with a price. In the Treasury market, it appears as a higher term premium — the extra return investors demand to hold long-dated US debt when the economic and policy outlook feels less predictable. That premium does not stay in the bond market. It is transmitted directly into mortgage rates, corporate financing costs and global capital flows. Because US Treasuries are the benchmark asset of the global financial system, changes in their pricing ripple outward. What begins as a trade policy shock can become a broad tightening of financial conditions, shaping investment decisions at home and exporting stress abroad. This is where trade policy becomes strategic. As economists Emmanuel Farhi and Matteo Maggiori argue in their model of the international monetary system, the global role of US debt rests on credibility — the belief that American public liabilities are safe, liquid and insulated from short-term political shocks. That credibility allows the United States to borrow cheaply and at scale. Paradoxically, a policy framed as strengthening national power, if mishandled, can weaken the foundation of that power. Tariffs may redirect trade. But if they also raise uncertainty and risk premia, they can quietly erode the credibility and attractiveness of US debt — the asset on which American economic power ultimately rests. The trade war has not broken global commerce but redirected it. Firms and countries are adapting quickly — routing around tariffs, shifting production footprints, building new compliance strategies and rebalancing trade relationships. That adaptability is real and will likely persist. But adaptation carries costs, and the most important costs may not appear on a customs receipt. They may appear as a higher term premium in the Treasury market — a subtle repricing of US policy uncertainty that raises borrowing costs for households, businesses and the federal government itself. This year and beyond, the most strategic way to think about tariffs is as a variable that interacts with Treasury supply, Treasury demand and the Fed’s inflation calculus. A trade policy that treats the Treasury market as an afterthought risks turning a tariff shock into a bond shock. In an economy built on the benchmark of US yields, a bond shock becomes everyone’s problem. If “trade is like water,” then Treasuries are the riverbed. Policy can redirect the flow, but if it erodes the bed, the flood will not stay contained.[Lee Thompson-Kolar edited this piece.] The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.

While Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao made the headlines following his interview at the just-concluded World Economic Forum, where he called a Bitcoin supercycle in 2026, his crypto counterpart and Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, has come forward with feedback from the global event held in Davos, Switzerland. In a January 24 post on the social media platform X, Armstrong shared a few key “themes and takeaways” from the latest edition of WEF. After admitting that the conference offered a productive time of meeting people one-on-one, the Coinbase CEO revealed that the major focus was on pushing crypto adoption globally. Starting his list of takeaways, Armstrong highlighted that everyone was talking about tokenization, which is beginning to expand to every asset class in the world. The crypto leader said to expect some major progress in the tokenization sector in 2026, especially as the Fortune 500 business leaders continuously lean in. Secondly, the Coinbase CEO shared that crypto legislation and the CLARITY Act were another area of focus, as the government of the day looks to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. According to Armstrong, most of the bank CEOs he met at the WEF in the past week are actually pro-crypto. Armstrong wrote on X: One CEO of a top 10 global bank told me crypto is their number one priority, and they view it as existential. Furthermore, the Coinbase CEO lauded the Trump administration as the most crypto-forward government in the world at the moment. Armstrong acknowledged their progress with the crypto market structure, stating that these clear rules are crucial for global competitiveness and will put money back in people’s pockets. In what seemed like a cheeky tone, Armstrong mentioned that ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) topics didn’t come up throughout the forum. According to the crypto founder, the week felt productive, as it centered around real, global progress — all thanks to BlackRock CEO and new WEF co-chair Larry Fink. The Coinbase leader touted crypto and AI (artificial intelligence) as the most talked-about technologies in today’s world. Highlighting their compatibility, Armstrong stated that AI agents will eventually default to using stablecoins for payments, as they cannot be KYC’d like human beings. Finally, Armstrong revealed that the Coinbase, Circle, and Bermuda partnership to build a fully on-chain economy was announced at WEF Davos 2026. “Excited to make progress on this and create a compelling case study for other nations to follow,” the crypto CEO concluded. As of this writing, the global cryptocurrency market has a total capitalization of $3.086 trillion, with Bitcoin retaining its spot as the world’s largest cryptocurrency.

January 25, 2026 6:30am by Barry Ritholtz Avert your eyes! My Sunday morning look at incompetency, corruption and policy failures: • I’ve Covered Police Abuse for 20 Years. What ICE Is Doing Is Different. There were no promises of an impartial investigation. There was no regret or remorse. There was little empathy for her family — for her parents, her partner or the children she left behind. From the moment the world learned about her death, the administration pronounced the shooting not only justified but an act of heroism worthy of praise and celebration. (New York Times) • We Are Witnessing the Self-Immolation of a Superpower: With Donald Trump’s actions in Greenland, Minneapolis, and Venezuela, a foreign enemy could not invent a better chain of events to wreck the standing of the United States. (Wired) see also America vs. the World: President Trump wants to return to the 19th century’s international order. He will leave America less prosperous—and the whole world less secure. (The Atlantic) see also This Is the End: Putinism abroad always morphs into Putinism at home. And we chose this path. Why? Because something-something the price of eggs. (The Bulwark) • The rich are powering spending, with the U.S. economy in a danger zone: The health of the economy increasingly depends on rich people spending money, a new analysis of government data finds. That puts the U.S. in a fragile place because consumer spending drives growth — so the entire economy is now relying on a smaller number of people to keep things afloat. (Axios) • When Chicago pawned its parking meters: The deal Chicago made would go down as one of the most notorious miscalculations in the history of city government. It would call into question what the government is even supposed to do, and become a textbook case on the potential pitfalls of privatization.

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $1.33 Billion Outflow In 2026 See-Saw Performance

Time Published: 2026-01-25T06:00:06Z

The Bitcoin Spot ETFs continue to witness a volatile start to 2026, with back-to-back weeks showing sharply contrasting performance. After netting a staggering $1.42 billion in weekly netflows on January 16, market momentum soon swung the opposite way in line with a Bitcoin decline, forcing a net outflow of $1.33 billion over the last week. A similar phenomenon was seen in the first two weeks of the year, after an initial net deposit of $458.77 million by January 2 was followed by a net outflow of $681.01 million by January 9. This investor behavior suggests a highly reactive market with little long-term confidence. In analyzing the most recent wave of withdrawals in the Bitcoin Spot ETF market, data from SoSoValue shows that the fourth trading week of January recorded no single day with a positive netflow. The heaviest outflows totaled $708.71 million on January 21, followed by the smallest daily outflow of $32.11 million on January 22. Looking at individual funds, BlackRock’s IBIT, the market leader, suffered the largest net outflows valued at $537.49 million. As usual, Fidelity’s FBTC ranks a close second with redemptions surpassing deposits by $451.50 million. Other Bitcoin Spot ETFs with heavy net outflows also included Grayscale’s GBTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and Ark Invest’s ARKB, which suffered losses estimated at $172.09 million, $66.25 million, and $76.19 million, respectively. Meanwhile, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC also experienced net outflows between $6 million and $11 million. Notably, Grayscale’s BTC, Invesco’s BTCO, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Hashdex’s DEFI recorded the least activity with zero netflows. At press time, total net assets for the Bitcoin Spot ETFs stand at $115.88 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT accounting for over 54% of these holdings, as the undisputed market leader. Meanwhile, total cumulative net inflow is presently valued at $56.49 billion.

Similar to its Bitcoin counterpart, the BlackRock ETHA also produced the largest net withdrawals valued at $431.50 million. Presently, the total net assets for the Ethereum Spot ETFs are valued at $17.70 billion, representing 4.99% of Ethereum’s market cap. Meanwhile, the cumulative total net inflow is valued at $12.30 billion. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Analyst Says You’re Not Bullish Enough On Ethereum – What Does He Mean?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A growing number of analysts believe Ethereum’s current price action is being misunderstood. Although frustration is growing due to Ethereum’s inability to hold above $3,000, some technical analysts are quick to point out that the structure forming beneath the surface tells a very different story. According to one analyst, the real risk right now is not being bullish on Ethereum and trying to short in anticipation of a downside breakout. The analyst’s technical view on Ethereum is focused less on short-term momentum and more on the structure developing on the chart, which he argues is even clearer than what is currently visible on Bitcoin’s chart. Notably, Ethereum’s price action is carving out a series of higher lows on the daily candlestick timeframe chart to form a tightening triangular pattern since December 2025. This kind of behavior shows that each pullback is being absorbed at progressively higher levels, which is how strong trends reset before continuation. Ethereum needs to avoid a breakdown below key support zones in order for this trend continuation setup to still be valid. According to the analyst, a dip under $2,860 would begin to weaken the pattern, while a close below $2,780 would invalidate the higher-low structure. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,950, which is dangerously close to the lower boundary of this setup. Therefore, some traders will be tempted to short Ethereum at this level, but the analyst called it the dumbest thing to do here. As long as those levels ($2,860 and $2,780) hold, the analyst sees no technical justification for betting against ETH, especially near the lower boundary of the channel where buyers have repeatedly stepped in. If support holds, the next move would be a gradual return to the upper trendline of the channel, which is just below $3,340. A move into that region would bring price back into direct contact with overhead resistance and set the stage for a breakout if buying pressure continues to increase. Ethereum Price Chart. Source: @Tryrexcrypto on X Ethereum is entering 2026 without clear bullish momentum, a reality that has dampened sentiment across the spot and derivatives markets. Spot ETF inflows into Ethereum and Bitcoin have slowed down, and issuers have been highlighted with consistent days of outflows. Nonetheless, major asset managers are still holding huge amounts of Ethereum and are working on diversifying their activities on Ethereum. BlackRock, for example, filed with the SEC in December to launch a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund, a move that will bring in more institutional investors into the Ethereum ecosystem. Speaking of staking, BitMine Technologies recently amped up its ETH staking to over $5.71 billion worth of Ethereum. On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows that the firm has staked an additional 171,264, worth $503.2 million, pushing its total stake to over 1.94 million ETH.

Title: $7 Trillion Player Is Moving Into Bitcoin, Can This Trigger A Surge To $200,000?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/7-trillion-player-eye-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2026-01-25T00:30:06Z

Swiss banking giant UBS, with assets under management (AuM) of up to $7 trillion, is set to launch Bitcoin trading for some of its clients. This comes amid predictions that regulatory clarity and broader adoption could send the BTC price to as high as $200,000. Bloomberg reported that UBS is planning to launch crypto trading for some of its wealth clients, starting with its private bank clients in Switzerland. The bank will reportedly begin by offering these clients the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the same time, the crypto offering could further expand to clients in the Pacific-Asia region and the U.S. The banking giant is currently in discussions with potential partners, and there is no clear timeline for when it could launch Bitcoin and Ethereum trading for clients. This move is said to be partly due to increased demand from wealth clients for crypto exposure. UBS also faces increased competition as other Wall Street giants are working to offer crypto trading. Morgan Stanley, in partnership with Zerohash, announced plans to launch crypto trading in the first half of this year, starting with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The banking giant may soon also be able to offer its crypto products, as it has filed with the SEC to launch spot BTC, ETH, and SOL ETFs. Furthermore, JPMorgan, another of UBS’ competitors, is considering offering crypto trading to institutional clients, although this plan is still in the early stages. The bank already accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral from its clients. Last year, it also filed to offer BTC structured notes that will track the performance of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. Kevin O’Leary predicted that Bitcoin could rally to between $150,000 and $200,000 this year, driven by the passage of the CLARITY Act. His prediction came just as White House Crypto Czar David Sacks said banks would fully enter crypto once the bill passes. As such, there is a possibility that BTC could reach this $200,000 psychological level in anticipation of the amount of new capital that could flow into BTC from these banks once the bill passes. BitMine’s Chairman, Tom Lee, also predicted during a CNBC interview that Bitcoin could reach between $200,000 and $250,000 this year, partly due to growing institutional adoption by Wall Street giants. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that a BTC rally to $200,000 is the “most obvious thing in the world” to him. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $89,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: XRP Ledger Enters The AI Era As Ripple Merges Two Mega Trends

Time Published: 2026-01-24T21:30:04Z
Full Content:
The XRP Ledger has entered a new phase of innovation as Ripple integrates to bring together two of the most powerful technology trends shaping the global economy. Long known for its speed, low transaction costs, and enterprise-grade reliability, the Ledger is now expanding beyond payments to data-driven and automated financial applications. By merging AI with decentralized settlement, Ripple is positioning the Ledger to support smarter workflows and more efficient liquidity management. An analyst known as SMQKE on X has shared a case study of an AI implementation in the cross-border payment, in which Ripple has successfully combined blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness of global transactions. As a leading provider of real-time cross-border payment solutions, Ripple leverages the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain that enables real-time cross-border settlement. Related Reading: Surge In XRP Transactions: 1.45 Million Daily Users Could Signal Price Rally Ahead, Says Expert What sets this integration apart is the use of AI to optimize transaction flows and routing decisions in real time. Ripple AI-powered systems continuously process large volumes of payment data in real time, allowing financial institutions to make dynamic decisions on the most effective payment paths. BlackRock is now using Ripple’s RLUSD as collateral, which is extremely bullish for XRP. JackTheRippler revealed that the altcoin is being positioned as the future infrastructure, which is being built with the potential to hit over $10,000 per coin. With the REAL token launching on January 26th, trillions in global capital could flood into the XRP Ledger. According to JackTheRippler, some projections suggest up to $800 billion could flow into the REAL token on XRP Ledger, potentially sparking a powerful supply shock. The rise of the phoenix XRP is here. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull highlighted that Caroline Pham isn’t just another name in crypto. Pham played a role in pushing utility regulation into the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), helping shift policy toward real-world use cases. Currently, she is at MoonPlay and posting about the phoenix on X. Related Reading: How Donald Trump’s Latest Crypto Move Will Boost Demand For XRP Years ago, Brad Garlinghouse drew that same phoenix, and it became one of the biggest pieces of XRP lore. While the market chased narratives, Ripple has been building institutional-grade crypto products for years. Meanwhile, the token, RLUSD, and the XRP Ledger are now live operating, and recognized among the most compliant blockchain assets in the crypto world. This is the same asset that survived the SEC’s biggest regulatory battles in crypto history, and is now on the other side with legal clarity, growing integration, and increasing relevance to government infrastructure in its favor. Xfinancebull concluded that Caroline has helped clear the regulatory path, Brad and Ripple built what actually runs on that path, and they have been aligning all along, which is how the real adoption happens.

Title: Bitcoin price to hit $180,000 if it overcomes this hurdle, analyst says
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/bitcoin-to-180000-if-one-thing-does-not-happen/
Time Published: 2026-01-24T17:51:24Z

About us Copy link Fears of quantum computing breaking Bitcoin’s encryption continue to plague Bitcoin investors. In fact, Eliezer Ndinga, global head of research at 21Shares, reckons that unless developers address the concern, Bitcoin won’t enjoy a rally anytime soon. But if developers act? It’s clear, blue skies. “If we get past the quantum threat, then Bitcoin can go to $180,000,” Ndinga told DL News. For now, however, “it’s a cloud in the air.” Every day more market watchers are cropping up and labelling quantum computing Bitcoin’s most pressing threat. Adding to Ndinga, Sergio Ermotti, CEO of Swiss investment bank UBS, said that Bitcoin needs to prove itself able to overcome quantum computing. Ray Dalio and BlackRock have made similar comments. They aren’t the only ones, however. Just last week, Christopher Wood, of Jefferies Group, removed Bitcoin from his long-standing portfolio recommendation. Instead, he’s urging investors to double down on gold and gold-mining stocks. “In the world of institutional allocation, virtually everyone I have talked to is quietly concerned about Bitcoin,” Nic Carter, a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, previously told DL News. Of late, Bitcoin developers and the broader community are finding themselves fighting over a vulnerability that hadn’t been taken seriously. Why are investors so fearful now? Because advances in quantum computing are coming at a rapid pace, and if the technology falls into the wrong hands, it could potentially break Bitcoin’s entire encryption model. Researchers at Chaincode Labs discovered that 20% to 50% of all Bitcoin could be stolen by actors using quantum computers. We’re talking about $400 billion to $900 billion that could be lost — including Satoshi Nakamoto’s alleged 1 million Bitcoin stash. In an interview with DL News, the first thing that Ndinga said was that quantum computing is a real threat. “The challenge is that we’re drowning in information but starving for a reason,” Ndinga said. “Crypto has to get past its teenage years and address this seriously.” When asked to rate the quantum threat on a scale of one to ten, Ndinga broke it down into two dimensions: timing and magnitude. “On magnitude, you’re talking about potentially 50% of all Bitcoin at risk,” he said. “On timing, it’s harder to pin down. We could be talking about a couple of years or a couple of decades.” That uncertainty is exactly what’s creating headwinds for institutional investors, according to Ndinga. And unless he acknowledges the vulnerability, he’ll lose credibility among investors. “I won’t be taken seriously if I don’t talk about quantum computing,” he said. While institutional concern mounts, there are Bitcoin developers working on solutions — although progress is slow. One of the proposals is BIP 360, authored by developers Hunter Beast and Ethan Heilman, and podcaster Isabel Foxen Duke. “Nearly everyone has been very grateful that we are taking the problem seriously,” Beast told DL News. “Our whole motto is: prepared, not scared.” Rather than forcing a sudden network-wide upgrade, BIP 360 would introduce a new type of Bitcoin address that allows users to voluntarily move funds into quantum-resistant protections, reducing long-term exposure without breaking existing wallets, the Lightning Network, or Layer-2 systems. BIP 360 is now into its second year of development, and according to Beast, it remains one of the most widely-discussed draft BIPs in Bitcoin’s history. That means little, however, since the notoriously lethargic Bitcoin Investment Proposal process means activation could still be years away. Beast acknowledged the urgency but cautioned against rushing. “We must remain thoughtful and diligent, while not rushing a half-baked solution,” he said. “Fortunately, the general consensus is that we still have time.” Pedro Solimano is a markets correspondent based in Buenos Aires.

Blade’s return following a five-week layoff is one of just three changes made by head coach Stuart Lancaster. Out-half Josh Ioane is named outside Blade, while Dylan Tierney-Martin comes in at hooker in place of the injured Dave Heffernan. Connacht have over 850 caps worth of experience to call upon from the bench with Bundee Aki, Jack Carty and Denis Buckley all named among the replacements. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO Meanwhile, Niall Smyth is set to make his Leinster debut as Leo Cullen navigates a tricky period of injuries among his tightheads. Smyth, who won a Leinster Schools Senior Cup with Blackrock in 2024, partners Jack Boyle and Gus McCarthy in the front row. Harry Byrne starts at out-half once again, while captain Caelan Doris is set to win his 100th Leinster cap. 15. Sam Gilbert 14. Shane Jennings 13. Harry West 12. Cathal Forde 11. Finn Treacy 10.

The last time the sides met, only last month, Leinster were runaway winners in the end — but Connacht were excellent in the first half of that game at the Aviva. Imbued with home advantage and the sense of occasion in a new-look Dexcom Stadium, let’s see if this one is more competitive for 80. Nick Elliott / INPHO Nick Elliott / INPHO / INPHO Fantastic performance on the pitch pre-game, with all 26 Connacht clubs represented. Ballina man Caelan Doris leads Leinster onto the pitch to a fairly warm reception. And now here come Connacht to some serious noise! Dexcom Stadium is HOPPING. And it looks absolutely fantastic. Here we go! 1′ – CON 0-0 LEIN: Harry Byrne gets us underway at The Sportsground! Taken by Cathal Forde and Connacht exit through Caolin Blade. A little bit of argy-bargy before the first lineout. Brilliant! 6′ – CON 0-0 LEIN: Billy Bohan wins a scrum pen on Leinster debutant Niall Smyth and Connacht get a lineout on the Leinster 22′, but Josh Murphy spills it forward at the front. Leinster exit through Fintan Gunne, who booms it to touch on halfway. Then a half-break by Gus McCarthy who snatches one from Blade’s hands — and Leinster eventually win a penalty deep in Connacht territory as they impede Leinster at lineout time. 8′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! Fintan Gunne! The scrum-half crashes over after a sharp Leinster start in attack. Byrne converts for 7-0, and there’s a further double blow for Connacht: Cathal Forde and Sam Illo are gone off, replaced by Bundee Aki Jack Aungier respectively. Not sure if either of those were HIAS — will try to keep you posted. 11′ – TRY FOR CONNACHT! Dylan Tierney-Martin! Connacht respond immediately! Ferocious Leinster defence, phase after phase, but Tierney-Martin burrows over with a brilliant close-range finish. That’s a serious reaction by the hosts, and Sam Gilbert chips over the afters. He’s well over 90% from the tee since arriving at Connacht — I think he’s missed only one kick?! Seven each in Galway! 15′ – CON 7-7 LEIN: First chorus of ‘The Fields’ as Eoghan Cross sets up a scrum after some brilliant Connacht defence forced a Leinster error on midfield. And in the game’s second scrum, Connacht win their second scrum penalty. This time it’s Sam Illo on Jack Boyle. Connacht lineout outside the Leinster 22′. 16′ – CON 7-7 LEIN: Alex Soroka gets hands on Connacht ball in a ruck just outside the Leinster 22′ and referee Cross pings Connacht for side entry. Leinster lineout just inside the Connacht half — but Doris knocks it on on halfway. 20′ – CON 7-7 LEIN:Play stopped with Jack Boyle down, appearing to hold his calf. Andy Farrell will be holding his breath here — but Ireland’s loosehead injury crisis looks set to deepen. Stretcher coming on. Ah, Jeayyysus. Poor Boyle! That’s a massive blow to Ireland ahead of the Six Nations. 23′ – CON 7-7 LEIN: Boyle is replaced by Jerry Cahir. And Billy Bohan immediately wins another penalty on Smyth. Meanwhile, Sam Illo and Cathal Forde are both back on the field having passed their HIAs. Connacht back to their starting side. The hosts then win a further penalty as Lowe infringes in a ruck. Gilbert chips over three points from close range and Connacht lead for the first time! 26′ – CON 10-7 LEIN: Leinster attempting to play with tempo but another attack in the Connacht half breaks down as Gunne tries to feed the intended decoy in Doris but passes it forward. Leinster win a scrum pen, though, as Illo is pinged for not driving straight. Harry Byrne does what Gilbert did seconds earlier and pops over the easy three points. 29′ – CON 10-10 LEIN: A madcap passage of play leads to a Gunne chip through, which dribbles into touch deep inside the Connacht 22′. Connacht lose their second straight lineout — and Leinster are knocking on the door! Penalty advantage to the visitors also. 31′ – CON 10-10 LEIN: Connacht scramble well but concede two penalties in the process. Leinster will take three points once more from close range — surprising considering Connacht are on an official warning now. 32′ – CON 10-13 LEIN: Shane Jennings wins the restart — he’s been excellent in the air once again — and Connacht wind up earning a penalty outside the Leinster 22′ as Will Connors impedes Blade on the floor at the base of a ruck. Connacht will take a shot at goal, this one from left of centre. And Sam Gilbert does what Sam Gilbert does: we’re level once more! 36′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Cian Prendergast catches Snyman with a seatbelt tackle just inside the Connacht 10′. Advantage comes to nothing and Leinster go to touch — lineout just inside the home 22′. 37′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Sean Jansen melts Gus McCarthy off the Leinster lineout and forces the knock-on. Dexcom Stadium goes nuts! What a hit. It was borderline high but the TMO has checked it in the background and can’t find any head contact. Connacht scrum inside their own 22′. Terrifically enjoyable half if far from free-flowing! Vicious, pulsating stuff. Ireland will be sweating after Jack Boyle was stretchered off for the visitors. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO Connacht on top in the scrum, where they lead 3-1 on penalties. But where it matters, it’s 13-13 following first-half tries by Fintan Gunne and Dylan Tierney-Martin, with the rest of the points coming from the respective boots of Harry Byrne and Sam Gilbert. Nick Elliott / INPHO Nick Elliott / INPHO / INPHO Catch you shortly! 41′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Back underway at Dexcom! A big 40 minutes ahead on what’s been a superb occasion so far. 45′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: A really open, loose start to the second half! Connacht have a scrum well inside the Leinster half after Ciarán Frawley knocked on during an attempted rip. The hosts almost got around the Leinster blitz there — but still savage defence by the eastern province! Alex Soroka, meanwhile, looks like he’s going off for a HIA. 47′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Superb carry by Cathal Forde and he makes serious yardage deep into the Leinster 22′! Connacht go very close and Leinster concede the pen. Advantage comes to nothing, so Connacht go again with the tap. Paul Boyle reaches for the line but Leinster hold him up! Unreal defence by debutant Niall Smyth who had a tough first half! 48′ – TRY FOR CONNACHT! Harry West! What a score! Magic, magic, magic Connacht! The outstanding Sean Jansen and Finn Treacy combine and West collects the offload on the inside to score, pretty much under the sticks. Handbags afterwards and officials getting involved but the try will be good! Gilbert converts and Connacht lead! 51′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Sublime line-break by Fintan Gunne and he finds Snyman in support! The huge lock takes it close but Cian Prendergast wins the jackal penalty on the scramble and The Sportsground erupts again. What a piece of attack and defence by each side. This is cracker. 54′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Leinster have a penalty advantage inside the Connacht half — and now a penalty as Sam Gilbert and co. stop James Lowe and Ciarán Frawley down Leinster’s left. There’ll be a Leinster lineout deep in Connacht territory shortly, but Rónan Kelleher is just getting a bit of treatment. He looks alright. 56′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Connacht defend their line! Sean Jansen — man of the match by a wide margin to this point — wallops Scott Penny in contact and forces another knock-on. Connacht will get the scrum on their own 5′. The Fields of Athenry reverberates around Dexcom once again. 57′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Leinster win the scrum penalty on the Connacht 5′! 57′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! RG Snyman! The visitors tap and go and after a first effort by Charlie Tector, RG Snyman breaches the whitewash and dots down! Harry Byrne brings us level again. What a final quarter we have in store. 59′ – CON 20-20 LEIN: Leinster’s tempo is starting to give Connacht big problems. 60′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! Charlie Tector! That’s inexcusable defence by Connacht, to be honest. Off first phase, Tector runs through Tierney-Martin and Aungier and goes right under the sticks from just outside the Connacht 22′. Leinster have turned this game on its head: they lead 27-20! 64′ – CON 20-27 LEIN: Connacht win a scrum pen near halfway. Jack Carty gives them a lineout up towards the Leinster 22′. 66′ – CON 20-27 LEIN: Another Connacht pen just outside the 22′ — Tector not rolling away — and Connacht take the three points. Gilbert brings the gap down to four as the rain begins to descend from the heavens over Galway again. 69′ – CON 23-27 LEIN: Nice grubber down the left by James Lowe and Leinster get a five-metre scrum after an error in judgement by Finn Treacy! The Connacht wing clips the ball with his instep ahead of the try-line and then dots it down. Leinster can kill it here. 70′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! Ciarán Frawley against his future employers! That should do it! Leinster win a penalty advantage and eventually cross in the left-hand corner through the Connacht-bound Frawley, who just about gathers Harry Byrne’s delayed pass to score. Byrne converts from the left-hand touchline and Leinster lead by 11 with just under 10 minutes to go. That’s also the bonus point secured by Leinster. 72′ – CON 23-34 LEIN: Luke McGrath pins Connacht back with a beautiful box-kick over the top which rolls into touch near the Connacht 5′. Leinster have turned the screw here. That’ll do it: a special occasion for Connacht but they just about ran out of gas and, unfortunately for them, leave with nothing. Leinster take maximum points after another second-half surge against the Westerners, but that was a super game. Thanks for joining us. Keep an eye on The 42 for Murray Kinsella’s report and reaction.

Title: Aave Price Structure Hinges On Crucial $145 Level — Here’s How

As the crypto market suffered a widespread decline, Aave (AAVE) prices dipped by nearly 10%, reaching a local bottom around $153. Presently, the altcoin is trading within a range of $155-$160, but an emerging chart pattern indicates an impending price breakout. In an X post on January 23, popular market expert Ali Martinez shares an insightful analysis of the AAVEUSD 4-hour chart, showing the altcoin is approaching a critical market juncture. Notably, a key support zone of $144 sits at the base of a broader descending structure that has defined AAVE’s price action since last year. Martinez’s analysis shows that AAVE is trading within a falling wedge formation, characterized by a series of lower highs capped by a descending trendline and relatively stable support near the $145 region. This price formation often represents a period of consolidation following sustained downside pressure, as sellers gradually lose momentum while buyers defend a key floor. For context, since topping out above the $350 level earlier in the cycle, AAVE has experienced a steady corrective move, with price stepping down through multiple horizontal levels near $240, $200, and $162. The loss of these zones shifted short-term momentum firmly in favor of sellers, making the current support range even more important. At present, AAVE is trading in the mid $150s, leaving limited room before a direct retest of the $144.93 support. However, this level has already acted as a demand zone multiple times during the current downtrend, reinforcing its significance. According to Martinez’s analysis, a clean break below $145 could force an accelerated downside move, with the next major support area set around $125. In that scenario, price acceptance below the wedge structure would likely confirm a continuation of the broader bearish trend. Conversely, holding the $145 support may provide the conditions for a technical rebound. A successful defense of this level, combined with a break above the descending trendline, could allow AAVE to reclaim higher resistance zones around $162 and potentially $200 over time. While such a move would not immediately invalidate the larger corrective structure, it would suggest improving market balance and decreased selling pressure. At press time, Aave trades at $156.99, reflecting a decline of 0.76% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is up by 6.07% and valued at $362.59 million. With price compressing toward the apex of the falling wedge, traders should expect increased volatility in the coming AAVE trading sessions. For now, the price moves at $144.93 as a pivotal inflection point for determining the next directional move.

Title: A Ghost is Haunting Davos! The WEF Summit
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/ghost-haunting-davos/5913196
Time Published: 2026-01-24T12:52:19Z

The 2026 Davos Summit of the World Economic Forum (WEF) will undoubtedly go down in history. Just as the fall of the Berlin Wall symbolized the end of the First Cold War with the victory of the United States, I believe the Davos Summit, which began on Monday, is declaring the end of American hegemony. To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Español, Русский, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. The World Economic Forum shouldn’t be taken lightly. Founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a student of Kissinger who was a former lawyer for Rockefeller, this foundation has been renowned for shaping the course of the capitalist world for 50 years. Note: The WEF’s founding date coincides with the year the US dollar was removed from the gold standard. Image: Brende in 2023 (Public Domain) At this year’s summit, Borge Brende, a low-profile Norwegian right-wing politician who has taken over the seat of the now-retired Klaus Schwab, is attempting to keep the foundation afloat; Even if he says, “The World Economic Forum isn’t about responding to current events. It’s about orchestrating the right conditions to move forward,” it’s all in vain. There’s great chaos at the top level. The culprit is Emperor Trump, who, like a bull in a china shop, is destroying everything in the Western establishment. Trump is actually feigning madness, but he knows perfectly well that his country is in a terrible situation. Its total debt has reached $40 trillion, and for the first time in history, its annual interest payments exceed its military spending by one trillion dollars. To address this, Trump has increased the Pentagon budget to $1.5 trillion by 2026. What Trump is doing, continuing with “Iran, Venezuela, Mexico, Greenland, Canada,” is like a powerful opponent overturning the table after losing the game. In my opinion, Trump is playing the role of a madman to prevent the inevitable collapse of the US. He probably doesn’t need to act that much, given his nature. As the spoiled and useless child of a wealthy contractor whose father was a Jewish lobbyist, nonsense and perversion are in his blood. But the bitter truth is emerging at the annual meeting of finance capital in Davos. The Western world is accepting defeat. For example, what did Larry Fink, the famous CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, say? “Global elites have lost the public’s trust and are currently facing ‘deep institutional distrust.’ If the WEF wants to be useful in the future, it must regain that trust.” Fink is referring to the Plandemic and the Great Reset scenarios. And of course, he’s describing the horrific income inequality in the world and the savagery of neoliberalism, or finance capital, that ran rampant after 1980. He’s practically confessing the sins of capitalism’s as a grey cardinal! “Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the greatest wealth in history has been created, but this money has gone into the pockets of a tiny minority, enough to disrupt social peace. No society can sustain such an unjust distribution for long; eventually, the system will crack.” The End of White-Collar Workers: “Just as globalization hit the factory worker, Artificial Intelligence will now do the same to office workers, lawyers, and analysts. I’m not talking about the future, I’m talking about today!” You’d think he was about to sing the international anthem! But Fink, burning with rage as gold, silver, and copper soared while stock markets and the dollar crashed, wasn’t alone. The announcement of the collapse of the West’s “rules-based order” was made by the US’s immediate neighbor. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered a speech that was at least as important, perhaps even more so, than Fink’s: “We knew the narrative of a rules-based international order was a lie. We knew that the most powerful actors would exempt themselves when it suited them. But this construct was convenient.” Carney also admitted that he had accepted American hegemony because it suited the purposes of his government. But now the system had broken down. The former central banker-turned-prime minister alluded to Vaclav Havel’s famous story of the greengrocer. In the story, a greengrocer in the Soviet Union hangs a sign in his shop that reads “Workers of the world unite,” even though he doesn’t believe it. But one day he decides not to conform and takes it down; this spreads, and communism collapses! “This fiction was useful. That’s why we put the sign up in the window. We are not in a transition period, but in the midst of a rupture. We are aware of what is happening and we are determined to act accordingly. We know that a rupture requires more than just conformity. It requires honestly accepting the world as it is. We are taking the sign down.” This was a response to Trump’s “initiation of illegality” and the very announcement of the specter haunting Davos: the collective acceptance by the West of the end of US hegemony. Like Fink and Carney, Belgian Prime Minister (right wing-conservative) Bart De Wever stated: “On Wednesday, together with King Philippe of Belgium, we will meet with Trump. But this will have a different character than we planned. The message we will probably have to give is: You are crossing red lines here. Either we stand together or we are divided; if we are divided, it will be the end of 80 years of Atlanticism, a real era will close. And you know, as Gramsci said: “While the old is dying, the new is not yet born, now is the time of monsters. It is up to him (Trump) to decide whether he will be a monster or not, yes or no?” The Italian communist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, like the famous Czech anti-communist Vaclav Havel, was declaring the end of the Second Cold War and the defeat of the US long after his death (through the mouths of the most ardent capitalists). While all this was happening, the EU announced it was canceling its trade agreement with the US. The US was offering Denmark $700 billion to buy Greenland (including a one-time payment of one million dollars to each Greenland citizen to accept US citizenship), and Iran was preparing for what was likely an imminent US-Israeli attack. At Davos, the club of the wealthy where the future of the world and capitalism was discussed, the familiar rhetoric of global warming was also shelved. In fact, it would become clear at this summit that the chemicals sprayed into the air under the pretext of global warming were not a conspiracy theory. Journalist James O’Keefe secretly filmed at the World Economic Forum, recording elites confessing to things long dismissed as “conspiracy theories.” World Economic Forum in casual conversations with O’Keefe, the elite openly admitted that chemicals were being sprayed into the atmosphere and even agricultural areas to cool the planet. One company executive acknowledged that many of these operations were being carried out quietly and behind closed doors by the US military; “A large part of the work is actually done by the (US) military. They do it constantly, and it’s actually quite cheap.” Those lines we saw in the sky were indeed chemicals dropped from planes! In short, the end of Pax Americana was announced in Davos, and the ghost of reality began to howl in the Swiss Alps. The panic among the bosses shows that the world has now reached a turning point. Whether good or bad… Note: Meanwhile, China and Russia seem to be enjoying the taste of winning without doing much. What the Chinese delegation said in Davos suggests that Western leaders (like Mark Carney) will soon be heading to China. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng said in Davos: “The world cannot return to the law of the jungle where the strong prey on the weak.” “China is ready to be not only the world’s factory, but also the world’s market,” he said. However, when Trump arrived in Davos, Switzerland, there was no one to greet him. There was no official welcome. No delegation was present. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Every time Reed publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Citi has largely put the dog days of its multiyear transformation behind it, and CEO Jane Fraser signaled a shift from remediation to competition. The next step is cultural. In a memo to employees last week, Fraser told Citi's more than 200,000 workers that "the bar is raised" and that it was time to ditch bad habits. When Fraser took over as Citi's chief executive in 2021, the bank was under intense scrutiny — bogged down by regulatory pressure, dated and weak technology, and investor doubts about whether it could still compete with Wall Street's most established names. Five years in, the stock is up about 40% over the past year and more than 80% over the past five — signs that investors are increasingly confident the firm has moved past its worst problems. Central to the bank's efforts are three executives she hired to run businesses that are key to Citi's growth: investment banking, wealth management, and technology. Brian Mulberry, a senior client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, offered a sports analogy. "If Jane Fraser is the quarterback, you need really strong skill positions — the receivers and running backs — to carry the ball over the goal line. These are the five-star recruits you'd want on that team," he told Business Insider. "They're now on offense." Corporate dealmaker Viswas Raghavan has earned an industry reputation for pushing his people. Andy Sieg is the politically savvy denizen of the white-glove world of money management. And Tim Ryan is the steady hand from consulting, tasked with reinventing the bank's technology backbone. Their rise has fueled some quiet succession chatter, though Fraser has given no indication she is considering stepping aside anytime soon. As her no-nonsense year takes shape, here is how those three executives have fared in reshaping their units and how they're helping enforce her mandate. Title: Executive Vice Chairman and Head of Banking Since Viswas "Vis" Raghavan took over Citi's investment banking business in June 2024, the unit is showing clear signs of momentum. Investment banking fees rose 35% year over year in 2025, with M&A revenues jumping 84%, according to Citi's fourth-quarter results. Fraser highlighted some of the bank's most prominent client wins during the earnings call, including mandate work for Boeing, Pfizer, Nippon Steel, Johnson & Johnson, and private-equity firms Blackstone and TPG. Last year, Citi advised on Nippon Steel's roughly $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel, and on Charter Communications' announced nearly $35 billion combination with Cox Communications. As head of banking, he oversees investment banking, corporate banking, and commercial banking — a sprawling remit that puts him at the vanguard of many of Citi's most financially important relationships. Raghavan is known in the industry for his high expectations. A 25-year JPMorgan veteran, Raghavan ran the firm's league table-topping investment banking franchise and oversaw its business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Landing Raghavan's star power was a boon for Citi, Mulberry said. "It absolutely matters who is backing the deal. Having that specific hire, with the confidence he brings" in the eyes of the kinds of clients Citi wants, is a triumph for the bank, he added. His credibility has helped him rebuild Citi's senior dealmaking ranks from rivals — especially JPMorgan. He's lured JPMorgan bankers Drago Rajkovic and Guillermo Baygual to serve as global co-heads of M&A at Citi. Former Goldman Sachs partner David Friedland joined Citi last summer as co-head of North America investment banking. And the Wall Street Journal reported this week that former JPMorgan banker Alex Berkett, an ex-Paramount executive, would join to build Citi's media business. Title: Head of Wealth In a note sent to employees of his division following earnings results last week, Andy Sieg said key focuses for the division would include leading the way in wealth advisory, deepening the integration of wealth offerings through the US retail bank, and incorporating AI into regular, daily workflows. He shared a chart showing Citi Wealth revenue up 22% in two years. And he doubled down on Fraser's empathic message. "For 2026, the bar has been raised," he wrote in the memo, which was viewed by Business Insider and confirmed by a Citi spokesperson. "Jane speaks of scale for the bank; it will be our watchword as well. Strong, sustained organic growth will be ours if we double down on a set of strategic priorities," including fomenting "a culture of ownership, accountability, and innovation," he added. Sieg joined Citi in late 2023 to fix its wealth business. Sieg previously oversaw roughly 25,000 employees at Bank of America, where he had risen to the role of president of Merrill Wealth Management. The bank said wealth revenue grew 14% in 2025, according to fourth-quarter earnings. Mulberry said Citi could rebuild wealth gradually over time, but argued that Sieg's background speeds things up. "I think on the wealth management side, there's a fair argument you could do that organically," he said, "but it helps to have a weighty name that's been successful in gathering assets at a place like Merrill Lynch." Sieg has moved away from the single global private-bank head structure and made targeted hires, including former BlackRock portfolio manager Kate Moore to run the chief investment office and ex-Morgan Stanley executive Dawn Nordberg to deepen ties between wealth and banking. Citi has also added senior private bankers like Clinton Warren, a former JPMorgan private banker, to lead teams in the central US. He has also had notable exits, including longtime private bank chief Ida Liu, who left in early 2025; and Valentín Valderrábano, chief operating officer for global wealth, whose exit was announced this month. He is following Liu to her new employer, HSBC. It's also been reported that Sieg was the subject of an internal investigation into his conduct. A Financial Times report from October raised some questions about how the probe was conducted, but Citi told the FT that it approaches "all internal complaints appropriately by conducting unbiased, thorough, and complete investigations", and noted a "commitment to a workplace where everyone is treated fairly and has equal opportunity to succeed." Title: Head of Technology and Business Enablement Citi is pushing deep into artificial intelligence as it moves out of its long-running cleanup phase. More than 80% of Citi's transformation programs are now at or close to their target state, Fraser said on the latest earnings call. That progress has enabled the bank to shift its focus toward growth and innovation. That next phase is being largely driven by Tim Ryan, who joined Citigroup in 2024 after spending nearly two decades at PwC, most recently as the consulting firm's US chair. Fraser tapped him to run technology and business enablement as Citi worked to move past years repairing outdated systems and addressing regulatory shortcomings. Early on, he was tasked with turning around Citi's substandard data management systems. Last summer, he was named one of the senior executives overseeing Citi's AI strategy. Citi has begun embedding artificial intelligence into core processes across the firm — from know-your-customer reviews to loan underwriting — starting with more than 50 of its largest and most complex workflows. Employees in 84 countries have already used the bank's proprietary AI tools tens of millions of times with adoption exceeding 70% across the workflow. According to the bank's third-quarter earnings report last year, Citi used generative AI to conduct one million automated code reviews, saving approximately 100,000 hours per week across its developer population. In the fall, Ryan wrote on LinkedIn that Citi had rolled out prompt training to help workers get more out of the tech, and cheered the bank's plans to rev the engine on agentic AI. But competition is rife. The broader finance industry is being rapidly reshaped by AI, with powerhouse firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan spending billions to supercharge their workforces. The fight to secure top AI talent has intensified. Citi has spent years defined by baggage from its past that it's been under pressure to fix. Now, it has the rare chance to define what it wants to be. Fraser wants her staff to know there's no time to lose. She concluded her memo with a clear directive: "Let's get it done." Jump to

It’s a story so good it could have been a screenplay. In 2000, Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph sat down across from John Antioco, then CEO of video rental giant Blockbuster, and pitched him on acquiring their still unprofitable DVD-by-mail startup, Netflix, which at the time had around 300,000 subscribers. But when they told him their price—$50 million and the chance to develop and run Blockbuster’s online rental business—Antioco balked. By 2010, Blockbuster had filed for bankruptcy, and Netflix had stormed Hollywood with its entertainment streaming service.

Title: Take a look at the fanciest private jets and government aircraft that took the rich and powerful to Davos

Every time Pete publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people traveled to Switzerland this week, to attend the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos. That meant some of the world's fanciest aircraft descended on nearby airports, too. Business Insider has been tracking the private jets and government aircraft that arrived there this week. On Monday alone, there were around 160 private jet arrivals from over 40 countries spread across five continents. The majority appeared to land at Zurich Airport, which is 75 miles from Davos. In a press release, the airport said it expected more than 1,000 extra takeoffs and landings due to the WEF. Others landed at Friedrichshafen, over the border with Germany, or St Gallen, also near Lake Constance. From Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 to Air Force One, here's some of the most impressive aircraft. On Monday, 31 of the 157 private jet arrivals were Gulfstream G650s. Throughout the week in Switzerland, data from JetSpy showed such planes belonging to: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Blackstone, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase. Gulfstream jets are known for their large, circular windows, which give high-flyers great views. Business jets can be configured in different ways depending on what the customer wants. Sometimes, they have double beds and an on-board shower. It's more likely that a billionaire flying solo would choose that, whereas a company would probably prefer more seats. These are pretty rare to see since they're so spacious compared to other business jets. A Boeing Business Jet version of the 737 Max costs about $100 million. Flight-tracking data showed a private 737 that flew from Dubai to Zurich on Sunday. Another one from Dubai went to Friedrichshafen, a lakeside German city just over the Swiss border, on Tuesday. Some governments also use the 737 to transport political leaders. In Switzerland this week, flight-tracking data showed such planes belonging to the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands. Due to its size, the Boeing 737 business jet is even more customizable than Gulfstream or Bombardier aircraft. Sometimes they are laid out like a typical airliner, with six seats abreast. But there is room for all sorts of amenities, too. Business Insider toured one in 2024, which had an on-board bar, two double bedrooms, and two showers. The first Gulfstream G800 was only delivered last August, so they're still relatively rare to see. It costs about $70 million to buy one. A handful of them flew into Swiss airports this week. JetSpy data shows they included ones owned by Visa, Qualcomm, and Pfizer. It's big enough to have room for four living areas on board. Passengers also shouldn't feel as fatigued as flying commercial, because the G800's cabin pressure makes it feel like the altitude is 2,480 feet. On the newest airliners, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the cabin altitude is more like 6,000 feet. According to data from JetSpy, the above jet is owned by Robert F. Smith, the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners. The private equity firm's logo is on the tail. Flight-tracking data shows this Global 7500 flew from Atlanta to Zurich, about 75 miles from Davos, last Saturday. JetSpy data showed that other Bombardier plans that landed in Switzerland this week include ones owned by: Avram Glazer, the Manchester United co-owner; Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East; and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma. This is the interior of a Global 7500 owned by VistaJet, a private charter firm that operates the most such jets. Several of its planes touched down in Switzerland during the week of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. Emmanuel Macron appeared to arrive in Davos on Tuesday. That morning, two French government jets — a Dassault Falcon 7X and a smaller Falcon 900 — flew to Zurich from an air base near Paris. However, it appears he left before Trump's speech. Even the president couldn't help compliment Macron's eyewear, which spawned plenty of memes and jokes online. "Those beautiful sunglasses," Trump said. "What the hell happened?" Macron has worn them in public in recent days due to an eye problem. A Dassault Falcon 8X arrived in Zurich from Scottsdale, Arizona, on Tuesday, flight-tracking data showed. It costs about $60 million to buy a new one, or $14,000 an hour to charter. More popular than the Falcon 8X in Switzerland this week was the smaller Falcon 2000 jet. Trump was supposed to fly to Zurich aboard the usual presidential jet, a Boeing VC-25A. It's a militarized version of the Boeing 747 airliner. However, 30 minutes into his journey, the plane U-turned and went back to Joint Base Andrews. He instead flew on a Boeing C-32A. It's not quite as fancy and is usually used as the Vice President's Air Force Two. Any plane carrying the president is designated as Air Force One while he is on it. This week served as a reminder of Trump's impatience with Boeing over delays in building the new Air Force One. His press secretary took the opportunity to mention the 747 that he was gifted by Qatar. That plane is currently undergoing modifications and refitting by the Air Force. The Sikorsky VH-60N White Hawk flew in a convoy of at least five helicopters. They took about 40 minutes to fly from Zurich Airport to Davos on Wednesday. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has had a busy start to the year. He flew on a military version of the Airbus A330. It first arrived in Beijing on January 14, flew to Doha a few days later, and then to Zurich on Monday. Carney won plenty of attention for his speech in Davos about the change in world politics since Trump's election. "We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition," he said. The above Azerbaijani private jet landed in Zurich on Tuesday. The Argentine government's Boeing 757 jet, registered as "ARG-01," arrived in Zurich on Tuesday. Flight-tracking data showed it departed Buenos Aires on Monday evening, then stopped in the Canary Islands, before heading to Switzerland. The journey took about 15 hours. Jump to

Title: Ethereum Outlook Splits Wall Street as BlackRock Bets on Tokenization While JPMorgan Remains Cautious
URL: https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-outlook-splits-wall-street-as-blackrock-bets-on-tokenization-while-jpmorgan-remains-cautious/
Time Published: 2026-01-24T08:11:58Z
Full Content:
Ethereum’s 2026 outlook appears to have split Wall Street giants BlackRock and JPMorgan. While the $14 trillion asset manager BlackRock notes that tokenization might benefit the network, JPMorgan notes that Ethereum is still not out of the woods yet. The diverging opinions come amid a surge in network activity, despite the ETH price stalling amid a bearish trend across the broader market. Earlier this week, BlackRock stated that Ethereum is set to dominate the tokenization industry. The asset manager noted that the network could emerge as the gateway for traditional companies looking to dip their toes into blockchain. According to the head of equity ETFs at the asset management firm, Jay Jacobs, if the number of firms using the Ethereum network to tokenize real-world assets increases, ETH could be on a bullish trajectory. BlackRock also notes that as demand for tokenization increases, trading activity on the network will increase, and so will the issuance of various assets, such as stablecoins. The report comes nearly two years after the asset manager launched its first tokenized fund on Ethereum, known as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The fund currently has a stablecoin market cap of more than $221 billion. Despite BlackRock’s bullish take, the firm’s iShares Ethereum Trust has been bleeding for the last three consecutive days. During this time, the ETF has seen more than $387 million in outflows, a trend that has coincided with a nearly 12% drop in ETH prices over the last week. JPMorgan has taken a cautious outlook on Ethereum, saying that the recent uptick in network activity might not be sustained. According to the banking giant, the factors that previously hampered network usage might still be at play, which could trigger a bearish correction in the future. Analysts at the bank added that the recent surge in activity might be due to the Fusaka upgrade that went live towards the end of 2025. However, historical data shows that these upgrades only improve network activity for a short time before stalling. JPMorgan also notes that user migration from the mainnet to layer two networks could stall activity, making it challenging for the ETH price to sustain an upward trajectory.

Title: AIL preview: Young Munster look to break top-five at home to Terenure

The top five teams in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League have opened up a 10-point gap to the bottom four, adding significant to the clash between Young Munster (28 points) in sixth and third-placed Terenure (32) at Tom Clifford Park, where the visitors last won in 2017. What’s more, Munsters are seeking a second consecutive double over Terenure after a 29-19 win at Lakelands Park in early December. Despite winning just one of their first six matches, it was clear the Cookies’ results were misleading, picking up seven bonus points in those first four defeats. But that win over Terenure sparked a maximum haul of 15 points from their last three games, and this weekend make just two changes to the side that won at Nenagh last time out. Munster and former Connacht and Ireland Sevens winger Andrew Smith returns while Leo Langbridge starts in the backrow. Terenure make one change to the team that ended a three-game losing streak at home to Old Belvedere a fortnight ago, Leinster hooker John McKee returning to the fold as Max Russell reverts to openside after playing for Leinster A in Toulouse last weekend while Ben Blaney is on duty with the Ireland Under-20s. The rest of the top five teams will be favourites to win, although the same was true in early December when UCD produced their best performance of the season to beat Lansdowne 43-38. The students’ make two changes for the return meeting in Belfield, Leinster academy and Ireland Under-20 Grand Slam winner James Culhane coming in at number eight and Thomas Quinn at scrumhalf. Lansdowne make four changes; Harry O’Riordan at inside centre, Jack Matthews and Stephen Madigan in the halfback line, and Harry van Eeden at eight. Leinster scrumhalf Cormac Foley is also among the replacements after a length injury lay-off. Leaders Clontarf (42 points), seeking a 10th successive win, are unchanged at home to Nenagh, who have lost all 10 games this season, while second-placed St Marys (37) make just one change for the visit of seventh-place Ballynahinch (21). Cork Con (fourth, 32) take their four-game winning run to Old Belvedere for a first meeting at Ollie Campbell Park since 2016. The 1B leaders Old Wesley go to Queens, while the 2A and 2B unbeaten duo of MU Barnhall and Galwegians continue their push for promotion at home to Greystones and Navan respectively. Division 1A: Clontarf v Nenagh Ormond, Castle Avenue; Old Belvedere v Cork Constitution, Ollie Campbell Park; UCD v Lansdowne, Belfield; Young Munster v Terenure College, Tom Clifford Park; St Mary’s College v Ballynahinch, Lakelands Park (3pm). Division 1B: Blackrock College v Instonians, Blackrock College School Pitch; City Of Armagh v UCC, Palace Grounds; Highfield v Dublin University, Woodleigh Park; Naas v Garryowen, Rathoe Road; Queen’s University v Old Wesley, Dub Lane.

Title: Gonna be golden: join the flight to gold and other precious metals
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fine-art-antiques/2026/01/24/gonna-be-golden-join-the-flight-to-gold-and-other-precious-metals/

Amid persistent geopolitical tensions rise in various parts of the world, precious metals such as gold and silver continue to see strong price growth. “The price of silver and gold has risen greatly in the past 60 days, mainly due to what’s going on in the world, from Greenland to the Middle East to Ukraine,” says John Weldon of Weldon Auctioneers in Cows Lane, Temple Bar, Dublin. Earlier this week, pure silver ingot was on the market for about €2.60 per gramme, compared with €1.39 per gramme in mid-November 2025. “People and banks move cash funds into the safety of silver and gold, not only to guard as an inflation hedge, but also to have a tangible asset,” Weldon says. John Weldon Auctioneers will be selling a commemorative set of silver ingots celebrating 1,000 years of the British monarchy from AD 973 to 1973, at their next auction on Tuesday, January 27th, at 2pm. Weldon says potential purchasers of this walnut-cased set of 50 silver ingots (each of which has a portrait and scene of a British monarch), will be more interested in the gramme weight of the silver rather than the historic significance of the item. The combined weight of the collection is about 3,300g. Although one would imagine that such a collection would sell better in the UK than in Ireland, Weldon says Irish owners have found that post-Brexit import duties have made it much less attractive for Irish owners to sell items of significant historic British interest there. The 1973 limited edition set made by John Pinches in London has an estimate of €5,000-€8,000, with the upper figure representing a little under the market price for silver (which stood at €2.57 per gramme earlier this week). Weldon says gold sovereign coins are another way of storing value. The auction includes three gold sovereign coins with guides of €700-€800 each, and a Canadian silver coin dated 2018 with a guide price of €400-€700. If predictions about people spending less time on their smartphones comes to pass, older-style time pieces such as alarm clocks and watches may well come back into vogue. Watches feature prominently in both Adams Blackrock online auction on January 28th at 7pm, and the aforementioned John Weldon in-person and live online auction on January 27th at 2pm. Elena McCrory of Adams Blackrock says Omega, Rolex, Patek Philippe, Longines and Raymond Weil watches are always in demand. A Rolex GMT-Master II Oyster-Perpetual Date man’s stainless steel wristwatch (€8,000-€9,000), and a Rolex Oyster 18-carat yellow gold diamond woman’s wristwatch (€6,000-€7,000) are included in the auction. Meanwhile, an 18-carat gold Rolex Oyster Date wristwatch with a white face and roman numeral dial (€9,500-€11,500) and an 18-carat Cartier Tank Française Chronograph wristwatch (€5,000-€6,000) are among the watches for sale at Weldon’s auction. The latter includes three sub-dials that track seconds, minutes and hours for anyone in need of such exact measurements for sporting or other pursuits. The Weldon auction also has a stainless steel Rolex Oyster Date wristwatch with a guide price of €3,000-€4,000. Most guide prices for watches at auction are substantially below the retail price of an equivalent watch. Moving on to matters much more mechanical, Wilsons Auctions in Belfast is holding a timed online auction of vintage tractors from Wednesday, January 28th, at 2pm, to Friday, January 30th. Collected over 60 years by Ronnie Deering of Newtownards, Co Down, the John Deere, Case, Chamberlin and Hanomag tractors date from 1918 to 1969 and were sourced in the UK, across Europe and in Australia. David Deering, son of Ronnie and Margaret Deering (who also ran Ballycastle House B&B for a number of years), has fond memories of participating in road runs, agricultural shows and vintage tractor shows over the years. Mount Stewart and Rosemount Estate in Greyabbey, Co Down, and Shane’s Castle, Co Antrim, were among the most popular local venues for such events. At least two of the Deering tractors for sale – a 1922 Case 12/20 Crossmotor tractor and a 1949 Chamberlin tractor – that were used in the Cooley Vintage Festival in 2007. At that event, more than 4,500 tractors helped set the Guinness World Record for the most veteran tractors ploughing simultaneously. Ronnie Deering, who worked for the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland, bought some of his collection in Western Australia when visiting family there. Now in his 80s, he is ready to sell 12 of them, while the family retains eight or nine others, alongside vintage cars for future generations of the Deering family. “Myself and my father have restored many of these tractors over the years and we built an insulated shed to store them,” says David Deering, who expects strong interest in the vintage tractors from collectors here as well as abroad. Viewing takes place at the Deering residence (BT222AL) on Monday, January 26th, 10am-5pm. jwa.ie, adamsblackrock.ie, wilsonsauctions.com Estimate €500-€800 Hammer price €3,000 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €800-€1,200 Hammer price €1,300 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €400-€600 Hammer price €1,300 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €600-€1,000 Hammer price €1,800 Auction house Adam’s Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

Full Content:
Larry Fink, president and CEO of investment firm BlackRock, interviewed Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX at the World Economic forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. They spoke about everything from AI to robotics to Mars, and Musk offered a vision of the future that’s coming more quickly than you might think. Here’s an excerpt of their conversation: Larry Fink: So you’re presently building on AI, on robotics, on space, on energy, all at the same time. When you look across those efforts, what do they have in common from an engineering standpoint? Elon Musk: Well, they’re all very difficult technology challenges, but the overall goal of my companies is to maximize the future of civilization, like basically maximize the probability that civilization has a great future, and to expand consciousness beyond Earth. So if you take SpaceX, for example, that SpaceX is about advancing rocket technology to the point where we can extend. Life and consciousness beyond Earth, to the Moon, to Mars, eventually to other star systems. And I think we should always view consciousness, life as we know it, as precarious and delicate. Because to the best of our knowledge, we don’t know of life anywhere else. You know, I’m often asked, are there aliens among us? And I’ll say that I am one, but . . . We have 9,000 satellites up there. And not once have we had to maneuver around an alien spaceship. So I’m like, I don’t know. Bottom line is, I think we need to assume. Life and consciousness is extremely rare, and it might only be us. And if that’s the case, then we need to do everything possible to ensure that the light of consciousness is not extinguished, because the way I view it is, the image in my mind of a tiny candle in a vast darkness, tiny candle of consciousness, that could easily go out. And that’s why it’s important to make life multi-planetary, such that if there is a natural disaster or a man-made disaster on Earth, that consciousness continues. That’s the purpose of SpaceX. Tesla is obviously about sustainable technology and . . . And also, at this point, we’ve sort of added to our mission sustainable abundance. So with robotics and AI. This is really the path to abundance for all. People often talk about solving global poverty, or essentially, how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? I think the only way to do this is AI and robotics, which doesn’t mean that it is without its issues. I mean, we need to be very careful with AI. We need to be very careful with robotics. We don’t want to find ourselves in a James Cameron movie. You know, “Terminator.” But if you have ubiquitous AI that is essentially free or close to it, and ubiquitous robotics, then you will have an explosion in the global economy, an expansion of the global economy that is truly beyond all precedent. Fink: How can that be created? How can it broaden the global economy? Musk: In the benign scenario of the future . . . there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is that there’ll be more robots than people. Fink: But how do you then have human purpose? Musk: Yeah, I mean, you know, nothing’s perfect, but I mean it is a necessary, like you can’t have both. You can’t have work that has to be done and amazing abundance for all. . . . But if you have billions of humanoid robots, and I think there will be, I think everyone on Earth is going to have one and going to want one. Because who wouldn’t want a robot to, assuming it’s very safe, watch over your kids, take care of your pets? If you have elderly parents, a lot of friends might have elderly parent, so it’s very difficult to take care them. Yeah, it’s expensive and they just aren’t enough young people to take care of the old people. So if you had a robot that could take care of and protect an elderly parent, I think that would be great. That would be an amazing thing to have. And I think we will have those things. So overall, I’m very optimistic about the future. I think we’re headed for a future of amazing abundance, which is very cool, and definitely we are in the most interesting time in history. Fink: So in the future that you talk about, the AI models, autonomous machines, rockets, depends on massive increases of compute, massive increases in energy, expensive energy, manufacturing scale. What are the bottlenecks to get there? Musk: I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power. It’s just, right, it’s energy. I mean, we’re seeing the rate of AI chip production increase exponentially, but the rate of electricity being brought online is negligible, 10%, 4% a year, max. It’s clear that we’re very soon, maybe even later this year, we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on. Except for China, China’s growth in electricity is tremendous. They’re building 100 gigawatts of nuclear as we speak. Actually, solar is the biggest thing in China. . . . China, just in solar, can do half of US electricity output per year. Solar is by far the biggest source of energy. And that’s why one of the things we’ll be doing with SpaceX within a few years is launching solar-powered AI satellites because the space is really the source of immense power, and then you don’t need to take up any room on Earth. There’s so much room in space, and you can scale to hundreds of terawatts a year. Fink: You and I have had these conversations before, but why don’t you tell the audience what would it take for the United States and what type of geography would it take to have that solar field to electrify the United States? And why aren’t we doing it? Musk: Yeah, so, I mean, I guess a rough way to think about it is 100 miles by 100 miles, I’ll call it 160 kilometers by 160 kilometers of solar is enough to power the entire United States. Yeah, 100 mile by 100 mile areas is, I mean, you could take basically a small corner of Utah. Nevada. Nevada, New Mexico. Obviously, you wouldn’t want it all in one place. But it is a very small percentage of the area of the US to generate all of the electricity that the US uses. And the same is true, actually, for Europe. You could take a small part. You can take. Relatively unpopulated areas of say Spain and Sicily and generate all of the electricity power that Europe needs. Fink: So why don’t you think that there’s a movement toward that here and in the United States? Musk: Unfortunately, in the US, the tariff barriers for solar are extremely high. And that makes the economics of deploying solar artificially high because China makes almost all the solar . . . We obviously don’t control the US tariff policy. But for other countries, China makes solar cells that are incredibly low cost. Fink: I know you’re going to be having a couple of big announcements on robotics and what it can do. I mean, when I went to the factory, you showed me those robots. You talked about billions of robots, but how quickly can they be deployed in a manufacturing setting? How quickly can it be utilized and be functional and create that abundance that you talked about? Musk: Well, humanoid robotics will advance very quickly. I think we do have some of the Tesla Optimus robots doing simple tasks in the factory. Probably later this year, by the end of this year I think they’ll be doing more complex tasks. But still deployed in an industrial environment. And probably sometime next year, I’d say that by the end of next year I think we’d be selling humanoid robots to the public. That’s when we are confident that it’s very high reliability, very high safety, and the range of functionality is also very high. You can basically ask it to do anything you’d like. Fink: You’re already seeing that in Tesla cars, the software changes that you’re doing. And what is it, every quarter now a software change that upgrades the ability of the robot within the car? Musk: Yes, the Tesla full self-driving software, we update it sometimes once a week and recently some of the insurance companies have said that it is actually so safe, Tesla full-self driving is so safe that they’re offering customers half-price insurance if they use has the force of driving in the car. Fink: And that can be monitored by the insurance company? Is that part of the agreement? Musk: Yeah. But I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla’s rolled out a sort of robot taxi service in a few cities and will be very, very widespread by the end of this year within the US. And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe hopefully next month. Fink: Really, that quickly. Musk: And then. Maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully. Fink: I want to move to space, because historically, space is very capital-intensive. It’s historically been done by governments. Obviously, SpaceX changed the whole model. But we’ve seen it slow to scale, and now I’m starting to see it ramping up in what you’re doing and other things.

Musk: Well, the key breakthrough, the major breakthrough that SpaceX is hoping to achieve this year is full reusability. So no one has ever achieved full reusability of a rocket, which is very important for the cost of access to space. We’ve achieved partial reusability with Falcon 9 by landing the booster stage. We’ve now landed the booster over 500 times. But we have to throw away the upper stage. The upper stage sort of burns up on reentry for Falcon 9. So, and the cost of that is equivalent to a small to medium sized jet. But with Starship, which is a giant rocket, it’s the largest flying machine ever made. Fink: That’s a rocket that you’re using for the idea of going to Mars, right? Musk: Yeah, Mars and the moon, as well as for high volume satellite stuff. So Starship, hopefully this year we should prove full reusability for Starship which will be a profound invention because the cost of access to space will drop by a factor of 100 when you achieve full reusability. It’s the same sort of economic difference that you would expect between, say, a reusable aircraft and a non-reusable aircraft. Like if you have to throw your aircraft away after every flight, that would be a very expensive flight. But if you only have to refuel, then it’s the cost of the fuel. And so that’s really the fundamental breakthrough that gets the cost-of-access to space. Below the cost of freight on aircraft. Under $100 a pound type of thing easily. So it makes putting large satellites into space very cheap. And then when you have solar in space, you get five times more effectiveness, maybe even more than that, than solar on the ground. Because it’s always sunny. You don’t have a day-night cycle or seasonality or weather. And you get about 30% more power in space because you don’t have atmospheric attenuation of the power. Any given solar panel will do five times more energy and space than on the ground. Fink: Is there any capacity in doing that and then taking that power and bringing it back to Earth? Is there a way of doing that or are you just taking that power and utilizing it for the needs, like building AI data centers in space? Musk: It’s a no-brainer for building AI, solar-powered AI data centers in space . . . It is also very cold in space, if you’re in the shadow. So you just have, you have solar panels facing the sun and then a radiator that’s pointed away from the sun. So it has no sun incidence and then it just cooling, it’s just a very efficient cooling system. Net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be space, and that will be true within two years, maybe three, three at the latest. Fink: So looking 10 or 20 years out, how would you describe success with AI or space technology, and where do you see it? Are you more certain what’s going to happen the next three years, or five or 10? Musk: I don’t know what’s going to happen in 10 years, but the rate at which AI is progressing, I think we’ve . . . We might have AI that is smarter than any human by the end of this year. And I would say no later than next year. And then probably by 2030 or 2031, call it five years from now, AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively. Fink: Do you see yourself ever going to Mars in your lifetime? Musk: I’ve asked it a few times, like do I want to, you know, die on Mars? And I’m like, yes, but just not on impact. Fink: Elon, thank you. Any last words? Musk: Well, I think generally, I mean my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future. Good. And generally, for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than a pessimist and right. Advertisement

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Essay by Eric Worrall “Even after 3 or 5 years more innovation?” “It’s against physics”. NOW – Honeywell CEO says solar power cannot produce cement or steel, "They are very energy-intensive… It's physics… Renewables remain in the mix, but it cannot bring the amount of joules we need to produce this infrastructure which is required in the world." pic.twitter.com/n4zz8KIfjp Anti-renewable blasphemy in the Davos World Economic Forum, the citadel of globalism. The moment when someone tells the emperor he has no clothes. The video is well worth watching, once they get over their momentary shock the quiet part is being spoken aloud, all the panelists nodded and agreed. Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, also trashed renewables in Davos 2024 (first published JoNova); The words are out now, and cannot be unspoken. For the last decade I’ve spent writing for WUWT myself and I think many of us have viewed BlackRock as an adversary, and big tech as hypocrites, all cynical exploiters promoting renewables and backing green politicians at the expense of ordinary people. But the money train has left the renewable station. Banks and big tech follow the money, and with subsidies and political goodwill for renewables on the wane, renewables are increasingly uninvestable. Now that Fortune 500 CEOs like Vimal Kapur “I’m an engineer by trade” are speaking out, now big bankers like Larry Fink are happy to throw renewables under a bus, now that President Trump is trashing renewables and cancelling climate treaties, it might seem the battle is won. Not everyone is onboard with the end of renewables. Some big European organisations are heavily invested in renewables, and stand to loose big time if the renewable subsidy hose dries up. Top business leaders issue an expletive-laced message on the green backlash PUBLISHED THU, JAN 22 20262:29 AM ESTUPDATED THU, JAN 22 20268:05 AM EST Sam Meredith@IN/SAMUELMEREDITH@SMEREDITH19 KEY POINTS Top business leaders this week delivered an expletive-laden plea in defense of climate action, describing the backlash to Europe’s green transition as an “aberration.” In an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Allianz CEO Oliver Bäte said he disagreed with the suggestion that it may just be a matter of time before net zero is dismissed in Europe, saying short-term thinking on this issue is “bulls—.” Asked about political leaders backtracking on their much-vaunted European Green New Deal and Norway’s oil fund reportedly defending a push from companies to water down their climate goals, Bäte said anyone who has children “will have to worry” about the planet’s future. “It’s an aberration that short-term people are saying that,” Bäte told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Tuesday. “I think it’s about doing it intelligently. And by the way, the role model here is China, they are going to be the leader both in terms of renewable and cost of energy.” … There is one important big player, mentioned in the article above, which wants to see the Western world remain committed to self destructive renewables. ‘Subservient to China’: Net zero warning at Davos as Trump slams the policy, Chinese vice-premier defends renewables America’s shock verdict at Davos has put Australia’s energy future in doubt. And China is at the centre of it all. Harrison ChristianJanuary 23, 2026 – 9:20AM Globalisation wasn’t the only policy to cop extraordinary criticism at Davos — another was net zero. … Donald Trump went even further than Lutnick in his remarks to the forum on Wednesday local time. … “One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing. “China makes almost all of the windmills, and yet I haven’t been able to find any windfarms in China. China’s very smart — they make them, they sell them for a fortune, they sell them to the stupid people that buy them.” In the end, it was Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng who advocated strongly for renewables at the forum. “China has put in place the world’s largest renewable energy system and the most complete new-energy industrial chain,” he said in his address. “We invite enterprises from all over the world to embrace the opportunities from the green and low-carbon transition, and work closely with China in such areas as green infrastructure, green energy, green minerals and green finance, and jointly create a green and prosperous future.” China makes the vast majority of renewable technology. It also installs more renewable energy capacity than the rest of the world combined, though it remains by far the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. … China, which uses vast and growing amounts of coal to manufacture renewables while maintaining a sham of going green, stands to lose 10s, possibly hundreds of billions of dollars if the world cancels Net Zero. They are using every influence lever they can pull to try to ensure global Net Zero remains on track. China doesn’t seem to care if Net Zero wrecks the global economy, so long as China ends up on top. Perhaps they hope a broken world would be easy pickings for China’s greedy elites. With President Trump strides the world stage, trampling green sacred cows, and some CEOs championing energy sanity, it is easy to think the battle is over. But China is patient, their culture champions the long game. China are doing everything in their power to replace the USA as the global superpower. The measure of their vast influence is the number of Western politicians and leading business figures who still champion green energy and the Chinese way, both within and outside the United States. If President Trump’s successor is not equal to the challenge of continuing the Trump energy abundance agenda, and companies like BlackRock start manoeuvring for trillions of dollars of re-instated green subsidies, 2029 will feel like 2021 all over again. “China makes almost all of the windmills, and yet I haven’t been able to find any windfarms in China. China’s very smart — they make them, they sell them for a fortune, they sell them to the stupid people that buy them.” This is a “they are eating the dogs” level lie. Reality just doesn’t matter in trumpland. You seem smart. How can you believe China is going green, when they are still expanding coal capacity? At what point will the penny drop that China is fooling you with a Potemkin village style green sham, while their industrial economy breaks new coal consumption records every other year? How much did their electricity production from coal grew last year? How much of their overall demand growth was covered by renewables? They can expand their capacity all they want when their capacity factor goes down. Let’s wait and see how it looks next year. China’s coal electricity production went up last year of record (2024, Coal fired supply increase 6.1% on year, to cover hydropower shortage). Since renewable generation has increased every year for at least the past decade, you would think even with the hydro down, coal usage would have been stable. Fwiw, demand growth in 2024 was approx.6.5%. Fwiw^2, nuclear had a growth rate of about 7% that same year in China. All the extra added nameplate wind/solar capacity appears to have done…. Last year was 2025 Clearly stated, “last year of record”. But comprehension was never your strong point, was it? CREA/GEM ‘China Coal Power’ August 2025 “Coal remains deeply embedded in the power system with little public discussion of its phase down or eventual exit.” “Coal power continues to expand in absolute capacity terms and remains structurally protected. Current institutions continue to lock in coal’s position” “Coal construction and commissioned projects remain high with no clear signs of slowing. 21GW commissioned in the first half of 2025, the highest first half total since 2016. Full year additions expected to exceed 80GW. Construction starts and restarts reached 46GW, equal to the entire coal capacity of S Korea” “Renewables equal 60% of installed capacity compared to 34% for coal but there is a widening disconnect between capacity growth and actual power production” “Faced with constraints in grid flexibility and market mechanisms Local Authorities have largely defaulted to coal power as the fastest and most controllable way to secure dispatchable capacity” “Only 1GW retired in the first half of 2025……Current efforts are focused on life extensions and retrofitting. Coal exits are politically marginal and institutionally unsupported. BEIJING – China’s coal output rose to a record in 2025, statistics bureau data showed on Monday, as lower domestic prices prompted buyers to cut imports and rebuild stockpiles with cheaper local supply, although the rise was limited by regulator efforts to curb production growth. Production in 2025 reached 4.83-billion metric tons, up 1.2% from 2024, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. More ample domestic supply – a reversal from the coal and power shortages China experienced a few years ago – also encouraged power plants to source better quality coal, said Peng Chengyao, head of APAC power and renewables research at S&P Global Energy. In H1 2025, 21 gigawatts (GW) of coal power were commissioned, the highest amount in the first half of the year since 2016, with projections for the full year exceeding 80 GW. This increase in commissions follows on the tail of the 2022-2023 coal power permitting surge that saw two new coal projects permitted per week, on average, totalling more than 100 GW of coal power approved per year. This trend will likely continue into 2026 and 2027 I asked about the power generated from coal (Twh), not their domestic production or their added capacity… And you were answered, lie spewing moron. Why are you asking? Just provide the details and make your point. “How much did their electricity production from coal grew last year? How much of their overall demand growth was covered by renewables?” NB : I am translating “Renewables” to equal “Wind + Solar (only)” here. I had no idea how China’s electricity generation was split for calender year 2025 when first reading your post … but being a curious fellow with (way) too much spare time on my hands I went looking for some actual data on the Wibbly Wobbly Web … I eventually ended up at the following site, which has monthly “data” up to November 2025 : https://lowcarbonpower.org/region/People's_Republic_of_China/sources Extracting the 21 lines starting with “CN,”People’s Republic of China”,…” — plus the header line with the date information — from their (just over 3 MB) CSV file allowed me to generate a “quick and dirty” spreadsheet plot, which is attached to the end of this post. . Notes – It looks like “Coal” generation levelled off on a “12-month rolling sum” basis during 2025, it neither increased nor decreased. – How much the “Coal” and “Renewable” (nominal / nameplate / baseplate) capacity numbers changed during 2025 is a completely separate issue. – “Renewables” — AKA “Wind + Solar” — has indeed steadily increasing both in absolute and percentage terms since (at least) 2019, but it is nowhere near overtaking “Coal”, let alone (completely) replacing it in China’s electricity mix. – Just because “demand growth” may have been “covered by renewables” in 2025 doesn’t mean all of the CO2 emissions from “Coal” electricity generation are going to drop to “Net Zero” anytime soon (“carbon neutrality before 2060“, according to China’s latest NDC). If wind and solar are so cheap, why would China build new coal plants? Because wind and solar can’t build themselves? 😎 you have obviously never been in China. I have been to every large city there. In winter it can be anything from -15 in Bejing to -30 in the north. It was snowing in Afshan when we were there, and Harbin was just a HUGE SMOG of burning coal. Coal is used for heating and electricity generation in China and with the EVs and heat-pumps+no wind or solar (cos of the smog and windless nightsm etc) they just need more and more electricity from all forms of reliable fossil fuels. And of course the Chinese Communist Party is above bribing parts of The Green Blob to favor Chinese interests. And if you believe that, I have a surefire investment in voodoo acupuncture for you. China energy.. Wind and solar are basically a very small afterthought.. You haven’t spent much time in China, have you? Drown it in soy sauce, and everything tastes the same. Just like snake tastes like chicken, crocodile tastes like chicken, lizards taste like chicken, etc etc. And now the chicken doesn’t taste like chicken. 😉 I was in China a decade, or so, ago, visiting auto plants. At one, we were given lunch in the same cafeteria as the workers. The only item on the menu was some kind of stew. It had a meat of some sort it. It tasted like nothing I had ever eaten before, and certainly not like chicken. I quietly covered my plate with a napkin and ate nothing there at all. I never found out what it was and didn’t ask. I thought it likely was dog. It takes about 3 weeks to get used to Soylent Green. It may well have been cat. It could have been cats or bats (from Wuhan). Actually none of those taste like chicken, and yes, I do know. The Chinese term for dog meat translates to “sweet meat.” I was talking about that: Trump repeats baseless claim about Haitian immigrants eating pets Those re not baseless claims, it was happening and still is, also eating cats and wild geese caught in parks and on ponds/creeks. But hey! Just lie some more, liar, its all you got. All of this has been debunked. Your lies endanger people that are a hard working part of their communities. Hope you are proud of yourself. Haitians are fine people- like everyone else- all most of us want is that if they come to America, it’s done legally. Actually, no. The Haitians Biden Admin fast tracked into America are the ones who f*cked up what government Haiti had and stole every penny the Clinton Foundation didn’t steal. Same with Somalians Biden and Obama Admins prioritized into America. Democrat Party stands with their fellow America hating criminals worldwide. I am, because you keep proving yourself to nothing more than a liar. Good job, buddy. The thoroughly discredited MyUsernameReloaded and all of his baseless claims, all offered without evidence, have been authoritatively debunked throughout media and academia, so much so that no person with a degree from an accredited institution accepts any of his lies. PS Just thought I’d “argue” on his level. -MSK Yes, you are a massive liar. We already know that. They are eating dogs – in China and Haiti. Your holy cows are someone elses food. That’s something you western white fagots can’t even imagine let alone fathom. Kim Iverson ( Vietnamese origin) had some funny jokes about Vietnamese people eating dogs in the USA. The fact that you are such a corrupt hypocrite does not change reality. It is an exaggeration. Trump’s public speech usually loose and hyperbolic. Most people understand that. When will you learn? Very nice Eric. It is a lie that CO2 can cause catastrophic runaway global warming. It is a lie that we must stop using fossil fuels. It is a lie that wind and solar can replace fossil fuels. People give China far too much credit, the only reason they are behaving the way they are is because they are considered a developing country rather than a developed country. They have nothing to lose by net zero and everything to gain. Every nation needs to adopt policies that are best for them without demanding welfare from the developed countries. It is that simple. The renewable backlash will only gain steam going forward. Now that it’s OK to question CC people will start listening to its’ facts and follies. The media will have no choice but to get on board with the ‘new’ narrative or risk losing their already dwindling audience. Ho hum another day another Great Leap Forward with triple somersault and full pike- Shared solar: Labor’s “free power” plan to have daily cap to stop abuse by EV and home battery owners Minister Bowen was naturally uber excited to ejaculate the wonder of free power from the sun whereas the pesky trogs hanging it all together were busy reminding him to do no macro harm as usual with gushing ministerial pronouncements. Particularly as middleclassville had concentrated all the subsidised Teslas solar panels and the latest in massive home batteries in their leafy burbs leaving a paucity of same in struggletown and the mortgagee nappy valleys. That’s hilarious 🙂 Male privilege- The rational capability to suffer life’s universal vicissitudes without blaming other various genders and sundry identifiers. Male privilege = build 99% of everything you can see in a picture of any town. Pay for it with way higher job related injury and mortality rates, while all the lazy unproductive people with liberal arts spit at you from their moral high ground and while the Ladies get the well paid administrative jobs. I still have to see my 1st female roofer,street or bridge constructer or at least a vintage photo of a female building a skyscraper. Solar panels on home rooftops is said to cost 3-4x more than having panels in a grid scale solar farm But in order to get grid scale solar 24/7 you need 3x more panels than equivalent base load fossil fuel (i) supply when sun is shining (ii) supply the batteries needed for the supply when its dark (iii) supply the system when its low sun or cloudy (iv) cost of the battery storage Theres goes the cheap energy when this the infrastructure required . Its much worse when the power needed isnt a sunny part of the country. Solar is like fast food- its only cheap when you need while out and about, not when its for 3 meals a day So, what you are saying is solar is a failure. Should have just opened with that. But he provided the analysis – full marks. Vastly better than the oh so sensitive arm waving. “Top business leaders issue an expletive-laced message” Practical interpretation: technical team could not provide slides with good numbers. Yes. It’s just like you can’t make a cake with dog turds. It’s cooking. It’s fine to leave them “in the mix” though. You will hardly even notice them after a while. If President Trump’s successor is not equal to the challenge of continuing the Trump energy abundance agenda, and companies like BlackRock start manoeuvring for trillions of dollars of re-instated green subsidies a Democrat, 2029 will feel like 2021 all over again. Will at least the autopen be solar powered to make some sort of difference? sarc I loved it when Trump told the Stupid People at Davos that only Stupid People buy windmills! All the Stupid People who buy windmills were sitting in the audience. I love his blunt language. It’s long over due. The ultimate reality check. 😎 He learned a lot about politics his first term but he’s still NOT a politician. That’s a good thing! “… and yet I haven’t been able to find any windfarms in China.” Well? Did find a collapsing bridge, and a bunch of collapsing buildings. They make buildings with “tofu dregs”. And a collapsing dam? Well, at this point it is just sorta mobile-ish. But you can find solar “farms” that cover entire mountain sides- up and over the top- for which I see no environmentalists complaining about loss of habitat, loss of biodiversity, loss of “green space”, loss of soil protection, etc. But it’s all for “The Cause” so it’s OK. Mr Kapur? You are SOOOO canceled. Now more invitations to hobnob with the glitterati. And I hope you don’t have teenage daughters, they are going to be SOOOO cross with you for embarrassing them by actually telling the truth. 😉 When the CEO said “I’m an engineer” it was clear that he knew it was worth mentioning. That’s why he said it. He knew that technical knowledge distinguished himself from (most) business leaders attending from Europe. Our business leaders rise through finance, law or (worst of all) sales. They just don’t understand the physical limitations that their industries are constrained by. It’s one of the reasons why Europe’s economy has fallen behind the USA and Asia since China joined the WTO. The lure of AI is like a vaccine to stop all the crazy aspects of Climate Change. It may not eliminate the disease entirely but it has the potential to render it harmless…… “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

Title: Friday, January 23. Russia’s War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine

ByKatya Soldak, Forbes Staff. Dispatches from Ukraine. Day 1,430 Zelenskyy Rebukes Europe At Davos January 23, the final day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, brought Ukraine neither breakthroughs nor fresh commitments from allies, only bold statements. The most important moment for Kyiv was a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Both leaders described the hour-long meeting as “constructive.” Afterwards, Trump emphasized that the war must stop; meanwhile, Zelenskyy, whose arrival in Davos remained in doubt until the last moment due to the acute energy crisis in Kyiv — caused by Russia’s bombing the energy and heating infructrtucture on the coldest week of the winter — used the meeting to underline Ukraine’s need for air-defense missiles to shield its battered energy system. The talks generated no agreements on postwar economic recovery or security arrangements that had been under discussion in recent weeks, as they were clouded by Trump’s aggressive rhetoric about Greenland. Meanwhile, media outlets had expected Ukraine and the U.S. to sign a plan worth possibly billions of dollars, but the agreement was put on hold. Zelenskyy later delivered a pointed speech in Davos, aimed at Europe. In blunt language, he warned that Europe’s internal divisions were a strategic weakness, accusing European allies of failing to “take the lead in defending freedom.” He called Europe a “fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers” that seemed “lost” as it tried to induce Trump to force Russia to end the war. “Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America’s focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost,” Zelenskyy said. After his speech, Zelenskyy presented estimates of Russian military losses. According to cited figures, Russian monthly casualties have doubled over the past year, to about 36,000. Zelenskyy attributed the increase in casualties to the effectiveness of Ukrainian drones, a priority of Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov. Russia’s cumulative losses, he claimed, now surpass 1.2 million personnel, roughly a fifth of which have occurred since last June. The Kremlin, however, effectively absorbs these losses through monthly conscription of 40,000-43,000 troops. Zelenskyy also announced a trilateral meeting involving Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia, the first such meeting in years, to be held in the United Arab Emirates on January 23. Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff has arrived in Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukraine In Davos The annual Ukrainian Breakfast in Davos, hosted by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, centered this year on Ukraine’s EU integration and reconstruction. The January 22 discussion brought together European leaders, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. A special guest at the Ukrainian Breakfast was Steve Witkoff, US Special Envoy to the Middle East, and the US negotiator on the Ukraine peace process. He shared updates on the progress in peace negotiations: “I think that we have made a lot of progress,” he said, “We spent the whole dinner last night talking about the upward trajectory for the Ukrainian economy and financial system... The President (Trump) talked about a tariff-free zone for Ukraine, that I think will be game-changing, and you’ll see the industry moving into that area,” he added that he’s headed to Moscow later that day to continue the negotiations with Putin and his government. A recurring theme was how to push Russia toward a peace settlement on terms acceptable to Kyiv. Finnish President Alexander Stubb said Europe and the U.S. might soon converge on a peace plan for Ukraine. In his opinion, however, it was questionable whether Moscow would accept such a plan, and the war would end only if accompanied by further military support for Ukraine. The debate over using frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine's postwar reconstruction, estimated to cost roughly $524 billion, exposed divisions among European countries. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever, a skeptic of direct confiscation and fearful of legal action from the Kremlin, reiterated that any such disposition must comply with international law. Still, he acknowledged that Russian assets should play a role in rebuilding Ukraine once a peace settlement is reached. Regarding Ukraine’s European track, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Taras Kachka expressed the opinion that Kyiv would be fully integrated into the EU energy market by 2027, even without formal membership. EU Commissioner Marta Kos supported that assessment, noting that Ukraine has completed most of the reforms required for accession. Nonetheless, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said Ukraine’s path to the EU would take several years. Speakers also highlighted Ukraine’s role in defense innovation, particularly in drone warfare. Even with generous reconstruction funds, however, Ukraine’s success is not guaranteed. Referring to what he described as well-designed reforms, Larry Fink said that “Ukraine’s future will depend on whether it can establish strong governance … and integrate itself more deeply into the European and global capital markets.” A January 21 panel, “The Role of the United States in the World,” examined Europe’s security amid shifting U.S. priorities. Former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg shared optimism for future negotiations but warned against trading Ukrainian territory for a ceasefire. He argued time favors Ukraine if it can withstand winter, and that Europe, with U.S. support, could deter Moscow. Russian Attacks Russia launched a sweeping attack overnight on January 20. Although Ukraine's Air Force reported intercepting 27 missiles and 315 drones out of 342 projectiles, the mega-strike, which targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, left half of Kyiv without electricity amid bitter cold. Zelenskyy said the attack employed “updated tactics” and included missiles produced this year. The strikes came just days after Ukraine received a new batch of air-defense missiles, which, Zelenskyy said, limited the damage. In addition, Ukrainian officials reported at least 14 civilians killed and nearly 80 more wounded in Russian strikes in the previous three days in the Kherson, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Donetsk, and Dnipropetrovsk regions.

Title: Ethereum Emerges As Likely Candidate In BlackRock Tokenization Vision – Here’s Why

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Recent remarks from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink have pointed toward the need for a single, unified blockchain for tokenized markets, and have intensified the focus on platforms capable of handling institutional-scale liquidity, compliance, and settlement. With its long track record in smart contracts, extensive developer ecosystem, and growing role in regulated financial products, Ethereum is now emerging as the most likely candidate to serve as the settlement layer for tokenized capital markets. In an X post, the Ethereum Daily shared a video in which BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made it clear that tokenization is necessary. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, Fink said the financial system must move rapidly toward digitization, adding that a single, common blockchain could reduce corruption and improve transparency across the global markets. While Fink did not name a specific network, the most plausible candidate could be ETH, based on BlackRock’s own initiatives and public statements that emphasized the role of ETH in asset tokenization. The firm has consistently highlighted ETH as a core platform for its on-chain strategy. Meanwhile, BlackRock launched its BUIDL tokenized money market fund directly on ETH, a product that has already grown to over $2 billion in total value locked. “There’s no second best,” Ethereum Daily noted. In the staking space, Bitmine has turned Ethereum staking into a multi-billion-dollar business. An analyst known as Milk Road has revealed that the company now has 1.83 million ETH staked, worth roughly $6 million at current prices, and plans to scale that figure toward 4.2 million ETH over time. Over the past months, Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. (BMNR) has accounted for nearly 50% of all new ETH entering the staking queue. Staking at this scale is important because it removes ETH from the liquid supply and locks it into long-term infrastructure rather than keeping it for short-term trading. When one player is willing to commit billions of dollars worth of ETH to staking, it reflects confidence in ETH’s future economic prospects. A lower liquid supply, combined with sustained network demand, will create structural pressure over time. Analyst Milk Road has also highlighted that Ethereum is holding near a critical support zone around $3,000, hovering just above the lower boundary of its long-term rising structure, an area that has acted as a stress test for ETH throughout the cycle. Historically, when ETH drifts into this area, the market will need to decide whether the weakness is temporary or structural. The $2,750 level remains the key line because it has repeatedly stopped downside pressure after macro-driven or narrative-driven pullbacks, making it a reliable floor for the broader trend. As long as ETH holds above that level, the broader multi-year uptrend will remain intact. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.
