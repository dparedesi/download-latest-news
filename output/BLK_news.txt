Title: Leinster’s James Culhane hoping for a change of fortune to consistently deliver on his talent

James Culhane may at one point have watched a black cat walk across his path from right to left – left to right is lucky apparently – spotted a single magpie, spilt salt, broken a mirror, and perhaps inadvertently witnessed many more harbingers of bad luck. It might explain his ridiculously unfortunate injury profile that dates to his teenage years. There are invariably two conversation topics when chatting to the talented 22-year-old Leinster backrow, his prowess on the pitch and his resilience in the face of periodic setbacks that might have broken players of lesser character. He’s got a lovely sense of gallows humour that’s evident in his assertion that “this will last a long time”, when asked to discuss his injuries. Culhane explained: “The worst one was in fourth year [in Blackrock College]. I started getting really bad lower back pain, got a scan and [it revealed] a stress fracture in my L5. They weren’t really sure if it was genetic from when I was born or if it had developed over time. “I was in a back brace for six months to let it heal. Then they re-scanned me, and the same defect was there, so it was pretty much genetic from when I was born. That had me out for about 11 or 12 months, pretty much all of fourth year. “I came back in fifth year and I was healthy but, unfortunately, we got knocked out in the first round of the Senior Cup by Gonzaga, so I didn’t play a huge amount of rugby. Sixth year was okay. “In first year in the [Leinster] academy I injured my ankle and had ankle surgery. Then the year after I obviously had that bad injury in Galway” (a reference to a torn hamstring and fractured shoulder suffered in the same match). “I’ve probably had about three surgeries in two years.” The fact that Leinster gave him a professional contract on a, relatively speaking, slim body of rugby – 16 appearances since making his debut against Cardiff in 2023 – speaks volumes for the esteem in which the 22-year-old is held by the coaches. It’s not as if they’re taking a punt. When Ireland won an under-20 Grand Slam in 2022, Culhane was voted the Six Nations player of the tournament on the back of several brilliant performances. Even then, he couldn’t shrug off a medical jinx as he spent a month in hospital with a severe kidney infection. He was nominated for RTÉ’s Young Player of the Year. What’s immediately obvious in watching him is his athletic prowess honed by a cross pollination of sports growing up from mini rugby in DLSP, through school, Gaelic football with Kilmacud Crokes and playing left back for Enniskerry, Wayside Celtic and Cabinteely soccer clubs. He was selected for the Emerging Ireland tour to South Africa last year and captained the team in their final game against the Cheetahs. His return to the country recently with Leinster didn’t quite meet the same success, as he was concussed five minutes in that first game against the Bulls. Breaking into Leinster’s backrow requires not only a set of disparate qualities but also the capacity to play right across the unit. “Yeah definitely you can’t really be one dimensional, you can’t just be able to play number eight, you have to play seven and six, especially when you’re trying to break into a team,” said Culhane. “It’s important. If you’re breaking into a team, you’re probably starting on the bench, and you have to cover many positions, so it is so important to be versatile. I’ve been working on how I’m viewed as a player by the coaches, so they don’t see me as one type of player you know.” Part of that process includes picking the brains of his team-mates. Culhane continued: “I think Caelan [Doris] especially and Josh [van der Flier] they’re just very easy to talk to, they’ve so much knowledge and they’re willing to give it to you as well. “I have been asking them a lot of questions about how they approach the game, especially around the contact area and ball carry and just that element which is especially important for my position. “It is taking that opportunity when you get it, especially when you’re involved with the team of internationals. On the weekend I was delighted to be playing with just so much talent around me, and the way they play elevates your game as well. When you get an opportunity to get your way into that team, you take it.” Culhane certainly honoured that goal in the victory over Ulster, 25 tackles, one turnover and leading the team in successful carries. It’s more than the metrics though; his effectiveness is just as easy to spot with the naked eye. Top of his wish list: consistent game time.

Title: State officials and pension-affiliated stakeholders remain concerned about Tesla, even with Musk's pledge to step back from DOGE

Full Content:
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday that his role at the White House DOGE office will be secondary as he devotes more time to the EV company. Some large Tesla stakeholders and state officials criticizing the company's leadership told Business Insider that they are still concerned. "The company's disappointing earnings were proof that his lack of focus has indeed hurt the company and has permanently damaged the brand value of Tesla," Michael Frerichs, treasurer for the state of Illinois, said in a statement on Wednesday to Business Insider. "It is helpful to hear that Mr. Musk may actually do his job as Executive of Tesla, but we cannot miss the fact that he has caused long-term damage to this company." Frerichs is one of seven state treasurers who sent a letter on April 17 demanding that Tesla's board chair, Robyn Denholm, ensure that Musk devotes "adequate time to the company," given Tesla's recent performance. Depending on the state, treasurers may participate in managing their state's pension funds, which could contain positions in Tesla. "The company's success or setbacks have significant implications for workers, regional industries, and innovation ecosystems in our states," the letter, which was signed by seven state treasurers and the California comptroller, said. Tesla, Musk, and Denholm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They aren't the only large stakeholders who have expressed concern. Even before his role with the DOGE office, some institutional shareholders had urged Musk to pay more attention to Tesla because they were concerned that the chief executive was juggling too many hats with his Twitter acquisition. In May last year, a group of institutional shareholders submitted a letter to the SEC demanding that Musk and the Tesla board stay more vigilant of the company's long-term growth. Those criticisms have only grown since then. Retail traders and even the most bullish analysts have urged Musk to stay on track as Tesla continued to miss expectations. Tesla reported in its latest first-quarter earnings that total revenue fell 9% from the same period last year. The company's stock dropped 41% on Wednesday from its peak in January. Business Insider contacted the state treasurers who signed the April 17 letter and several institutional shareholders who previously expressed concerns about Tesla's governance. Here's what they said. The New York City Comptroller oversees the city's five public pension funds and has been vocal about his misgivings on Musk's leadership. Last year, he joined the coalition of shareholders who called to vote against Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package. In April, Lander urged the Adams Administration and the New York City Law Department to pursue a securities lawsuit against Tesla. "Elon Musk's pledge is far too little, too late," Oluwatona Campbell, a spokesperson for the comptroller's office, told BI in an email. "Tesla shareholders deserve a full-time CEO dedicated to leading the company, not a part-time lackey for an authoritarian climate denier. Musk must be accountable to Tesla's shareholders and the millions of current and future customers who believe in a green transition." The comptroller's office said in April that the city's five public pension systems held more than 3 million Tesla shares worth about $1.26 billion on December 31, 2024. As of March 28, the shares were worth $831 million, according to the office. Young told BI in an interview that Tuesday's earnings showed the company underperforming expectations. He said he was concerned about Musk's insistence on staying on DOGE for at least the remainder of the month. "I think that's haphazard leadership and it endangers the market and the stability of the government at the same time," said Young, one of the state treasurers who signed the April 17 letter. Young added that Musk should "step back now" from the White House office. He said he was speaking solely in his official capacity as state treasurer and not as a fiduciary to the state. Colorado state employees could have some exposure to Tesla since the state's Public Employees' Retirement Association (PERA) offers a large-cap stock fund with holdings in major US companies, including 2.3% of its holdings in Tesla. PERA's reporting as of December 2024 showed that the fund held about $2.8 billion in assets under management, which means the fund's position in Tesla could be around $64.4 million as of Wednesday. "Yesterday's earnings call from Tesla offered plenty of promises, but what the American people need is performance," Goldberg, who signed the April 17 letter, said in a statement to BI. "It is time for the board to step up and ensure this company delivers and realizes its full potential. We will be watching for meaningful progress over time, not just ambitious words." Goldberg sits on the nine-member board of the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management, which oversees the state's pension benefits. A spokesperson told BI that the Pension Reserves Investment Trust Fund has about $315 million of passive exposure to Tesla stock, given its holdings in the S&P 500. Russell signed the April 17 letter and, as the principal fiduciary of the state's Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, told BI, "Musk has put Tesla employees, customers, and investors at financial risk." "While we are cautiously optimistic about the market's positive response to Elon Musk's pledge to refocus on his day job, we await concrete actions and will ultimately judge him on performance. The reputational damage he has caused Tesla may never fully be repaired, and his efforts to shift blame onto protesters and recast his role in DOGE as part of his fiduciary responsibility to Tesla are misleading diversions that risk further alienating customers." A spokesperson for the treasurer's office said Tesla represents about $230 million in passive investments of the state's Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, which have about $60 billion in assets under management. KLP, a Norway-based pension company that holds about 900,000 shares of Tesla, was one of the institutional shareholders that criticized Musk's pay package. In a statement to BI, Embu said Musk may have breached his fiduciary duty as Tesla's CEO by prioritizing personal interests over the company's best interests. "His involvement with DOGE appears to offer little strategic value to Tesla, as his association with the Trump administration has arguably harmed Tesla's brand image and sales outlook," he said. Frerichs, who joined the group of state treasurers criticizing Tesla's leadership in the April 17 letter, told BI he was "glad" that Musk committed to spending more time on his company and looks forward to hearing more details to repair the "damage he has done." "Tesla's earnings report was a testament to what happens when a CEO does not have his eye on the ball," he said in an email, adding that "we can call the last three months what it is — a failure by Elon Musk to the duty and care that all shareholders expect from any CEO." A spokesperson for Frerichs' office said the treasurer doesn't manage the sprawling network of pension funds in the state. Pellicciotti told BI in a statement that "the board of Tesla needs to take seriously the severe damage their CEO is doing to the company's performance, brand, and commitment to bringing needed supply and innovation to the EV market." "If Musk's plan is to be a part time CEO and part time Trump surrogate, I'm far from convinced there is a path to recovery, let alone success, in either endeavor," he said. As treasurer, Pellicciotti is a member of the Washington State Investment Board, which manages the state's public retirement and trust funds. However, he does not speak on behalf of the board. As of December 31, the WSIB's top 10 holdings included Tesla at 1% of the $45 billion in assets under management, or roughly $450 million. In February, the American Federation of Teachers — a group of trustees who serve on public pension funds holding positions on Tesla stock — urged major asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard to review their investments in the EV company, as the stock plunged earlier this year. The group said the pension funds amount to about $4 trillion, including a "material amount" invested in Tesla shares. In a statement to BI, Weingarten said that Tesla's first-quarter earnings were "disastrous" but expected. "On the earnings call, Elon Musk dismissed the problems facing his company and claimed real full self-driving is still just around the corner," Weingarten said. "Tesla continues to be a huge risk to pension portfolios and retirement security. What will Tesla's board do to address this?" Jump to

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Go ‘Pac-Man’ Mode, Gobble Up $1.2 Billion In 1 Week

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Capital poured into US-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds this week, with Tuesday alone witnessing nearly $1 billion in fresh cash. The rush propelled weekly inflows to $1.2 billion and total assets under management (AUM) to $103 billion, based on Bloomberg data. The investment deluge occurred while Bitcoin’s price rose above $93,000, reaching $93,700 – its highest since early March. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) remains at the forefront with year-to-date inflows of $2.7 billion. The fund took in another $346 million last week alone. Ark Invest’s ARKB and Grayscale’s Bitcoin funds lag behind with significantly smaller year-to-date inflows of $410.41 million and $385.31 million. Not everything is coming up roses, however. Grayscale’s GBTC has seen $1.18 billion of outflows since January, going against the overall positive tide. The spot bitcoin ETFs went Pac-Man mode yesterday, +$936m, $1.2b for week. Also notable is 10 of 11 of the originals all took in cash too. Good sign to see flow depth vs say $IBIT doing 90% of the lifting. Price up $93.5k. Pretty strong all things considered IMO. pic.twitter.com/HeLwffgT8F — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 23, 2025 Ten of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of fresh funds this week, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported. They’re going “Pac-Man mode”, the analyst said on X. That broad-based involvement indicates institutional players are diversifying their bets into several funds rather than focusing on one or two. The value traded across all Bitcoin spot ETFs totaled $496 million, while net assets in them now represent nearly $57 billion – equivalent to around 2.80% of Ethereum’s market cap. As Bitcoin-linked investments thrive, Ethereum products simply can’t seem to get a break. According to reports from CoinShares, investment products centered around Ethereum lost yet another $26.7 million last week. This takes their eight-week outflow amount to a mind-boggling $772 million. Even in the face of this continued outflow, Ethereum remains in second place for year-to-date inflows at $215 million. Short Bitcoin products are experiencing the squeeze. Short BTC products had their seventh consecutive week of outflows, with $1.2 million exiting these funds. CoinShares data show that these short bets have now lost $36 million over seven weeks – 40% of their assets under management. The ongoing outflows from short positions are consistent with Bitcoin’s recent price strength. XRP is the only exception among alternative coins, and its investment products attracted over $37 million last week, the third highest for year-to-date inflows on $214 million. This defies the trend observed in most of the other altcoins, which still face selling pressure. Certainly, all of this new money being poured into Bitcoin ETF investments is perhaps the clearest sign yet that traditional financial institutions are coming around to cryptocurrency as an asset class. We’re talking almost $1 billion coming into the market in just one day: this looks like the dawn of a new era in which acceptance of the asset class by the mainstream is even greater.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

The protocol proposed a discussion on structuring approaches that would allow for the compliant issuance and distribution of tokenized securities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ondo Finance and legal counsel from Davis Polk & Wardwell met with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Crypto Task Force on April 24 to discuss regulatory pathways for tokenized versions of publicly traded US securities, according to a memorandum reviewed by the agency’s staff. The meetings focused on structuring options and regulatory considerations for issuing tokenized securities, particularly those referencing assets such as US equities and fixed-income instruments. The topics listed revealed that Ondo’s presentation addressed regulatory challenges, including registration requirements, broker-dealer obligations, market structure rules, financial crimes compliance, and the application of state corporate laws. The firm proposed a discussion on structuring approaches that would allow for the compliant issuance and distribution of tokenized securities while exploring possibilities for participating in a regulatory sandbox or targeted relief. Additionally, Ondo’s legal team outlined key considerations around investor protection, anti-money laundering compliance, and the application of the Exchange Act to token-based issuance models. The initiative marks another step in Ondo’s broader push to integrate traditional financial assets into blockchain-native environments. The firm currently manages over $1 billion in tokenized products, representing 16.4% of the $6.15 billion tokenized US Treasuries market. The Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund (OUSG) is a blockchain-based fund that tokenizes exposure to short-term US Treasuries. Its primary backing is the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), and the fund aims to deliver yield while maintaining liquidity at all times. Meanwhile, a combination of short-term Treasuries and demand deposits held with banks secures Ondo’s US Dollar Yield Token (USDY). Designed to mimic the accessibility of stablecoins, USDY targets non-US investors seeking exposure to US dollar-denominated returns without using traditional financial intermediaries. Both products represent a growing asset class within tokenized finance, consisting of applying blockchain infrastructure to wrap and manage real-world securities in a digitally native format. The meeting represents part of a broader industry effort to seek clarity on regulatory guidelines since SEC leadership changed in January. Since creating its Crypto Task Force on Jan. 21, the regulator has held 81 meetings with key figures from the crypto industry. The meetings involved discussions around a wide range of subjects, including implementing staking in exchange-traded products (ETPs) and the impact of market manipulation on centralized platforms. These movements highlight how the regulator is now open to engaging with the crypto industry under the President Donald Trump administration.

Title: Greenlane’s flagship electric charging truck stop is now online [update]

Greenlane, which is rolling out a US EV charging network for big rigs, just switched on its first electric truck stop in Colton, California. April 24, 2025: The flagship facility, at the intersection of Interstates 215 and 10, was completed eight months after breaking ground. It’s got 41 OEM-agnostic chargers with 12 pull-through lanes and CCS 400 kW dual-port chargers with liquid-cooled cables. They’re built to handle big Class 8 electric rigs with ease. Twenty-nine bobtail lanes feature CCS 180 kW chargers. Colton offers a spacious lounge with food and drinks, a water refill station, and restrooms. There’s free wifi, mobile charging stations, and 24/7 customer support. Security includes round-the-clock on-site attendants, security cameras, gated access, and enhanced lighting. Office space is available for leasing, and there’s overnight truck and trailer parking. It’s the first of several electric charging truck stops planned for the company’s I-15 commercial EV charging corridor. Greenlane plans to expand its network with future sites expected roughly every 60 to 90 miles in Long Beach, Barstow, and Baker, California. Greenlane has also secured its first commercial fleet customer, fully electric truckload carrier Nevoya, which will begin operating its fleet of electric trucks out of Colton early next month. Nevoya will use the charging infrastructure and occupy on-site office space. The two companies plan to scale the partnership to include up to 100 of Nevoya’s electric trucks. March 11, 2025: Builder and developer Mortenson is constructing the commercial EV charging facility in Colton, which broke ground last September. It will include more than 40 chargers when it comes online for heavy, medium, and light-duty EVs. In its next phase, Greenlane plans to deploy solar panels and battery storage to enhance grid stability, manage peak loads, and increase energy efficiency. Greenlane’s pull-through lane chargers will be equipped with Alpitronic CCS 400 kW dual-port chargers featuring oil-cooled cables. That means faster charging without the bulk—these cables stay lightweight and easy to handle. For bobtail charging, eFill CCS 180 kW chargers will be available, bringing smart energy management to keep fleet operations running smoothly. To keep everything in check, ABB’s SCADA system will handle remote monitoring and breaker management, boosting reliability and efficiency. Plus, Greenlane’s sites are built with Trenwa precast cable trench, making it easier to expand EV charging infrastructure and upgrade to megawatt charging as fleet demand grows. Greenlane, a joint venture between Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy, and BlackRock, also debuted its branded digital technology suite as part of its ongoing development of the I-15 Commercial EV Charging Corridor. The products will be rolled out in phases. Greenlane’s Chief Technology Officer, Raj Jhaveri, said, “Our technology helps maximize uptime and operational efficiency by ensuring vehicles are charged efficiently and ready to meet the demands of their freight schedules.” The tech rollout includes an app that allows drivers to check charger availability and make reservations in advance, a fleet portal that enables fleet managers and dispatchers to plan and manage routes for their electric fleets, and a new Greenlane website. I've never seen a charger site with such an expanse of solar panels. I think it is a very important message to send to to the public to pair solar panels with EV charging. Back of the envelope calculations, however, show that the panels can at best only provide a full charge for maybe 3-4 trucks per day. The vast majority of electricity must come from the grid (hopefully from giant wind/solar farms). Greenlane also now has OnRamp Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that integrate with existing fleet solutions, providing fleet managers and drivers access to optimized routes, efficient charging and refueling schedules, and related charging data and emissions savings.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin stash grows to $103B – Should we be concerned?

What if Satoshi breaks the decade-long silence and sells? Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin [BTC], has once again found their dormant fortune thrust into the spotlight as BTC prices surge past $94,000. With an estimated 1.1 million Bitcoin under their control, untouched since the protocol’s earliest days, Nakamoto’s holdings have now soared past the $103 billion mark, dramatically reclaiming billionaire status. This rally, which marks a 27% rebound from Bitcoin’s recent five-month low, has sparked both celebration and unease within the crypto community. As the asset approaches uncharted highs, speculation is intensifying around the one question that has lingered for years: what happens if Satoshi ever decides to sell? Source: Meta Gorgonite/X Echoing similar sentiments, was another X (formerly Twitter) user – Dan Lucro, who added, “The question is, will he ever sell… and when?” As expected, another user put it best when he said, Source: Nate Ryan/X Even as Bitcoin’s price continues its upward trajectory, falling to $92,357.57 at press time, following a 1.44% daily drop, Satoshi Nakamoto’s legendary Bitcoin holdings remain untouched. The estimated 1.1 million BTC attributed to Bitcoin’s mysterious creator were mined in the network’s infancy using what is now known as the “Patoshi Pattern,” a distinct mining fingerprint that has helped trace these early coins. Despite growing market speculation and price momentum, Nakamoto has never moved a single coin from this massive stash, further fueling the mystique surrounding their identity and long-term intentions. As Bitcoin’s institutional adoption continues to grow, entities like BlackRock and MicroStrategy now collectively hold more BTC than Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated stash. While Tesla’s 11,509 BTC may not rival these giants, its steadfast commitment to holding Bitcoin as a corporate asset reflects a broader shift among public companies embracing digital currencies. Yet, the absence of fiduciary responsibility sets Nakamoto’s untouched holdings apart, unlike corporations whose Bitcoin reserves are subject to regulatory oversight and shareholder scrutiny. Interestingly, MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor recently floated the idea of permanently removing access to BTC by destroying private keys after death. Hence, in a market shaped by both institutional control and mythical origins, the tension between utility and ownership continues to define Bitcoin’s evolving narrative.

The mysterious creator of Bitcoin now sits on a fortune worth over $100 billion, as the cryptocurrency’s price climbed back above $94,000 this week. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor who disappeared from public view more than a decade ago, holds approximately 1.1 million Bitcoin, according to data from analytics platform Arkham. If Satoshi were a public figure today, their net worth would rank them 16th on Forbes’ list of billionaires worldwide. This would position Bitcoin’s inventor above prominent business personalities such as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and computer mogul Michael Dell. The value of these Bitcoin holdings reached a high of $120 billion when Bitcoin hit its all-time high in January before falling during the recent market correction. Perhaps most salient in the wealth of Satoshi is just how little money he has utilized. Studies demonstrate that of what’s estimated as 1.1 million Bitcoins residing in the dormant wallets, merely 907 BTC have actually ever been disbursed. Mining from Satoshi had, by and by, reached its end when the singularly patterned mode of mining labeled as the “Patoshi pattern” closed with block number 54,316 during May 2010. Such a defining technical signature has aided researchers following the early mine works of Satoshi throughout over 22,000 blocks. Bitcoin momentarily traded at $94,400 before settling at a slightly lower price, a monthly high. This is a 25% recovery from its recent fall to $74,400 in the first part of this month, the lowest since November 2024. As the value of Bitcoin rises, long-term holders are watching their investments increase again. Whereas Satoshi’s holdings are still the biggest single Bitcoin hoard, institutional investors are closing in. Bitcoin ETFs collectively now hold almost as much Bitcoin as Satoshi, with total holdings worth about $104 billion. BlackRock is the leading ETF providers with Bitcoin holdings of $50 billion, followed by Grayscale with $17 billion. Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) is still accumulating and now holds 538,200 BTC worth nearly $50 billion. The ongoing absence of the founder of Bitcoin has raised so many questions regarding what happened to this massive cryptocurrency wealth. In its analysis, Whale Alert states Satoshi potentially mined as much as 1,125,150 BTC before he vanished from the Bitcoin world. Whether such coins will ever be moved is still one of the largest cryptocurrency enigmas. Traders keep a close eye on these sleeping wallets since any unusual activity may have a noticeable effect on Bitcoin prices and conceivably give information regarding Satoshi Nakamoto’s whereabouts or identity.

Title: WealthTech, Retirement And Investing Predictions For 2025 And Beyond

ByEric Satz ByEric Satz, Forbes Councils Member. Eric Satz is Founder and CEO of AltoIRA, which provides investment access with retirement savings to private market assets for all. Investors have faced highly volatile and stressful conditions to start 2025, with considerable stock market losses. The ongoing challenges could encourage investors to consider a different approach for allocating their retirement dollars, including alternative assets. In 2024, demand for alternative investments grew dramatically from retail and institutional investors looking to bolster returns and improve portfolio diversification. Private market asset managers are now pursuing the retail channel, so increased supply and demand are meeting in the middle. In addition, new technology platforms opened access to private markets that previously were only available to the very wealthy. I expect these trends to continue and accelerate in the coming years due to increasing investor education, ongoing stock market uncertainty and changing regulatory conditions. For the typical retail investor, most of their portfolio is in a retirement plan such as a 401(k) or individual retirement account (IRA). Most brokers and banks only allow IRA investing in traditional market assets like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. However, investors can use a self-directed IRA custodian to invest their retirement savings in a variety of alternative asset classes, such as private equity, private credit and venture capital. Self-directed IRAs also allow direct investments in cryptocurrencies, which had a moment given the record prices reached by certain coins early this year. I expect the industry to raise more awareness of the different ways to access alternatives in an investment portfolio, including through self-directed IRAs. These accounts can be opened online in minutes. Ultimately, investors want control over their retirement investments, and we’re likely going to see an increase in investors learning how to do so through self-directed IRAs in the years ahead. I expect more traditional industry players, including large retail brokers and financial advisors, to engage with the alts space over the next year as they respond to investor demand. For example, numerous brokers launched crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024, such as Fidelity, BlackRock and Invesco. Financial advisors are also constantly seeking ways to improve asset allocation and portfolio results for their clients. A KKR study found that a portfolio with an allocation of 40% stocks, 30% bonds and 30% alts had a higher annual return than the standard 60/40 stock and bond portfolio from 1927 to 2021. Financial advisors will shift their recommendations to match new research, but they need help doing so. Brokers and advisors who are new to alts could lean on those specializing in this space, such as the recent partnership between the Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA) Association and the Financial Planning Association (FPA), to share educational materials. In the past, the alts sector was mostly a manual process and didn’t leverage technology; think pen and paper and fax machines. While this approach made sense when these investments were only for a few high-net-worth individuals, it no longer works for investors in the digital era. Investors need a uniform platform where they can educate themselves, have access to a range of choices, evaluate decisions and then seamlessly execute investments. Ideally, platforms should be backed by human support. Investors are used to these digital platforms and tools for traditional public market-based assets and will expect them for alts, too. That same technology and digital experience should be easily accessed by financial advisors so they feel comfortable referring it to clients. Ultimately, the companies that engage investors with a user-friendly digital experience are the ones that will be better positioned to grow. Over the last few years, the regulatory landscape has become difficult for fund managers, financial advisors and investors to navigate. Government agencies are targeting the industry with more scrutiny and enforcement. That still holds for the time being. While firms seek opportunities to grow and innovate in the alternative investment space, compliance must remain a priority. Things have been slowly moving in a different direction for alts, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving crypto ETFs, but barriers remain. In addition, if the Fed resumes decreasing interest rates, investor confidence may increase, specifically for private equity and venture capital, leading to increased investment demand. This could create further political pressure from investors to push the regulatory landscape in a different direction. I believe demand for alts will continue to grow as investors realize the potential diversification and investment value of these assets. The industry will adopt more user-friendly wealth tech platforms, both for individual investors and their advisors. While regulatory challenges remain, I am cautiously optimistic that the evolving policy landscape may create a more supportive environment for alternative investments. The coming years should continue expanding access to investment opportunities that were once limited to the ultra-wealthy. Investors exploring alternatives can work with their financial advisors to determine how these options might fit into their long-term retirement planning.

Would you offer insurance when expecting low odds of a claim being made? Most likely, you would, while pocketing the premium without a second thought. Bitcoin (BTC) traders are doing something similar in the Deribit-listed BTC options market, hinting at bullish price expectations. Recently, an increasing number of traders have been selling (writing) BTC put options, likened to providing insurance against price drops in exchange for a small upfront premium. They are implementing this strategy in a cash-secured manner by holding a corresponding amount in stablecoins, ensuring they can buy BTC if the market declines and the put buyer decides to exercise his right to sell BTC at the predetermined higher price. This strategy enables traders to collect premiums (paid by put buyers) while potentially accumulating bitcoin if the options are exercised. In other words, it's the expression of a long-term bullish sentiment. "There is a notable increase in cash-secured put selling using stablecoins—another sign of a more mature, long-term approach to BTC accumulation and a continued expression of bullish sentiment," Deribit's Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen told CoinDesk. Chen said BTC holders are also selling higher strike call options to collect premiums and generate additional yield on top of their coin stash, which is weighing over Deribit's DVOL index, which measures the 30-day BTC implied volatility. The index has dropped from 63 to 48 since the April 7 panic selling in BTC to $75K, according to data from the charting platform TradingView. "We observe that investors remain long-term bullish on BTC, particularly among crypto-native “holders” who are willing to hold through market cycles," Chen said. Bitcoin's price has risen to over $92,000 since the early month slide to $75,000, supposedly on the back of haven demand and renewed institutional adoption narrative. The sharp price recovery has seen BTC options risk reversals reset to suggest a bias for call options across time frames, according to data source Amberdata. Over the past two days, traders have specifically snapped up calls at strike $95,000, $100,000 and $135,000 via the over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm. As of writing, the $100,000 strike call was the most popular option play on Deribit, with a notional open interest of over $1.6 billion. Just how important it is to track flows in the options market can be explained by the fact that the cumulative delta in Deribit's BTC options and options tied to the U.S.-listed BlackRock spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and its peers was $9 billion as of Wednesday, according to data tracked by Volmex. The data indicates heightened sensitivity of options to changes in BTC's price, suggesting potential for price volatility. Delta, one of the metrics used by sophisticated market participants to manage risk, measures how much the price (premium) of an options contract is likely to change in response to the $1 chance in the price of the underlying asset, in this case, BTC. So, the cumulative delta of $9 billion represents the total sensitivity of all outstanding BTC and bitcoin ETF options to changes in the spot price. As of Wednesday, the total notional value of all outstanding options contracts was $43 billion. Such large data or sensitivity to price swings in the underlying asset means market makers and traders actively engage in hedging strategies to mitigate their risks. Market makers, or those mandated to provide order book liquidity, are known to add to price volatility through their constant effort to maintain a net directional neutral exposure. "Option deltas have increased to record levels as open interest grew and strike deltas shifted significantly. Option market makers are actively hedging this delta exposure, driven by substantial new positions and notable shifts in strike pricing," Volmex noted on X. According to Volmex, crypto-native options traders over Deribit are positioned more bullishly than those trading options tied to IBIT.

The three-year agreement aims to help increase savings for U.K. households. The Blackrock Foundation, the philanthropic arm of BlackRock Inc., has committed 1.5 million pounds ($2 million) to support Nest Insight, a public-benefit research and innovation center in the U.K. The foundation reported the three year-partnership agreement will focus on using BlackRock’s Emergency Savings Initiative, launched in 2019, to help boost savings and improve financial security for millions of British households. The Emergency Savings Initiative is funded with $50 million and has the goal of spurring “innovation that enables people to establish a stronger financial safety net.” According to the foundation, the collaboration aims to work with regulators and support employers to launch more opt-out savings plans for U.K. workers. According to Nest Insight, its recent research demonstrates that an “opt-out approach to saving could make a significant impact on the UK’s savings gaps.” Its research found that approximately 25% of adults in the U.K. have less than 100 pounds in savings, and its opt-out pilot program indicated that 70% of workers are beginning to save. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  An opt-out approach involves employees being automatically enrolled in a savings account through payroll contributions unless they choose to opt out. The foundation’s research indicated that workers save more if they are required to request unenrollment from a savings program, rather being required to sign up for one, the foundation reported. “If they want to start saving, they don’t need to do anything,” the Nest Insight stated. “Everything is done for them. Only people who don’t want to save have to take action.” Related Stories: U.K. Nest Pension Auto Enrollment Remains ‘Robust’ With Assets at $11.2B, UK’s Nest to Make Domestic Investments More Transparent Nest to Acquire 10% Stake in IFM Investors in Alts Buildout Tags: BlackRock, BlackRock Foundation, Emergency Savings Initiative, Nest Insight « Moody’s, MSCI to Launch Private Credit Risk Modelling Tool
