In a recent interview with Decrypt, Kerbrat said that blockchains could one day be used to help startup founders raise capital in a transparent way that helps them preserve control. However, under current rules in the U.S., 90% of the population wouldn’t be able to participate—because they don’t, for example, make more than $200,000 a year. Typically, as a company goes from a passion project to publicly traded firm, venture capitalists and private equity firms help raise funds along the way. When it comes to listing on a stock exchange, investment banks also play a significant role, underwriting the offering, and as Kerbrat described it, commanding a “huge banking fee.” According to Kerbrat, a founder risks losing control through share dilution, among other factors, as intermediaries extend their services on the company’s path to an eventual IPO. On top of that, venues like the Nasdaq often charge their own exchange fee, he added. “These steps are just middlemen that are taking over the company, and not necessarily creating value for your customer, for your employee base, or anything like that,” he said. “We could bring, with tokenization, a new world to raising funds, where instead of launching a new coin, you could launch a new offering for your startup and raise funds on-chain.” With a regulatory backdrop that’s more supportive of innovation, Kerbrat said that Robinhood is well positioned to help startup founders bypass middlemen, leveraging its “huge retail platform” alongside its connections on the institutional side with market makers. Instead of basing an investor’s accreditation on factors like their salary, Kerbrat argued that “the checkpoint should be education” and whether investors are aware that early-stage investments carry outsized risk. In April, Kerbrat submitted a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission recommending that there should be knowledge-based tests and self-certification components to accreditation. “A new regulatory approach is needed to allow tokenization to flourish, and that system should be designed at a federal level to provide consistency to the marketplace,” the letter stated. Whether it’s stocks, bonds, or real estate, tokenization can refer to any asset that's represented with a token on-chain. Last month, crypto exchange Kraken said that it would begin offering users in Europe the ability to trade U.S.-listed stocks using Solana. Tokenization advocates, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, have focused on benefits beyond the potential democratization of markets. When he backed tokenization in 2022, his focus was on greater market efficiency and settlement that’s nearly instantaneous. “I think there are a lot of advantages, but right now, what is blocking us from this world is a lot of [outdated] rules,” Kerbrat said, underscoring that tech isn’t what’s holding tokenization back.

Title: Data centers are building their own gas power plants in Texas

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Abigail Lindsey worries the days of peace and quiet might be nearing an end at the rural, wooded property where she lives with her son. On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it. The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently proposed down the road. “It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.” The project is one of many others like it proposed in Texas, where a frantic race to boot up energy-hungry data centers has led many developers to plan their own gas-fired power plants rather than wait for connection to the state’s public grid. Egged on by supportive government policies, this build out promises to lock in strong gas demand for a generation to come. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How The data center and power plant planned across from Lindsey’s home is a partnership between an AI startup called CloudBurst and the natural gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer. It was Energy Transfer’s first-ever contract to supply gas for a data center, but not likely its last. In a press release, the company said it was “in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects this to be the first of many agreements.” Previously, conventional wisdom assumed that this new generation of digital infrastructure would be powered by emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar, and battery power, which have lately seen explosive growth. So far, that vision isn’t panning out as desires to build quickly overcome concerns about sustainability. “There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas. “Even the large hyperscalers are willing to turn a blind eye to their renewable goals for some period of time in order to get access.” IREN prioritizes renewable energy for its data centers—giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems that can be configured to produce crypto currency or generate artificial intelligence. In Texas, that’s only possible because the company began work here years ago, early enough to secure a timely connection to the state’s grid, Draper said. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How There were more than 2,000 active generation interconnection requests as of April 30, totaling 411,600 MW of capacity, according to grid operator ERCOT. A bill awaiting signature on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, S.B. 6, looks to filter out unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing a $100,000 fee for interconnection studies. Wind and solar farms require vast acreage and generate energy intermittently, so they work best as part of a diversified electrical grid that collectively provides power day and night. But as the AI gold rush gathered momentum, a surge of new project proposals has created yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, prompting many developers to bypass it and build their own power supply. Operating alone, a wind or solar farm can’t run a data center. Battery technologies still can’t store such large amounts of energy for the length of time required to provide steady, uninterrupted power for 24 hours per day as data centers require. Small nuclear reactors have been touted as a means to meet data center demand, but the first new units remain a decade from commercial deployment, while the AI boom is here today. Now, Draper said, gas companies approach IREN all the time offering to quickly provide additional power generation. Gas provides almost half of all power generation capacity in Texas, far more than any other source. But the amount of gas power in Texas has remained flat for 20 years, while wind and solar have grown sharply, according to records from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Facing a tidal wave of proposed AI projects, state lawmakers have taken steps to try to slow the expansion of renewable energy and position gas as the predominant supply for a new era of demand. This build-out promises strong demand and high gas prices for a generation to come, a boon to Texas’ fossil fuel industry, the largest in the nation. It also means more air pollution and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as the world continues to barrel past temperature records. Texas, with 9 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for about 15 percent of current gas-powered generation capacity in the country but 26 percent of planned future generation at the end of 2024, according to data from Global Energy Monitor. Both the current and planned shares are far more than any other state. GEM identified 42 new gas turbine projects under construction, in development or announced in Texas before the start of this year. None of those projects are sited at data centers. However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers. For gas companies, the boom in artificial intelligence has quickly become an unexpected gold mine. U.S. gas production has risen steadily over 20 years since the fracking boom began, but gas prices have tumbled since 2024, dragged down by surging supply and weak demand. “The sudden emergence of data center demand further brightens the outlook for the renaissance in gas pricing,” said a 2025 oil and gas outlook report by East Daley Analytics, a Colorado-based energy intelligence firm. “The obvious benefit to producers is increased drilling opportunities.” It forecast up to a 20 percent increase in U.S. gas production by 2030, driven primarily by a growing gas export sector on the Gulf Coast. Several large export projects will finish construction in coming years with demand for up to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day, the report said, while new power generation for data centers would account for 7 billion cubic feet per day of additional demand. That means profits for power providers, but also higher costs for consumers. Natural gas, a mixture primarily composed of methane, burns much cleaner than coal but still creates air pollution, including soot, some hazardous chemicals, and greenhouse gases. Unburned methane released into the atmosphere has more than 80 times the near-term warming effect of carbon dioxide, leading some studies to conclude that ubiquitous leaks in gas supply infrastructure make it as impactful as coal to the global climate. It’s a power source that’s heralded for its ability to get online fast, said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston. But the yearslong wait times for turbines have quickly become the industry’s largest constraint in an otherwise positive outlook. “If you’re looking at a five-year lead time, that’s not going to help Alexa or Siri today,” Hirs said. The reliance on gas power for data centers is a departure from previous thought, said Larry Fink, founder of global investment firm BlackRock, speaking to a crowd of industry executives at an oil and gas conference in Houston in March. About four years ago, if someone said they were building a data center, they said it must be powered by renewables, he recounted. Two years ago, it was a preference. “Today?” Fink said. “They care about power.” Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers. In the small city of Abilene, the builders of Stargate, one of the world’s largest data center projects, applied for permits in January to build 360 MW of gas power generation, authorized to emit 1.6 million tons of greenhouse gases and 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants per year. Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 MW of gas power generation capacity. Also in January, a startup called Sailfish announced ambitious plans for a 2,600-acre, 5,000 MW cluster of data centers in the tiny North Texas town of Tolar, population 940. “Traditional grid interconnections simply can’t keep pace with hyperscalers’ power demands, especially as AI accelerates energy requirements,” Sailfish founder Ryan Hughes told the website Data Center Dynamics at the time. “Our on-site natural gas power islands will let customers scale quickly.” CloudBurst and Energy Transfer announced their data center and power plant outside New Braunfels in February, and another company partnership also announced plans for a 250 MW gas plant and data center near Odessa in West Texas. In May, a developer called Tract announced a 1,500-acre, 2,000 MW data center campus with some on-site generation and some purchased gas power near the small Central Texas town of Lockhart. Not all new data centers need gas plants. A 120 MW South Texas data center project announced in April would use entirely wind power, while an enormous, 5,000 MW megaproject outside Laredo announced in March hopes to eventually run entirely on private wind, solar, and hydrogen power (though it will use gas at first). Another collection of six data centers planned in North Texas hopes to draw 1,400 MW from the grid. Altogether, Texas’ grid operator predicts statewide power demand will nearly double within five years, driven largely by data centers for artificial intelligence. It mirrors a similar situation unfolding across the country, according to analysis by S&P Global. “There is huge concern about the carbon footprint of this stuff,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin. “If we could decarbonize the power grid, then there is no carbon footprint for this.” However, despite massive recent expansions of renewable power generation, the boom in artificial intelligence appears to be moving the country farther from, not closer to, its decarbonization goals. Looking forward to a build out of power supply, state lawmakers have proposed or passed new rules to support deployment of more gas generation and slow the surging expansion of wind and solar power projects. Supporters of these bills say they aim to utilize Texas’ position as the nation’s top gas producer. Some energy experts say the rules proposed throughout the legislative session could dismantle the state’s leadership in renewables as well as the state’s ability to provide cheap and reliable power. “It absolutely would [slow] if not completely stop renewable energy,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant, about one of the proposed rules in March. “That would really be extremely harmful to the Texas economy.” While the bills deemed as “industry killers” for renewables missed key deadlines, failing to reach Abbott’s desk, they illustrate some lawmakers’ aspirations for the state’s energy industry. One failed bill, S.B. 388, would have required every watt of new solar brought online to be accompanied by a watt of new gas. Another set of twin bills, H.B. 3356 and S.B. 715, would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil-fuel based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating. When the legislature last met in 2023, it created a $5 billion public “energy fund” to finance new gas plants but not wind or solar farms. It also created a new tax abatement program that excluded wind and solar. This year’s budget added another $5 billion to double the fund. Among the lawmakers leading the effort to scale back the state’s deployment of renewables is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. One bill she co-sponsored, S.B. 819, aimed to create new siting rules for utility-scale renewable projects and would have required them to get permits from the Public Utility Commission that no other energy source — coal, gas, or nuclear — needs. “It’s just something that is clearly meant to kneecap an industry,” Lewin said about the bill, which failed to pass. Kolkhorst said the bill sought to balance the state’s need for power while respecting landowners across the state. Former state Rep. John Davis, now a board member at Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, said the session shows how renewables have become a red meat issue. More than 20 years ago, Davis and Kolkhorst worked together in the Capitol as Texas deregulated its energy market, which encouraged renewables to enter the grid’s mix, he said. Now Davis herds sheep and goats on his family’s West Texas ranch, where seven wind turbines provide roughly 40 percent of their income. He never could have dreamed how significant renewable energy would become for the state grid, he said. That’s why he’s disappointed with the direction the legislature is headed with renewables. “I can’t think of anything more conservative, as a conservative, than wind and solar,” Davis said. “These are things God gave us — use them and harness them.” A message from Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Title: Billionaire BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Warns $36,000,000,000,000 Debt Will ‘Overwhelm’ America Unless Stellar Economic Growth Achieved

The chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager just issued a dire warning, saying that the US will drown in debt unless the country finds a way to stimulate and grow the economy. Speaking at the 2025 Forbes Iconoclast Summit, Larry Fink details the remarkable pace at which the US has amassed an astronomical amount of debt. “After 223 years of being a nation in 2000, the [national debt] of the United States was $8 trillion. And in the last 25 years, both parties are guilty of this, [that number’s] now at $36 trillion. And now we have a pending tax bill that’s going to add $2.3 to $2.4 trillion on the back of that. If we don’t find a way to grow at 3% a year, real growth, we’re going to hit the wall.” Although the numbers are bleak, Fink believes the US can still climb out of its multi-trillion-dollar hole, outlining a number of steps that policymakers can take to spur real economic growth across multiple industries. “This is why we need to unlock more private capital… We need to be streamlining permitting, we need to be focused on rebuilding our infrastructure. If you believe that we’re going to be the leader in AI (artificial intelligence), we’re going to have, it’s estimated, a shortage of 500,000 electricians in this country. So, despite all of this pessimism, the foundation of growth is there. We just need to unlock it… If we cannot unlock that growth and if we’re going to continue to stumble along in a 2% economy, the [national debt is] going to overwhelm this country.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Henry Holterman: Dutch Midas found a 1 billion euro gold opportunity in Greece

Full Content:
Henry Holterman is a numbers man. In this invisible but fundamental universe there is no room for misinterpretation or sentimentality. So, by the numbers, the Dutch investor is among the most successful dealmakers of the last few decades in Greece. From the recent deal to sell his 9.75% stake in Alpha Bank, profitable transactions in GEK TERNA, Hellaktor and the capital gains from his holdings in Greece, both visible and hidden, are estimated to have so far earned a sum approaching €1 billion. They have been reported to have accumulated over the past few years, and in the meantime, the company has been able to report a total of more than 1 billion euros in assets to date. An impressive performance, but fully justified. Those who have met him speak of an absolutely disciplined investor, with a clear focus and a special ability to identify undervalued assets, making positions without loans and margins. In all cases of his investment moves in our country, those who have interacted with him say that he is a result-oriented person, who is not influenced by his thymic or ego, even in the tough races that have arisen. Just business, aiming for maximum profit. If others win along with it that’s fine, but it’s not an end in itself. The obstacles that appear in his path are an opportunity to rethink strategy and seek alternative moves to ensure a successful exit. No matter how long it takes. His moves reflect what he stands for in terms of investment. In early 2018 and in the midst of the shareholder civil war at Hellaktor, Holterman travelled by private plane to Athens at the invitation of the Kallitsantsis brothers who were seeking support for the proxy war that would shake the historic group, with the aim of overthrowing the then management of the construction group. The talks did not end positively, as did another venture, that of acquiring then Forthnet in partnership with the Odyssey-Athena group, but another opportunity had already arisen that brought him first a 10% and then a 30% stake in GEK Terna. He left the group of Mr George Peristeri after a long time but for an estimated €200 million. Having new firepower, he was placed in the Hellactor group and after more than two years of fierce competition, first with the Kallitsantsis side and later with the triumvirate of Kaymenakis – Bakos – Exarchos, he finally prevailed, having also secured a strong alliance with the Vardinoyannis group. This was followed by the asset sale of the once-mighty Hellactor group, which was done with mathematical sequence precision, and in 2021, when investment grade was still a distant goal for Greece, he invested in Alpha Bank. And while tons of ink had been spilled about how the Dutchman would become… a banker and increase his stake in the bank even further, he correctly interpreted the signs and decided to sell his stake, reaping a profit of more than €340 million. At the same time, he retains a 3.95% stake in Optima Bank, which he acquired in the IPO for €21 million, a stake currently valued at approximately €60 million. Holterman could be said to be the epitome of the “Dutch dream”, an expression that is, of course, incongruous because, given the journalistic cliché, such stories happen all the time in America. And yet, its trajectory to date has the characteristics of a story that would easily transfer to cinema. Born in 1955, after his studies, he began working as a chartered accountant. Legend has it that he was assigned to audit VolkerWessels, one of the largest and oldest Dutch groups active in construction and infrastructure, with Reggeborgh as its investment arm. At that time he meets and marries Herita, one of the two daughters of owner Dick Wessels. And Vessels, after all, started from the bottom. He worked in the carpentry business founded by his father, Arendt, in 1933. In 1968, at the age of 22, he took over management of the company and grew it rapidly, becoming one of the largest construction groups in Europe. In 2017, when Wessels passed away, he held third place on the list of the richest Dutchmen, with an estimated fortune of around €4 billion. Holterman took over the reins of the Vessels family business empire in 2017 after the death of his father-in-law. Reggeborgh, founded in 1990 to manage investments for the Dutch Vessel family, has now developed a portfolio of more than 20 companies in a variety of sectors, ranging from infrastructure and real estate to energy, medical research, and new technologies. The company operates in Europe and the Americas, and its portfolio includes companies such as Koninklijke VolkerWessels, DW Property, Prescan, Tesorio, and EVI. In total, the family’s assets are estimated at €15-20 billion. The Dutch investment fund also has significant investment positions, led by a 3.04% stake in ABN Amro Bank. Reggeborgh became the fifth largest shareholder in ABN Amro behind the Dutch state, US-based MFS Investment Management, Norwegian NBIM, and BlackRock. The fund had earlier sold ING its 17.6% stake in Dutch private asset manager Van Lanschot Kempen. Those who know Holterman associate his name with the description “gambler”. In Greek, the designation leaves room for many interpretations, but in the case of the Dutchman it can be said literally, as it captures his appeal for financial investments. However, one of these was destined to cause Holterman problems, which he successfully overcame and reaped significant gains, which would continue to happen in the future. Reggeborgh was among the original investors in the technology company World Online, retaining a significant stake at the time of its listing in 2000. After the IPO, however, its shares suffered a significant drop, causing losses for many investors, but not for Reggeborgh, as it was revealed that it had sold before the collapse. Holterman’s involvement with World Online also had legal ramifications, as the company’s founder, Nina Brink (aka Nina Storms) claimed €182 million from Reggeborgh, claiming it was owed to her under an agreement. The dispute lasted nearly two decades and was eventually settled out of court, with the Dutchman having said there was no wrongdoing in the company’s listing and that the responsibility for the losses lay with investors’ exaggerated expectations. Under Holterman, the family office made other profitable moves, despite being under the microscope of the supervisory authorities, and in addition to World Online, the family office made significant gains from the fibre-optic companies Reggefiber and Eurofiber, as well as the investment bank NIBC. At the same time, Greece enters his life, and surely even he would not have expected that in our country, he would discover a gold mine of goodwill that added about 1 billion euros to his fortune. About 25 years ago, together with his wife, Herita, they decided to buy a holiday home in Corfu. They acquired a magnificent property in Kassiopi, an area of unique natural beauty in the north of the island where, among others, are the holiday homes of the Rothschild family, German investor Yergk Rockenhizer (Permira), Rob Lucas (CVC Capital), and other super-rich. That’s when he met Mr. Nikos Dendia, one of the island’s best-known lawyers at the time, and long before the Corfiot lawyer, originally from Paxos, entered politics and was elected as a member of parliament. The Dendia law firm handled most of the cases of the Dutch businessman, who proved to be extremely active in investing in the country. Holterman’s ties with the Faiacs Island would prove strong in the process. He would buy a dream villa in the Kommeno area, and almost every summer, he would enjoy the beauty and refined gastronomy of Corfu. From there, he gazes at the green and blue of the bay of Gouvia, which is often crossed by the “Guilty”, the famous boat of the Ioannou family, who also maintain a holiday home in the same area. Of course, Holterman knows his way around a yacht himself, having years ago acquired the 47-metre yacht “Lars” built at the well-known Italian shipyard Sanlorenzo. However, a few years ago, he put it up for sale for 24 million euros, and it eventually changed hands for an undisclosed price. Unlike the sea, land seems to be the great love of the now 70-year-old businessman. The properties he has acquired in Corfu, as well as in Athens, are just as unique as the equity investments he has made in the country. One could say that the real estate purchases he has made reflect his investment philosophy. These were properties with excellent location and characteristics, just waiting for someone to bring out their value. A typical example is the historic “Corfu Palace” hotel, which he bought, it was reported, for €30 million from the Fokas family. The hotel started operating in 1962 and is literally in a prime location in the island town, but it has gone from periods of glory to periods of decline, as it required heavy maintenance and renovation, which was done intermittently and never completely. The “Corfu Palace” in the hands of the Dutchman is now being completely renovated, in an investment of 20 million euros, and when it reopens in 2026, it will claim a good slice of the luxury hoteling pie on the cosmopolitan island. Two years ago, it also acquired just two blocks from the “Corfu Palace,” another neoclassical building overlooking Garitsa Bay, totalling 1,000 square metres, at a price of more than 2 million euros. Five years ago, he appeared to have acquired in Corfu and the famous Red House or Antico Rosso, for 8 million euros. It is a property of stunning beauty with a 17th-century mansion built on the ruins of a 13th-century monastery. It belonged to the Kourkoumeli-Rodostamos family, one of the oldest on the island, united by the marriage of Nikolaos Rodostamos and Maria, sister of Ioannis Kapodistrias. Those who know him say that from the first moment, he loved Corfu, and he constantly makes sure to prove it. He has made donations to the island’s hospital, the Coast Guard, the Police, supports the Center for the Disabled “Melissa” and the Corfu ambulance, but also non-profit organizations, sports clubs, and federations through Hellaktor. In 2022, he, his wife, and their son were honorary naturalized Greek citizens. The properties he has acquired in Corfu are not the only ones, as he has also made several purchases in Athens. In the capital, real estate insiders say Holterman has built up a substantial property portfolio, part of which was acquired by REDS, which paid €80 million to acquire Athens Properties from Holding Greece B.V., a company managed by the Holterman family. Hestia Luxury Apartments, a subsidiary of Athens Properties B.V., manages 10 fully renovated buildings in prime locations. It also owns other properties, in addition to those in Corfu and those owned by Hellaktor. Real estate, moreover, is one of his favorite investments. In the Netherlands, the couple Henry and Herita reside in an understated luxury residence in Holden, a picturesque town known for its natural beauty and the Sallandse Heuvelrug National Park. When it was acquired, it was worth under 1 million, while today it is priced several times that. His penchant for investing in real estate leads many to conclude that his next step after his successful deals in Greece with GEK Terna, Hellactor, and Alpha Bank will be real estate, specifically the creation of a property management company. Hellactor, following the sale of its assets (most recently Aktor Concessions), now has, through REDS, its most important asset, Alimos Marina, although there have been reports that its sale has been discussed, which remains to be seen if it is true. REDS, on the other hand, has agreed to sell to Dimand two of its very important projects, the project at Gournes in Heraklion, Crete, and the Cambas Project at Kantza, Pallini. The company still has several assets in Greece and abroad, with REDS getting into hotels as well, as together with SWOT they have entered into a 25-year lease of the hotel property on Kifissia Avenue (formerly “Civitel”), owned by the Hellenic Olympic Committee, which they are renovating, while they are also expected to collaborate on “Corfu Palace”. What is certain is that a few days ago, REDS Hospitality was established by the parent company REDS, owned by Hellaktor, in order to operate in the wider hospitality sector. In addition to the Hestia Luxury Apartments properties and hotels, other moves are being prepared, and it is no coincidence that REDS is participating in the ETAD’s tender for the long-term lease of Vouliagmeni Beach in a joint venture with the Melissanidis family’s Aegean Warehouses. These are the facts, with real estate coming to the fore. Beyond that, Reggeborgh, after selling its stake in Alpha Bank, said it will continue to invest in Greece. However, this is not 2018, when valuations were still low, the economy has taken the investment grade, and the stock market has hit 15-year highs again.

Retail Bob Etchingham Businessman Bob Etchingham, who founded Irish forecourt giant Applegreen, has resigned as a director of artisan food chain The Butler’s Pantry. The resignation has followed reports last year that the business had been sold. Both Bob and Sarah Etchingham resigned as directors from The Butler’s Pantry Holdings last week, a business the Applegreen chairman’s Belgrave Capital had owned. The pair remain as directors of The Butler’s Pantry (Manufacturing) Ltd. In December, accounts released by The Butler’s Pantry Holdings said the company was due to change hands at the end of 2024. Reports linked Natural Bakery owner Luke Creighan with the acquisition, but this was never confirmed. He is now the sole director of The Butler’s Pantry Holdings. “The new owners expect to derive synergies by incorporating The Butler’s Pantry Holdings Limited into their existing business and thereby improve the trading performance of the company,” the accounts read. The accounts said a share purchase agreement for the business was made with a third party on May 10, 2024. Creighan was appointed as a director later that same month. Creighan has built up a reputation in the franchising space, owning some Eurospar stores and Insomnia and Four Star Pizza franchises. He founded The Natural Bakery in 2013 and has since expanded it to 10 locations. The Sunday Independent attempted to email Creighan and a separate employee of The Natural Bakery to ask if he had bought The Butler’s Pantry but did not receive a response. Etchingham declined to comment. Etchingham first joined The Butler’s Pantry as a director in March 2016, building up a stake in the business through a separate investment company, Appletreewick Nominees. In 2019, Appletreewick increased its stake to 75pc in The Butler’s Pantry Holdings. It put €3.6m into the company around the same time as last May’s share purchase agreement. Etchingham made his millions with Applegreen, which was taken private by Blackstone Infrastructure Partners in a deal worth €718.1m back in December 2020. The Butler’s Pantry was set up in 1987 by Eileen Bergin and opened its first outlet on Mount Merrion Avenue in Blackrock. Jacquie Marsh subsequently took it over. The Butler’s Pantry 2023 accounts show a loss of €1.15m. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/07/2025 10:37:13 AM PDT by george76 Leaving the port of Darwin in Chinese hands would bestow on Beijing a golden opportunity to make mischief for Australia and its allies. Hooroo, China! Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is evidently making good on an election campaign pledge to reclaim the Port of Darwin, a harbor in Australia’s Northern Territory, from Chinese control. The Chinese firm Landbridge has operated the port since 2015 under a 99-year lease. Last week the American private-equity firm Cerberus voiced interest in leasing the port from Canberra. Albanese cited national security grounds for breaking the lease. Why Darwin Matters.. Why does Chinese control over Darwin’s port matter? First and foremost, Darwin occupies prime real estate. Maritime historian Alfred Thayer Mahan fashioned a trio of metrics to help naval officialdom judge the worth of any strategic position, chiefly candidate sites for naval bases. “Situation,” or geographic position, meant a site’s proximity to something naval commanders wanted to influence—a hostile base, an important seacoast, or a strategic waterway. “Strength” connoted some combination of natural and manmade defenses to hold enemies at bay. “Resources” referred to the port’s or surrounding countryside’s ability to furnish warships with fuel, ammunition, and stores of all types. Darwin measures up handily by Mahanian standards in all three metrics—strategic position in particular. It is Australia’s northernmost major harbor, situated along an outcropping of land jutting toward the rim of the South China Sea. Maritime forces stationed there enjoy a central position just outside the southerly arc of Asia’s first island chain, which meanders from Japan through Taiwan, the Philippine Islands, and the Indonesian archipelago before terminating at the Strait of Malacca. Of particular note, the Sunda and Lombok straits, the best alternative passages to Malacca, lie within reach of Darwin. Darwin Port’s fortunate position affords ships and aircraft liberty of horizontal movement. They can range from side to side on the map, helping seal off the first island chain to Chinese maritime and air movement. They also enjoy vertical access to the South China Sea, one of Asia’s and the world’s most embattled expanses. Small wonder, then, that some 2,500 US Marines from the I Marine Expeditionary Force now rotate through the port on an annual basis. Among other functions, these Marines are honing tactics for access denial while helping beleaguered allies like the Philippines uphold their nautical rights in the face of Chinese gray-zone aggression. On occasion, Darwin has also played host to US Navy attack submarines. Just this March, for instance, the attack boat USS Minnesota, accompanied by submarine tender Emory S. Land, put into the harbor for a port call. In short, Darwin occupies a strategic position of great price while boasting resources adequate to support seagoing forces. Leaving the port in Chinese hands would bestow on Beijing a golden opportunity to make mischief for Australia and its allies. At a bare minimum, Chinese observers could gather intelligence on Australian Defense Force and allied comings and goings while abetting net assessment of allied capabilities, tactics, techniques, and procedures. In so doing, they help acquaint the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with potential foes, the first step toward defeating them. Nor is it farfetched to imagine Chinese port operators slow-rolling—or, more likely, actively hampering—allied military movements and resupply in wartime. Bear in mind that there is no such thing as an apolitical agreement with a Chinese company. Politics permeates everything in China; politics is warfare without bloodshed for the Chinese Communist Party; and domestic law obliges all Chinese firms, state-owned or not, to comply with party mandates on matters relating to national security. In other words, businesses constitute a geopolitical cudgel for Beijing as surely as the PLA does. And the party wields that weapon with zest on a 24/7/365 basis. So, kudos to Prime Minister Albanese for reasserting friendly dominion over Darwin Port. America Must Secure the Panama Canal, Too.. Not all maritime positions are created equal, as the Mahanian formula for gauging their value indicates. For instance, Darwin is less geopolitically pivotal than the Panama Canal, whose Pacific and Caribbean terminuses were, until recently, operated by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holding. Last winter, the Trump administration successfully pressured the Hong Kong firm to transfer the leases to a consortium including BlackRock Inc. If the Panamanian government approves the transaction—it remains in limbo for the time being—the strategically situated waterway will, in effect, come under American control. That matters because of a fourth index of a strategic position’s value that Mahan did not explicitly incorporate into his formula—namely, alternatives. If there is no alternative to a position, it commands peerless value. Hawai’i, which sits alone in the vacant Eastern Pacific, is one such site. There are relatively accessible alternatives to Darwin for Australia-based forces, though none so convenient for coping with today’s strategic seascape. The only alternatives to the Panama Canal for the United States are the Northwest Passage, skirting the Arctic flanks of Alaska and Canada, or around Cape Horn, circumnavigating South America. But the Northwest Passage route is largely impractical for naval maneuver, while the Cape Horn passage is slow, burdensome, and weather-beaten. Both routes encumber strategic mobility. Geopolitics maven Nicholas Spykman observed that digging the Panama Canal in effect rewrote Western Hemisphere maritime geography. In practical terms, by sparing merchantmen and ships of war the long voyage around South America, artificially modifying geography teleported American east-coast ports thousands of miles closer to East Asia. Traders could now compete with European rivals on a more equal footing because merchant ships’ journeys to Pacific trading partners were comparable in length and duration. Just as important, the US Navy could swing forces from side to side through the Caribbean Sea, concentrating and reconcentrating fleets in whichever ocean the leadership deemed most in need. If it persists, Chinese control of the canal threatens to repeal Spykman’s geographical revolution. Like Anthony Albanese, Donald Trump was wise to usher China away from crucial marine geography. Here’s hoping fellow leaders around the world follow suit, rethinking Chinese control of their seaports. After all, Mahan depicts sea power as a “chain” connecting domestic manufacturing—via domestic seaports—with foreign harbors across the sea. Economic prosperity and martial prowess depend on ports. A country that cedes control of its ports to China grants Beijing the option to snap its sea-power chain. Deliberately empowering an antagonist in this way courts ruin. Don’t let China break the chain.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Why does Chinese control over Darwin’s port matter? First and foremost, Darwin occupies prime real estate. Maritime historian Alfred Thayer Mahan fashioned a trio of metrics to help naval officialdom judge the worth of any strategic position, chiefly candidate sites for naval bases. “Situation,” or geographic position, meant a site’s proximity to something naval commanders wanted to influence—a hostile base, an important seacoast, or a strategic waterway. “Strength” connoted some combination of natural and manmade defenses to hold enemies at bay. “Resources” referred to the port’s or surrounding countryside’s ability to furnish warships with fuel, ammunition, and stores of all types. Darwin measures up handily by Mahanian standards in all three metrics—strategic position in particular. It is Australia’s northernmost major harbor, situated along an outcropping of land jutting toward the rim of the South China Sea. Maritime forces stationed there enjoy a central position just outside the southerly arc of Asia’s first island chain, which meanders from Japan through Taiwan, the Philippine Islands, and the Indonesian archipelago before terminating at the Strait of Malacca. Of particular note, the Sunda and Lombok straits, the best alternative passages to Malacca, lie within reach of Darwin. Darwin Port’s fortunate position affords ships and aircraft liberty of horizontal movement. They can range from side to side on the map, helping seal off the first island chain to Chinese maritime and air movement. They also enjoy vertical access to the South China Sea, one of Asia’s and the world’s most embattled expanses. Small wonder, then, that some 2,500 US Marines from the I Marine Expeditionary Force now rotate through the port on an annual basis. Among other functions, these Marines are honing tactics for access denial while helping beleaguered allies like the Philippines uphold their nautical rights in the face of Chinese gray-zone aggression. On occasion, Darwin has also played host to US Navy attack submarines. Just this March, for instance, the attack boat USS Minnesota, accompanied by submarine tender Emory S. Land, put into the harbor for a port call. In short, Darwin occupies a strategic position of great price while boasting resources adequate to support seagoing forces. Leaving the port in Chinese hands would bestow on Beijing a golden opportunity to make mischief for Australia and its allies. At a bare minimum, Chinese observers could gather intelligence on Australian Defense Force and allied comings and goings while abetting net assessment of allied capabilities, tactics, techniques, and procedures. In so doing, they help acquaint the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) with potential foes, the first step toward defeating them. Nor is it farfetched to imagine Chinese port operators slow-rolling—or, more likely, actively hampering—allied military movements and resupply in wartime. Bear in mind that there is no such thing as an apolitical agreement with a Chinese company. Politics permeates everything in China; politics is warfare without bloodshed for the Chinese Communist Party; and domestic law obliges all Chinese firms, state-owned or not, to comply with party mandates on matters relating to national security. In other words, businesses constitute a geopolitical cudgel for Beijing as surely as the PLA does. And the party wields that weapon with zest on a 24/7/365 basis. So, kudos to Prime Minister Albanese for reasserting friendly dominion over Darwin Port. America Must Secure the Panama Canal, Too.. Not all maritime positions are created equal, as the Mahanian formula for gauging their value indicates. For instance, Darwin is less geopolitically pivotal than the Panama Canal, whose Pacific and Caribbean terminuses were, until recently, operated by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holding. Last winter, the Trump administration successfully pressured the Hong Kong firm to transfer the leases to a consortium including BlackRock Inc. If the Panamanian government approves the transaction—it remains in limbo for the time being—the strategically situated waterway will, in effect, come under American control. That matters because of a fourth index of a strategic position’s value that Mahan did not explicitly incorporate into his formula—namely, alternatives. If there is no alternative to a position, it commands peerless value. Hawai’i, which sits alone in the vacant Eastern Pacific, is one such site. There are relatively accessible alternatives to Darwin for Australia-based forces, though none so convenient for coping with today’s strategic seascape. The only alternatives to the Panama Canal for the United States are the Northwest Passage, skirting the Arctic flanks of Alaska and Canada, or around Cape Horn, circumnavigating South America. But the Northwest Passage route is largely impractical for naval maneuver, while the Cape Horn passage is slow, burdensome, and weather-beaten. Both routes encumber strategic mobility. Geopolitics maven Nicholas Spykman observed that digging the Panama Canal in effect rewrote Western Hemisphere maritime geography. In practical terms, by sparing merchantmen and ships of war the long voyage around South America, artificially modifying geography teleported American east-coast ports thousands of miles closer to East Asia. Traders could now compete with European rivals on a more equal footing because merchant ships’ journeys to Pacific trading partners were comparable in length and duration. Just as important, the US Navy could swing forces from side to side through the Caribbean Sea, concentrating and reconcentrating fleets in whichever ocean the leadership deemed most in need. If it persists, Chinese control of the canal threatens to repeal Spykman’s geographical revolution. Like Anthony Albanese, Donald Trump was wise to usher China away from crucial marine geography. Here’s hoping fellow leaders around the world follow suit, rethinking Chinese control of their seaports. After all, Mahan depicts sea power as a “chain” connecting domestic manufacturing—via domestic seaports—with foreign harbors across the sea. Economic prosperity and martial prowess depend on ports. A country that cedes control of its ports to China grants Beijing the option to snap its sea-power chain. Deliberately empowering an antagonist in this way courts ruin.

America Must Secure the Panama Canal, Too.. Not all maritime positions are created equal, as the Mahanian formula for gauging their value indicates. For instance, Darwin is less geopolitically pivotal than the Panama Canal, whose Pacific and Caribbean terminuses were, until recently, operated by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holding. Last winter, the Trump administration successfully pressured the Hong Kong firm to transfer the leases to a consortium including BlackRock Inc. If the Panamanian government approves the transaction—it remains in limbo for the time being—the strategically situated waterway will, in effect, come under American control. That matters because of a fourth index of a strategic position’s value that Mahan did not explicitly incorporate into his formula—namely, alternatives. If there is no alternative to a position, it commands peerless value. Hawai’i, which sits alone in the vacant Eastern Pacific, is one such site. There are relatively accessible alternatives to Darwin for Australia-based forces, though none so convenient for coping with today’s strategic seascape. The only alternatives to the Panama Canal for the United States are the Northwest Passage, skirting the Arctic flanks of Alaska and Canada, or around Cape Horn, circumnavigating South America. But the Northwest Passage route is largely impractical for naval maneuver, while the Cape Horn passage is slow, burdensome, and weather-beaten. Both routes encumber strategic mobility. Geopolitics maven Nicholas Spykman observed that digging the Panama Canal in effect rewrote Western Hemisphere maritime geography. In practical terms, by sparing merchantmen and ships of war the long voyage around South America, artificially modifying geography teleported American east-coast ports thousands of miles closer to East Asia. Traders could now compete with European rivals on a more equal footing because merchant ships’ journeys to Pacific trading partners were comparable in length and duration. Just as important, the US Navy could swing forces from side to side through the Caribbean Sea, concentrating and reconcentrating fleets in whichever ocean the leadership deemed most in need. If it persists, Chinese control of the canal threatens to repeal Spykman’s geographical revolution. Like Anthony Albanese, Donald Trump was wise to usher China away from crucial marine geography. Here’s hoping fellow leaders around the world follow suit, rethinking Chinese control of their seaports. After all, Mahan depicts sea power as a “chain” connecting domestic manufacturing—via domestic seaports—with foreign harbors across the sea. Economic prosperity and martial prowess depend on ports.

Yes, unfortunately they’re still out there free when they should be rotting in a frozen gulag or fertilizing an unmarked field somewhere. I get that. However, if you’ve been tracking the elitist cabal as long as I have you might have noticed a sudden and abrupt shift in public activity among the most prominent globalist institutions. From at least 2019 onward the mask had come completely off. The elites were flooding western media with woke propaganda through their NGO operations. You couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with multiculturalism, DEI and LGBT nonsense. There was a clear attempt to engineer a massive cultural shift in the western world; an expedited progressive coup. Conservatives were relentlessly targeted as “insurrectionists” and a “threat to democracy”. Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

It's a load of crap. Russia has its hands completely full with Ukraine alone at this point, and the last thing it wants to do is to pull NATO into the war as an active belligerent. Russia also is smart enough to know that the use of nuclear weapons, even so-called tactical nuclear weapons, would not only make it an international pariah, but would poison some of its own people. 15 posted on 06/07/2025 11:54:47 AM PDT by Bruce Campbells Chin ( ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: frithguild Excellent. Closed minds will reject every sentence when their worldview is challenged and but they will realize that they are caught up in this supporting it. Those who have realized the never ending wars and War, Inc. was in itself the coup attempt, we have been vocal about US involvement in NATO and this Project Ukraine. USAID was the end of the Global Homo Agenda and the Homsexual/LGBT movement here at home. The race baiting industry has collasped without lawsuits for injury and public funds to pay fines. The Hate Industry is still alive in the US and across the West. The politics of Hate has divided individuals, countries and the world - you can almost trace it’s ugly emergance on the world scene with Obama’s presidency as it errupted in the States. I have been overseas since 1999 when Obama was election and did not return to live until 2011 - gone for 12 years and I didn’t recognize the US when I got home. The racist hate was everywhere. I had gone from working with all races oversea to returning to a country where race defined benefits, schooling and even if you could be a racist - how the American people were lulled into this is anyone’s guess. But the fear of the elites across the west is evident. 16 posted on 06/07/2025 11:58:40 AM PDT by Jumper [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: DIRTYSECRET They killed Sadat.

The reason that Russian and USA and NATO strategic bombers are parked in plain sight is so Russian and USA spy satellites can keep track of the exact number that exist. This tracking system is part of nuclear weapon agreements signed by Russia, USA, and NATO. The bombers Ukraine destroyed are part of Russia's nuclear arsenal. It is likely that NONE of the destroyed Russian planes ever dropped a conventional bomb on Ukraine. If NATO or USA intelligence assisted Ukraine in this attack, that is INSANE provocation against Russia. 19 posted on 06/07/2025 12:16:16 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Russia also is smart enough to know that the use of nuclear weapons, even so-called tactical nuclear weapons, would not only make it an international pariah, but would poison some of its own people. 15 posted on 06/07/2025 11:54:47 AM PDT by Bruce Campbells Chin ( ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: frithguild Excellent.

The Hate Industry is still alive in the US and across the West. The politics of Hate has divided individuals, countries and the world - you can almost trace it’s ugly emergance on the world scene with Obama’s presidency as it errupted in the States. I have been overseas since 1999 when Obama was election and did not return to live until 2011 - gone for 12 years and I didn’t recognize the US when I got home. The racist hate was everywhere. I had gone from working with all races oversea to returning to a country where race defined benefits, schooling and even if you could be a racist - how the American people were lulled into this is anyone’s guess.

The reason that Russian and USA and NATO strategic bombers are parked in plain sight is so Russian and USA spy satellites can keep track of the exact number that exist. This tracking system is part of nuclear weapon agreements signed by Russia, USA, and NATO. The bombers Ukraine destroyed are part of Russia's nuclear arsenal. It is likely that NONE of the destroyed Russian planes ever dropped a conventional bomb on Ukraine. If NATO or USA intelligence assisted Ukraine in this attack, that is INSANE provocation against Russia. 19 posted on 06/07/2025 12:16:16 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Yes, unfortunately they’re still out there free when they should be rotting in a frozen gulag or fertilizing an unmarked field somewhere. I get that. However, if you’ve been tracking the elitist cabal as long as I have you might have noticed a sudden and abrupt shift in public activity among the most prominent globalist institutions. From at least 2019 onward the mask had come completely off. The elites were flooding western media with woke propaganda through their NGO operations. You couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with multiculturalism, DEI and LGBT nonsense. There was a clear attempt to engineer a massive cultural shift in the western world; an expedited progressive coup. Conservatives were relentlessly targeted as “insurrectionists” and a “threat to democracy”. Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

The elites were flooding western media with woke propaganda through their NGO operations. You couldn’t go anywhere without being bombarded with multiculturalism, DEI and LGBT nonsense. There was a clear attempt to engineer a massive cultural shift in the western world; an expedited progressive coup. Conservatives were relentlessly targeted as “insurrectionists” and a “threat to democracy”. Pandemic hysteria opened the door to an array of mandates as well as legislation designed to erase constitutional protections in the name of “health safety”. The plan was openly admitted: An endless cycle of covid lockdowns and vaccine passports. A perpetual loop of medical tyranny. Globalists were ecstatic, reveling in the fear and calling for the implementation of forced vaccinations, covid tracking apps and even covid camps for people who refused to comply. In the midst of the frenzy the WEF and other organizations pushed their economic agenda, asserting that the world needed to go cashless, that carbon controls and “climate lockdowns” needed to become normalized. They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan.

This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

They wanted what they called a “Great Reset” of the global financial framework. Everything was admitted, they barely tried to hide their intentions. It was the New World Order we “conspiracy” analysts had been warning about for decades. In the past they would mention details of the plan in obscure white papers or in moments of unguarded discussion. Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence.

Over the past five years the globalists were essentially dancing in the streets and advertising the NWO for all too see. Why? Because they thought they had already won. Fast forward to 2025 – The covid mandates and lockdowns are defeated and abandoned. The multicultural invasion is being reversed with a majority of the American population in support of secure borders and deportations. Bans on the transing of kids are being established across the US and LGBT propaganda is being removed from schools. DOGE and Trump instituted cuts which have greatly damaged the government-to-NGO revolving door (which is why many DEI programs are disappearing). BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

USAID was the end of the Global Homo Agenda and the Homsexual/LGBT movement here at home. The race baiting industry has collasped without lawsuits for injury and public funds to pay fines. The Hate Industry is still alive in the US and across the West. The politics of Hate has divided individuals, countries and the world - you can almost trace it’s ugly emergance on the world scene with Obama’s presidency as it errupted in the States. I have been overseas since 1999 when Obama was election and did not return to live until 2011 - gone for 12 years and I didn’t recognize the US when I got home. The racist hate was everywhere. I had gone from working with all races oversea to returning to a country where race defined benefits, schooling and even if you could be a racist - how the American people were lulled into this is anyone’s guess.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson BLM is dead. Pride Month is a dud (so far). Covid is being exposed as the nothingburger it always was. The climate change agenda is fading. The masses are generally suspicious of organizations like the WEF and no one supports a cashless CBDC based system. The globalist ideal has been relegated to the garbage heap and we didn’t even need to fire a shot. Is this what winning looks like? Not quite. We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson We have won the information war in the US (for the most part). Europe is taking longer, but conservatives movements are gaining ground; so much ground, in fact, that the elites are arresting people for speech, not to mention arresting their political opponents for being right leaning. This is a sign of panic, not power. The globalists flew too close to the sun too fast and they got burned. Nearly every major elitist institution has stopped openly promoting “Great Reset” related policies. They’ve limited their media interviews and their think tanks have stopped releasing revealing white papers. Some globalists have suggested in media encounters that globalism is dead. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even used a Financial Times op-ed to argue that “globalization is over”. I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson I’ve never seen them back off from their agenda so completely, and I’m highly suspicious of the radio silence. As I warned in my article ‘World War III Is Now Inevitable – Here’s Why It Can’t Be Avoided’, the globalist plan for a Bolshevik coup has failed, but this only means they will move on to more historically predictable tactics. Meaning, exponential economic crisis and world war. European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson European political leaders have made it nearly impossible to negotiate a legitimate ceasefire in Ukraine because they continue to give Kyiv hope that NATO will step in with boots on the ground. Even if the US completely pulls all support, the Ukrainians believe Europe will fill the gap. This is ridiculous, of course; the EU has no capacity to fight an attrition war with the Russians and they are much more likely to trigger a nuclear event than liberate Ukraine. What concerns me more, though, is a specific strategy being used by NATO and Kyiv: I’m talking about the deliberate targeting of Russian nuclear infrastructure. This has been an ongoing problem since the beginning of the conflict and it seems to me as if the elites WANT some kind of catastrophic escalation. Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Ukraine has used multiple drone attacks to strike nuclear power plants, including its OWN Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl plants. The Kursk offensive (now failed) pushed towards a nuclear power plant in the region and Russia accused Ukraine of trying to hit the plant with drones. In early 2024, Ukraine long range drone and missile attacks hit two separate Russian “over the horizon” early warning nuclear radar installations. The Voronezh-DM stations were positioned outside the city of Orsk and the region of Krasnodar (Armavir); far away from the front lines in Ukraine. I warned about this development in June of last year in my article ‘False Flag On The Horizon? The Strange Case Of The Destroyed Russian Nuclear Radar’. This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This past week confirmed my suspicions when Ukraine initiated a complex covert strike on a base holding Russian long range bombers. These bombers were primarily nuclear readiness aircraft and are not generally used to launch FABs or other weapons against Ukrainian targets. The attack could not have been achieved without NATO aid and once again follows the odd pattern of targeting Russian nuclear infrastructure. There are two obvious dangers attached to this scenario: First, Russia responds with a devastating bombardment of population centers to prove the strike on the bombers did nothing to prevent them from hitting Ukrainian cities from afar. Second, Russia assumes that NATO’s plan is to weaken their nuclear readiness in preparation for European troops entering the war, or in preparation for a nuclear exchange. In either case, WWIII is the result. Establishment commentators have tried to spin the bomber attack as a Ukrainian victory without consequence, but they deliberately omit the primary purpose of the aircraft. Best case scenario, Russia pounds a few Ukrainian cities with massive ordnance. At worst, the nuclear threat becomes tangible and we edge towards a missile exchange. I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson I continue to believe that the globalists want to avoid full spectrum nuclear war. Why would they deliberately vaporize the very control grid it took them decades to build? But I do think we will see a limited nuclear event in the near future (perhaps a limited nuke event in Ukraine). The continuing attacks on nuke related armaments and infrastructure suggest to me an attempt by Kyiv and NATO to create a situation so chaotic that it opens the door to troop deployments and direct confrontation with Moscow before anyone can catch up to what is happening. Without war, the globalists have nothing. Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished?

Maybe they can pull off an economic crisis (all the pieces are certainly in place), but in a vacuum they could get the blame. War offers a valuable distraction for the masses and an ever adaptable scapegoat. People broke and starving? Well, that’s just war. The dollar crashing? Currencies are at risk during war. Freedoms being curtailed? Hey, people need to set aside their liberties for the sake of “security”. There’s a reason why multi-nation wars almost always occur just after historic economic declines. The two crises feed into each other, but the wars also provide cover for extensive centralization schemes. Each successive world war brings us a step closer to world government and a centrally controlled global economic system. The globalists in Europe are doing everything in their power to prolong the conflagration. They know Ukraine is never going to get their lost territory back. They know that Russia is generating a massive breakout on the front lines in the east. They have no peace plan. Their purpose is to force a direct confrontation between NATO forces and Russian troops. It’s the only explanation for the attacks on Russian nuclear armaments. It’s a provocation designed to end all chances of a ceasefire and take the war to the next level. The unsettling quiet from normally boisterous NWO reps within think tanks and the media suggests to me that a memo has been posted from on high. All other programs have been scrapped and all eyes are on Ukraine and Russia. Perhaps the globalists have suddenly gone quiet because they’ve set Plan B in motion, and this time they don’t want any of their people talking out of turn until total war is accomplished? As the old saying goes, loose lips sink ships… Of course, there’s always the chance we see escalation in Iran, or a Chinese move on Taiwan. There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

There are more than a few precarious powder kegs in place right now. What I see, though, is an inordinate amount amount of financial and political energy going into the Ukraine affair. The elitists are mostly tight lipped about it, but an inordinate amount of financial and political energy is flowing into the region. It’s clear that the next couple of months will be highly unstable as tensions mount. Diplomatic pathways are fading fast. Most likely scenario? Ukraine cities get hammered in a relentless Russian bombardment and Europe vows to deploy its forces to intervene. Even if Trump cuts off all US ties to Ukraine and walks away, there’s little that can be done to prevent the disaster that comes next. It’s not necessarily a scorched earth option for the globalists, but it certainly seems like a last resort – Conjuring a calamity big enough to distract the masses while total centralization is instituted. I’m not saying the plan will work, I’m just saying that this is their most viable strategy.

Title: Bitcoin vs. macro pressure – Is $100K still safe amid rate-cut bets, inflation risks?

Time Published: 2025-06-07T17:00:42Z
Full Content:
June’s volatility may shake out weak hands in the crypto market. Bitcoin’s [BTC] resilience has been on full display lately. Despite a barrage of macro noise, rate cut odds, Trump’s Fed shakeup tease, and institutional reshuffling, BTC is still trading above $100,000 on the charts. And in doing so, it has kept FOMO on a low simmer without flipping into euphoria. Such a setup screams bullish continuation. You see, we’re halfway through 2025, and the market’s leaning hard into the rate-cut narrative – 97.4% odds for a cut at the next FOMC. That’s a big vote of confidence. However, here’s the thing – What if the Fed doesn’t budge? What if the CPI ticks higher and inflation throws a wrench in the plan? Mid-June could get messy. On the contrary, if BTC retains its strength, it could set the tone for a breakout heading into the second half of the year. May’s Non-Farm Payrolls report came in solid. 139,000 jobs added vs. 125,000 expected, though slightly below April’s 147,000. The unemployment rate stayed at 4.2%, highlighting a steady but healthy labor market. Source: Trading Economics Skeptics might argue that this strong employment data contradicts the idea of a rate-cut pivot. After all, why lower borrowing costs when economic activity is stable? David Hernandez, Crypto Investment Specialist at 21Shares, told AMBCrypto, “BTC has found solid footing above the meaningful $100,000 support level, with each day spent above this level strengthening it as a foundation for future upward moves.” He added that Bitcoin’s ability to hold through volatility reflects growing institutional conviction. Especially with the Fed funds market pricing in near-100% odds of a pause this June. Simply put, stable labor data means inflation pressures are manageable without more tightening. This gives the Fed room to pause rate hikes. In turn, it also encourages investment flows into risk-on assets like Bitcoin. As the U.S. economy continues to tame inflationary pressures with a string of “better-than-expected” data, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Fed holds rates steady at the upcoming meeting. However, what about those 97.4% odds priced in? Well, that’s why Bitcoin’s resilience matters. While short-term volatility is inevitable as investors reposition ahead of the Fed’s decision, BTC’s ability to hold the $100k-level keeps FOMO intact. It also validates its structural support. In fact, we’ve seen this dynamic play out repeatedly over the past two weeks. Despite BlackRock reducing its exposure, Bitcoin hasn’t flinched. Holding six figures in the face of institutional distribution underscores just how solid BTC’s macro setup really is. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) In an unexpected twist, Trump teased a new Fed Chair pick recently, despite Powell’s term running until 2026. Source: The Kobeissi Letter His comments added fuel to the speculative fire and helped push crypto markets up 2.5% over 24 hours – Alongside $35 million in short liquidations. But if this is just hype—and not substance—there’s a risk this relief rally fades just as fast. If CPI stays contained and the Fed delivers the expected pause, this base at $100k will become launchpad territory. On the other hand, if the market’s pricing proves premature, we could see a volatility shakeout before the next leg. Right now, Bitcoin isn’t breaking down – It’s loading up. And, if the macro deck falls into place, the next breakout may not just reclaim highs, but rewrite them.

Editor Tech CoinDesk, Francisco Rodrigues The messaging app, with over 1 billion users, plans to use $955 million to buy back existing bonds and the remaining $745 million for growth. Telegram has secured $1.7 billion by issuing five-year convertible bonds, aiming to refinance existing liabilities and push out repayment deadlines. The messaging app, which now counts over 1 billion users, will use $955 million of the new funds to buy back bonds maturing in 2026, Bloomberg reports. The remaining $745 million gives the company fresh capital to bolster its operations or invest in growth. Investors in the new bonds will have a shot at converting their holdings into equity if Telegram goes public before the notes mature. In that scenario, they would be entitled to redeem at 80% of the initial public offering price. The tender offer closed May 28, with settlement expected on June 5. CoinDesk previously reported the round drew interest from from both returning investors such as the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, as well as new entrants including hedge fund Citadel The notes carry a 9% coupon, two percentage points above Telegram’s previous $2.35 billion bond issued in 2021. Telegram passed $1 billion in revenue last year and holds over $500 million in cash reserves, excluding crypto, Bloomberg’s report adds.

아빠찬스 Here are five key takeaways from the US jobs report for May https://t.co/URzOFQM4zF ICYMI: A hiring freeze that impedes the Bureau of Labor Statistics may cost Americans a lot more than the government saves.Read @JonathanJLevin ⬇️https://t.co/RVpvbz2BhX 트럼프 노동부에서 발표한 5월 비농업 '고용 보고서'('NFP')에 따르면 '일자리' 증가율은 이전 두 달에 비해 총 95,000명 감소한 후 139,000명 증가하면서 '둔화'되었고 전월은 하향 조정되었지만 실업률은 4.2%로 변동없이 안정적으로 '유지'되었습니다. NFP 보고서는 고소득 노동자의 임금이 포함되는 등 시장금리 대장지표라 불립니다. Lori Chavez-DeRemer '노동부 장관'은 일자리 보고서에 관해 "지난 몇 달 동안 우리가 본 것은 미국 태생의 미국인들이 일자리 증가가 일어나고 있다는 것입니다. 우리는 먼저 미국 노동자를 보호하고 있는지 확인하고 싶습니다."라고 말하였습니다.

The shares of the stablecoin giant Circle surged on its first day as a public company. In a post on the social media platform X, the issuer of the second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC and the euro-pegged Euro Coin (EURC) says its shares can now be traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company initially announced plans to go public back in 2021. “Circle is now officially a public company, listed on the NYSE under CRCL. With USDC, EURC, Circle Payments Network & more, we’re pushing forward a future of frictionless value exchange. We are not just building financial products. We are building the money layer of the internet.” Circle made its stock market debut on Thursday with an opening price of $69 per share, up by 168.48% from the initial public offering (IPO) price of $31.00 per share. The company originally aimed for an IPO price of about $28 per share, but pseudonymous crypto analyst The Flow Horse says this is relatively low. “ I think $28 is going to look cheap over a multi-month period. Outside of the initial event volume, I will be looking for price to develop a clean range and ideally start to establish a longer-term position.” Circle’s stock peaked at $103.75 and closed at $83.23 on Thursday. Financial titan BlackRock reportedly plans to accumulate 10% of Circle’s shares. The world’s largest asset manager is already the acting reserve manager for the assets backing USDC.

Title: Circle’s victory: How USDC is rewriting the stablecoin playbook

Full Content:
Could USDC finally crack Tether’s fortress and rewrite the stablecoin playbook? The stablecoin market is heating up again. But this time, it’s not just another routine “flight-to-safety” shuffle. By launching its IPO on the NYSE, Circle plugged traditional finance straight into stablecoins, and the market didn’t hold back. USDC shot up 170%, closing at $84 from a $31 IPO price, pushing Circle’s valuation to $18 million. The timing is razor-sharp. With crypto volatility through the roof, stablecoins are the ultimate safe harbor. Sure, Tether [USDT] still wears the crown, but is Circle’s bold move sparking a liquidity shakeup? Circle’s IPO had an explosive first day, jumping from $31 to close at $82, a 171% gain and even hitting $93 intraday. The offering was 25 times over-subscribed, boosting Circle’s market value from $6.9 billion at open to around $17–20 billion. Source: Yahoo Finance But USDC still trails Tether in the stablecoin race. The reason? USDC currently has $60.3 billion in supply, roughly two-thirds the size of Tether. But Tether still dominates with $1 trillion in monthly volume making it significantly more profitable. Now, imagine if that flips. What if Tether’s hefty $153 billion supply suddenly struggles to attract liquidity as capital starts flowing elsewhere? That’s exactly the game Circle’s IPO is playing. According to AMBCrypto, it is aiming to rewrite the stablecoin rulebook. Circle’s NYSE debut wasn’t just about market cap. Instead, it pulled in some serious heavy hitters. Notably, big names like BlackRock and ARK jumped in, loading up on Circle shares and showing some serious confidence. Why does this matter? If buyers start stepping up, that $60.3 billion USDC supply could become a real advantage. Plus, Circle’s IPO is doing more than just raising cash, it’s helping stablecoins break into the traditional finance world for real. Source: TradingView (USDC.D) Meanwhile, Tether’s sitting on a mountain of supply that might just become a liability. So on the utility front, USDC is making moves, stepping up its game and challenging USDT’s long-held dominance. This is a strategic masterstroke led by Circle. If it takes off, the stablecoin market could face a major paradigm shift — one where USDC becomes the go-to liquidity magnet.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and crypto prices have soared this year, fuelled by a combination of U.S. president Donald Trump’s support and Wall Street adoption (with Tesla billionaire Elon Musk making a dramatic return to the front lines of crypto this week). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price, after rebounding sharply from its April lows, has held above $100,000 per bitcoin since early May even after BlackRock issued a serious bitcoin warning. Now, as fears swirl of a “cataclysmic” U.S. dollar collapse, Jim Esposito, the president of market maker Citadel Securities, has warned the spiraling $37 trillion U.S. debt pile is a “ticking time bomb”—adding to similar warnings that some think could be about to send the bitcoin price sharply higher.

More Wall Street's embrace of crypto pushes up the bitcoin price. “The stock of debt and the budget deficit is a ticking time bomb,” Esposito said at the Piper Sandler Global Exchange & Trading Conference in comments reported by Reuters. “No one is smart enough to predict when exactly it will rear its ugly head. We’ve been talking about this for more than 20 years, so in some ways the market’s gone into complacency, but over a multi-year period we can work this out.” Esposito added that Citadel Securities, a Wall Street market-making giant that was founded by hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, plans to ramp up its bitcoin and crypto trading this year in anticipation of a new crypto regulatory framework. "Crypto is definitely a space we’re going to get bigger in, and we're excited about the prospects," Esposito added. The worsening U.S. debt crisis, which has dramatically blown up the relationship between Elon Musk and president Trump this week, was exacerbated by massive government spending through Covid lockdowns. The rise in U.S. debt comes as the Federal Reserve, led by chair Jerome Powell, holds the line on interest rates despite pressure from Trump and the bond market suffers highly volatile swings that are a sign of waning faith in the U.S. from investors. Economic and monetary uncertainty has pushed some traders and companies toward bitcoin, leading to a flood of bullish bitcoin price predictions.

More spiraling U.S. debt pile. “The dominant story for bitcoin has changed again,” Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick wrote in an emailed note. “It was correlation to risk assets ... It then became a way to position for strategic asset reallocation out of U.S. assets.” Kendrick has predicted the bitcoin price will soar to $500,000 per bitcoin by the end of Trump’s presidency in early 2029 as a result of his U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve and the ending of stifling regulations that will see more companies buy bitcoin. “Institutions are reinforcing their exposure to bitcoin, building out their bitcoin treasuries,” Seamus Rocca, the chief executive of bitcoin and crypto custody company Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments. "Whether you’re looking at institutional flows or retail behavior, the message is the same: conviction in bitcoin’s long-term value is holding firm–and growing.”

Title: Organizing an Electoral Revolution. Forging a Path to Freedom

Any society needs a monetary system to advance beyond the most primitive level. The trouble arises when the system is taken over by the most selfish and ruthless elements who use it for their own self-aggrandizement to the detriment of everyone else in the community. This is what has happened in the nations of the Collective West. The primary mechanism of control is creation of a banking system based on usury—i.e., charging interest on loans. This fee for the privilege of taking part in the economic life of society is in fact an indirect tax that goes to support a financial aristocracy that ends up controlling all trade, politics, and even culture. A façade of “democracy” and “self-government” may be maintained for appearances’ sake, but this is really a mechanism to engender the “war of each against all” so people won’t notice they are being controlled and manipulated. In today’s world, a revolt against this system is gathering steam, led by “civilizational states” like Russia, China, Iran, India, and others—all states the Collective West defines as “threats.” The financial elites quickly move to destroy any movement toward monetary reform, even as they tolerate or even encourage other types of relatively harmless protest, including “elections,” as well as self-destructive activities like drugs, sexual degeneracy, etc. The last US protest against the financial system was the “Occupy Wall Street” movement that was quickly suppressed. Nevertheless, the core of a monetary reform movement has remained and continues to attract notice. Among these has been the “End the Fed” campaign of people like Ron Paul and Thomas Massey, but also a much more sophisticated group that has its roots in the activities of the American Monetary Institute, the Public Banking Institute, the Direct Funding movement, etc. A notable component of this effort was the NEED Act of 2011 entered onto the ledger of Congress by Dennis Kucinich, adopted as part of the platform of the Green Party, and still on the books. Today, we present a major proposal for direct action by one of the leaders of the Green Party, Howard Switzer from his Substack, “Howard’s Newsletter.” Howard is an architect promoting earth-friendly construction and sovereign monetary reform. He is a founding member and former co-chair of the Green Party of Tennessee and served many terms on the Green Party’s National Committee as a delegate from Tennessee while running for office in Tennessee three times. In 2017 he led a successful defense of the “Greening the Dollar” plank in the Green Party Platform against an effort by outside advocates of “Modern Monetary Theory” to remove it. He is also a founding board member and former president of the Alliance for Just Money, and he is a co-founder and a current co-chair of the GPUS Banking and Monetary Reform Committee (BMRC). —Richard C. Cook, June 5, 2025 *** By Howard Switzer, June 3, 2025 I have been reading numerous essays exposing and describing the enormous, catastrophic, horrific and unbelievably profitable crimes of the System, the capitalist monetary system. It is the mechanism of power in the private hands of the Monsters of Mammon, the apparent psychopaths who control the allocation of global capital, the money, thus “everything,” as Henry Kissinger famously noted. Most of those essays do not have a hint of what to do about it. The cynical use of the axioms “if it bleeds it leads” or “If it burns it earns” by the Monster’s mass media are used because they know that humans have a negativity bias that attracts our attention while positive stories do not. Those stories then get highlighted and repeated by numerous essay writers whose attention was captured. This constant assault impacts our mental and physical health. Research has shown that people can exhibit increased depression and anxiety symptoms after only 14 minutes of news consumption. Negative headlines seriously play on our emotions too, which is why they push engagement so powerfully. “A recent Stanford University study reported, for example, that emotional stories are around 22 times more memorable than facts alone.”[1] This increased stress is a major factor in illnesses. To protect our health, we are told to reduce our exposure. Negativity bias is related to our fight-or-flight response but the ‘recommendation for protecting our health’ seems to be flight rather than fight. Considering our predicament flight does not seem to be a viable option, for where can we go to escape this gargantuan monster’s global grip? Further, this serves the Monster’s agenda by keeping the people distracted by the symptoms of the disease, so they don’t see the disease itself. Those who write about solutions are ignored in favor of those who write only about the seemingly intractable problems. The constant exposure to pain and fear makes us susceptible to neuroticism. “Compellingly, out-group animosity (denigrating one’s political opponents online) appears to be a stronger motivation to vote than in-group amity (friendliness). Thus, there appears to be political capital in encouraging online hate by one’s supporters. A 2018 study, for example, studied two populist rhetoric driven campaigns: Donald Trump’s 2016 US presidential campaign and the UK Brexit referendum from the same year. Researchers reported that both campaigns heavily appealed to similar pain points—fear, for example, as well as lost national pride, overplayed immigration fears, baiting opposing voter groups, and racism, or the fear of other nationalities or ethnicities. These negative headlines powerfully drove exposure and engagement.”[1] All this indicates that to attract attention to fighting this we need to generate animosity for the Monsters of Mammon. However directing it at humans, no matter how awful they are, seems counter to the world’s need for greater empathy and care to reduce dangerous and destructive fear, replacing it with love, the other root emotion. Thus, I think we need to focus our hatred and animosity on the System, the capitalist monetary system, which is the illegitimate mechanism of power, a usurpation of power with the sin of usury. A power that rightfully belongs to us all, not a greedy, and one can only assume a psychologically damaged, few. Usury does have serious psychological consequences. It seems like we need to understand how the System operates then organize and express our hatred for what it does. The issues facing civil society seem to get bigger and more urgent with every election cycle and polls show that the number one issue for most of the electorate, regardless of political affiliation, regardless of which party is in power, is the economy. What about the economy that makes it an issue? The answer unequivocally is money. People don’t have enough money to pay for the things they and their family need to maintain a decent quality of life; food, shelter, transportation, healthcare and enough money to pay their debts so as not to default on their loans and lose what they have. People are not concerned about inflation if they have enough money. No solution to the problem of poverty has ever been so effective as providing income to the poor, income is by far the best antidote for deprivation. An economy in depression is an economy with not enough money in circulation, a policy of austerity only makes it worse. The truth is that nothing denies a person liberty more than the absence of money and no truth has ever spawned more ingenious evasion than that. If the lack of money is the problem, then a political party that wants to win must offer a viable solution to that problem. Why is it that 80% of the population is struggling for lack of money? Over 60% could not cover a $400 emergency. People can see that the economy is not designed to serve most people. “The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer” is an aphorism that has been popularly repeated since long before the civil war. We have an economic system that steadily transfers wealth to the super-rich. People have felt powerless as their government bails out the big banks and spends trillions on corporate subsidies and foreign wars. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this process as 8 million more Americans slid into poverty, 100 million world-around, and100,000 small businesses, responsible for creating two out of every three new jobs in the U.S. economy, closed their doors permanently. At the same time the world’s billionaires increased their wealth to a record $10.2 trillion, and that is just the amount they admit to. This is where we are, what some call “late-stage capitalism” is an unleashed neoliberal crime fest as private equity firms pillage any company that has value now even targeting retirement savings and healthcare. They are coming for our homes too. The result is increased economic suffering, homelessness, and increasing oppression to keep it going that way. Our elections and public policy are controlled by money. All the regulatory agencies are captured by the industries they are supposed to regulate, and the military industrial complex takes the lion’s share of discretionary spending year after year as interest payments on the federal debt blow past a trillion dollars per year. These are the reasons that trust in the two major political parties and our national institutions has fallen to a record low. There have been calls for a new political party to pick up the pieces and champion the American people. A party that can effectively tie economic justice to monetary reform can galvanize 80% of the population, farmers, working-class and small business Americans, to challenge elite power and present a credible alternative to establishment politics. The Green Party has the platform and infrastructure to be that party. What it lacks is vision. Can there be any doubt that money rules the roost? That being the case it behooves us to look at the money system we have since it is not taught in any of our schools and has long been kept shrouded in mystery. It is our nation’s privatized monetary system that creates and allocates the money. There have been numerous calls for monetary reform over the last 240 years, but most people are unaware of them as the systemic solution has always been drowned out by constant debates over polarizing issues. The System is a system of usury; the abuse of monetary authority for personal gain which has been described as an extraordinarily efficient form of violence by which one can do the most damage with the least amount of effort. We call this System capitalism. Capitalism = (capital = money) + (ism = system) = money system. The central feature and source of the awesome power of the Monsters of Mammon is the debt-based private global monetary system they own and operate through the global banking system. Capitalism is often wrongly conflated with “free enterprise” and “free markets” but capitalism ensures that these are NOT free. This is because capitalism is a debt parasite on the back of free enterprise making every household, business and government in this world in debt and dependent on the banking System. The System issues all money as interest-bearing debt in the process of making loans. That may sound relatively benign because it has been normalized, but it is a form of slavery that systematically concentrates wealth to the wealthiest, the Monsters of Mammon. Credit, used for money, is created by the banking system as the principal of a loan and, because that is the way money is created, the interest on that loan must be paid from money created by another’s loan. This drives destructive growth and predatory competition as people compete to pay the interest on their debts, so they won’t default on their loan and lose their real wealth collateral. The System is not stable because when loan payments (money destroyed) exceed loans being made (money created) the System crashes for lack of money creating a recession or depression depending on the amounts and how many loans default. This causes a massive transfer of wealth because when this happens the real-wealth collateral is picked up for pennies on the dollar by those with the money. Furthermore, interest is compounded (interest on interest) throughout the System’s economy which is built into the prices of all the goods and services we buy, on average 50%. This means money going to the Monsters of Mammon with every transaction. “All wars are bankers wars” To be clear by bankers I mean their shareholders, the Monsters of Mannon, who demand a constant flow of profits. The System has for over 500 years, forced sovereign governments to turn over their sovereignty, their monetary authority, to the bankers due to war debt. The word capitalism comes from the French word, “capitalisme,” which refers to the system of war finance, or the practice of borrowing large amounts of money to fund the costs of war. War debt is how the Monsters of Mammon got nations to hand over their monetary authority to the wealthy private interests. who controlled large accumulations of money. You can tell those who are resistant by looking at the System’s list of enemies, the smaller of which have been or are being destroyed by war. The larger enemies are continually being threatened with war. The System allows control of every industry in the world by the Monsters of Mannon. It dominates the ownership of raw materials, the means of production, exploits earth’s materials and labor, concentrates wealth, creates poverty, drives destructive growth, predatory competition and all wars. The System has made the U.S. Dollar the international reserve currency and abuses its currency dominance using sanctions and war to gain control over resources it wants to exploit. The System is a system of debt slavery: student loans, medical debt, and credit card exploitation trap millions. The System causes inflation. Issuing money as debt is itself inflationary, but banks can increase inflation at will which is used as a weapon for controlling economies or bring them to their knees. Every instance of hyperinflation you’ve heard of was caused by banks making war upon a nation’s economy. The governments blamed for hyperinflation were the targets and have long served as the whipping boy for the crimes of the Monsters of Mammon. The System allows the massive accumulation of money making it an instrument of power with which to control, industry, governments, economies, in short, as Henry Kissinger said, “…if you control the money, you can control everything.” The banking oligopoly, a handful of megabanks like JPMorgan, CITI Bank, Bank of America, etc., control most of the lending and are all owned, along with all the major corporations and their subsidiaries, by the largest asset managers in the world, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, behind which the Monsters of Mammon hide and shield themselves from liability and accountability. The System uses technology as a weapon but sells to us as a convenience, thus they profit from selling the very tools they use as a weapon to subjugate us and the world. Digital surveillance, private fintech, cryptocurrency and AI all threaten financial freedom and are employed by the Monsters of Mammon to make war upon the world. This list could go on getting into more detail but that should be enough to make you realize the scale of what we are up against. To fight it we must summon forth the courage that David did to fight Goliath. Like David’s slingshot our weapon may seem too small and impotent for the job and yet it got the job done with miraculous efficiency. Our weapon is Monetary Reform, a term that people may find mundane and are unfamiliar with because it is not taught in schools; the System does not allow the monetary system to be a legitimate field of inquiry. Economists, to protect their careers, shun knowledge of it. Economics studies wealth while ignoring power and Political Science studies power while ignoring wealth. This is what makes these fields so mind-numbingly boring. However, Political Economy, the study of the relationship between wealth and power, makes both relevant and exciting.

Title: FCA clears path for UK retail crypto ETF trading—kind of

FCA aims to strike balance between market growth and consumer protection with crypto ETN access. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has proposed lifting its longstanding ban on crypto exchange-traded notes for retail investors, opening the door for broader access to regulated crypto exposure through public investment exchanges. The move, announced June 6, forms part of a broader regulatory push to bolster market competitiveness and reduce barriers for financial firms. Retail investors would be allowed to purchase crypto ETNs, debt instruments tied to digital asset prices, if these are listed on a recognized investment exchange and meet the UK’s financial promotion rules. The FCA emphasized that safeguards would still apply, including requirements for risk disclosures and restrictions on promotional incentives, similar to the rules for direct digital asset sales. The FCA’s proposal does not extend to spot crypto ETFs like in the US through BlackRock and the Newborn Nine. ETNs (Exchange-Traded Notes) are unsecured debt securities that track the price of a digital asset but do not hold the underlying asset. The FCA proposes allowing retail access to these as long as they’re listed on recognized investment exchanges and meet financial promotion rules. Spot ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), which directly hold crypto (e.g., Bitcoin) as the underlying asset, are not currently permitted in the UK and remain subject to broader regulatory and legislative constraints. The FCA has not proposed changes here. So, this consultation does not pave the way for spot ETFs in the UK. Any move in that direction would likely require new rules around custody, fund structures, and potentially legislative change. For now, ETNs are the FCA’s chosen compromise vehicle for retail exposure under tight oversight. Charlie Morris from crypto ETF issuer ByteTree celebrated the news, stating, “I am thrilled by the recent announcement that the FCA has lifted the ban on UK retail investors trading in crypto ETFs.” [Editor’s Note: In Europe, many issuers (ByteTree included) market their physically-backed crypto products as “ETFs”, even though the legal wrapper is an ETP/ETN/ETC. ByteTree’s blog explicitly lumps the terms together, describing “Bitcoin ETFs (also referred to as ETPs, ETNs, ETCs)” when discussing London listings. Their tweet is therefore branding rather than a statement of new ETF permissions.] What will change if the proposal is adopted? Retail clients could buy the same sterling-denominated crypto ETNs that professional investors already trade on the London Stock Exchange, such as 21Shares, WisdomTree, or Invesco products (including ByteTree’s BOLD bitcoin-and-gold ETN). The trading experience will look like an ETF, with a ticker on an exchange and intraday liquidity. Still, the instrument will remain a note, with counterparty risk to the issuer and no direct title to the underlying coins. The consultation reverses the FCA’s 2021 policy of barring retail access to crypto ETNs and derivatives. While the retail ban on crypto derivatives will remain in force, the regulator’s latest stance reflects its evolving posture on high-risk investments and its intention to grant consumers greater autonomy in choosing investment products. According to FCA executive director David Geale, the shift represents an effort to “rebalance” the regulator’s risk framework, allowing retail participants to decide whether such investments align with their risk tolerance. The change follows a March 2024 update in which the FCA said it would not object to UK exchanges launching dedicated market segments for crypto ETNs aimed at professional investors. The new proposal would extend this access to retail customers, provided the products are listed on an FCA-recognized venue, such as the London Stock Exchange, and comply with investor protection mandates. The announcement appears alongside the FCA’s broader quarterly consultation, which includes measures to simplify reporting obligations for asset managers and reduce unnecessary data collection across regulated firms. While those measures aim to ease compliance burdens for traditional financial services, the crypto ETN proposal aligns more directly with the UK Treasury’s ambition to position the country as a global hub for digital asset innovation. Per the FCA’s crypto roadmap published in late 2024, the UK is implementing a phased regulatory regime covering stablecoins, custodial requirements, market abuse prevention, and prudential standards for crypto firms. Parallel consultations are underway on stablecoin issuance and digital asset custody, while a May 2025 discussion paper outlined proposals for licensing and oversight of broader crypto activities. The proposed change would bring the UK closer to the regulatory stance adopted by the European Union, where crypto ETNs are widely available to retail investors across exchanges like Deutsche Börse’s Xetra platform and Euronext. Over 300 crypto-linked ETNs are currently listed on Xetra, and issuers such as 21Shares and VanEck have broadened their offerings to include assets like Solana and PYTH. In contrast, the US has prioritized spot-based Bitcoin ETFs over the ETN structure, with crypto ETNs remaining largely absent from public markets there. The consultation remains open through July 31. If approved, the change would grant UK-based investors access to crypto ETNs under regulated conditions, a shift expected to reshape retail participation channels without overturning the FCA’s prohibition on derivatives. By distinguishing between the two instruments, the FCA appears to be signaling a more nuanced approach to crypto regulation, one that attempts to balance market growth with consumer protection within existing legal frameworks.

Title: Bitcoin Pepe sees continued momentum as Uber plans to accept payments in crypto

Uber made headlines in the cryptocurrency space this week after revealing that it is exploring the integration of crypto payments into its platform. While the ride-hailing giant clarified it has no current plans to hold Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies on its balance sheet, the mere prospect of accepting crypto as a payment method has stirred excitement across the digital asset community. The move, if implemented, could mark a significant step toward mainstream adoption, given Uber’s global scale and user base. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Pepe, one of 2025’s most closely watched presales, is seeing massive buying pressure ahead of its exchange debut. Only 11 days to go before a listing announcement is made on June 17. According to Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive officer of Uber, the company is studying the possibility of adding cryptocurrencies to its payment options. Specifically, the company wants to use stablecoins for cross-border payments. However, it will not invest in or hold crypto. Per the Uber CEO, who shared the move at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco, the plan is to give customers more flexibility when it comes to payment choices. “We’re still in the study phase, I’d say, but stablecoin is one of the, for me, more interesting instantiations of crypto that has a practical benefit other than crypto as a store of value,” Khosrowshahi noted. “Obviously, you can have your opinions on Bitcoin, but it’s a proven commodity, and you know, people have different opinions on where it’s going.” On this point, the broader sentiment leans bullish. Bitcoin (BTC) remains above the $100,000 mark, bolstered by signs of accelerating mainstream adoption and growing regulatory clarity. JPMorgan recently announced plans to allow its clients to buy BTC, joining a growing list of institutions including BlackRock, MicroStrategy, and even GameStop that are deepening their exposure to the asset. While recent volatility was amplified by the high-profile spat between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, Bitcoin continues to attract capital as a hedge, a store of value, and a bet on the future of decentralized finance. Fear of missing out on BTC’s continued momentum has put other well-positioned cryptocurrencies on the investor radar—chief among them is Bitcoin Pepe. Bitcoin is a $2 trillion market ecosystem, and meme coins continue to find traction as serious projects come to the fore. The Bitcoin Pepe project, which stands out as one of the best presales to invest in, is the first meme layer 2 on Bitcoin. It has emerged as one of the most anticipated token launches in 2025. With over $13.9 million raised so far, the Bitcoin Pepe presale page shows that the team will soon make a listing announcement on June 17, 2025. Presale Announcement We’ve been working closely with exchanges, but as these things go, they need a bit more time to finalise. Therefore, our listing announcement is now set for June 17th, with more info coming 🗓️ To thank our early supporters, we’re giving a 30% bonus to… pic.twitter.com/Dq6o64EKvd — Bitcoin Pepe (@BitcoinPepe_) June 2, 2025 Ahead of this announcement and a potential listing soon, investors are buying BPEP at the bargain presale price of $0.0396. The crypto market is bullish on BTC and SOL, and set to tap massively into sentiment around these two coins is BPEP.

(Bloomberg) -- Temasek Holdings Pte Chairman Lim Boon Heng is stepping down and will be succeeded by Teo Chee Hean, marking a significant shift in leadership at the Singapore state investor. Teo will replace Lim on Oct. 9, Temasek said in a statement on Friday. As part of the change, Deputy Chairman Cheng Wai Keung and director Stephen Lee will leave the board on June 30. Director Bobby Chin will also retire on July 31. Lim has been Temasek’s chairman since August 2013. His replacement, Teo, is a former Singapore Cabinet minister who retired from politics last month after more than three decades as an elected politician. The 70-year-old was most recently Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security. Earlier on, Teo was the country’s Deputy Prime Minister and has also overseen its defense, education and home affairs ministries. Temasek is one of the biggest state-owned investment firms in the world. It grew its net portfolio value from S$223 billion ($173 billion) to S$389 billion in the 10 years through March 2024. It boasts a footprint across Europe and the US, which now hosts six of its 13 international offices. “In this era of deepening global uncertainty, we must remain clear minded on critical matters such as international relations, security, and climate change,” Teo said in a statement. He will join Temasek’s board on July 1, initially as Deputy Chairman. Lim, who is 77, focused on talent development and oversaw the board’s renewal process, increasing its international representation. He also guided Temasek through its chief executive officer leadership transition in 2021, the company said. A prolific investor, Temasek is a backer of some of the biggest companies in the world including BlackRock Inc., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Mastercard Inc., Standard Chartered Plc and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as of March 2024. --With assistance from David Ramli.

Title: PwC Ireland boss focused on getting tech to do some heavy lifting

“The future is technology and you’ve got to lean in and embrace that,” says Enda McDonagh, managing partner of PwC Ireland, one of the Big Four accounting firms in the State. We’re speaking in his office overlooking the Liffey in Dublin’s north Docklands. The impressive double aspect view stretches down to Liberty Hall on one side and up towards Capital Dock the other way. “It’s a great view all right, but I usually have my back to it working on the computer,” he says. Technology is at the heart of the change that has been taking place on McDonagh’s watch since he took over the reins at PwC almost two years ago. “The big thing we’re trying to get after is a much better focus on the technology part of what we can bring to our clients,” he says, adding that PwC has long had a good reputation in that area. Artificial intelligence is the latest technology taking centre stage, particularly generative AI. “We’ve got stuck into AI in a big way in the past couple of years,” he says. The firm converted to Microsoft M365, which brings Copilot capability with it. As part of a global collaboration with OpenAI, it has created Chat PwC to undertake tasks that “previously would have been done by people manually researching, and helps speed up the productivity on a day-to-day basis”. Can he trust its accuracy? “You always have validation checks, but because it’s pulling from our own materials, it’s very reliable,” he says. PwC is also using Harvey, a tax and legal tool, generating first-level content to use in the practice. McDonagh says AI is not replacing jobs at the firm. “There hasn’t really been any net replacement of our people with AI. We’re trying to take tasks from our people in the administrative space and repurpose what they do,” he says. “We’re not seeing AI replacing humans, we’re just seeing it changing what the human does in the dynamic.” Last year, PwC added 1,028 staff, including 383 graduates, to bring its headcount to 3,566. McDonagh says a similar number will be added in 2025, with “broadly similar numbers” employed by the firm overall, reflecting the significant annual churn at professional services firms. PwC Ireland reported a 2.8 per cent increase in net revenue last year to €469 million. In gross terms, revenue was €569 million, up 9.6 per cent on 2023, but its “expenses and disbursements on client engagements” rose by 59 per cent to €100 million. All the figures exclude VAT and relate to income generated by PwC’s firms in the Republic and Northern Ireland. But it does not include the firm’s advisory and consulting activities in the North, which are part of the UK firm and employ about 3,000 people. Advisory services was the big drag on PwC Ireland’s numbers, declining by €16 million to €107 million. This included €63 million (up from €59 million a year earlier) in revenue from permitted non-audit services to entities that are audited by the Republic of Ireland firm of PwC. Its assurance and tax units recorded revenue increases of 9 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively. McDonagh says the slowing down in its advisory business was a combination of fewer deals and more prudence from clients in terms of discretionary spend. “What we’ve entered into a period of now is uncertainty, which is the worst possible thing for businesses,” he says by way of reference to US president Donald Trump and his flip-flops on tariffs. “This ebb and flow period of going to bed at night and waking up in the morning and the goalposts have shifted again is the really tricky part. We are seeing a real slowdown in new investment allocations, M&A is on pause and there’s a period of stasis.” Setting Trump aside, McDonagh says now is the time for Ireland to tackle its “competitiveness issues”, particularly around infrastructure, to “stay agile” and continue to attract new investment. “We’re going to have to work harder than we have done in a while on the Irish story in the context of what’s going on. The question for all of us where does the whole tariff debate land,” he says. In spite of the market being a “bit more challenging”, McDonagh says PwC’s ambition is to “keep growing” the firm, hiring in the right skills rather than making acquisitions. “M&A would take place at a [global] network level more than a local level,” he says. PwC is the smallest of the Irish Big Four firms. EY is the clear leader with annual revenues last reported at €772 million for the island. KPMG’s income was €625 million and Deloitte’s €517 million. “We just focus on what we’re doing in terms of our own strategy. There are lots of apples and oranges in those numbers. We’re happy with our own numbers ... when one of your businesses [advisory] is down by double digits and you’re still able to grow and trade through, that’s a good result for the year,” he says. In terms of this year’s revenues, McDonagh is “hopeful” of beating the 3 per cent growth achieved last time, while recognising the global economic uncertainty that exists. He declines to comment on the trends in pay and profits for Irish partners, amid reports that UK partner pay last year fell by 5 per cent on average while the firm’s profits declined by 14 per cent. In the US, the firm has been laying off thousands of staff while profits in Asia-Pacific fell as scandals in China and Australia affected the firm. “If your revenue is growing at less than it did before, that obviously has an impact, but I’m not getting into it beyond the revenue figure.” The Irish firm was itself dragged into a scandal last year involving PwC in Australia when it was revealed that a partner in its Australian tax practice had used confidential information from government meetings to assist colleagues in winning new business from multinational technology companies. It emerged that former PwC Australia tax partner Peter-John Collins, who was banned from practising as a tax agent after sharing secret information, sought in 2015 to tap PwC Ireland’s contacts with technology companies in the United States to share his insights. PwC Ireland repeatedly declined to disclose the identity of the individual in its firm who received the email. McDonagh declined to comment on the Australia issue, saying it had been dealt with “at international level” by the firm and there was no issue for the Irish business. Back to the day-to-day business at home, PwC last September enforced a three-day-a-week policy for staff attendance in its offices (it has bases in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Waterford and Wexford). “The reason we looked for a three-day commitment is because our business is about people and one of our core philosophies is about high-performing teams and people being together in that team environment so they can learn and grow and foster. Getting that three days in the office is the right balance for us at the moment,” he says. McDonagh says attendance at its headquarters in Dublin peaks at about 1,600 staff on days midweek, a similar level to pre-Covid days. “Fridays are a lost day to the city centre,” he says. “Like most everybody else, we went into Covid not thinking a business like ours could operate remotely. The business was incredibly resilient. But a huge amount of how you develop as a professional is the learned experience of being in a team environment and learning from interactions. It’s working well for us now.” Born in Southend in southeast England, his family returned to Ireland when he was two and McDonagh grew up in Tallaght, southwest Dublin. This was a time before the M50 and the Square shopping centre when there was a lot of farmland in the area. “A lot of football and other games would have been played on those spaces back then,” he says. His late father hailed from Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, his mother from Clones, Co Monaghan. “I’m a big GAA fan and I probably went to more Ulster finals [in Clones] as a kid growing up by dint of spending time with my mother’s family in the summer,” he says. In spite of that childhood experience, he is a “diehard Dubs fan, there’s no ambiguity when it comes to that”, but he always has a “soft spot” for Ulster teams in the championship. His father worked in Irish Rail while his mother’s family was behind a hardware store in Clones called Morgans. He attended Templeogue College for secondary school before taking a BComm business degree in University College Dublin and joining Craig Gardner Price Waterhouse (one half of what later became PwC) in 1994 via the annual milk-round recruitment sweep of universities that the big accounting firms all do. He later followed that with a master’s degree in accounting, sponsored by the firm. Why accounting? “I had a fantastic accounting teacher in the way that, in schools, you can get. That’s what fostered the interest in accounting,” he says. He worked as an auditor, making his way up the ranks to manager level, at which point he took advantage of PwC’s international transfer system to take a role in Boston in 2000, spending three years in the US city. “I wanted to do something different. So I applied to go to the US and Boston came out of the hopper,” McDonagh says. “Being Irish there is not culturally a shock to the system. Boston is one of the more European American cities if that’s an appropriate analogy. The downtown area is not the block model of a lot of American cities. In terms of quality of life and opportunity, Boston at that time was brilliant. “I also worked a lot with the pharmaceutical industry over there, so when I came back, with the growth in pharma here, it worked out very well for me.” In 2006, McDonagh became a partner in the firm, led the assurance practice and served eight years on the leadership team of his predecessor as managing partner, Feargal O’Rourke. He was chosen to lead the firm two years ago, taking over from O’Rourke in July 2023 for a four-year term. Will he go again for second term? “That will be for the [146] partners to decide,” he says with a smile. “I’m really enjoying the role. It’s a privilege to lead a firm like this. As long as people want me around, I’m happy to stay. “If you’d asked me in 1994 did I ever think I’d be sitting in a chair like this, I’d never have thought that in a million years. But there’s an innate part of me that thinks I want to be the best that I can be.” Name: Enda McDonagh Job: Managing partner, PwC Age: 52 Lives: Blackrock, Co Dublin Family: Married, with three children: a 17-year-old son and 15-year-old twins (one boy, one girl). Hobbies: Big fan of American sports, having lived and worked in Boston for three years. Also a Manchester United season ticket holder and a “diehard” Dublin GAA fan. Something we might expect: “I’m a great believer in the importance of team. The highlight of any week is when I get a call from a client to tell me the team we have working with them have gone above and beyond to deliver for them.” Something that might surprise: “Notwithstanding my well-known support of Irish sporting teams, I was actually born in England.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Data centers are building their own gas power plants in Texas

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Not long ago, developers of the massive server farms talked about powering them with wind and solar energy. Now they’re bypassing the grid and building their own gas-fired power plants on site. Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. NEW BRAUNFELS — Abigail Lindsey worries the days of peace and quiet might be nearing an end at the rural, wooded property where she lives with her son. On the old ranch across the street, developers want to build an expansive complex of supercomputers for artificial intelligence, plus a large, private power plant to run it. The plant would be big enough to power a major city, with 1,200 megawatts of planned generation capacity fueled by West Texas shale gas. It will only supply the new data center, and possibly other large data centers recently proposed down the road. “It just sucks,” Lindsey said, sitting on her deck in the shade of tall oak trees, outside the city of New Braunfels. “They’ve come in and will completely destroy our way of life: dark skies, quiet and peaceful.” The project is one of many others like it proposed in Texas, where a frantic race to boot up energy-hungry data centers has led many developers to plan their own gas-fired power plants rather than wait for connection to the state’s public grid. Egged on by supportive government policies, this buildout promises to lock in strong gas demand for a generation to come. The data center and power plant planned across from Lindsey’s home is a partnership between an AI startup called CloudBurst and the natural gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer. It was Energy Transfer’s first-ever contract to supply gas for a data center, but not likely its last. In a press release, the company said it was “in discussions with a number of data center developers and expects this to be the first of many agreements.” Previously, conventional wisdom assumed that this new generation of digital infrastructure would be powered by emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar and battery power, which have lately seen explosive growth. So far, that vision isn’t panning out as desires to build quickly overcome concerns about sustainability. “There is such a shortage of data center capacity and power,” said Kent Draper, chief commercial officer at Australian data center developer IREN, which has projects in West Texas. “Even the large hyperscalers are willing to turn a blind eye to their renewable goals for some period of time in order to get access.” IREN prioritizes renewable energy for its data centers — giant warehouses full of advanced computers and high-powered cooling systems that can be configured to produce crypto currency or generate artificial intelligence. In Texas, that’s only possible because the company began work here years ago, early enough to secure a timely connection to the state’s grid, Draper said. There were more than 2,000 active generation interconnection requests as of April 30, totalling 411,600 megawatts of capacity, according to grid operator ERCOT. A bill awaiting signature on Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, Senate Bill 6, looks to filter out unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing a $100,000 fee for interconnection studies. Wind and solar farms require vast acreage and generate energy intermittently, so they work best as part of a diversified electrical grid that collectively provides power day and night. But as the AI gold rush gathered momentum, a surge of new project proposals has created yearslong wait times to connect to the grid, prompting many developers to bypass it and build their own power supply. Operating alone, a wind or solar farm can’t run a data center. Battery technologies still can’t store such large amounts of energy for the length of time required to provide steady, uninterrupted power for 24 hours per day as data centers require. Small nuclear reactors have been touted as a means to meet data center demand, but the first new units remain a decade from commercial deployment, while the AI boom is here today. Now, Draper said, gas companies approach IREN all the time offering to quickly provide additional power generation. Gas provides almost half of all power generation capacity in Texas, far more than any other source. But the amount of gas power in Texas has remained flat for 20 years, while wind and solar have grown sharply, according to records from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Facing a tidal wave of proposed AI projects, state lawmakers have taken steps to try and slow the expansion of renewable energy and position gas as the predominant supply for a new era of demand. This buildout promises strong demand and high gas prices for a generation to come, a boon to Texas’ fossil fuel industry, the largest in the nation. It also means more air pollution and emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases, even as the world continues to barrel past temperature records. Texas, with 9% of the U.S. population, accounted for about 15% of current gas-powered generation capacity in the country but 26% of planned future generation at the end of 2024, according to data from Global Energy Monitor. Both the current and planned shares are far more than any other state. GEM identified 42 new gas turbine projects under construction, in development or announced in Texas before the start of this year. None of those projects are sited at data centers. However, other projects announced since then, like CloudBurst and Energy Transfer outside New Braunfels, will include dedicated gas power plants on site at data centers. For gas companies, the boom in artificial intelligence has quickly become an unexpected gold mine. U.S. gas production has risen steadily over 20 years since the fracking boom began, but gas prices have tumbled since 2024, dragged down by surging supply and weak demand. “The sudden emergence of data center demand further brightens the outlook for the renaissance in gas pricing,” said a 2025 oil and gas outlook report by East Daley Analytics, a Colorado-based energy intelligence firm. “The obvious benefit to producers is increased drilling opportunities.” It forecast up to a 20% increase in U.S. gas production by 2030, driven primarily by a growing gas export sector on the Gulf Coast. Several large export projects will finish construction in coming years with demand for up to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day, the report said, while new power generation for data centers would account for 7 billion cubic feet per day of additional demand. That means profits for power providers, but also higher costs for consumers. Natural gas, a mixture primarily composed of methane, burns much cleaner than coal but still creates air pollution, including soot, some hazardous chemicals and greenhouse gases. Unburned methane released into the atmosphere has more than 80 times the near-term warming effect of carbon dioxide, leading some studies to conclude that ubiquitous leaks in gas supply infrastructure make it as impactful as coal to the global climate. It’s a power source that’s heralded for its ability to get online fast, said Ed Hirs, an energy economics lecturer at the University of Houston. But the yearslong wait times for turbines has quickly become the industry’s largest constraint in an otherwise positive outlook. “If you’re looking at a five-year lead time, that’s not going to help Alexa or Siri today,” Hirs said. The reliance on gas power for data centers is a departure from previous thought, said Larry Fink, founder of global investment firm BlackRock, speaking to a crowd of industry executives at an oil and gas conference in Houston in March. About four years ago, if someone said they were building a data center, they said it must be powered by renewables, he recounted. Two years ago, it was a preference. “Today?” Fink said. “They care about power.” Since the start of this year, developers have announced a flurry of gas power deals for data centers. In the small city of Abilene, the builders of Stargate, one of the world’s largest data center projects, applied for permits in January to build 360 megawatts of gas power generation, authorized to emit 1.6 million tons of greenhouse gases and 14 tons of hazardous air pollutants per year. Later, the company announced the acquisition of an additional 4,500 megawatts of gas power generation capacity. Also in January, a startup called Sailfish announced ambitious plans for a 2,600-acre, 5,000 megawatt cluster of data centers in the tiny North Texas town of Tolar, population 940. “Traditional grid interconnections simply can’t keep pace with hyperscalers’ power demands, especially as AI accelerates energy requirements,” Sailfish founder Ryan Hughes told the website Data Center Dynamics at the time. “Our on-site natural gas power islands will let customers scale quickly.” CloudBurst and Energy Transfer announced their data center and power plant outside New Braunfels in February, and another company partnership also announced plans for a 250 megawatt gas plant and data center near Odessa in West Texas. In May, a developer called Tract announced a 1,500-acre, 2,000 megawatt data center campus with some on-site generation and some purchased gas power near the small Central Texas town of Lockhart. Not all new data centers need gas plants. A 120 megawatt South Texas data center project announced in April would use entirely wind power, while an enormous, 5,000 megawatt megaproject outside Laredo announced in March hopes to eventually run entirely on private wind, solar and hydrogen power (though it will use gas at first). Another collection of six data centers planned in North Texas hopes to draw 1,400 megawatts from the grid. All together, Texas’ grid operator predicts statewide power demand will nearly double within five years, driven largely by data centers for artificial intelligence. It mirrors a similar situation unfolding across the country, according to analysis by S&P Global. “There is huge concern about the carbon footprint of this stuff,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the University of Texas at Austin. “If we could decarbonize the power grid, then there is no carbon footprint for this.” However, despite massive recent expansions of renewable power generation, the boom in artificial intelligence appears to be moving the country farther from, not closer to, its decarbonization goals. Looking forward to a buildout of power supply, state lawmakers have proposed or passed new rules to support deployment of more gas generation and slow the surging expansion of wind and solar power projects. Supporters of these bills say they aim to utilize Texas’ position as the nation’s top gas producer. Some energy experts say the rules proposed throughout the legislative session could dismantle the state’s leadership in renewables as well as the state’s ability to provide cheap and reliable power. “It absolutely would [slow] if not completely stop renewable energy,” said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant, about one of the proposed rules in March. “That would really be extremely harmful to the Texas economy.” While the bills deemed as “industry killers” for renewables missed key deadlines, failing to reach Abbott’s desk, they illustrate some lawmakers’ aspirations for the state’s energy industry. One failed bill, Senate Bill 388, would have required every watt of new solar brought online to be accompanied by a watt of new gas. Another set of twin bills, House Bill 3356 and Senate Bill 715, would have forced existing wind and solar companies to buy fossil-fuel based power or connect to a battery storage resource to cover the hours the energy plants are not operating. When the Legislature last met in 2023, it created a $5 billion public “energy fund” to finance new gas plants but not wind or solar farms. It also created a new tax abatement program that excluded wind and solar. This year’s budget added another $5 billion to double the fund. Among the lawmakers leading the effort to scale back the state’s deployment of renewables is state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham. One bill she co-sponsored, SB 819, aimed to create new siting rules for utility-scale renewable projects and would have required them to get permits from the Public Utility Commission that no other energy source — coal, gas or nuclear — needs. “It’s just something that is clearly meant to kneecap an industry,” Lewin said about the bill, which failed to pass. Kolkhorst said the bill sought to balance the state’s need for power while respecting landowners across the state. Former state Rep. John Davis, now a board member at Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, said the session shows how renewables have become a red meat issue. More than 20 years ago, Davis and Kolkhorst worked together in the Capitol as Texas deregulated its energy market, which encouraged renewables to enter the grid’s mix, he said. Now Davis herds sheep and goats on his family’s West Texas ranch, where seven wind turbines provide roughly 40% of their income. He never could have dreamed how significant renewable energy would become for the state grid, he said. That’s why he’s disappointed with the direction the Legislature is headed with renewables. “I can’t think of anything more conservative, as a conservative, than wind and solar,” Davis said. “These are things God gave us — use them and harness them.” A report published in April finds that targeted limitations on solar and wind development in Texas could increase electricity costs for consumers and businesses. The report, done by Aurora Energy Research for the Texas Association of Business, said restricting the further deployment of renewables would drive power prices up 14% by 2035. “Texas is at a crossroads in its energy future,” said Olivier Beaufils, a top executive at Aurora Energy Research. “We need policies that support an all-of-the-above approach to meet the expected surge in power demand.” Likewise, the commercial intelligence firm Wood Mackenzie expects the power demand from data centers to drive up prices of gas and wholesale consumer electricity. Even when new power plants aren’t built on the site of data centers, they might still be developed because of demand from the server farms. For example, in 2023, developer Marathon Digital started up a Bitcoin mine in the small town of Granbury on the site of the 1,100 megawatt Wolf Hollow II gas power plant. It held contracts to purchase 300 megawatts from the plant. One year later, the power plant operator sought permits to install eight additional “peaker” gas turbines able to produce up to 352 megawatts of electricity. These small units, designed to turn on intermittently during hours of peak demand, release more pollution than typical gas turbines. Those additional units would be approved to release 796,000 tons per year of greenhouse gases, 251 tons per year of nitrogen oxides and 56 tons per year of soot, according to permitting documents. That application is currently facing challenges from neighboring residents in state administrative courts. About 150 miles away, neighbors are challenging another gas plant permit application in the tiny town of Blue. At 1,200 megawatts, the $1.2 billion plant proposed by Sandow Lakes Energy Co. would be among the largest in the state and would almost entirely serve private customers, likely including the large data centers that operate about 20 miles away. This plan bothers Hugh Brown, who moved out to these green, rolling hills of rural Lee County in 1975, searching for solitude. Now he lives on 153 wooded acres that he’s turned into a sanctuary for wildlife. “What I’ve had here is a quiet, thoughtful life,” said Brown, skinny with a long grey beard. “I like not hearing what anyone else is doing.” He worries about the constant roar of giant cooling fans, the bright lights overnight and the air pollution. According to permitting documents, the power plant would be authorized to emit 462 tons per year of ammonia gas, 254 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, 153 tons per year of particulate matter, or soot, and almost 18 tons per year of “hazardous air pollutants,” a collection of chemicals that are known to cause cancer or other serious health impacts. It would also be authorized to emit 3.9 million tons of greenhouse gases per year, about as much as 72,000 standard passenger vehicles. “It would be horrendous,” Brown said. “There will be a constant roaring of gigantic fans.” In a statement, Sandow Lakes Energy denied that the power plant will be loud. “The sound level at the nearest property line will be similar to a quiet library,” the statement said. Sandow Lakes Energy said the plant will support the local tax base, provide hundreds of temporary construction jobs and dozens of permanent jobs. Sandow also provided several letters signed by area residents who support the plant. “We recognize the critical need for reliable, efficient and environmentally responsible energy production to support our region’s growth and economic development,” wrote Nathan Bland, president of the municipal development district in Rockdale, about 20 miles from the project site. Sandow says the plant will be connected to Texas’ public grid, and many supporting letters for the project cited a need for grid reliability. But according to permitting documents, the 1,200 megawatt plant will supply only 80 megawatts to the grid and only temporarily, with the rest going to private customers. “Electricity will continue to be sold to the public until all of the private customers have completed projects slated to accept the power being generated,” said a permit review by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Sandow has declined to name those customers. However, the plant is part of Sandow’s massive, master-planned mixed-use development in rural Lee and Milam counties, where several energy-hungry tenants are already operating, including Riot Platforms, the largest cryptocurrency mine on the continent. The seven-building complex in Rockdale is built to use up to 700 megawatts, and in April it announced the acquisition of a neighboring, 125 megawatt cryptocurrency mine, previously operated by Rhodium. Another mine by Bitmain, also one of the world’s largest Bitcoin companies, has 560 megawatts of operating capacity with plans to add 180 more in 2026. In April, residents of Blue gathered at the volunteer fire department building for a public meeting with Texas regulators and Sandow to discuss questions and concerns over the project. Brown, owner of the wildlife sanctuary, spoke into a microphone and noted that the power plant was placed at the far edge of Sandow’s 33,000-acre development, 20 miles from the industrial complex in Rockdale but near many homes in Blue. “You don’t want to put it up into the middle of your property where you could deal with the negative consequences,” Brown said, speaking to the developers. “So it looks to me like you are wanting to make money, in the process of which you want to strew grief in your path and make us bear the environmental costs of your profit.” Disclosure: Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation, Energy Transfer, the Texas Association of Business, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Houston have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Title: From Wall Street To Red Square: Moscow Exchange Lists BlackRock Bitcoin Futures

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Russia’s main exchange. the Moscow Exchange, has started offering Bitcoin futures contracts. This is one of the biggest moves yet in the country’s slow but steady opening to cryptocurrencies. According to market insiders, these new contracts track the price of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF, which has gathered over $72 billion in assets. Trades will be priced in US dollars per lot, while settlements will happen in Russian rubles. This setup lets local traders tap into Bitcoin’s price swings without touching foreign crypto platforms. These Bitcoin futures will come out every three months, with the first batch due to expire in September 2025. Based on reports, only qualified investors will be allowed to trade on the MOEX. That means big banks, funds, and other approved financial groups can take part. Ordinary investors won’t get in on these deals. The Bank of Russia gave the green light in May 2025 for such products, but it still warns most firms to steer clear of direct crypto deals. The idea seems to be to let big players handle the risk in a controlled way. Moscow Exchange decided to price the contracts in US dollars. However, when it’s time to settle, everything happens in rubles. This approach protects Russia from sudden swings in foreign markets. A trader can lock in a deal based on Bitcoin’s value in dollars, yet get paid in their home currency. It’s a setup that keeps money inside Russia even as it ties to a global crypto product. Some analysts see this as a smart middle ground. It lets Russia join the international cryptocurrency scene but without depending on overseas platforms. 🚀 Moscow Stock Exchange Launches #Bitcoin Futures Contracts will only be available to qualified investors, with the futures tied to the value of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, quoted in US dollars, and settled in Russian rubles. (TASS) The launch follows Sberbank’s approval… pic.twitter.com/wMTRlK2Y0y — RT_India (@RT_India_news) June 4, 2025 Behind the scenes, the central bank is still cautious. It approved crypto-linked derivatives for qualified investors, but it hasn’t opened the door for everyone. Most banks and investment firms are told not to put their clients into direct Bitcoin trades. Instead, they can offer tools like these futures if they qualify. This reflects a watchful stance on digital assets. Authorities acknowledge the lure of big profits, but they also want to avoid big losses. By keeping access limited, they hope to keep any trouble contained. Meanwhile, Sberbank, the country’s biggest bank, is working on its own crypto-based product. Soon, select clients will be able to buy structured bonds tied to Bitcoin’s price. These bonds will also trade in rubles and won’t require a crypto wallet. That way, people can bet on Bitcoin without opening accounts on foreign sites. Featured image from Lonely Planet, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock buys $357 mln in BTC, ETH amid shifting whale sentiment
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/blackrock-buys-357-mln-in-btc-eth-amid-shifting-whale-sentiment/
Time Published: 2025-06-06T00:00:02Z

BlackRock purchases $357M in crypto as Ethereum whales accumulate and Bitcoin whales shift to profit-taking. On the 5th of June, BlackRock purchased 2,704 Bitcoin [BTC], valued at approximately $283.9 million, and 28,239 Ethereum [ETH] worth $73.2 million. The firm’s crypto purchase in this round has amounted to a total of $357 million. Its assets under management are now at $11.5 trillion, and this move cements BlackRock’s strong foray into the digital asset space. Notably, the ETH purchase comes after the SEC approval of spot Ethereum ETFs, which are slated to hit the shelves in the next few weeks. BlackRock’s action is more of an outlier compared to the broader whale trends in the market. For BTC, the whale activity appears to be fading. On-chain data indicates that major BTC holders withdrawing their profits, as is typical during periods of price consolidation following an extended rally. So, large players are withdrawing recent gains and potentially positioning themselves for near-term corrections or re-allocations. Source: CryptoQuant But the situation is different for Ethereum. ETH whales appear to be mirroring institutional sentiment rather than unloading assets. The king of altcoins shows significant whale accumulation at comparable price points. This is in sync with growing institutional attention on ETH, especially with the ETF story gaining momentum. Source: CryptoQuant Retail investor sentiment has fallen slightly over recent weeks, leaving the market momentum trailing behind. BlackRock’s fresh investment can be viewed as filling the gap, providing supporting arms to the broader market—specifically Ethereum. While interest from the whales in Bitcoin is on the decline, Ethereum seems to be moving into the institutionally favored asset position currently. Large ETH holders’ behavior indicates long-term sentiment turning positive. Their accumulation may signal optimism about Ethereum’s future, especially with the ETF catalysts and continued network improvements.

Title: Profit-taking, not capitulation: institutions cut Bitcoin ETF exposure by 23% in Q1

CoinShares reported decreasing appeal of the basis trade as likely reason for profit-taking, resulting in declining ETF exposure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Institutional investors cut Bitcoin (BTC) allocations in US-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the first quarter after hedging profits waned and futures premiums compressed, a June 5 CoinShares report showed. The report assessed 13-F filings from asset managers with at least $100 million in assets under management. These investors reported $21.2 billion in Bitcoin ETF exposure as of March 31, down from $27.4 billion registered in last year’s fourth quarter. The 23% pullback outpaced the 12% slide in the overall ETF market’s assets under management and came as Bitcoin dropped 11% over the period. CoinShares tied most of the reduction to hedge funds. Those firms trimmed holdings by almost 33% after the decreasing appeal of the basis trade, which captured wide spreads between futures and spot prices throughout 2024. Advisors moved in the opposite direction. Dollar-denominated stakes decreased in value, yet Bitcoin-denominated positions increased, lifting advisors to 50% of all filer assets. Meanwhile, Hedge funds slipped to 32%, and brokerages held 10%. Advisors also dominated headcount, accounting for 81% of the 755 managers that disclosed Bitcoin ETFs. Despite selling, professional investors still commanded nearly 23% of Bitcoin ETF assets, a modest decrease from the 26.3% share reported in the prior quarter. CoinShares framed the decline as tactical rather than structural, noting that average portfolio allocations sit below 1%. The firm expects larger institutions to build positions once regulatory guidance stabilizes, internal committees approve crypto mandates, and education gaps close. Filers kept a tight focus on three products. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) carried $12.7 billion from professional investors, or almost 33% of the ETF’s assets. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with $3.6 billion, while Grayscale’s converted GBTC held $2.2 billion. Together, the trio account for 85% of institutional ownership. Quarterly flows reflected that hierarchy. BlackRock drew fresh capital from Goldman Sachs and Macquarie, which opened or expanded positions worth $206 million and $136 million, respectively. Hedge fund heavyweight Millennium Management reversed course, slashing $980 million, and Bridgewater-style advisor Bracebridge Capital liquidated $335 million. Wisconsin’s state pension fund sold its entire $323 million stake, while Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala sovereign fund lifted holdings to $411 million. Institutional retrenchment contrasted with corporate treasury accumulation. CoinShares estimated company treasuries increased Bitcoin reserves by 18.7% year-to-date, reaching 1.98 million coins in mid-May. The report noted that corporations emulated Strategy’s balance sheet strategy. At the same time, professional asset managers opted to lock in gains earned since the launch of ETFs in January 2024, following Bitcoin’s crossing of the $100,000 mark in February.

Title: Ethereum ETF Holdings Spike as BlackRock Snaps Up $560 Million in ETH

Time Published: 2025-06-05T19:22:33Z

Ethereum (ETH) trades within a narrow range, with major institutional investors increasing their exposure. According to on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, BlackRock has accumulated over 214,000 ETH over the week—worth approximately $560 million. The move coincides with a period of price consolidation for ETH, which has hovered between $2,500 and $2,700 over the last several weeks. Despite low price volatility, ETF inflows have steadily risen, pointing to growing institutional confidence. BlackRock’s activity suggests a deliberate accumulation strategy. By building positions during a period of market calm, the firm appears to be positioning itself ahead of potential macro or regulatory shifts. Data confirms the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has attracted sustained inflows since U.S. regulators approved Ethereum spot ETFs earlier this year. According to data from SoSoValue, Ethereum ETFs posted $109.43 million in net daily inflows, of which BlackRock alone accounted for $77.06 million. This marked the 12th consecutive day of positive inflows into ETH-based funds. By contrast, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recorded significant outflows on May 30 and June 2—totaling $561 million. While inflows briefly returned to the firm’s Bitcoin product with $58 million on Tuesday, the figure was still dwarfed by Ethereum’s ETF momentum. TheBlock’s Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator shows Ethereum’s next major resistance zone between $2,726 and $2,856. Roughly 4.13 million ETH—held by 2.7 million addresses—were acquired within this band. Meanwhile, over 12 million ETH sit in the out-of-the-money zone at an average cost basis of $2,613. This imbalance suggests that many investors are still in accumulation mode. The at-the-money zone remains larger than immediate resistance, indicating that ETH may be under less near-term sell pressure. Joao Wedson, CEO of analytics firm Alphractal, said in a tweet that significant market-maker activity at lower levels could signal a breakout is forming. He identified a short-term target of $2,830 following a break above $2,660. Wedson also highlighted $2,556 as a key stop-loss threshold based on aggregated liquidation data. Ethereum’s daily chart shows modest strength. A bullish crossover between the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages recently formed, supporting the short-term outlook. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates renewed buyer interest. BlackRock’s $560 million Ethereum purchase via the iShares Ethereum Trust signals a strategic long-term commitment, not a speculative trade. Despite Ethereum’s price staying in a tight range, institutional interest continues to build.

Title: 'We live in a terrarium': Larry Fink on why today's leaders should be 'more guarded'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-leadership-advice-guarded-social-media-populism-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-05T18:28:50Z
Full Content:
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has some words of wisdom for leaders navigating the age of populism and social media: Watch what you say. "You have to be a lot more guarded," Fink said on Thursday. "I can't say everything I really want to say to all of you right now," he joked to the audience attending Forbes's Iconoclast Summit. "The reality is you have to be a lot more systematic in what you say and how you say it internally or externally," he said, adding, "I mean, we live in a terrarium today. We live in a glass bottle." The billionaire cofounder of the world's largest asset manager is no stranger to backlash over the firm's business decisions. Fink's embrace of "ESG" investing, for example, has been derided by Republicans as "woke capitalism," while drawing criticism from climate groups for not going far enough. The state of Texas only recently removed the asset manager from its investment blacklist, allowing the state to reinvest with the firm, after BlackRock withdrew from climate-focused initiatives like the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. "You have to lead differently," in this era, Frink said. "You have to be a lot more thoughtful in every word you say." He said this holds true when it comes to internal messaging as well. "If you can't get your messaging properly with your employee base, and we have 23,000 employees at BlackRock globally, how are you going to get those messages across to all your clients?" Fink said. Fink told the audience gathered at the Cipriani's restaurant in downtown Manhattan that leaders also need to be led. He gave the example of a trip to the firm's European officers following President Trump's "Liberation Day" trade tariffs were unveiled. "The Europeans were quite frightened," Fink said. They were frightened about the potential for dramatic changes to US policy and the implications this could have on the culture and direction of their US-based employer. "Is BlackRock changing too?" Fink recalled them saying, before he reassured them that it would not. "It was just a wake-up call," Fink said. "Even for me, and I think I'm pretty well experienced in this stuff. Again, when there's great moments of uncertainty, even your top leaders need to be led." Where Big Tech secrets go public — unfiltered in your inbox weekly.

Photographer: Suhaimi Abdullah/Bloomberg Circle, the company behind the $61 billion stablecoin USDC, made a roaring debut on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, becoming the first stablecoin issuer to go public and making CEO and cofounder Jeremy Allaire a billionaire. Shares surged as much as 235% after Circle and some of its shareholders raised nearly $1.1 billion in an initial public offering that was upsized twice amid heavy investor demand. The stock opened at $69, more than double its IPO price of $31, and climbed as high as $103.75. The offering included 34 million shares from Circle and other shareholders including Allaire, up from the 32 million shares announced earlier this week and 24 million initially. The IPO was priced well above its initial $24–$26 range and even its revised $27–$28. Based on Circle’s 2 P.M. stock price of $86, Forbes figures Allaire has a net worth of at least $1.7 billion. A representative for Circle has not yet responded to a request for comment about Allaire's net worth. BlackRock, already an investor, and Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management, were among the reported buyers. The deal was led by JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, alongside 12 other underwriters. “We’re thrilled with the demand,” Circle CFO Jeremy Fox-Geen told Forbes. “We saw a wide range of investor interest from traditional mutual fund complexes through to high-conviction, long-oriented pools of private capital within the broader hedge fund space, as well as various sovereign wealth funds. I think it says that the investor community is understanding that we are on the precipice of what we here call the new internet financial system.” Circle’s listing arguably marks crypto’s most significant public market event since Coinbase’s 2021 IPO. The New York-based firm is a pure-play stablecoin business: USDC is the world’s second-largest stablecoin, making up 27% of the market behind Tether’s 67%. While originally used for crypto trading, stablecoins are increasingly drawing attention from financial giants and tech firms—among them Fidelity Investments, Bank of America and Meta—as rails for payments and cross-border transactions. Since launching USDC in 2018, Circle has processed over $25 trillion in transaction volume, nearly $6 trillion of which occurred in just the first quarter of 2025. The company has long positioned itself as the regulated, transparent alternative to Tether, publishing detailed audited reserve disclosures. In 2024, Circle reported $1.68 billion in revenue and $156 million in net income, up from $1.45 billion in revenue and $268 million in profit the year prior. But its business remains highly concentrated: More than 99% of revenue came from interest income on the cash and Treasurys backing USDC. In its S-1 filing, Circle warned that a 1% drop in interest rates could wipe out $441 million of that revenue. Fox-Geen says diversification is underway: “We have a set of product investments which we have started monetizing recently, which range from subscription and services revenues, such as our blockchain network partnerships, through to transaction revenues, where we monetize certain of the flows across the network where users of the network wish to use a value added service which they're willing to pay for.” Those initiatives generated $20.7 million in Q1. Modest for now, but growing quickly, he noted. The company’s distribution model, however, remains costly. In 2024, Circle paid over $1 billion in distribution fees—$900 million of it to Coinbase. Tether, by contrast, doesn’t pay distributors to maintain dominance. The road to public markets was not a straight one. Circle scrapped a $9 billion SPAC merger in late 2022. In 2023, the company was hit by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, where it had deposited a portion of its reserves. Though Circle ultimately recovered the funds, USDC’s market capitalization took months to rebound. In April, Circle reportedly fielded acquisition offers from both Coinbase and Ripple valuing the company at around $5 billion. It opted instead to go public, filing confidentially for an IPO early this year. It’s likely a bet that regulatory clarity will finally be arriving, and with it, a premium for compliance. “Becoming public has always been part of our strategy,” said Fox-Geen. “This is a multi decade transformation of the plumbing of the financial services industry, but that understates just how profound a technology upgrade this really is.”

Title: Circle Shares Opens at $69 on NYSE Debut, Signaling Strong Appetite for Stablecoin Issuers

Shares of Circle (CRCL) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Thursday, opening at $69 a share in early trading. The stock at one point surged to as much as $100, more than 200% above the $31 price it had set the night before. The company announced late Wednesday that it sold roughly 34 million shares in its initial public offering, raising $1.1 billion and landing a valuation of $6.9 billion. The listing marks Circle’s long-awaited arrival on public markets after previous attempts, including a failed SPAC deal in 2021. Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management expressed interest in buying as much as $150 million worth of the circle shares, with BlackRock also intending to buy 10% of the shares, according to SEC filings and Bloomberg. The IPO draws comparisons to crypto exchange Coinbase's (COIN) 2021 IPO on Nasdaq, which saw a volatile session with shares trading as high as $430 before tumbling to $200 one month later. Elsewhere, crypto-linked stocks, including Coinbase and Strategy (MSTR), along with bitcoin BTC$108,051.48, were trading lower on Thursday. Circle's shares seem to have stabilized around $80 to $83 per share. Circle's debut lands in a market still wrestling with an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Earnings season is winding down, and more companies have flagged weak outlooks for the next quarter than strong ones, suggesting that U.S. stocks could face added pressure in the months ahead. However, Circle’s core business — issuing the dollar-pegged USDC token — is benefiting from a different trend. Demand for stablecoins has grown in 2025, partly due to progress on U.S. regulation. Policymakers have signaled they’re moving closer to establishing clearer rules, which could help legitimize and expand the use of stablecoins in mainstream finance. Deutsche Bank predicted in a report last month that stablecoins are on the verge of going mainstream. The bank cited their growing role in digital payments, cross-border settlement and treasury management while also reinforcing the U.S. dollar's dominance globally. Circle’s IPO may be early evidence of that shift — an investor bet not just on a crypto company, but on stablecoins becoming essential financial infrastructure.

At first glance, throwing Web3 and AI into a headline might seem like a bad example of buzzword soup, the practice of media companies trying to game the algorithms (and your attention) by using a bunch of the most-searched words of the day. But CoinDesk has been following the slow integration of applications that track vast amounts of data on a public blockchain and the artificial intelligence capable of making sense of that data for a decade. In the first-ever CoinDesk Top Women in Web3 & AI list, we consulted with a panel of women judges: Julia Bonafede, Co-Founder of investment management firm, Rosetta Analytics; Olivia Bolec, Google’s Enterprise Global Account Director; Sarah Idahosa, Founder of Women in Defi; Saruul Krause-Jentsch, Head of Podcast at Spotify for Central Europe; and Amélie M., Founder and President of the French branch of the Association of Women in Crypto. This list was brought to life through a collaboration between CoinDesk and Proof of Talk, hosted by XVentures. To help ensure the list selection process was as unbiased as possible we sought out multiple, diverse perspectives. An initial public outreach on social media platforms and to our deeply sourced expert analysts, resulted in more than 300 nominations from every geographic region. After removing the name and contact information from each nomination, CoinDesk’s editorial board narrowed the candidates to 100 semifinalists. A panel of five judges then reviewed the resulting list of semifinalists, looking for the rare combination of innovation, relevancy and influence. Each judge closely reviewed 20 candidates, providing crucial feedback for the final selection process. Rather than focusing exclusively on technical innovation, the list recognizes that the development of emerging technologies involves multiple types of expertise—from product development and business strategy to regulatory compliance and ethical frameworks. As both Web3 and AI move from experimental phases toward broader adoption, these diverse perspectives become increasingly important. For a fuller explanation of the methodology, please see here. Amodei is an architect of responsible AI development, having co-founded Anthropic in 2021 after her principled departure from OpenAI over safety concerns.

Since co-founding the crypto exchange-traded product firm in 2018, she’s helped grow it into one of the most prolific creators of ETPs and ETF. 21Shares now manages $9.3 billion in 54 ETPs around the world, including five in the U.S. In addition, it currently has applications out for a Dogecoin ETF and Sui ETF awaiting approval. The Harvard alumna has helped create one of Bitcoin's most impactful Layer-2 solutions, with the Lightning Network now serving more than one million users through integrations with major exchanges like Binance and Kraken. Under her leadership, Lightning Labs has raised over $82.5 million and helped grow the Lightning Network to more than 14,000 active nodes, reinforcing Bitcoin's infrastructure for faster, lower-cost transactions. When Su took the helm of AMD in 2014, the company was struggling, with a stock price around $3 and a market capitalization of approximately $2 billion. Through strategic investments in high-performance computing and a focus on AI-driven innovation, she orchestrated a remarkable turnaround. By 2022, AMD's market value surpassed that of its long-time rival, Intel, for the first time, and the stock price soared to about $140, reflecting a nearly 50-fold increase. Under her leadership, AMD launched the Instinct MI300X AI accelerator in December 2023, positioning the company as a formidable player in the AI hardware space. In recognition of her transformative leadership, Su was named TIME's 2024 CEO of the Year. Launched in August 2024, MANSA uses stablecoins to help under-served African clients fund customer accounts instantly. Investors loan stablecoins to payments companies that need to be pre-funded for larger volumes. Under Uwaje’s leadership, MANSA raised $10 million in funding, including a $3 million pre-seed round led by Tether, to expand into Latin America and Southeast Asia. The company has facilitated $92 million in payments, resulting in $178 million in on-chain volume. Viégas co-founded Google’s People+AI Research (PAIR) initiative, in 2017, to create tools that are used inside and outside of Google to this day, and to build industry standards for Human-AI interactive systems. In 2022 she joined Harvard as a professor. The Brazil-native’s work has been cited 39,000 times, according to Google Scholar, including a project called Wind Map that uses data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to visualize hurricane predictions. The president of end-to-end encrypted messaging app, Signal, is also a co-founder of the AI Now Institute, which since 2017 has been studying the social implications of artificial intelligence. In April 2019, she co-led a walkout at Google to protest systems designed, she said, to keep AI development “overwhelmingly white and male.” She’s now the chief advisor to AI Now, which in April published a report about how military AI systems are jeopardizing U.S. national security.

Title: BlackRock Escapes Texas Oil-Boycott List After ESG Retreat

BlackRock Inc. was removed from Texas’ blacklist of companies that boycott fossil fuels, ending a three-year standoff over the environmental policies of the world’s largest asset manager. The move means pension funds and other state-run investment accounts — which manage more than $300 billion of assets — will be allowed to purchase BlackRock shares, invest in its exchange-traded funds and hire the firm for advice and risk management. Inclusion on the list resulted in some Texas entities pulling billions of dollars of assets from the firm. State Comptroller Glenn Hegar said BlackRock had rolled back many of its green-focused initiatives, including exiting the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative and stepping back from the Climate Action 100+, a group devoted to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. The move marks a win for BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, who has been courting Texas leaders. Last year, he took the stage with Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick at a summit focused on shoring up the state’s energy grid, and just months ago BlackRock sponsored a table at the Black Tie & Boots Gala, a celebration of conservative politics in Texas. The company is also backing a Dallas-based Texas Stock Exchange. “We appreciate the Comptroller’s resolution of this matter,” a spokesperson for the firm said in a statement. “BlackRock is proud to help millions of Texans retire with dignity and, on behalf of clients, invests over $400 billion in corporations, local governments, energy infrastructure and other private assets throughout the state. These investments support the continued growth of the Texas economy.” Hegar touted some of BlackRock’s steps. He said while they are “unrelated” to the listing decision, the actions “show a real commitment to overall policy changes and a desire to act as a trusted partner in the growth of the Texas economy.” The company was a major target for conservative activists for years, with groups taking out advertisements around the country targeting the firm and Fink in particular. They argued the company was trying to influence corporate America and wider society through its support for ESG and sustainable investing. Republican officials in several states joined in that campaign, pulling money from the firm and arguing that it was harming fossil-fuel producing states like Texas. Fink himself said he would no longer use the ESG term because it had been politicized. “We never set out to punish any of these firms, and the hope was always that any firm we included on the list would eventually take steps to ensure they were removed,” Hegar said in a statement. “BlackRock, following the lead of many of its competitors, has finally done exactly that. While it took the company longer than others in the financial sector to make the shift, the end results are what matter.” BlackRock and a number of other financial firms including UBS Group AG and BNP Paribas SA were added to Texas’ blacklist n 2022. The action followed a law that restricted business with companies that the state considered to be hostile to the energy industry. Since then, the ESG push at investment firms, pension funds and law practices has faded somewhat, partly because of efforts to avoid attacks by President Donald Trump and Republicans. BlackRock has been seeking to get off the list since it was added. The firm had always maintained it didn’t run afoul of the law. At the time it was included, the company said the decision was “not a fact-based judgment” and detailed investments of more than $100 billion in Texas energy companies. As head of Texas’ finances, Hegar is required to update the list once a year and can do so as often as quarterly. And though his office reviews information on an ongoing basis, removing BlackRock is likely to be one of Hegar’s last actions in the post. The three-term comptroller has been named the next chancellor of the Texas A&M University System after its current leader steps down on June 30.

Title: Wall Street Embraces Crypto: 4 IPO Listings In 7 Months

ByTomer Niv ByTomer Niv, Contributor. Illustration of Nasdaq and Bitcoin logos. Circle, the issuer of USD Coin (USDC), debuted on the NYSE today by raising $1.05 billion at $31 per share, valuing the company at roughly $8 billion. The IPO exceeded expectations and was one of the largest crypto-related listings since Coinbase in 2021. It signals a significant shift: crypto firms, especially those dealing in infrastructure or stablecoins, are now being viewed as more “institutionally safe” than speculative assets. Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire emphasized in his X account that going public promotes transparency and trust - essential ingredients for bridging crypto and traditional finance. Crypto related IPOs. Galaxy Digital uplisted to Nasdaq in May 2025. Previously listed in Toronto, the firm made the move to gain greater liquidity and access to U.S. capital. Although it didn’t raise money on the day of its listing, Galaxy soon followed with a secondary offering. The uplisting was seen as a regulatory milestone - Galaxy shifted domicile from the Cayman Islands to Delaware to meet listing requirements. eToro, the Israeli social trading platform, went public the same week. Priced at $52, the stock surged nearly 30% on debut, giving it a ~$5.6 billion valuation. eToro’s pivot to regulatory compliance, such as limiting its U.S. crypto services and settling with the SEC, played a major role in making the IPO viable. Crypto now forms a significant chunk of eToro’s revenue, blurring the line between fintech and crypto-native businesses. Exodus, maker of a self-custody crypto wallet, uplisted to NYSE in late 2024. Though smaller in size (~$800–900 million market cap), its listing marked a step forward for crypto software firms. The move followed the election of President Trump and a more crypto-friendly regulatory tone, signaling a potential shift in how smaller crypto players can access public markets. Yoni and Ronen Assia, co-founders of eToro, after the eToro IPO event outside the Nasdaq in New ... More York. Coinbase’s direct listing in April 2021 was historic. It opened at $381, peaking at $429, and ended the day with a valuation around $85 billion. The listing legitimized crypto on Wall Street and established a blueprint for future IPOs. Today, Coinbase has gained further credibility by entering the S&P 500 index in 2025. Robinhood, though not crypto-native, made its mark in July 2021. The IPO raised $2 billion at a $32 billion valuation. Robinhood’s significant crypto trading volumes made it a proxy for retail crypto enthusiasm. Its listing reinforced the narrative that consumer fintechs with crypto exposure could thrive in public markets. Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase. Companies like Marathon, Riot, and Strategy (formelly known as MicroStrategy) went public before they were crypto-linked: Marathon and Riot pivoted to Bitcoin mining from totally different businesses (patents and biotech) and reached $4-5 billion market caps during bull cycles. Strategy, originally an analytics software company, became a de facto Bitcoin ETF, amassing over 568,000 BTC and reaching a $25 billion valuation. These firms illustrate how legacy businesses have transformed into crypto leaders, even if their IPOs predated the sector’s rise. Michael Saylor, co-founder and CEO of Strategy. Several crypto companies are considered strong IPO candidates: ConsenSys (developer of MetaMask and other Ethereum developer tools) is viewed as nearly IPO-ready, with a $7 billiob valuation and ongoing internal preparations. It could become the first pure-play blockchain infrastructure listing. Ledger, the hardware wallet maker, is likely to IPO on Euronext or a U.S. exchange. With $500+ million in funding and strong global brand recognition, it could appeal to security-conscious investors. Fireblocks, an institutional custody provider, is valued at $8 billion. While in no rush to go public, it has been hiring C-suite leaders in preparation. Chainalysis, the blockchain intelligence and analytics firm, is a key compliance partner to governments and businesses. Leadership changes and new board members hint at IPO readiness. Kraken may be the next major U.S. exchange to list. It’s been expanding globally and acquiring traditional trading platforms like NinjaTrader. Revolut, while not crypto-native, is seen as a possible candidate for IPO. With its massive user base and crypto integration, it would highlight the fintech-crypto convergence. 1. Maturing Crypto Businesses: Firms like Circle and Coinbase now resemble traditional fintechs - with compliance teams, revenue transparency, and risk management. This appeals to public investors seeking durable growth. 2. Regulatory Shift: Under the Trump administration, the U.S. has signaled a more crypto-friendly stance. The SEC’s softer tone (e.g. approving spot Bitcoin ETFs and dismissing many lawsuits against crypto companies) and moves toward stablecoin legislation reduce uncertainty for would-be public companies. 3. Institutional Buy-In: Heavyweights like BlackRock, Visa, and Fidelity are not only backing crypto firms, taking part in their IPOs, but also launching crypto-related services. Their involvement lends legitimacy and opens doors for broader investment. 4. Better Investor Protections: Public listings require disclosures and financial oversight, giving both retail and institutional investors greater confidence. 2025 is emerging as a watershed year in which crypto and traditional finance begin to truly converge. What was once considered a fringe sector defined by volatility and skepticism is now producing companies that are not only IPO-ready, but in some cases are joining the ranks of the S&P 500. Crypto-native firms like Circle, Galaxy Digital, eToro, and Exodus have all gone public over the past year, signaling that digital asset businesses are entering the financial mainstream. They join earlier listings from Coinbase and Robinhood, which helped lay the groundwork for what is now a rapidly expanding category of “crypto stocks.” For investors, this shift presents a broader and more diversified opportunity set. The market now includes publicly traded exchanges, self-custody wallets, institutional infrastructure providers, and fintech apps with integrated crypto trading and staking features. This diversity reflects a maturing industry that is increasingly defined not by speculative trading, but by real business models and long-term strategic vision. Importantly, the move into public markets also brings greater accountability. Listed companies must meet higher standards for financial reporting, compliance, and governance - which in turn makes them more attractive to institutional capital. While significant risks remain, including regulatory fragmentation across jurisdictions and persistent market volatility, the underlying foundation of the crypto sector is stronger than ever. Going public enables these companies to access capital and scale responsibly, under the watchful eye of both regulators and public shareholders. In short, crypto’s entrance into public equity markets marks a pivotal step toward institutional credibility, market discipline, and sustainable growth.

Title: From Bitcoin Maxis to Yield Farmers: A Crypto Archetype Glossary

Highlights Crypto culture is diverse and tribal, with distinct archetypes like bitcoin maximalists, builders, degens, yield farmers, OG HODLers and now institutional players — each with unique ideologies, goals and influence on the ecosystem. Builders and degens shape innovation and speculation, where builders focus on long-term infrastructure and user experience, while degens embrace high-risk, fast-paced strategies like yield farming and meme coin trading. Institutional adoption is legitimizing crypto, with major firms and banks entering the space — shifting the balance of power but raising concerns over regulation, centralization and the original ethos of decentralization. The cryptocurrency landscape can be tribal, full of vibrant archetypes that each hold distinct ideologies and goals.

Δ From bitcoin maxis to degens and yield farmers, even OG HODLers, the crypto space isn’t just pure technology. To its most diehard supporters, the industry represents a powder keg of culture, ideology and economics, all crashing into each other on-chain. For traditional players, understanding how different factions describe themselves can serve as a way to understand what they are looking to get out of, or build into, at the intersection of finance and blockchain. The bitcoin maximalist is one of the more recognizable personas dominating the crypto sphere. To maxis, bitcoin isn’t just the first cryptocurrency. It’s the only one that matters. They can be found pushing things like strategic bitcoin reserves and telling anyone who will listen that the value of bitcoin will one day reach the millions. These bitcoin maxis, who can frequently refer to themselves as being “orange-pilled,” were once on the fringe. But they are becoming more mainstream as crypto itself becomes more embraced across the financial landscape. Dozens of companies, following the lead of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), have now launched corporate bitcoin treasuries, turning their businesses, in essence, into a financial bet on the digital currency’s future value. In April, a new company formed by Cantor Fitzgerald, Tether Holdings SA and SoftBank Group, Twenty One Capital, aimed to become one of the largest public holders of bitcoin by deploying billions of dollars to stockpile the digital asset. Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said May 19 that the bank now offers its clients access to bitcoin. The bank announced Wednesday (June 4) plans to offer financing to clients using spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as collateral. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke,” Dimon said in May. “I defend your right to buy bitcoin.” Read also: Are Crypto Markets Going Mainstream? What Treasury Execs Should Know For crypto advocates who view themselves as builders, the blockchain is an experimental playground. These are the developers, engineers and entrepreneurs deploying smart contracts, creating payment networks, and launching Layer 2 solutions. They are often chain-agnostic and driven by a hacker ethos of permissionless innovation. “The biggest problem in crypto is not adoption, it’s the user experience,” Mesh CEO and co-founder Bam Azizi told PYMNTS last month. “You need to make payments so simple that even a grandmother will use it one day, maybe without even knowing that the mechanism behind the scenes is a stablecoin … to do that, you need to do a lot of heavy lifting.” That’s where the builders come in. They can be dismissive of the hype cycles (and market collapses) but are invested in shipping products that work and bring blockchain closer to institutional-grade architecture. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS in April. “Back in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.” Degens represent the risk-tolerant end of the spectrum. They are the high-flying crypto market traders, found on exchanges like Binance and formerly FTX. For them, crypto is a game of high-stakes strategy. Yield farming, airdrop hunting, meme coin speculation — these activities aren’t just profit-driven, they’re cultural rituals. Degens are all about tokenizing everything onto the blockchain and then trading or building financial products with it. To gain their favor (and investment fees), the marketplace is responding. Crypto exchange Kraken is planning to offer tokenized versions of more than 50 stocks, called xStocks, including names like Apple, Tesla and Nvidia, along with exchange-traded funds (ETFs), showing that blockchain is increasingly maturing beyond its earlier history. Kraken’s xStocks aren’t targeting American day traders or Wall Street veterans. Instead, they’re aimed at retail investors in emerging and underserved markets. But as crypto market regulation starts to shape up in the United States, what might happen next could be anyone’s guess. Yield farmers are similar in that these individuals or entities are seeking to maximize their returns by strategically moving their crypto assets across different decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Yield farming is essentially the act of putting crypto assets to work to earn passive income, often in the form of interest, rewards or tokens. Yield farmers seek out platforms offering the highest annual percentage yield. They may switch protocols frequently, sometimes daily or hourly, in pursuit of better returns. See also: The CFO and Treasurer’s Guide to Digital Assets The OG HODLers are the original gangsters of crypto, so to speak. These are the individuals who bought in early, weathered the Mt. Gox collapse, and held through multiple bear markets. To them, crypto is not a career or a play-to-earn game. It’s a multi-decade revolution, and OGs often sit on holdings and prefer cold wallets to constant engagement. Some may argue this tribalism is holding the industry back, creating echo chambers and slowing down consensus on technical standards. Others believe it’s a feature, not a bug, the sign of a healthy, pluralistic ecosystem. As crypto matures, the stakes get higher. Governments are crafting regulations, institutional money is flowing in, and technological standards are being codified. In this landscape, who gets to speak for crypto? Who sets the rules? Who gets funded? New archetypes are also entering the arena, such as crypto corporates. Once derided, institutional players are now a dominant force. Whether it’s BlackRock pushing Bitcoin ETFs, Visa integrating stablecoins, or Coinbase going public, corporate involvement is legitimizing crypto in the eyes of regulators and traditional investors. However, many experts worry that this comes at the cost of KYC, surveillance and centralization. Still, the capital and stability these entities provide are reshaping the competitive landscape. And their regulatory capabilities are helping shape the future.
