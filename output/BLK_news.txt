For more information, please contact: Sequana Medical Investor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.com T: +44 (0) 797 342 9917 About Sequana Medical Sequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload, a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease, heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study, a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada, the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life1,2. Sequana Medical is commercializing the alfapump through a specialty commercial team initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. In August 2025, CMS announced that it approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements3. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com.

Title: BlackRock sends $382M in Bitcoin and $220M in Ethereum to Coinbase

Share this article BlackRock deposited 74,973 Ethereum worth $220 million and 4,356 Bitcoin worth $382 million to Coinbase Prime today, according to data from blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence. The movements come amid uneven flows across BlackRock’s digital asset funds. On Tuesday, the firm’s Bitcoin ETF recorded more than $210 million in net outflows, while its Ethereum ETF saw net redemptions exceeding $220 million. Still, daily ETF flows do not necessarily capture the immediate trading behavior of the underlying assets. Instead, the flows provide insight into share creation and redemption. That said, authorized participants may choose to hold shares in inventory, wait for buyers, or redeem shares for Bitcoin at a later time. This means that inflows and outflows often lag actual market activity, and short-term daily numbers may not accurately reflect investor sentiment or trading pressure.

Title: Most Influential: Carlos Domingo

Time Published: 2025-12-17T15:00:00Z

Eight years after co-founding Securitize in 2017, Carlos Domingo is steering what has quietly become one of the core infrastructure players of the tokenized asset trade. This feature is a part of CoinDesk's Most Influential 2025 list. The firm says it has about $3.6 billion in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) outstanding as of late November and expects to finish the year above $4 billion in assets under management. Securitize is profitable — revenue has grown roughly 10x over the past 18 months — and the firm is preparing to go public via a SPAC merger with Cantor Fitzgerald’s vehicle, with a listing targeted for early next year. “This has been the best year in the company's history, by far,” Domingo said in an interview with CoinDesk. “It’s been the inflection point we’d been waiting for.” If tokenization is one of crypto’s big narratives now, Domingo is quick to point out that Securitize was there when it decidedly wasn’t. “In 2021 I would talk to investors and they’d say, ‘Why would we invest in tokenization? Look at FTX, Celsius, BlockFi, they’re growing so fast,’” he said. “I’d say, ‘Sure, but are you sure those guys will be around tomorrow?’ There were a lot of red flags. Still, we were not the cool kids on the block.” It was a challenging path. Securitize had to raise fresh funding roughly every 18 months, with modest rounds compared to the mega-raises going to unregulated trading platforms. Hiring talent was harder, too. “We couldn’t give people big token packages. We couldn’t pay the highest salaries,” Domingo said. What kept him going was conviction and a bit of survivalist philosophy. “One of our board members, Brad Stephens from Blockchain Capital, told me: you need to be like a cockroach,” Domingo said. “Digitization of any industry is unavoidable, the only thing you don’t know is when. So you need to make sure you don’t die before it happens.” He’s blunt about what happened to early tokenization rivals. “If you look at the companies that looked like they were going to dominate, most disappeared, ran out of money or sold on bad terms,” he said. “Being early is a problem if you don’t survive.” Carlos Domingo will be speaking at CoinDesk's upcoming Consensus Hong Kong in February and Consensus 2026 in Miami in May. When Securitize launched, Domingo thought he was building a software company. “The original idea was to sell a tokenization platform as technology,” he recalled. Banks, asset managers and other issuers would license the stack, tokenize their assets and handle everything themselves. Securitize would just ship code. It took less than a year for reality to bite. “In 2018 it became very clear we needed to pivot from being a technology provider to being a service provider,” he said. “The people that have financial assets are not technology companies. They expect somebody to provide service to them – that’s what BNY, State Street or SS&C do.” That led Securitize to pursue licenses and roles that live deep in the plumbing of traditional finance. The firm became a registered transfer agent in the U.S., then added a broker-dealer, an alternative trading system (ATS), an investment adviser and fund administration capabilities. The transformation culminated with the acquisition of MG Stover’s unit, turning Securitize into the largest digital-asset fund administrator. Today, instead of selling a tokenization toolkit, Domingo pitches a one-stop shop to bring assets onchain. “We go to an asset manager and say: we’ll form the fund, we’ll put your securities onchain, we’ll integrate with the blockchains and DeFi, we’ll do distribution, fund admin, everything,” he said. “You do what you do well — manage assets. We do everything else.” He traces that strategy back to a dog-eared copy of “Crossing the Chasm,” Geoffrey Moore’s classic on commercializing new technologies. The core idea: early adopters are happy to stitch together multiple vendors; the mainstream market is not. “To cross the chasm, you have to offer the whole product,” Domingo said. “People are not going to piecemeal build things by putting together five different providers." The company has now moved far beyond survival, lining up a powerful roster of backers including BlackRock, Jump Crypto and Cathie Wood's ARK Invest. Securitize helped bring BlackRock’s tokenized fund to market last year and has since expanded it across multiple blockchains, including Solana and BNB Chain. It’s currently the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury offering, with a roughly $2.5 billion market cap. It also lined up a powerful roster of backers Ark Invest, BlackRock and Jump Crypto. Domingo said the important shift isn’t just about putting securities on a “better ledger,” but, instead, what happens after that. The use case he emphasized is collateral. “We’re very bullish on collateral,” he said. “You can take high-quality collateral like people use in TradFi, but move it at crypto speed, 24/7, with the quality of collateral institutions expect.” Securitize has worked with venues like Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, on using tokenized RWAs as collateral in derivatives and other products. It's the kind of plumbing that doesn’t trend on social media, but it’s where Domingo sees tokenization starting to matter for the broader crypto market structure. The SPAC listing is both a milestone and a new kind of pressure. “I’m very excited about finally going public. It’s going to be a defining moment for us,” he said. “It’s also scary. I’ve never been CEO of a publicly traded company.” While Securitize’s year may look like an overnight success, from Domingo’s point of view, it’s the delayed payoff for being early and refusing to leave. “Now it’s not about whether the industry is happening or not,” he said. “It’s about how much market share we can capture and retain. We’ve been talking about this for eight years. Finally, everybody else is talking about it too.” More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You DAWN raises $13M to expand decentralized broadband networks The decentralized wireless protocol plans U.S. expansion and new international deployments as investors back a user-owned alternative to legacy internet providers.

Title: Did Bitcoin's 4-year cycle break, and is the bull market really over?
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/did-bitcoin-4-year-cycle-break-is-bull-market-really-over
Time Published: 2025-12-17T14:55:34Z

Bitcoin ETFs, corporate treasuries and macro tailwinds are challenging BTC’s traditional four-year cycle, which could result in new all-time highs in 2026. Key takeaways: ETFs, treasuries and macro tailwinds may snap Bitcoin’s four-year boom-and-bust pattern. A bearish phase should not be ruled out before new all-time highs. Bitcoin (BTC) has historically moved in four-year cycles tied to its halving events, with prices typically peaking 12-18 months after each supply cut before sliding into a prolonged bear market. This time was no different. Bitcoin peaked near $126,200 in October, exactly eighteen months after the April 2024 halving, before declining by more than 30%. The trend aligns with the early stages of past bearish phases, prompting veteran analysts such as Peter Brandt to see Bitcoin falling toward $25,000 in the coming months. João Wedson, founder of onchain analytics company Alphractal, pointed to the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Trend Signal, a metric signaling the end of Bitcoin’s bull market. Historically, SOPR marked market turning points by tracking shifts between profit-taking and loss-driven selling. In bull markets, SOPR stayed above 1 as coins were sold at a profit, often preceding local tops. Near the bottom, it fell toward or below 1, signaling a realization of loss. A sustained recovery above 1 later marked easing sell pressure and past rebounds. As of December, SOPR was trending lower, showing BTC was being spent at smaller profits or at a loss. This supported the bearish narrative based on the four-year cycle. “You may believe that Bitcoin’s cycles have changed and that this time is different,” Wedson said, adding: Multiple market observers noted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle may no longer be applicable, however. On Monday, US-based Grayscale Investments predicted that BTC’s price would reach a new record high in the first half of 2026, citing a growing macro demand due to currency debasement and a supportive regulatory environment in the US. “Fiat currencies (and assets denominated in fiat currencies) face additional risks due to high and rising public sector debt and its potential implications for inflation over time,” Grayscale wrote in its latest report, adding: Fidelity shared a similar bullish outlook in its 2026 crypto outlook report. The investment company discussed the odds of Bitcoin entering a “supercycle,” analogous to commodity supercycles in the 2000s that spanned nearly a decade. Related: Bitcoin’s four-year cycle is intact, but driven by politics and liquidity: Analyst Central to this view is what Chris Kuiper, Fidelity Digital Assets’ vice president of research, called an “entirely new cohort and class of investors,” which could support a longer market expansion than in past cycles. “We’ve seen traditional money managers and investors begin to buy Bitcoin and other digital assets,” he said, adding: As of December, US Bitcoin ETFs backed by BlackRock, Fidelity, and others collectively held over 1.30 million BTC (~$114.13 billion), a 309% increase since their debut in January 2024. At the same time, public companies held over 1.08 million (~$100.42 billion) in their treasuries, an investor cohort that hardly existed before 2020. With Bitcoin miners’ role decreasing with each halving, new demand from ETFs and corporate treasuries may be altering the boom-and-bust dynamics that have historically defined Bitcoin’s four-year cycle.

Today’s top news: Two separate announcements today pointed in the same direction. Stablecoins are moving deeper into the U.S. financial system. First, Visa expanded its USDC settlement program to U.S. banks, enabling participating institutions to settle obligations using Circle’s USDC on Solana. The expansion allows banks and payment firms to move funds outside of traditional banking hours, with onchain settlement finality and integration into Visa’s existing treasury and reconciliation systems. Visa has previously tested stablecoin settlement internationally and with select partners, but this marks a broader U.S. rollout. At the same time, the FDIC approved a proposed rulemaking to implement the GENIUS Act, outlining how FDIC-supervised banks could issue payment stablecoins through subsidiaries. The proposal describes application requirements, governance standards, reserve and liquidity expectations, and ongoing supervisory oversight. Banks would be required to maintain high-quality reserves backing issued stablecoins and operate within defined risk-management and compliance frameworks. “Visa is expanding stablecoin settlement because our banking partners are not only asking about it—they’re preparing to use it” - Visa’s Global Head of Growth Products and Strategic Partnerships Rubail Birwadker “Fintech and crypto innovators increasingly ask us to bring stablecoins into their existing product suite.” - Gilles Gade, founder, president, and CEO of Cross River Bank A powerful milestone in the mainstream adoption and acceptance of USDC, with Visa announcing that all US card issuers (banks, fintechs, crypto firms) can now settle directly with Visa using USDC.

Visa’s expansion shows how large payment networks are integrating stablecoins into existing systems, while the FDIC’s proposal outlines the framework banks would use to issue and manage them. The combination matters. Institutional adoption tends to accelerate once large financial intermediaries and regulators move in the same direction.

Title: Former SEC counsel explains what it takes to make RWAs compliant
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-sec-counsel-ownership-rwa-compliant
Time Published: 2025-12-17T13:45:00Z

The SEC’s changing approach to crypto is supporting RWA growth, but jurisdictional and yield constraints continue to limit compliant models. The key constraint on real-world assets (RWAs) has been regulatory engagement rather than technology, and that dynamic has been shifting in the US, said Ashley Ebersole, chief legal officer of Sologenic. Ebersole joined the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early 2015, where he served in the agency’s early internal working groups on crypto and the application of securities law to blockchain-based assets. The securities regulator published the DAO Report in 2017, asserting its jurisdiction over tokens that met the definition of securities. What followed was an enforcement-led approach that left little room for sustained dialogue with the industry. “After the DAO Report, it was an enforcement response for the next two years. I expected there would be more of a rotation toward policy while I was still there — that didn’t happen,” he told Cointelegraph. Ebersole said that posture hardened after he left the agency, shortly before Gary Gensler took the helm in April 2021. From private practice, he continued engaging with the SEC until staff were later discouraged from interacting with crypto firms. The communication breakdown made it difficult for companies to design legally compliant RWA products and delayed the development of onchain securities models that are now moving into production. The market for tokenized real-world assets is scaling quickly. Standard Chartered has projected that the value of non-stablecoin RWAs could reach $2 trillion by 2028, driven largely by tokenized equities, funds and other traditional financial instruments migrating onto blockchains. Major financial institutions are positioning for that shift. BlackRock is reportedly exploring tokenization to modernize fund infrastructure, while JPMorgan has launched tokenized money-market products on Ethereum. “There is a right way to do compliant tokenization and issue tokenized assets. It absolutely can be done,” Ebersole said. Related: Ronin and ZKsync’s onchain metrics fell the most in 2025 One model he pointed to involves stock tokens that function similarly to depository receipts. When a user purchases a token, a corresponding share is acquired and held by a regulated clearing broker, while a token is minted to represent contractual rights to that share. “You own it. It’s minted at the time of purchase, and it references contractual rights to a share of stock that was purchased at the same time,” Ebersole said. Ebersole said this approach differs from other tokenized stock products that offer price exposure without conferring ownership. In those cases, stock tokens function as synthetic instruments that track the price of an equity without granting shareholder rights or a legal claim on the underlying asset. The distinction remains relevant today. In late July, Robinhood promoted tokenized exposure linked to OpenAI. The private company publicly distanced itself from the product and said that any transfer of its equity requires approval, which did not occur. Interest in tokenized RWAs is accelerating, but Ebersole warned that it does not eliminate the geographical constraints of securities regulation. In practice, many RWA initiatives run into legal and jurisdictional limits. Securities laws remain nationally bound even if blockchain infrastructure is not. An RWA structure that complies with US requirements does not automatically translate to the European Union or Asian markets, where separate licensing, disclosure and distribution rules apply. “The toughest thing we hear about with tokenized RWA projects is the maze of legal requirements that apply to these assets if you’re doing them in a fully legally compliant way,” Ebersole said. “That’s true in the US, and it’s even more complicated globally.” Related: How crypto is used in 2025: YouTube, Pokémon cards and more That fragmentation has pushed many platforms toward region-specific offerings. Robinhood’s tokenization offering is limited to EU users. It allows trading in tokenized US stocks and exchange-traded products but does not confer direct ownership of the underlying shares. Instead, the tokens mirror the prices of publicly traded securities and are regulated as blockchain-based derivatives under the bloc’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). Yield is another area where RWA tokenization often runs into regulatory friction. Ebersole noted that regulators draw a sharp distinction between yield generated through a holder’s own actions — such as participating in transaction validation — and yield that accrues passively simply by holding a token. “If you buy an asset with an inherent yield just by virtue of holding it, regulators are still going to look at that as the hallmark of a security,” he said. That distinction has already shaped enforcement decisions and continues to influence how tokenized products are structured. While regulatory views on staking and other forms of yield have evolved under the current SEC administration, Ebersole said inherent yield remains a sensitive trigger under current law. The practical shift for RWAs has come from a change in how the SEC approaches the industry. During an enforcement-heavy period under the Gensler-led SEC, when staff were discouraged from engaging with crypto firms, would-be issuers were left without a workable path to build compliant onchain products, even when attempting to operate within existing securities law. That posture has begun to soften as the agency signals greater openness to engagement. Ebersole pointed to recent leadership changes at the SEC, including the arrival of Paul Atkins, as contributing to a tone that treats blockchain technology as infrastructure with potential applications for securities markets rather than as an inherent regulatory risk. “Now the SEC is engaging a lot with the industry and saying, ‘Come in and tell us if you are trying to do what we’re trying to do, how would you do it?’” Ebersole said. In that environment, compliant models such as tokenized equities structured through regulated intermediaries and custody arrangements can move from concept to production, even as legal friction persists around cross-border distribution and yield-bearing designs that can still trigger additional securities obligations. Existing securities law continues to govern RWAs, but the move away from an enforcement-only posture does not, in Ebersole’s view, foreclose the possibility of more tailored rules over time if regulators and the market continue working through remaining gaps.

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the industry-owned clearing and settlement market infrastructure, has selected the privacy-focused Canton Network as a tokenization partner, the companies said on Tuesday. The partnership, which will enable a subset of U.S. Treasury securities custodied at DTC to be minted on the Canton Network, follows DTCC’s recent receipt of a No-Action Letter from the SEC to implement and operate a new service to tokenize real-world, DTC-custodied assets. The organizations are working towards an MVP in a controlled production environment during the first half of 2026, with plans to expand the project's size and scope in the months that follow, based on client interest, according to the press release. “DTCC’s partnership with Digital Asset and the Canton Network is a strategic step forward as we collaborate across the industry to build a digital infrastructure that seamlessly bridges the traditional and digital financial ecosystems and provides unmatched scalability and safety,” said Frank LaSalla, CEO of DTCC. The Canton Network was designed to enable institutions to issue and trade tokenized real-world assets, such as bonds, loans, and funds, on a shared ledger while maintaining privacy and compliance with legal requirements. Digital Asset, the firm behind Canton, is backed by powerful Wall Street firms including BlackRock, Blackstone, Nasdaq, S&P Global, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel Securities. In addition to the tokenization initiative, DTCC will assume a leadership position within the Canton Network’s decentralized governance structure, joining the Canton Foundation as co-chair alongside Euroclear. This new role will enable DTCC to actively participate in setting industry-wide standards for decentralized financial infrastructure, the companies said. “DTCC’s leadership in this space not only accelerates industry adoption but establishes a foundation for meaningful innovation, unlocking new liquidity opportunities, products, and operational improvements,” said Yuval Rooz, Co-Founder and CEO of Digital Asset.

He noted that India’s middle class is largely confined to bank savings, mutual funds, and fixed deposits, and that tokenization could open high-return assets to them while providing instant, broker-free liquidity. Chadha said the nation now needs its own “bespoke legislation for asset tokenization” along with a dedicated regulatory sandbox to safely test new models. Such a framework, he argued, would make investment and ownership “truly inclusive for the common man,” while giving India the clarity required to attract global capital flows from hubs like Singapore, the UAE, and Hong Kong. Raj Kapoor, founder and CEO of the India Blockchain Alliance, told Decrypt that India stands at a “decisive inflection point in the evolution of global finance,” calling a dedicated tokenization bill “no longer optional… a strategic necessity to anchor India in the next financial architecture.” Such a law could unlock India-native tokenization of “infrastructure, MSMEs, real estate, carbon credits, gold, and receivables,” he noted, aligning tokenized instruments with existing securities and contract law. "Jurisdictions that provide legal clarity are rapidly becoming magnets for global capital," Kapoor said, noting that India remains, "constrained by regulatory ambiguity around tokenized assets" despite its leadership in the field of digital public infrastructure. “India needs a tokenization bill to retain economic sovereignty, ensuring Indian assets, capital formation, and innovation are tokenized onshore under Indian law, not exported to foreign jurisdictions,” he said. Without a clear statutory framework, Kapoor warned, India risks its assets, startups, and capital formation migrating offshore into friendlier jurisdictions, "often through complex SPVs that strip domestic value creation." His caution comes as global financial heavyweights are already signalling where the world is headed, with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein recently writing in The Economist that finance is "entering the next major evolution in market infrastructure" driven by blockchain-based tokenization, comparing today's stage to "the internet in 1996." Musheer Ahmed, Founder and MD of Finstep Asia, told Decrypt that while there is skepticism around crypto assets in India, "one needs to distinguish between the asset here being a crypto asset or digital asset, which may have a variety of use cases and concerns around cross-border or money laundering." A tokenization bill would establish clear rules for financial institutions, open high-value asset participation to the middle class, and place India alongside global leaders in next-generation financial innovation, Ahmed added.

The San Francisco-based data and AI company surpassed a $4.8bn revenue run-rate during its third quarter, with year-on-year growth of more than 55%. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more The run-rate figure includes more than $1bn from its data warehousing business and more than $1bn from its AI products. The company has delivered positive free cash flow over the 12 months since December 2024. Insight Partners, Fidelity Management & Research Company, and JP Morgan Asset Management are leading the Series L investment. Additional investors in the round include Andreessen Horowitz, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, funds managed by Blackstone, Robinhood Ventures and Thrive Capital. The funding will support product development in three strategic areas: Lakebase, Databricks Apps and Agent Bricks. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The funding will be used to help customers develop AI applications and agent-based tools using their own proprietary data. The approach will position Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user-facing experience layer and Agent Bricks as the engine for multi-agent workflows. It linked this focus to what it called the parallel rise of “vibe coding” and generative AI (gen AI), which is accelerating the development of data data-intelligent applications in enterprises. Databricks Apps enables organisations to build and deploy data and AI applications quickly and securely. Agent Bricks is designed to simplify the creation and scaling of high-quality agents using an organisation’s own data. According to Databricks, Lakebase is a serverless PostgreSQL database designed specifically to support AI-era workloads. Databricks co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi stated: “Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads. “With this investment, we’re deepening our commitment to help every organisation innovate with AI on their own data.” In its first six months, Lakebase has drawn thousands of customers and is generating revenue growth at twice the pace of its data warehousing product. The Data Warehousing product reached a revenue run-rate of more than $1bn in less than four years from general availability. Databricks’ AI products have achieved a revenue run-rate of more than $1bn. Its net retention rate remains above 140% and more than 700 customers are consuming at an annual revenue run-rate of more than $1m. Databricks expects the new capital to support its growth and to be used to provide liquidity for employees. The company also said the investment is expected to support future AI acquisitions and deepen its AI research.

Title: BlackRock moves 47K Ethereum in a day: But the real story isn’t a sell-off

What are institutions seeing that retail traders are missing? Even as Ethereum’s price hesitates around the $3,000 price level, the institutional engine behind the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) is running at full speed. On the 16th of December, on-chain data flagged a massive $140 million transfer as BlackRock deposited 47,463 ETH into Coinbase Prime. Far from a simple “sell-off” signal, this move reflects the complex rebalancing needed to manage the leading spot Ethereum [ETH] ETF during heavy market liquidations. While retail traders hesitate, BlackRock’s major rebalancing shows strong institutional confidence, as ETF issuers must keep adjusting ETH holdings to match inflows. This strategy helps stabilize the fund during volatility and reinforces Ethereum’s growing acceptance in traditional finance. Though BlackRock remains the institutional “gold standard,” it is no longer the undisputed heavyweight in the Ethereum treasury race. As of mid-December, BlackRock’s ETHA fund holds approximately 3.7 million ETH (approx. $11 billion). However, this massive stash has officially been eclipsed by BitMine Immersion (BMNR). Under the leadership of Tom Lee, BitMine has aggressively expanded its treasury to nearly 4 million ETH, signaling a “MicroStrategy-style” accumulation play that prioritizes protocol-level dominance over simple ETF fee collection. The timing of BlackRock’s 47,463 ETH deposit follows a turbulent period for US-based Ethereum ETFs. On the 16th of December, Farside Investors’ data revealed a staggering net outflow of $221.3 million from BlackRock’s ETHA. This single-day redemption accounted for nearly 99% of the total $224.2 million pulled from all US Ethereum ETFs combined. All in all, this suggests that while the “institutional machinery” is moving funds on-chain, it is largely to facilitate heavy redemptions from investors who are rotating capital or de-risking amidst a lackluster Q4 performance for the asset. That being said, this institutional reshuffling occurred against a backdrop of technical fragility. At the time of reporting, Ethereum was trading at $2,935.44. Despite a microscopic 0.77% gain in a 24-hour window, the broader trend remains bearish with ETH plummeting by 11.58% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap Hence, for BlackRock, the challenge is now two-fold: managing the logistics of massive ETF outflows while simultaneously defending a price floor that retail traders seem increasingly unwilling to support. This coincided with BlackRock’s recent $28.78 million acquisition of Ethereum, which the broader market has largely misread as mere price speculation. In reality, this move signalled BlackRock’s formal validation of Ethereum not as a “digital gold” alternative to Bitcoin, but as the essential financial infrastructure of the future. By securing this bundle of ETH, the world’s largest asset manager is effectively stockpiling the “fuel” necessary to run its BUIDL fund, which operates exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain. Ultimately, this acquisition shows BlackRock is no longer just participating in crypto, but actively building on Ethereum as mission-critical infrastructure for future global finance.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. For 15 years, BlackRock's Kirsty Craig has operated as a kind of "translator" inside the world's largest asset manager, sitting between portfolio managers making big bets and engineers building the systems that help inform those decisions to get both sides aligned on driving returns. This skill set is part of what earned Craig, head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech, the title of Tech Fellow, one of the firm's high technological distinctions, held by only two dozen of its thousands of engineers. Craig is one of five new fellows that the firm announced on December 16, recognized for supercharging the asset manager's investment team. This year, she is the only woman and the only fellow who works outside of Aladdin, the lucrative spine of BlackRock's investment technology. When it comes to her impact on how $13.5 trillion money manager BlackRock uses AI, Craig said she's especially proud of her role in Asimov, the agentic AI platform for the firm's fundamental equity business. The "virtual investment analyst" was unveiled by Chief Operating Officer Rob Goldstein at the firm's investor day in June. It leverages AI to automate workflows and research, as many firms race to adopt the technology to speed up what were once monthslong investment processes. Now, as a fellow, Craig is even more embedded in BlackRock's efforts to stay ahead, as the firm continues to center on technological prowess. At first, Craig wasn't sure she'd become a tech fellow, largely because her work is different than most of the other fellows who work squarely within BlackRock's data analytics and risk platform, Aladdin. Her team of around 60 software engineers, data engineers, and data scientists "sits at the horizontal" across various investment capabilities to help drive investment research. She found out about the honor at the beginning of the month when a meeting was added to her calendar. When she heard the news, Craig started by telling the manager who had nominated her, her sponsor during the application process, her team, and her family, "but they've got no idea what it means," she told Business Insider. Nish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and the co-executive sponsor of the fellows program, said that existing tech fellows knew Craig not only for her innovation with AI in investing, but for her collaborative efforts. He described Craig as an "AI native," and added that her team is at the "tip of the spear" when it comes to applying AI to investment. Craig's time at different offices — Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia — has, she thinks, given her a strong foundation of horizontal leadership across teams. "I am responsible for really trying to find the dial movers across data, AI, and technology that really help our investment pillars drive investment research," she said of her work. Craig has learned how to communicate with both investors and Aladdin technologists, and said that building deep trust with both groups has been key to her success. "If you put both of those different personalities or personas together, quite often they're talking above or below each other. They struggle to connect. So for me, it's really been being able to translate both and then come up with a strategy in the middle," she said. For Craig, being a woman in a position of visible leadership is "a huge honor." Of the 24 tech fellows, five are women, including Craig. Women make up 43.8% of BlackRock's global workforce and 33.1% of senior leadership, according to data from January 1, 2025, posted on the firm's site. Craig said being involved in BlackRock's women and LGBTQ+ resource groups has informed her other work at the firm, especially in how they've taught her how to collaborate with people from across divisions and explain complicated topics. "If anything has probably helped me with, one, building my network; two, softer presentation skills; and then three, around how to communicate with impact," Craig said. With the title, she hopes to help more junior female technologists "lean in." For Ajitsaria, it's also important to have a diversity of expertise in the program and ensure that fellows represent all arms of BlackRock. When it comes to driving technology strategy itself, Craig said she's excited to keep figuring out how to leverage AI in active investing. Right now, her team is thinking about how to expand the scope of agentic research, potentially to areas like fixed income and macro investing. As she continues to soak up the news, Craig is also preparing for a very different big life change. Her partner is scheduled to give birth in early January, so, with the due date mere weeks away, Craig said they've kept all celebrating fairly tame so far. "We did go out for a meal. Nothing has been purchased, apart from cribs and bottles," she said. "Definitely some more celebrating will be done post January 6." Jump to

As concerns about the potential risks posed by quantum computing to the cryptocurrency landscape grow, the Solana Foundation has taken new measures by announcing a collaboration with Project Eleven, which specializes in post-quantum security. In a Tuesday press release, the Solana Foundation outlined its commitment to fortifying the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem against the implications of quantum computing. Through this initiative, Project Eleven has conducted a comprehensive threat assessment and successfully prototyped a functioning testnet utilizing post-quantum digital signatures. Under their engagement, Project Eleven undertook a risk analysis to evaluate how forthcoming breakthroughs in quantum computing could impact various facets of Solana’s infrastructure. Areas scrutinized included user wallets, validator security, and the foundational cryptographic assumptions that underpin the network. Moreover, Project Eleven has implemented a working post-quantum signature system on a Solana testnet, demonstrating that quantum-resistant transactions can be both practical and scalable. Matt Sorg, VP of Technology at the Solana Foundation, emphasized the organization’s approach: “Our responsibility is to ensure Solana remains secure not just today, but decades into the future.” He noted that the culture of innovation within the Solana ecosystem would continue to thrive with the upcoming release of a second client and an advanced consensus mechanism this year. Alex Pruden, CEO of Project Eleven, echoed this sentiment, stating, “Solana didn’t wait for quantum computers to become a headline problem. They invested early, asked the hard questions, and took actionable steps today.” Solana’s stance comes amid alarming reports indicating that quantum computers could potentially undermine blockchain security by developing algorithms capable of deciphering private keys. This scenario raises significant concerns for any digital assets operating on blockchain technology that rely on digital signatures, making them vulnerable to quantum hacking. As such, industry experts are actively exploring various measures to bolster cryptocurrency networks against these threats. Doug Finke, Chief Content Officer at Global Quantum Intelligence, pointed out that several groups are integrating the three post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms established by NIST into their platforms. He emphasized the uncertainty surrounding when a sufficiently powerful quantum computer might be developed, raising the stakes even further. Finke stated, “What’s worse, if an unfriendly party does develop such a computer, they may not let anyone know about it.” Currently, several cryptocurrencies have already begun incorporating quantum-safe cryptography into their architecture, including Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL), Cellframe, and Bitcoin Quantum from BTQ. Among those issuing warnings about the looming threats from quantum computing are notable figures such as Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, Capriole Investment founder Charles Edwards, and representatives from major firms like BlackRock and Google. Yakovenko has urged the Bitcoin community to accelerate efforts to implement quantum-resistant upgrades. He believes there is a 50% chance of a significant quantum breakthrough occurring within the next five years, further emphasizing the need for vigilance. At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $127, which is a 6.7% decrease in price over the past seven days. Compared to the all-time high of $293 reached earlier this year, SOL is trading at almost 56% below this threshold.

Title: SPYM’s $100B Milestone Might Be the Last of Its Kind

The fund is State Street’s way of tapping the retail market, but it might be the last new dominant S&P 500 entrant. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com A hundred billion is the new hundred million. State Street’s SPYM fund surpassed $100 billion in assets last week, making it the fastest to grow from $50 billion to $100 billion, taking just 283 trading days, according to State Street. The ETF is the latest entrant to the core S&P 500 cast and represents the firm’s efforts to access growing retail markets via low fees; SPYM’s is just two basis points. But it may be the last core S&P 500 product breakthrough for a while because of all the funds already tracking the index — and their sheer size. This means advisors shouldn’t expect any new core S&P 500 funds anytime soon, experts said. “It’s more likely that other kinds of broad equity ETFs will be launched in the future as opposed to [trying to] do battle with $100 billion ETFs that are out there,” said Loren Fox, director of research at Fuse Research Network. “At this point, it’s hard to see a lot of space in the market for another S&P 500 ETF that is just tracking the straight beta.” SPYM, which formerly operated under the ticker SPLG, is one of the four primary S&P 500 ETF offerings, said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF Research & Analytics at CFRA Research. The others include the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). But they cater to different segments of the market: While SPY has traditionally been a fund for institutions, such as asset managers and hedge funds, IVV has honed in on advised retail and VOO on self-directed retail investors. Because of State Street’s institutional focus, added Ullal, the company didn’t really have a product that prioritized the retail segment. “SPYM basically is their way of accessing retail money, by going with a lower-cost product and competing more directly with VOO and IVV,” he said. Inflows and outflows among the rest of the four were varied. In Q3 2025: S Tier. The ETF industry as a whole, Ullal said, can also be broken down into three main price segments: the passively managed, low-cost beta tier; the mid-priced segment, which has more active management; and high-priced funds of roughly 75 basis points and above, including things like derivatives and buffer products. “The newer entrants, like Capital Group, JPMorgan [and] Goldman Sachs, they’re focused more on active management, derivatives and those kinds of products,” Ullal said. But the low-cost segment, he added, is dominated by the likes of Vanguard, State Street and BlackRock — something he doesn’t see changing: “It’s hard to see anybody coming and disrupting these three big players.” With the average cost of health care regularly outpacing inflation, Americans are struggling to afford it. A new legal standing for marijuana could help change how ETFs track and invest in the cannabis industry. The company is planning to add 10 target-maturity ETFs. Vanguard and State Street have also moved to fill out their bond-ladder lines. With more than $1.4 trillion in flows and more than 1,000 product launches, it’s safe to say the industry is booming. A new proposed ETF would hold bitcoin only after markets close. Wanna bet? ETFs aren’t for gambling, but a rise in risk-on products could prove irresistible to a population obsessed with sports betting. After a dive, the company’s stock is still up 8% in 2025, while both long and short leveraged ETFs are down. The world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the biggest crypto ETF is expanding into staked Ethereum. Is there room for anyone else? Active fixed-income strategies accounted for nearly half of ETF inflows so far this year. Niche strategies, like buffer ETFs, could play a larger role in deal activity. Its price is up 100%, significantly ahead of gold’s surge, and the (very) few silver ETFs on the US market have benefited. The company’s flagship ETF, QQQ, is just shy of enough votes to approve its reclassification as an open-end fund. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Court to reconsider inquest into death of infant born at Bessborough mother and baby home

Cork South Coroner’s Court will reconsider holding an inquest into the death of a baby boy shortly after his birth at Bessborough mother and baby home, after the court’s chief coroner conceded a High Court challenge brought by the infant’s mother. Madeleine Bridget Marvier was 17-years-old when she was admitted to the home in Blackrock, Cork city, in August 1960. About two months later, she gave birth to her son, William Gerard Walsh. In December 1960, at 37 days old, William died at St Finbarr’s Hospital, Cork. In October 2023, Ms Marvier wrote to the Cork South Coroner asking that an inquest be held into the death of her son, on the grounds that his death was violent or unnatural, or was unexpected and from unknown causes, or was in suspicious circumstances. This request was refused. Ms Marvier brought judicial review proceedings against the Cork South Coroner in July challenging the refusal, claiming that a conclusion that the infant’s death is beyond doubt “cannot reasonably be drawn or inferred” and is “without basis” in the evidence she had put before the coroner. Ms Marvier brought the case alongside her daughter, Carmel Cantwell. On Tuesday, barrister Cillian Bracken, appearing for Ms Marvier, told Mr Justice Micheál O’Higgins that an order could be made on consent quashing the coroner’s decision to refuse to hold an inquest into the infant’s death. Mr Bracken said an order could also be made remitting the case to the deputy coroner for Cork South for reconsideration. An order against the coroner for his clients’ legal costs could also be made, counsel said. Barrister Eoin Sreenan, appearing for the coroner, said his client was consenting to the reliefs. Mr Justice O’Higgins granted the orders. Bessborough mother and baby home was operated by the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, an order of nuns, between 1922 and 1998. In 2021, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes concluded that 923 babies associated with Bessborough died during that time, but burial records for only 64 of them could be found. According to Ms Marvier’s court documents, her son’s death certificate – which she obtained in 1999 – attributed his death to renal abscess septicaemia, sepsis caused by an abscess in the kidney. Ms Marvier said she was previously unaware of the cause attributed to her son’s death. In 2019, after obtaining documents from Tusla, Ms Marvier learned for the first time that William had been buried at Carr’s Hill Cemetery in Cork, within the jurisdiction of the Cork South Coroner. In October 2023, Ms Marvier wrote to the Cork South Coroner asking that an inquest be held into the death of her son, on the grounds that his death was violent or unnatural, or was unexpected and from unknown causes, or was in suspicious circumstances. Included in her request was a report compiled by Dr Michael Munro, a consultant neonatologist, who opined that the death certificate’s stated cause of death was speculative and conjectural. In January this year, the coroner wrote to Ms Marvier refusing the request to hold an inquest. The coroner stated William did not die in a violent or unnatural manner, and on the balance of probabilities, did not die unexpectedly or from unknown causes, Ms Marvier’s court papers stated. Ms Marvier’s case noted the coroner’s purported assumption that in the absence of any record of a postmortem examination of the infant, there was no doubt around the cause of death of the infant, and therefore, there was no sufficient evidence available now to cast doubt on the death certificate’s cause of death. Ms Marvier claimed that the coroner made this assumption while at the same time acknowledging that medical records pertaining to the infant’s care at St Finbarr’s are now unavailable, and that it was not known what medical skills were employed in establishing William’s cause of death.

Title: JP Morgan’s move to Ethereum proves Wall Street is quietly hijacking the digital dollar from crypto natives

JP Morgan’s move into tokenized funds poses new challenges to traditional stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. JP Morgan Chase & Co. has formally entered the contest for on-chain cash, and the prize is not just a new product line. It is the billions of dollars in institutional capital that now sit in zero-yield stablecoins and early tokenized funds. On Dec. 15, the $4 trillion banking giant launched the My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY) on the Ethereum blockchain, in its attempt to pull back liquidity into a structure it controls and regulators recognize. MONY wraps a traditional money-market fund in a token that can live on public rails, pairing the speed of crypto with the one feature payment stablecoins such as Tether and Circle cannot legally offer under new US rules: yield. That makes MONY less a DeFi experiment than JP Morgan’s attempt to redefine what “cash on-chain” means for large, KYC’d pools of capital. It also puts the bank in more direct competition with BlackRock’s BUIDL and the broader tokenized Treasuries sector, which has grown into a mid–tens of billions market as institutions look for yield-bearing, blockchain-native cash equivalents. To understand the timing, one has to start with the GENIUS Act, the US stablecoin law passed earlier this year. The statute created a full licensing regime for payment stablecoins and, crucially, banned issuers from paying interest to token holders simply for holding the token. As a result, the core business model for regulated dollar stablecoins is now codified: issuers hold reserves in safe assets, collect the yield, and pass none of it through directly. For corporate treasurers and crypto funds that hold large stablecoin balances for weeks or months, that embeds a structural opportunity cost. In a world where front-end rates hover in the mid-single digits, that “stablecoin tax” can run at roughly 4–5% per year on idle balances. MONY is designed to sit outside that perimeter. It is structured as a Rule 506(c) private placement money-market fund, not a payment stablecoin. That means it is treated as a security, sold only to accredited investors, and invested in US Treasuries and fully collateralized Treasury repos. As a money fund, it is structured to pass most of the underlying income back to shareholders after fees, not to trap the entire yield at the issuer level. Crypto research firm Asva Capital noted: “Tokenized money-market funds solve a key problem: idle stablecoins earning zero yield.” By letting qualified investors subscribe and redeem in either cash or USDC via JP Morgan’s Morgan Money platform, MONY effectively creates a two-step workflow. This allows the investors to use USDC or other payment tokens for transactions, then rotate into MONY when the priority shifts to holding and earning. For JP Morgan, this is not a side bet. The bank seeded MONY with around $100 million of its own capital and is marketing it directly into its global liquidity client base. As John Donohue, head of Global Liquidity at JP Morgan Asset Management, put it, the firm expects other global systemically important banks to follow. So, the message is that tokenization has progressed past pilots; it is now a delivery mechanism for core cash products. The economic logic becomes clearer when you look at collateral, not wallets. Crypto derivatives markets, prime brokerage platforms and OTC desks require margin and collateral around the clock. Historically, stablecoins like USDT and USDC have been the default because they are fast and broadly accepted. They are not, however, capital efficient in a high-rate regime. Tokenized money funds are built to fill that gap. Instead of parking $100 million in stablecoins that earn nothing, a fund or trading desk can hold $100 million of MMF tokens that track a conservative portfolio of short-term government assets and still move at blockchain speed between vetted venues. BlackRock’s BUIDL product has already shown how that can evolve. Once it gained acceptance as collateral on large exchanges’ institutional rails, it stopped being “tokenization as demo” and became part of the funding stack. MONY is aimed at the same corridor, but with a different perimeter. While BUIDL has pushed aggressively into crypto-native platforms through partnerships with tokenization specialists, JP Morgan is tying MONY tightly to its own Kinexys Digital Assets stack and the existing Morgan Money distribution network. So, the pitch for MONY is not to the offshore, high-frequency trading crowd. It is to pensions, insurers, asset managers and corporates that already use money-market funds and JP Morgan’s liquidity platforms today. Donohue has argued that tokenization can “fundamentally change the speed and efficiency of transactions.” In practical terms, that means shrinking settlement windows for collateral moves from T+1 into intraday, and doing it without moving out of the banking and fund-regulation perimeter. Moreover, the risk for stablecoins is not that they disappear. It is that a meaningful slice of the large, institutional balances that currently sit in USDC or USDT for collateral and treasury purposes migrate into tokenized MMFs instead, leaving stablecoins more concentrated in payments and open DeFi. Perhaps the clearest signal in MONY’s design is the choice of Ethereum as its base chain. JP Morgan has run private ledgers and permissioned networks for years; putting a flagship cash product on a public blockchain is an acknowledgment that liquidity, tooling and counterparties have converged there. Thomas Lee of BitMine views the move as a watershed moment, stating simply that “Ethereum is the future of finance.” This is a claim now supported by the fact that the world’s largest bank is deploying its flagship tokenized cash product on the network. However, the “public” blockchain launch here comes with an asterisk. MONY is still a 506(c) security. This means that its tokens can only sit in allowlisted, KYC’d wallets, and transfers are controlled to comply with securities law and the fund’s own restrictions. That effectively splits on-chain dollar instruments into two overlapping layers. On the permissionless layer, retail users, high-frequency traders and DeFi protocols will continue to rely on Tether, USDC and similar tokens. Their value proposition is censorship resistance, universal composability and ubiquity across protocols and chains. On the permissioned layer, MONY and peer funds like BUIDL and Goldman’s and BNY Mellon’s tokenized MMFs offer regulated, yield-bearing cash equivalents to institutions that care more about audit trails, governance and counterparty risk than about permissionless composability. Their liquidity is thinner but more curated; their use cases are narrower but higher-value per dollar. Considering this, JP Morgan is betting that the next meaningful wave of on-chain volume will come from that second group: treasurers who want Ethereum’s speed and integration without taking on the regulatory ambiguity that still surrounds a large part of DeFi. Ultimately, MONY looks less like a revolution against the existing system and more like a defensive pivot inside it. For a decade, fintech and crypto firms chipped away at banks’ payment, FX and custody businesses. Stablecoins then went after the most fundamental layer: deposits and cash management, offering a digital bearer-like alternative that could sit outside bank balance sheets entirely. By launching a tokenized money-market fund on public rails, JP Morgan is trying to pull some of that migration back inside its own perimeter, even if it means cannibalizing parts of its traditional deposit base. George Gatch, CEO of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, has emphasized “active management and innovation” as the core of the offering, implicitly contrasting it with the passive float-skimming model of stablecoin issuers. Meanwhile, bank is not alone. BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon have already moved into tokenized MMFs and tokenized cash-equivalent products. So, JP Morgan’s entry shifts that trend from early experimentation to open competition among incumbents over who will own institutional “digital dollars” on public chains. If that competition succeeds, the effect will not be the end of stablecoins or the triumph of DeFi. Instead, it would be a quiet re-bundling as the settlement rails will be public, and the instruments running on them will look a lot like traditional money-market funds. However, the institutions earning a spread on the world’s cash will, once again, be the same Wall Street names that dominated the pre-tokenization era. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

This year's members underwent a rigorous application process — from being nominated to completing written evaluations and interviews — before being voted into the program by current fellows, Nish Ajitsaria, BlackRock's co-head of Aladdin product engineering and executive sponsor of AI, and the co-executive sponsor of the program, said. "We think about the combination of technical expertise, domain expertise, commercial mindset, but really lifting the platform, the culture, the experience across the firm," said Ajitsaria, who has been involved with Tech Fellows since it launched in 2020. Many of this year's fellows are credited with mentoring other technologists, according to an internal announcement shared with Business Insider. Technologists are gaining more and more influence on Wall Street as firms race to adopt AI. BlackRock has long positioned itself as equal parts financial technology company and asset manager. Aladdin — the firm's sprawling risk and portfolio management platform — underpins its client relationships, and tech-related revenue is among its fastest-growing businesses. BlackRock's technology services and subscription revenue jumped 28% year-on-year over the last quarter, fueled by Aladdin and the integration of newly acquired Preqin's private-markets data business, the firm reported in its latest earnings. Four of this year's fellows work in Aladdin, though Ajitsaria said that the group has always represented a wide swath of the firm's businesses. "We are also really deliberate about leveraging and applying our tech fellows to the firm's most critical technology initiatives," Ajitsaria said. As of 2023, one in every third BlackRock employee was a software engineer or technologist, according to a document about the firm. Fellows meet internally at least once a month and are expected to foster the firm's engineering culture both internally and externally — they might, for example, contribute to BlackRock's engineering blog or attend conferences, Ajitsaria said. BlackRock has set high targets for the year 2030, when it aims to reach $35 billion in annual revenue and fundraising $400 billion in private markets. As Ajitsaria said, "the 2030 vision of BlackRock is very much underpinned by technology." These five new fellows have just become a more integral part of that vision. As the head of Aladdin Studio Engineering for Aladdin Data, David Woodhead has spearheaded the effort to "open Aladdin," giving stakeholders access to the platform's data and analytics models, among other tools. He's recognized for "championing modern data platforms, cloud-native technologies, and open-source adoption," according to the internal announcement. Woodhead has helped craft the very architecture of Aladdin. Beyond his role at Aladdin Studio, Woodhead also oversees services that give Aladdin and its clients reference, market, and other third-party data. He joined BlackRock in 2006 and is based in Virginia, serving as a managing director. Kirsty Craig has been at BlackRock for 15 years and now serves as the head of research, data, and AI strategy for portfolio management tech. She's shaped how the firm uses AI and data science in investment research. While Craig is this year's only fellow who doesn't work within the Aladdin program, she has forged collaboration between the investment and technology teams. Craig has worked in offices in Edinburgh, San Francisco, and now Philadelphia, and is currently a managing director. New York-based director Infant Vasanth is known for his work pushing BlackRock's internal research and automation platform forward. He joined the firm in 2011 and is now a senior director of engineering, running the team behind an analytics and automation platform. Vasanth, an advocate for open-source, often speaks at tech conferences and is the brain behind multiple patent filings. He also leads a team focused on Aladdin Studio's AI abilities. "Drawing on deep expertise in neural networks and pattern-recognition algorithms, he applies research rigor to building enterprise-scale AI systems," the announcement said. Michael Duncan, a director and engineering lead on Aladdin's Trading Engineering team, is the architect behind a collection of tools dubbed BlackRock's Xceler Ecosystem, which is now integral across Aladdin and has helped raise engineering standards. His team is in charge of "delivering multi-asset trading solutions and technology across global markets," and Duncan has improved its abilities. Beyond that, Duncan is the global engineering lead for part of Aladdin and leads a client support and performance engineering program. Duncan joined BlackRock in 2020 and is based in Chicago. New York-based Charlie Johnston joined BlackRock as a summer intern in 2013 and has worked his way up to being a director. A software engineer, he has improved the quality of the asset management giant's code and development processes. "Charlie's technical contributions and collaborative approach have strengthened the engineering community across Aladdin," the internal announcement reads. Jump to

December 16, 2025 11:27 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Carbon-Smart Investment Portfolio Global Market Report 2025" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The carbon-smart investment portfolio market is witnessing significant expansion, projected to rise from $28.18 billion in 2024 to $33.35 billion by 2025, with a robust CAGR of 18.4%. This growth is propelled by heightened focus on climate-related financial risks, the surge in green bond issuance, and the enhanced performance of renewable energy assets. Contributing factors include the expanding use of climate stress testing and the increasing availability of carbon-offset projects. Looking ahead, the market is set to escalate to $64.67 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 18%. Driving this momentum are factors such as the escalating demand for sustainable investments, rising awareness of climate change repercussions, government incentives favoring low-carbon projects, and a growing interest in net-zero aligned portfolios. Increased transparency in carbon reporting and the integration of blockchain technology are significant trends alongside advancements in carbon accounting, offset verification, and climate risk models. The surge in green building certifications is a pivotal growth driver for carbon-smart investment portfolios. As governments, businesses, and occupiers aim for energy-efficient and sustainable construction, the role of such portfolios becomes increasingly crucial. They provide capital for projects meeting sustainability standards, incentivize energy-efficient practices, and support certified green developments. Notably, in July 2024, the U.S. Green Building Council reported over 46,000 residential projects certified under the LEED rating system, exemplifying this upward trajectory. Key market players are developing innovative strategies to enhance carbon sequestration and biodiversity, attracting environmentally conscious investors. For instance, the Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec partnered with Clean Energy Finance Corporation to launch Meldora, a $165 million sustainable agriculture platform promoting climate-smart farming and renewable energy, resulting in high-quality Australian carbon credits. Similarly, in April 2025, Meta Platforms Inc. collaborated with EFM Investments & Advisory LLC to foster climate-smart forestry in Washington State. The alliance aims to generate 676,000 forest carbon credits by 2035, transitioning 68,000 acres to management practices that enhance carbon storage and biodiversity, aligning with Meta's goal to attain net-zero emissions by 2030. Prominent players shaping the carbon-smart investment landscape include Allianz Global Investors GmbH, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., Legal & General Investment Management Ltd., UBS Asset Management AG, and Fidelity Investments, among others. The carbon-smart investment portfolio market analysis indicates that Europe was the largest region in 2024, with Asia-Pacific anticipated to witness the fastest growth rate.

Title: Altcoins update: XRP ETFs hit $1B in inflows; whales offload Ethereum
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/altcoins-update-xrp-etfs-hit-1b-in-inflows-whales-offload-ethereum/
Time Published: 2025-12-16T15:48:14Z
Full Content:
Cryptocurrencies extended their weakness on Tuesday, with Bitcoin sliding toward $85K. The value of all digital assets has declined by 3% over the past day to $2.96 trillion. Sentiments are deteriorating daily due to thin liquidity, as even fundamentally healthy projects are failing to sustain prolonged upsides. Amidst the gloomy outlook, investors are becoming more defensive, with institutional players reducing exposure as they rotate to narratives dominating the current landscape. This divergence is visible in leading altcoins, XRP and Ethereum, in this case. Let us explore further. Ripple’s token is recording a rare enterprise win amid broad market declines. According to SoSoValue data, XRP-linked exchange-traded funds have hot $1 billion in cumulative inflows. That marks a crucial milestone for a product that launched on November 13. Notably, XRP ETFs have recorded consistent daily inflows since their debut. The substantial inflows, within a short timeframe, indicate that expert investors are narrowing their focus and not exiting crypto altogether. XRP’s compliant ETF structure makes it appealing for institutions seeking cryptocurrency exposure without handling operational risks or custody. Most importantly, the inflows suggest a long-term positioning strategy, rather than chasing near-term price fluctuations. XRP’s institutional attractiveness lies in its improved regulatory clarity and clear use cases. Narratives matter the most during bearish sessions. Indeed, traditional investors will justify a payment-focused blockchain ecosystem faster than highly speculative or experimental narratives. Moreover, ETFs are crucial for enterprises looking to manage risk as they offer transparency, compliance, and liquidity. These features are valuable during unstable markets and have helped XRP-related products absorb pressure as rivals endure outflows. Meanwhile, XRP is trading at $1.92 after losing 7% the previous week. While the XRP community cheered staggering inflows, Ethereum is encountering immense selling pressure as large-scale holders reduce their exposure. According to Lookonchain, BlackRock has deposited 47,463 ETH, valued at approximately $140 million, to Coinbase Prime. Markets have interpreted the transaction as a preparation to sell. At the same time, the Konstantin Lomashuk-linked wallet sold 14,585 tokens, worth roughly $42.71 million, today, when ETH changed hands at $2,928. Also, Lookonchain revealed two whales that dumped Ethereum worth around $40.82 million, 14,000 tokens early today. The magnitude and timing of these transfers have intensified bearish sentiments around the largest altcoin. These transactions coincide with an already fragile market, amplifying downward momentum for ETH prices. Ethereum is trading at $2,928 after losing 3% and 6% the past day and week.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The IPO window may have cracked open, but it seems some former startups have no intention of going public. Makes sense, in a way: IPOs were traditionally a way to raise money, and if you can manage to raise ungodly amounts without having to put your company through public scrutiny, why do it? Databricks is proving that point: The data intelligence company has just raised more than $4 billion in a Series L funding round at a $134 billion valuation — up 34% from the $100 billion valuation that it achieved just three months ago. This is Databricks’ third major venture fundraise in less than a year, and it comes as the company focuses on building products that address the needs of the AI revolution: a database for AI agents, an AI agent platform, and apps that let companies build and deploy data and AI applications. The company is investing heavily in its database for AI agents, known as Lakebase, which is based on the open source database Postgres (enabled by the $1 billion acquisition of a startup called Neon), and is aimed at corporate developers’ vibe-coding projects. Meanwhile, its AI agent platform, Agent Bricks, is aimed at helping businesses build and deploy AI agents that can tap into their data. The company has also struck hefty deals worth hundreds of millions with AI labs Anthropic and OpenAI to offer their models within its enterprise products. Series L rounds aren’t really common, but the fact that Databricks has managed to raise venture funding at ever-increasing valuations (it was valued at $60 billion around this time last year) indicates how strongly investors believe in the power of helping companies use data to fuel their AI efforts. Indeed, Databricks on Tuesday said it now generates run-rate revenue of more than $4.8 billion, up 55% from a year earlier, of which more than $1 billion came from its AI products. “The parallel rise of vibe coding and generative AI is accelerating the development of data-intelligent applications in the enterprise. Databricks will use this new capital to help customers build AI apps and agents on their proprietary data, leveraging Lakebase as the system of record, Databricks Apps as the user experience layer, and Agent Bricks to power multi-agent systems,” the company said in a press release. The Wall Street Journal reports that the company will also use the new money to add thousands of new jobs in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, as well as bring on more AI researchers. “Enterprises are rapidly reimagining how they build intelligent applications, and the convergence of generative AI with new coding paradigms is opening the door to entirely new workloads,” Databricks’ co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi said in a statement. The round was led by Insight Partners, Fidelity, and J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Andreessen Horowitz, BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, GIC, MGX, NEA, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Robinhood Ventures, T. Rowe Price Associates, Temasek, Thrive Capital, and Winslow Capital also participated. Topics Editor Ram is a financial and tech reporter and editor.

Title: Visa launches USDC settlement for US banks on Solana blockchain

Visa launched USDC settlement for US financial institutions, starting with Cross River and Lead Bank on Solana, with a wider rollout planned for 2026. Payment processing giant Visa has launched USDC settlement services for some United States-based financial institutions. Visa said Tuesday that its USDC (USDC) settlement service is available for US financial institutions, with Cross River Bank and Lead Bank as the first participants; they have already begun settling with Visa in USDC on the Solana blockchain, and a broader rollout is expected in 2026. The report follows USDC issuer Circle’s launch of the public testnet for its layer-1 blockchain Arc, with over 100 major partners, including Visa, Mastercard, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, in late October. Visa noted that it is a design partner for the network, which “offers the performance and scalability needed to help support Visa’s global commercial activity.” Visa said it plans to use Arc for USDC settlements within its network and operate a network node. The payment giant’s global head of growth products and strategic partnerships, Rubail Birwadker, said “financial institutions are looking for faster, programmable settlement options that integrate seamlessly with their existing treasury operations.” Visa said the US launch is part of a larger effort to modernize its settlement infrastructure. Birwadker’s comments suggest that adopting stablecoins is a way for the company to ensure it remains relevant when stablecoins gain a more substantial foothold. He said, “Visa is expanding stablecoin settlement because [its] banking partners are not only asking about it — they’re preparing to use it.” Visa appears to be taking an active role in helping financial institutions adopt stablecoins for their operations. On Monday, the company launched a global Stablecoins Advisory Practice, a unit tasked explicitly with helping banks, merchants and fintechs design, roll out and manage stablecoin products. Related: YouTube enables PYUSD stablecoin payouts for US creators: Report On Nov. 27, Visa announced it had expanded its use of stablecoins for settlement in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa by partnering with crypto infrastructure company Aquanow. The partnership aims “to settle transactions using approved stablecoins such as USDC, reducing costs, operational friction, and settlement times.” Visa cited strong demand from banks and payment companies as the reason behind the initiative. Still, not all Visa stablecoin products are institution-facing services. On Nov. 12, Visa launched a pilot in the US, allowing US dollar-pegged stablecoin payouts to user wallets to be sent from business accounts funded using fiat currency. Visa said it is in the process of onboarding “select partners,” and broader access to the service will be rolled out in 2026.

Business FILE PHOTO: Databricks logo is seen in this illustration taken December 17, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Dec 16 : Databricks said on Tuesday that it has raised more than $4 billion at a valuation of $134 billion, the latest example of investors betting big on companies benefiting from the broader adoption of artificial intelligence. The Series L funding round for Databricks, which provides a software platform that helps firms manage large amounts of data and build their own AI models, came less than six months after its previous round at a valuation of $100 billion. It has given the San Francisco-based company a war chest to maintain investment momentum against competitors. "It's a race, and everybody's investing," Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi said in an interview.

I think by investing a lot and raising this kind of capital in the past, we've been able to actually accelerate our growth."REVENUE SURGINGDatabricks surpassed a $4.8 billion revenue run rate in the third quarter, up more than 55 per cent from a year earlier.Revenue from its AI products and data warehousing businesses each exceeded a $1 billion run rate, all while delivering positive free cash flow over the last 12 months, it added.The company plans to use the funds for research and development, to expand its go-to-market teams and for talent retention, which includes providing liquidity to employees through secondary share sales.The funding round was led by Insight Partners, Fidelity Management & Research Company and J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

"We don't want to fall behind. I think by investing a lot and raising this kind of capital in the past, we've been able to actually accelerate our growth." REVENUE SURGING Databricks surpassed a $4.8 billion revenue run rate in the third quarter, up more than 55 per cent from a year earlier. Revenue from its AI products and data warehousing businesses each exceeded a $1 billion run rate, all while delivering positive free cash flow over the last 12 months, it added. The company plans to use the funds for research and development, to expand its go-to-market teams and for talent retention, which includes providing liquidity to employees through secondary share sales.

Title: America’s $38 trillion national debt ‘exacerbates generational imbalances’ with Gen Z and Millennials paying the price, warns think tank
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/16/us-national-debt-generationa-imbalances-research-think-tank/
Time Published: 2025-12-16T11:32:02Z
Full Content:
The United States’ current borrowing trajectory will place an “undue burden on future generations,” an economic think tank has warned, with younger generations facing a higher interest rate environment, slower economic growth, and stalling wage increases.The latest research from the American Action Forum chimes with concerns across both the public and private sectors. JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell are among those nervously eyeing the nation’s $38 trillion debt burden. The government has paid $10 billion a week to service the debt for the first few months of the 2026 fiscal year.Economists are concerned that at some point, the growth of the American economy will become so disconnected from the borrowing of its government that bond buyers will demand higher premiums on their loans. The worry is that the central bank will intervene by increasing the money supply—kick-starting an inflationary cycle—but that ultimately the government may have to cut back on spending. Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio has described this scenario as an economic “heart attack,” with government investment squeezed out by the need for the country to maintain its debt obligations. Younger people will face the sharpest end of that outcome, warned Jordan Haring, director of fiscal policy at the American Action Forum. Haring, formerly a senior policy analyst at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), wrote in a note this week: “The United States’ high debt load exacerbates generational imbalances. These imbalances will ultimately burden younger and future generations with higher interest payments, slower economic growth, slower income growth, and a greater burden to bear for future tax or spending changes.” She continued: “Without significant policy changes to reduce debt growth, future generations will inherit a budget where significant resources are locked into servicing past borrowing. “As interest costs rise, the federal government will have less money available for education, infrastructure, or scientific research—areas that directly support long-term prosperity. Future taxpayers will face higher tax burdens or reduced government services simply to cover the costs created by previous budget deficits.” Haring pointed to the discrepancies in budgets between education and health services, for example. Already the gap is large: In 2025, the Department of Education requested $82.4 billion for its budget, while in 2024 Medicaid spending totaled more than $900 billion, per the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission. With an aging population, it is likely that spending on social care will increase over the coming decades. Lower birth rates will mean fewer entrants into the ranks of the economically active to maintain the revenues gathered by the government. While the accuracy of the conservative think tank’s research has been criticized in the past, Haring’s stance has been echoed by the likes of BlackRock’s Larry Fink. Last year, Fink urged corporate leaders and politicians to pursue “an organized, high-level effort” to rethink the retirement system. In a letter to BlackRock investors, Fink wrote: “The federal government has prioritized maintaining entitlement benefits for people my age (I’m 71) even though it might mean that Social Security will struggle to meet its full obligations when younger workers retire.” He added: “It’s no wonder younger generations, millennials and Gen Z, are so economically anxious. They believe my generation—the baby boomers—have focused on their own financial well-being to the detriment of who comes next. And in the case of retirement, they’re right.” With a shift in economic activity from one generation to the next comes new flows of wealth, and this is something governments around the world will be looking to leverage, according to experts. Studies have found that over the next 20 to 30 years as much as $124 trillion will be passed down from older generations to their younger counterparts, though UBS puts the figure of the so-called Great Wealth Transfer at $80 trillion. Baby boomers—people born between 1946 and 1964—are the wealthiest generation in history, and as these individuals begin passing on their assets, sums will go immediately to their Gen X, millennial, and Gen Z successors, and some cash will go to spouses. “The change in wealth comes at a time when many governments around the world have high debt and deficits. It seems unrealistic to suppose that governments will just sit idly by as this wealth moves around. We would expect governments to attempt to mobilize that wealth to help fund their debt, but in doing so that denies private sector investment access to some of those funds.”

Title: November 2025: The new priorities of European tech investing
URL: https://www.electronicpaymentsinternational.com/comment/november-2025-new-priorities-european-tech-investing/
Time Published: 2025-12-16T11:16:36Z

European technology investing can no longer be relegated to the continent’s economic sideline. New movement in the sector and regular activity over the past few years have made it one of the primary infrastructures on which other industries and services are built. Every month, I publish a brief look at how this European tech sector is evolving, not just to summarise, but to better understand what the market is building towards.In this edition, the evidence further shows that tracing capital concentration is shaping Europe’s next phase of tech development. November was a particularly useful snapshot of activity, marking a shift from chasing the “next big theme” to backing essential parts of the sector’s infrastructure and disciplined scaling. Capital flows towards technologies that grow when risk is managed, production is planned, and execution outweighs narrative. One of the core signals of growth in the European tech industry in 2025 has been the rise in strategic investing, spanning defence, dual-use systems, and energy hardware. Capital is flowing towards tech that builds sovereignty as much as long-term resilience – as first signalled in my Summer 2025 analysis. By this fall, a pattern emerged not as a spike, but as a clear sign of market stability. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Find out more What shifted in November was the focus from the tech itself to the capacity to produce it. Investors financed strategic solutions as well as their supply chains, fabrication, and manufacturing. The evidence of this investment shift is unmistakable in examples like Quantum Systems in Germany raising €180M to push dual-use aerial systems at an industrial scale, or Lithuania’s development bank backing MNP Technologijos/Monopulse to expand manufacturing of NATO-grade drone components. Over in Dresden, Ferroelectric Memory Company raised €100M (mixing €77M in private capital with IPCEI/EIC support) to further expand semiconductor fabrication for efficient AI computing, and France added depth with Hummink, bringing the total to €15M in microfabrication processes. Even Holosolis committed to a PV gigafactory at €220M or more. All these signs underscore that sovereignty has shifted from a theme to a production agenda. The space industry is growing faster globally. In Europe, what had looked in September and October like a series of strong individual rounds began to consolidate in November, marking a shift towards an industry with its own financial architecture, supporting repeatable deals. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The first of these signals was the emergence of institutional capital, when the European Investment Bank offered Space TechEU a €500M programme of dedicated funding rather than a one-off initiative. The second was the shift from isolated rounds to production-focused scaling across Europe. For example, Toulouse U-Space raised €24M for an industrial target of one satellite per week. In Germany, Reflex Aerospace closed a €50M Series A (the largest in European New Space) tied to sovereign space-based intelligence needs. Both rounds were based on manufacturing and production, not focused solely on R&D. Then the market matured to the orbital services layer of space. In France, Infinite Orbits secured €40M to scale in-orbit inspection and life-extension services (mixing private capital and EIC funding). That maturity is crucial, as it means financing focuses on infrastructure rather than just project creation. AI is everywhere, especially in 2025, but primarily as software systems with horizontal capabilities in workflows, data tools, and automation. What changed in November was the shift from software-only AI towards embodied systems and robotics. A scalable set of robotics deals across Europe appears less as isolated bets and more as shaping the physical AI stack in early stages. The first layer is the intelligence stack that trains, coordinates, and controls AI robotics. In Zurich, Flexion Robotics raised nearly €50M for a “brain stack” powering humanoid robotics. In London, Neuracore raised €2.5M in pre-seed funding to build a unified robot-centric infrastructure. Another layer came in deployment across industries. This was evident in Switzerland’s Gravis Robotics, which raised €19.9M to bring construction robots into operation through its “Excavator-as-a-Service” model. The Netherlands saw Saia Agrobotics raise €10M to steadily scale robotic greenhouse automation over clear productivity metrics. Taken together, these deals signal that robotics are getting out of the lab and into revenue-generating settings. Dexterity in robotics came next, as Zurich-based mimic raised €13.8M in Seed to focus on manipulation for complex physical tasks, and Forgis raised €3.8M pre-seed to develop industrial automation modules that extend AI into machinery. Beneath all of this, a components layer formed with Italy’s adaptronics raising €3.15M to scale electro-adhesive grippers, hardware crucial to the rest of the stack. When exploring the entire sector, these deals tell a story: robotics is shifting from prototyping and new product development to layered, investable solutions with AI-backed systems. While AI is making waves in robotics, it is also crucial in embedded workflows, analytics, and automation through industries like banking and healthcare. That activity leading up to November has led to the growth of a parallel market for controlling, securing, and governing AI integrations. Such investment is no longer a one-off, but an essential budget line, driven by rising demands in compliance, fraud prevention, identity and security. In the governance layer, London’s AI Score raised just under $1M to centralise oversight of AI use, ensuring visibility, auditability, and policy in one place. Vigilant AI.ai in the UK added “AI teammates” designed for regulated environments, supporting operational and governance needs. Fraud prevention is just as crucial, especially as AI makes it easier for scammers, fraudsters, and hackers to operate. The UK’s Falkin raised €1.7M in pre-seed funding to focus on blocking fraud before payments are made. Romania’s TMT ID secured €34M for identity intelligence and cybercrime prevention, one of the biggest European checks this month in anything related to trust or security. November also marked brand and misinformation defence, with the Netherlands’ Social Links raising €2.6M for tools that help companies defend against identity abuse, scam campaigns, and AI-driven misinformation (a category that barely existed only two years ago). Beneath all these layers is an emphasis on security, with Norway’s Bsure raising €1.8M to target identity, access, and licence risk across Microsoft environments. The pattern is clear: AI drives innovation, but also requires new mandatory spending on oversight, compliance, and trust. November marks the emergence of early architecture for the “AI risk stack,” sure to scale in parallel with AI across other applications. Earlier in 2025, debt slowly entered venture rounds as an add-on, then as blended structures. In November, that shift grew, with companies scaling through financial structures rather than solely through equity rounds. That took the form in multiple ways. Instead of raising larger Series A or B rounds, several companies focused on opening credit lines aligned with their business models. A clear example came from the UK’s BKN301 Group, which paired its €32M Series B with an institutional facility backed by BlackRock-managed funds. Zilch followed a similar pattern: its latest financing blended debt and equity with a securitisation expansion arranged alongside Deutsche Bank, using credit capacity as the engine for commercial scaling. Together, these cases show how credit capability, rather than dilution, increasingly fuels growth. November saw securitisation solidify its role as a meaningful scaling tool, something that used to live in banking and structured credit more than in venture-backed firms. For instance, London’s Zilch raised over €150M across debt and equity while expanding its securitisation programme with Deutsche Bank (using receivables as an asset for growth). This marked financing expansion through structured instruments rather than repeated equity rounds. November also saw companies scale with capital tied to managed assets rather than their latest valuation. In the UK, Keyzy expanded using asset-backed funding to finance property purchases, with more than €147M having already flowed through its model over 18 months. The company continues to grow as more homes move through the platform, without having to reset valuation every time it adds capacity. Hybrid stacks began appearing in early funding stages. In Spain, Devengo raised €2M in pre-Series A funding, combining equity and debt. While small, this signals that mixed financing structures are no longer limited to later-stage companies. Altogether, November highlighted the need for companies to focus on growth through smarter financing tools, not bigger venture checks. It shows that scaling is increasingly possible without constant dilution, and that venture is gradually absorbing capital-markets logic. Europe’s tech industry and exit market are active, but not in a way that generates broad liquidity. November saw small, focused acquisitions over massive or complex headline deals. Across the region, the pattern was visible in volume: the DACH markets alone saw 69 tech M&A transactions, with smaller, tuck-in deals outweighing larger, valuation-defining exits. POM’s acquisition of FarPay pulled invoicing, payments, and AR automation into a singular workflow. Integral bought CleverLohn in Berlin, folding payroll into its HR suite. Latvia’s TestDevLab was absorbed by Xoriant, adding delivery capacity. What links these deals is that they are not built around liquidity. They are driven by functionality. Buyers are acquiring capabilities they need immediately, while teams are joining larger platforms so their work can be used at scale. As the tech market becomes more industrial and execution-focused, exit activity looks smaller and is based on transactions that boost system strength. November’s patterns point in the same direction. European tech is moving out of the exploratory phase. What is visible now is greater discipline around production, supply chains, real-world deployment, and financing built for scale. That trend is reflected in defence, space, robotics, and AI, shifting towards things that can be manufactured, integrated, or operated. For investors, the market represents progress being measured by what can actually be built. For companies, the environment has shifted to one that rewards readiness — the ability to ship, deliver, and become part of the industrial stack. As Europe moves into the next cycle, this is the emerging shape — not one of narrative, but of a new, clearer sense of what the continent chooses to develop at scale. It outlines the trajectory along which the tech sector will continue to evolve. Oleg Khuaenov is CEO & Founder of Zubr Capital

Title: Jio Financial Services aims to be a constructive disruptor in India's financial services sector

MUMBAI: Jio Financial Services is not letting its late entry into the financial services space deter it from aiming for the top. Backed by the Jio brand, data support from parent companies, and learnings from peers, the non-banking financial company (NBFC) hopes to become a “constructive disruptor”. “For us, in financial services, we hope to be what I call ‘constructively disruptive’,” managing director and chief executive officer Hitesh Sethia said at the Mint BFSI Conclave 2025 on 12 December. “One has to be price competitive because that is true value for the customer. We will have to play on the advantage of cost and scale.” Jio Financial Services is the holding company for several businesses: NBFC Jio Credit Ltd, Jio Payments Bank Ltd, wealth management joint venture Jio BlackRock Investment Advisers Pvt Ltd, and asset management joint venture Jio BlackRock Asset Management Pvt Ltd, among others. Sethia said pricing competitiveness will come not through a price war but via cost engineering at scale, underpinned by technology. “We have the advantage to set everything from a zero base. If we are able to do that with today's modern technology, with the brand and capital that we have, there is a good chance we have in creating value for customers and capturing value for shareholders,” Sethia said. “That is an equation that can be solved.” He highlighted that Jio Financial’s late entry allows it to incorporate lessons from decades of industry data across timing the market, product segments, customer segments, and distribution channels. “Technology can certainly make a lot of products DIY (do-it-yourself). It can also digitize the distribution channel, make that intelligent and far more efficient. That is happening as we see.” The NBFC had assets under management (AUM) worth ₹14,712 crore as of end of September, while the AUM of the AMC business was at ₹15,980 crore across nine funds. The wealth management, broking and insurance businesses are still in the incubation phase. Demerged from Reliance Industries and listed in 2023, Jio Financial underwent a management and business overhaul to grow its loan book across home loans, loans against property, loans against mutual funds, loans against shares, and supply chain finance. Sethia, appointed CEO in November 2023, considers Jio Financial both a startup and a late entrant, but one blessed with two things most startups take years to build: brand and capital. “We were born with two things, which most startups take many years to build,” Sethia said, adding that the goal now is to build a “stable, steady” financial institution which is able to “last decades and weather the cycles that come with lending”. The plan is to start with secured loan products and later look at other loan products that “may be needed”, he said. Partnerships form a cornerstone of Jio Financial’s strategy. The company has 50:50 joint ventures (JVs) with BlackRock for asset management, wealth management, and broking. It has another 50:50 JV with Allianz Insurance for reinsurance, and has signed non-binding agreements with Allianz to enter life and general insurance. The company is also leveraging the Jio ecosystem. “We are present in MyJio, which is a part of the Jio telecom company. The MyJio app has a few hundred million monthly active users. That gives us a funnel for Jio Finance as well. There is clearly a case for collaboration between industries,” he said, citing the example of telecom and e-commerce with financial services. “In an eventual scale, we expect to be a full-scale service firm. We will span across the entire length and breadth of the country,” Sethia said. With Jio Payments Bank’s banking correspondent network, Jio Financial already has over 200,000 touchpoints nationwide and 18 million mobile app users. “The game has to be expanding the market rather than trying to eat up just the existing market share,” said Sethia, who sees opportunity in taking wealth management services to people in the ‘the middle of the pyramid’ as well as offering better services to people at the 'top of the pyramid'. Sethia emphasized simplifying financial services, meeting evolving customer expectations, and moving from a “digital first to intelligent always” approach. “Simply put, financial services has to work like Wi-Fi. When you need it, it is available and when you don't, it's quiet in the background.” Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.
