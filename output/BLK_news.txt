By Arasu Kannagi Basil and Davide Barbuscia (Reuters) -BlackRock will buy private credit firm HPS Investment Partners for about $12 billion in an all-stock deal, the companies said on Tuesday, as the world's largest asset manager seeks to expand in a red-hot market. Private credit, or lending to companies by institutions other than banks, has grown rapidly in recent years as stricter regulations made it more expensive for traditional lenders to finance riskier loans. The asset class is expected to grow to $2.6 trillion by 2029 from $1.5 trillion at the end of 2023, according to Preqin data. "Together we will deliver income solutions for our clients that blend both the best of the public markets and the best of the private markets in an organized, unified fashion," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Tuesday. He has previously outlined private credit to be a "primary growth driver" within alternatives for BlackRock in coming years. HPS was founded in 2007 as a division of Highbridge Capital Management, the hedge fund unit of JPMorgan's asset management arm. In 2016, top HPS executives acquired the firm from JPMorgan. Since then, the New York-based company has become a massive private credit player, with assets under management vaulting to about $148 billion as of September from $34 billion in 2016. HPS originally aimed to do an initial public offering, but was approached by a number of parties including BlackRock, a source familiar with the matter said. HPS did not immediately return a request for comment. BlackRock, which manages $11.5 trillion in assets, has an existing $85 billion private credit platform as of Sept. 30. A new private financing solutions business unit will be formed, which will be led by the HPS leadership team. BlackRock will pay roughly 9.2 million shares upon deal close that are worth about $9.4 billion as of Monday's close. Nearly 2.9 million shares will be paid in about five years, subject to certain conditions. As part of the deal, which is expected to close in mid-2025, BlackRock will retire for cash or refinance about $400 million of existing HPS debt. "The HPS deal positions BlackRock to offer comprehensive alternative asset management portfolio services to the largest institutions in the world ... significantly advancing its private-market growth goals," said Ana Arsov, global head of private credit at Moody's Ratings. BlackRock's stock was last up 1.7% on Tuesday. “This is a really good move for them to try and bolster their higher fee areas,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp, which holds BlackRock shares. PRIVATE MARKETS PUSH BlackRock has been on an acquisition spree this year, splurging roughly $28 billion as it positions itself as a comprehensive platform for investors by integrating public and private markets. In October, the New York-based firm finalized its $12.5 billion acquisition of infrastructure investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners and anticipates completing the $3.2 billion purchase of private markets data provider Preqin by year-end. "GIP gave them infrastructure, but they still didn't really have a meaningful presence in private credit ... I think they've plugged the gap," said Kyle Sanders, an analyst at Edward Jones. The source familiar with the situation said a private equity firm could be BlackRock's next major acquisition. BlackRock declined comment. Edward Jones' Sanders said private equity is an area where BlackRock remains smaller than some of the largest firms, although it is a more mature product with likely less growth potential than infrastructure and private credit. This year's deals aim to strengthen BlackRock's foothold in infrastructure investments and private markets, both pivotal growth areas. Fink on Tuesday said he expected a "dramatic expansion" of private capital in backing infrastructure investments. BlackRock manages roughly $450 billion in alternative assets post-GIP acquisition. HIGHER FEES The HPS deal, which will create a private credit franchise with about $220 billion in client assets, will also increase BlackRock's private markets fee-paying assets under management and management fees by 40% and about 35%, respectively. Recent acquisitions will bolster BlackRock fees when compared to "razor thin margins" coming from passive investment, said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. Private assets carry much higher fees than exchange-traded funds, which is BlackRock's main business. Still, BlackRock's rival alternative asset managers Apollo Global Management, Blackstone and Ares Management have made bigger strides in private credit. Apollo manages $598 billion in credit assets and Ares $335 billion as of Sept. 30. Blackstone manages $432 billion in assets across its entire credit platform. The HPS deal comes amid speculation BlackRock's long-time boss Fink may eventually step down from leading the firm. Speaking at a New York event in October, Fink said the growth of private markets could mitigate the economic impact of wide U.S. deficits and high government debt levels. He also said at the time he was not thinking about retiring. In an op-ed he wrote for the Wall Street Journal in November, Fink said private investments in infrastructure projects such as data centers could help boost U.S. economic growth.

Title: Behind BlackRock's ambitions to push into private markets

Time Published: 2024-12-03T10:00:01Z

Larry Fink is looking to close 2024 as he started it — by announcing a big acquisition that brings BlackRock closer to dominating private-market investing. BlackRock is set to buy HPS Investment Partners, a private-credit behemoth managing $148 billion, in an all-stock deal worth about $12 billion, the firms announced Tuesday. Fink, BlackRock's chief executive and cofounder, built the world's largest asset manager, with $11.5 trillion in assets, by packaging public markets into cheap funds for the masses. He's now been very vocal about the firm's push into the profitable private markets. This shift in strategy could lead to a more valuable BlackRock, which might just be enough for Fink, who turned 72 last month, to finally pass on the reins to his yet-to-be-named successor. In January, the firm announced that it would buy the private-equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners, with about $170 billion in assets, for about $12.5 billion in cash and stock. The deal, its biggest one since it bought Barclays' asset-management business in 2009, closed in October. In June, it agreed to buy the data giant Preqin, which it hopes will help bring some of these more complex private strategies to a broader audience. In addition to the HPS talks, the Financial Times reported that BlackRock was eyeing a stake in Izzy Englander's $70 billion hedge fund, Millennium Management. BlackRock is not new to reshaping itself through acquisition. The Barclays deal gave the firm iShares and helped it become the passive-investing giant it now is. "I do not want us to be comfortable in our business model," Fink said during the firm's investor day in summer 2023. "I want to make sure we're questioning our business model and we are focusing on how to best serve our clients, and if we truly believe there is some great need that we need to do, we are going to reimagine who we are in our business model." Acquiring HPS could be another transformational deal for the company, helping it reach the same scale it has in public equities and bonds in private markets. HPS is set to push its alternative assets to more than $600 billion. BlackRock's private-credit business is poised to now have a combined $220 billion in client assets. The deal is expected to increase private-market fee-paying assets under management by 40% and management fees by 35%, BlackRock said. HPS was founded by CEO Scott Kapnick, Goldman Sachs' former head of investment banking, along with Scot French and Michael Patterson, in 2007 as a unit within JPMorgan called Highbridge Capital Management. Principals from the firm bought it out in 2016 after the bank's appetite for high-risk loans waned. The three are now set to join BlackRock's global executive committee and lead a new unit combining HPS and BlackRock's existing private-credit business. The secretive firm has been at the forefront of the private-credit boom, a result of the 2008 financial crisis and banks' withdrawal from risky lending. Private players moved in to make loans to companies when Wall Street giants were reluctant to. "Our competitors refer to us as the nerds of private credit and we take no offense," French told Bloomberg in an interview in November 2023. The firm, which was previously working toward an initial public offering, caters mostly to institutional investors and has more than 760 employees in offices around the world, according to its website. BlackRock brought in more assets in the third quarter than ever before, mostly down to its index funds. But in its October earnings call, the firm's leaders were already focused on its growth engine — GIP. GIP is expected to add $250 million in management fees in the fourth quarter alone. "This is a revenue-growth story," Martin Small, BlackRock's chief financial officer, said during that call. Private-equity and credit investments are much more expensive than BlackRock's usual roster of funds and in high demand from institutions like pensions and endowments, as well as ultrawealthy investors. While BlackRock has long had an alternatives investing unit, until recently, its private-markets assets were meaningfully smaller than those of the main players in the space, such as Apollo and KKR. It's tried growing through acquisition in this space in the past. In 2018, BlackRock bought a small credit manager, Tennenbaum Capital Partners, which at that time had about $9 billion in committed client capital, but saw several investment professionals exit. BlackRock expects the private-debt market to more than double to $4.5 trillion by 2030. While private credit's high yields and returns have increasingly attracted wealth managers and institutions alike, the deal will likely strengthen relationships with insurance firms, which have a longer investing horizon. Ana Arsov, Moody's Ratings' global head of private credit, said the acquisition was "catapulting" BlackRock into the ranks of the top five private-credit managers and would significantly advance its private-market growth goals. "BlackRock's large installed base of insurance-client assets offers a prime opportunity to cross-sell HPS's capabilities," Arsov said. "Additionally, BlackRock's extensive distribution network of institutional investors and wealth managers opens new markets for HPS." Jump to

New Delhi, Dec 3 (PTI) Realty firm Godrej Properties Ltd has raised ₹6,000 crore by selling shares to institutional investors, including Singapore sovereign wealth firm GIC and SBI Pension, through qualified institutional placement (QIP) route as it looks to expand business amid strong demand for residential plots and apartments. On November 27th, the company launched its QIP issue to raise up to ₹6,000 crore. The company has raised this amount by diluting nearly 8 per cent of equity through the QIP issue, which was closed on Monday. The QIP Placement Committee of the board approved the issue price of ₹2,595 per equity share, which is at a discount of ₹132.44 (4.86 per cent of the floor price) to the floor price of ₹2,727.44 per equity share. It also approved the allocation of 2,31,21,387 equity shares to be allotted to eligible qualified institutional buyers. In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, Godrej Properties informed that the QIP issue saw a strong demand of around 4 times the size of the QIP. The issue also had a healthy mix of leading international and domestic investors including GIC, Blackrock, Aberdeen, Norges Bank, SBI Pension, and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. As a result of the QIP, Godrej Properties said its "net worth has increased by more than 50 per cent while the equity dilution was 7.68 per cent". The company's gearing ratio will come down to below 0.2:1 from 0.7:1 as of September 30, 2024. Commenting on the fundraise, Pirojsha Godrej, Executive Chairperson, Godrej Properties Ltd, said, "We greatly appreciate the confidence and support of the investment community and will do our best to ensure we utilize this capital wisely." "This capital raise will allow Godrej Properties to significantly enhance its business development portfolio while maintaining a tremendously strong balance sheet. We remain focused on building scale through continued market share gains and margin expansion," he said. Godrej Properties has reset its scale in recent years with bookings growth of 56 per cent in 2022-23 and 84 per cent in 2023-24, he said. Pirojsha expressed confidence that the company was well positioned to deliver a 3rd consecutive year of rapid growth in booking value with 90 per cent growth in the sales bookings during the first half of this fiscal. Godrej Properties is one of the leading developers in the country. It has a major presence in Delhi-NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune and Bengaluru. It has entered into Hyderabad market recently. In the last fiscal, the company's sale bookings jumped 84 per cent to a record ₹22,527 crore, the highest among listed realty firms in 2023-24. Godrej Properties has set a target of achieving ₹27,000 crore worth of sale bookings for the 2024-25 fiscal. During the April-September period of this fiscal, Godrej Properties' sale bookings value grew 89 per cent annually to over ₹13,800 crore. This is the highest-ever booking value achieved by Godrej Properties during the first half of a fiscal year. To expand its housing business, Godrej Properties acquires land through outright purchases as well as forms partnerships with landowners for joint development. Godrej Properties has added 8 new land parcels in the first six months of this fiscal with a total estimated saleable area of about 11 million square feet and a total estimated booking value potential of around ₹12,650 crore.

21X, a Frankfurt-based company building a blockchain-based exchange to list and trade tokenized securities, has received approval to go live from Germany's financial supervisory authority, BaFin. The 21X exchange, which runs on the scalable Polygon chain, plans to launch its exchange for tokenized financial instruments from its Frankfurt headquarters in the first quarter of 2025, the company said on Tuesday. The plan is to trade tokenized equity, debt securities, funds, as well as more exotic real-world assets (RWAs) such as real estate or artworks that qualify as eligible financial instruments. Tokenization has become popular among traditional finance firms, with the likes of asset manager BlackRock now driving the trend. From a regulatory perspective, Europe is on the verge of welcoming a new regime for crypto assets, the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, the next phase of which is set to start at the end of this year. The 21X license has been issued under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime (DLTR), and is the result of an 18-month process that involved BaFin, the German Federal Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Central Bank (ECB), 21X said in a press release. “This is more than just a license – it’s a revolutionary moment for capital markets,” said Max Heinzle, CEO of 21X in a statement. “For the first time ever institutional and retail investors can trade and settle tokenized securities on a fully regulated, blockchain-based exchange with the same level of trust, security and compliance as traditional markets.” Ian Allison is a senior reporter at CoinDesk, focused on institutional and enterprise adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Prior to that, he covered fintech for the International Business Times in London and Newsweek online.

Title: Drinks industry veteran Patrick J Rigney invests in new Dublin brewery

Drinks industry entrepreneur Patrick J Rigney has invested in Changing Times Brewery, the newly launched beer-maker in Glasnevin, Dublin, backed by the families behind some of Dublin’s best known pubs. Mr Rigney has been instrumental in Ireland’s drinks industry for decades, establishing brands such as Baileys as global leaders. Before establishing his own business – the Shed Distillery of PJ Rigney – he created brands including the twin-bottle Sheridan’s Irish Cream Liqueur. He also owns a distillery in Co Leitrim where he produces Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin, which is his primary brand. Changing Times Brewery, located adjacent to the Royal Canal in Glasnevin, said Mr Rigney will join the group as chairman, with his involvement bringing the total investment among its backers to “over €2 million”. When the launch of the brewery was announced last month, its backers said they had put €1.8 million into the project, which would suggest Mr Rigney’s investment is in the region of €200,000. Its backers include Dublin publicans Willie Aherne and Paul Sheehan of the Palace Bar on Fleet Street and Sheehans Pub on Chatham Street respectively, as well as Benny McCabe, who owns a number of popular bars in Cork, and brewer Shane Long. It is also backed by the publican families behind the Ferryman, the Long Hall, the Swan, Darkey Kellys, the Bankers, Arthur Maynes in Donnybrook, Devitts, Doheny & Nesbitts, Lemon and Duke, the Bridge 1859, the Blackrock and the Bank. The group said Mr Rigney’s investment marked his first involvement in a brewery, and said his experience in the industry would be valuable for the company. “Changing Times hope to utilise his extensive contacts, creative entrepreneurship, vast experience in bringing new brands to market and his global perspective in helping to establish and grow their brand and products,” it said. Initially the brewery’s new beers are being stocked in the pubs of its founding members, with further pubs “expected to be announced soon”. “I was greatly flattered when I was asked to get involved in Changing Times Brewery, which I think represents a real innovation in the Irish beer market,” said Mr Rigney. “The families behind this brewery are steeped in the pub heritage of Dublin and Ireland with years and years’ of experience in catering to their customer’s tastes. They are a part of the fabric of the Dublin’s social culture. “Who could be better placed to deliver authentic, refreshingly Irish, locally brewed beers. I’m excited to come on board and to help them deliver a timely change for customers at the pub counter.” Colin Gleeson is an Irish Times reporter Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: SolarZero collapse: Liquidators’ first report reveals more than $40 million owed
URL: https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/solarzero-collapse-liquidators-first-report-reveals-more-than-40-million-owed/OBA77JJHWJBA5FGH6L44752YQY/
Time Published: 2024-12-03T05:10:34Z

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. The first liquidator’s report on SolarZero reveals the company owes more than $40 million to more than 700 creditors and staff. The Kiwi-founded solar and battery firm ceased operations last week and was placed in voluntary liquidation by its sole shareholder, an investment fund controlled by US private equity giant BlackRock. Russell Moore and Stephen Keen of Grant Thornton were appointed liquidators of the six entities – all in liquidation – that made up the Group. The reason for SolarZero’s collapse was due to it being unable to generate a profit – nor did it reach breakeven, the liquidators said. The company had 169 staff at the time of liquidation. The liquidators said they are aware of 173 preferential claims totalling $1,796,880, representing holiday pay owing to employees for accrued entitlement. Trade creditors with security are owed $3.1m. There are 598 unsecured creditors who are owed just over $34.9m. This includes $4.1m owing to trade creditors and $24.4m in intercompany payables. “At this stage, it is unknown if there will be any funds available to make payment to unsecured creditors,” the report said. The liquidator’s report also confirmed BlackRock had bought SolarZero for $110m from its Kiwi founders in a mid-2022 deal. The price has not been previously disclosed, but the deal required Overseas Investment Office approval, implying it was above the OIO’s $100m assessment threshold. Since the acquisition, BlackRock has injected a further $147.8m into the business, the report said. Last week the company said its customers – of which is estimated to be 15,500 – would not be affected by the liquidation. The liquidator’s report said SolarZero’s cash generating assets, and associated obligations, including most of its contracts with its customers, were legally transferred into special purpose trusts controlled by Public Trust. “This means that the majority of the Group’s SolarZero customers are not creditors of any of the companies.” The Public Trust has been quoted as saying “The trusts continue to operate as a going concern and are focused on ensuring services continue for customers”. The liquidators said since their appointment they have received expressions of interest from parties seeking to buy all or part of the SolarZero business. “We are keeping an interested parties register and we are working to develop options for a possible sale with all other stakeholders,” they said. On Friday about a dozen former staff protested outside BlackRock’s Auckland office, claiming they were owed $1.4m in holiday pay and $1.6m for one-month notice pay. “We also have about $300,000 outstanding with our contractors. And then our subcontractors - our field service providers around the country - are owed in total around $600,000,” one of the protest organisers told the Herald. Such sums were “chump change” for BlackRock, he said. Master Electricians chief executive Alexandra Vranyac-Wheeler said 14 former installers for SolarZero were Master Electricians have come forward. The amount owed to the industry group’s members was at least $118,000. Electricians outside the group had also approached it. NZ Green Investment Finance - a “green investment bank” created by the previous Government to fund environmentally-friendly businesses - made a $145m debt facility available to SolarZero, as well as facilitating $220m in credit lines from international private lenders First Sentier Investors, Natixis Investment Managers and Societe Generale. “At the time of SolarZero’s liquidation, approximately $115m of NZGIF’s commitment was drawn down against installations,” NZGIF said on Friday. Finance Minister Nicola Willis, who is due to meet with NZGIF executives later this week, said she was urgently seeking more information. BlackRock said in a statement to the Herald last week: “BlackRock’s Climate Infrastructure business, on behalf of the fund, held extensive discussions with various stakeholders over a period of time to explore and work through several options to reach an outcome that would meet the needs of various parties, which regrettably could not be brought to fruition. “The team is deeply disappointed with this outcome and has worked with the SolarZero board to appoint a liquidator to ensure an orderly transition of the business in the interests of stakeholders, including SolarZero’s customers, employees, creditors, and others.” SolarZero offered no-money-up-front solar panel installations, instead charging a monthly subscription over a 25-year contract.

Title: Altcoin Boom Forecasted: Expert Predicts $1.4 Trillion Market Cap With Bitcoin At $130,000
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/altcoin-boom-forecasted-bitcoin-at-130000/
Time Published: 2024-12-03T05:00:03Z

As the cryptocurrency market experiences a notable uptrend, altcoins have begun to take center stage while Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates just below its recent record high of $99,540. This shift has led to significant capital rotation toward altcoins such as Cardano (ADA) and XRP, both of which have outperformed many of the top ten cryptocurrencies over the past month. Market analyst Doctor Profit recently shared insights on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), highlighting that while retail traders seem to be selling off their holdings, cryptocurrency whales are accumulating Bitcoin at an accelerated pace. According to his analysis, in the last three to five weeks, these whales have amassed $1.6 billion worth of Bitcoin. Conversely, retail traders appear to be sidelined, primarily holding USDT as they panic-sell without clear justification. Doctor Profit also noted that Ethereum (ETH) is currently “undervalued” according to its market value to realized value (MVRV) chart and is showing signs of upward momentum. This month alone has seen 245,000 ETH in exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, with Ethereum ETFs surpassing Bitcoin ETF inflows for the first time, signaling a significant shift in institutional interest. The analyst suggests that the market is pricing in a potential altcoin-focused ETF launch in 2025, with S-1 filings made by asset managers such as Bitwise and Canaray Capital, among others, for these index funds to invest in Solana, Litecoin, XRP, and Hedera. According to Doctor Profit, the market is entering the “altcoin season” with previous periods of stagnation behind. He predicts that the upcoming XRP ETF, rumored to be launched by major financial institutions such as BlackRock and JPMorgan, will spur further interest in the altcoin market. Delving into the market’s dynamics, Doctor Profit emphasizes the importance of the Bitcoin to altcoin market cap ratio. In previous market cycles, a drop in this ratio has signaled impending corrections for Bitcoin. For instance, during the peak of April 2021, Bitcoin had a market cap of $1.2 trillion, while altcoins were valued at $984 billion, creating a healthier 50% ratio. However, when this ratio fell to 20% and later to 18%, Bitcoin faced substantial corrections. Currently, the altcoin market is undervalued relative to Bitcoin, with the ratio sitting at an extreme 95%. This discrepancy suggests that Bitcoin is overvaluing the altcoin market, which Doctor Profit views as a positive indicator for both sectors. The analyst further predicts a robust altcoin market cap of $1.4 trillion by Q1 2025, supported by anticipated altcoin ETFs, while Bitcoin could reach approximately $130,000. At the time of writing, XRP, the third largest digital asset on the market, is trading at $2.73, boasting a colossal market cap surge towards the $152 billion mark, setting a new all-time high in this metric for the token.

Title: 31.2 Patch Notes - Battlegrounds Season 9, Twist, Arena, Event, Heroic Brawl & More!

This site works best with JavaScript enabled. Please enable JavaScript to get the best experience from this site. The Great Dark Beyond Cards List & Guide Patch Notes for a 31.2 patch were just released, including Season 9 in Battlegrounds, a new event, upcoming Heroic Tavern Brawl & More! Details inside. Patch 31.2, launching tomorrow, kicks off Battlegrounds Season 9, sends an invitation to Bob's Holiday Bash, and more! On December 3 , Battlegrounds Season 8 will end and Season 9 will begin. That means ratings will reset in Battlegrounds and Duos, Trinkets will be removed, and the Battlegrounds Rewards Track will switch over. All rewards that were earned on the Season 8 track, but not yet claimed, will be automatically claimed. Learn more about the upcoming Season in our Season 9 Announcement Blog . Farseer Nobundo Exarch Othaar Zerek, Master Cloner These three new heroes will be offered in every Battlegrounds/Duos game for two weeks following their introduction in Patch 31.2. Since they will always be in the initial hero offerings each game, that also means you will NOT be able to Reroll into them during this period (because you can't Reroll into a hero that's already been offered, more on that below). Lich Baz'hial Shudderwock Marin the Manager Trade Prince Gallywix The new season will bring nearly 90 new and returning minions and 11 all-new Tavern spells across Battlegrounds and Duos! With so many changes, Bob's rolling out the minion types in groups so you can learn the new synergies, and each gets a chance to shine: You can see all the card reveals and changes now in the official Card Library . Starting with Season 9, the damage cap will be adjusted in solo Battlegrounds games (note: this change will only apply to solo Battlegrounds, not Duos). The damage cap will start at 5 damage, then go up to 10 damage on turn 4, and 15 damage on turn 8. The cap will still be removed once you're in the Top 4. This change will allow games to progress more evenly, without big bursts of damage in the early game. Starting with Season 9, you'll be able to Reroll Hero options during the Hero selection phase of your Battlegrounds games. Each Hero slot can be Rerolled once per game, using new Battlegrounds Tokens. Each Reroll will change that specific Hero into a different Hero option that hasn't been offered to any player in the lobby that game.* Each player's Rerolls are independent of other players', so you don't need to worry about timing your Rerolls to make them more effective. You can get Battlegrounds Tokens from the Rewards Track (as free rewards and with the Season Pass), in-game grants, viewership rewards, and the in-game Shop. Once Patch 31.2 goes live, all players will automatically have 2 Battlegrounds Tokens added to their account. There will also be a free bundle of 4 Battlegrounds Tokens that you can claim in the in-game Shop for a limited time after launch. Finally, with the new Battlegrounds Season Pass+, your first Reroll each game doesn't require a Battlegrounds Token. * Because you can't Reroll into a Hero that was already offered to someone in the lobby, and because the new Heroes are guaranteed to be offered in every lobby for two weeks following the patch, you will be unable to Reroll into those Heroes during that period. With Season 9, the Battlegrounds Rewards Track is being extended to add Battlegrounds Tokens throughout both the free rewards and the paid rewards from the Season Pass. There will also be a new option, the Season Pass+, that includes everything on the Season Pass plus a perk that makes it so your first Reroll each game doesn't consume a Battlegrounds Token—making it the most consistent and efficient option for people who want to maximize their Rerolls and Hero options. The Season Pass will be available for the same price as before ($14.99 USD or 1500 Runestones). The Season Pass+ will be available for $19.99 USD or 2000 Runestones. If you get the regular Season Pass and later decide you want to upgrade to the Season Pass+, you will be able to do so for $4.99 or 500 Runestones. See our Season 9 Announcement Blog for the details about all three levels of the Rewards Track. When Patch 31.2 launches on December 3 , all ongoing Arena runs will end and a new Arena season will begin. The eligible sets will be updated to the following: Twist is back! Twist returns with the Wonders format for when Patch 31.2 launches on December 3 . The Wonders format is a throwback format celebrating the early years of Hearthstone*. In it, players can make decks with cards from the following sets: Starting with Patch 31.2, Twist will no longer require that all formats start and end exactly on the first and last day of the month. This will allow for better support during those transition periods by avoiding weekends and holidays. The initial Wonders format will run from December 3 to January 6 . Seasons will still be monthly and ladder rankings will still reset with the monthly calendar. That means, for example, that the January ladder season will consist of two different formats: one from January 1-6 , and one from January 6-31 . On January 6 , the XL Wonders format will begin. XL Wonders uses the same card pool as Wonders, but allows you to build your decks with anywhere between 30 and 40 cards and then have your life total match your card total (so if you have a 37-card deck, you will begin the game with 37 max life). This means you can keep playing your Wonders deck, or add a bit more cards in once the format rolls over. What Wonders will you accomplish with freedom over your deck and life total?! We'll have more information about the February Twist season closer to when it goes live. * Before the introduction of Demon Hunter and Death Knight, so those classes are banned in both Wonders and XL Wonders. Heroic Tavern Brawl returns for the week of December 4-11 . Pay an entry fee and compete in high-stakes games until reaching either 12 wins or 3 losses, with prizing based on how well you do. Bob's hosting a holiday bash this year, with a special in-game event. From December 10 to December 31 , complete Event Quests to earn XP on the special Event XP Track. Both Hearthstone and Battlegrounds are on Bob's invite list, so Event Quests can be completed in either Mode, and progress gives rewards for both Modes. Complete the entire Event Track to earn 7 The Great Dark Beyond Packs, 4 Battlegrounds Tokens, and Bob the Bartender himself (regular and golden), for the first time in Standard Hearthstone! Bob the Bartender is planned to rotate out of Standard with the 2026 Standard rotation. Finish the year out strong with Hearthstone: Music of the Tavern (Volume 2), releasing on December 18 ! Enjoy the tunes of over 50 in-game tracks when they launch on Spotify, Apple Music, itunes, and Deezer! Artist: Uriah Voth correct me if I'm wrong, but Bob the Bartender would be able to deal with Unkilliax with the "Recruit a minion" option, right? Hopefully what I am seeing here from Bob the Bartender and Freeze the Shop specifically is a control tool for Rogue to get to the late game. Recruit a Minion is nice for control decks but I would stick with Mind Control Tech as it comes a turn earlier and against Ramp Druid, you'd want their Zilliax or Titan active on your side of the board immediately rather in hand. I think Bob will be tried out but I don't he is necessarily valuable for any deck. I mean you can get similar freeze the board effect with Sleepy Resident for example. Let me guess you can't craft Bob, right? Just like the Alliance/Horde spell from the current event. So this is gonna be a thing now? What about new and returning players? I can't believe it. These cards are even really fun and better than the average card IMO. I don't even know anymore with Hearthstone. It could be such a fun game but then they do things like that. I think until now it was maybe annoying to get some cards but now you literally can't anymore. Why are they doing this? Well, at least for me that means I really shouldn't play much anymore. Because why would I if the most fun cards aren't even available to people anymore. To be fair most people don't even like to play that way. But maybe in the future I thought we could have more social stuff like groups and I could play with people that are more like me. But now... this... I guess... it was to be expected... but I still feel disappointed. thats a lot of words for i dont want to play the game and want everything to be obtainable by spending money Bob about to see a lot of play in my Priest deck literally the artwork of the wrong N'zoth for the Twist promo art "Is Heroic Brawl worth it for me?"Short answer: No. Long answer: No, it is a scam set up to drain your gold reserves ahead of the miniset launching next month so you're more likely to have to spend real money on it instead. i dont know how much gold we will spend on 1 run? If still 150 it will be a boom I truly don’t understand why people get so angry about the brawl. If you’re a bad player or a player with a terrible deck wasting your gold on the brawl, then you deserve what happens to you. The brawl is only good for the very best players with great decks. I don’t understand the appeal of the brawl. I’ve never felt the desire to participate in it. I didn’t even play in the latest brawl (the one that was right before this expansion). The timing of the brawl has NOTHING to do with it being a “scam.” Even if it were after the mini-set, bad players shouldn’t participate. By the way, it’s totally fine if you just want to play it for fun. I’m talking about bad players who expect to maximize their gold and number of packs by winning in the brawl. Imagine a random player thinking they can profit from the brawl, saying, “I am rank 4284387 legend. I am so good at the game. Obviously, I will get at least 10 wins in this brawl.” LOL PS: I just want to make it clear: when I said “bad player,” I’m including diamond and low-legend players as well. It always makes me laugh how much players hate on Heroic Tavern Brawl, when it is basically a lite version of what "tournament mode" would be which is something we complain endlessly about not having. Face it guys - if you suck at the game, any competitive mode is going to be a losing proposition for you. So play it for fun, or don't play it. gotta love the flexers above pretending that a 12-2 or better win rate is consistently possible for the event to be even considered a profitable investment of time and gold."buh you get packs for less wins"yeah for a set I already have a meta-viable collection of. Oh boy! I cant wait for them to get rid of trinkets: (one of the funnest and most exciting mechanics they've ever added to BGs) and replace it with NOTHING again!!! And wow, I cant wait to get reroll tokens (a feature designed for tier-wh*re players who will choose the highest WR character every time because they care about imaginary rank points which don't actually give you any in-game rewards) instead of hero skins from the free tavern pass! Best season ever! IMO it's time for battleground to have its own game, I'm tired of seeing all these updates for a mode I don't even play. I think BG players would like this too, especially if they don't play constructed mode. Sign In Help Advertise Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2024 Magic Find, Inc. All rights reserved.

Title: Bitcoin And Ether ETFs Set Record $7.6 Billion Inflows Amid Trump’s Crypto Push

Analysts said that two of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world are riding on the waves of positive sentiments as the exchange-traded funds of Bitcoin and Ethereum reached record highs. The pro-cryptocurrency stance of US President-elect Donald Trump continues to fuel the positive outlook, propelling BTC and ETH to attain unprecedented levels. Analysts showed that as of November, the firstborn cryptocurrency’s exchange-traded funds (EFT) recorded an all-time high of $6.5 billion in net inflows, a significant milestone attributed to the incoming Trump administration. Many market commentators are predicting that Bitcoin could soon hit a record high of over $100,000 per coin; even American author Robert Kiyosaki posted on his X account that BTC would settle at around $250,000 in 2025. Analysts mentioned that since the start of 2024, BTC’s price has already doubled, and they observed that the crypto went up by 45% after the US presidential election, noting that investors’ optimism on cryptocurrencies can be attributed to Trump’s promise to make regulations more friendly to digital assets. As of press time, Bitcoin has been traded at $95,721, down by 1.8% in the last 24 hours and with a total market capitalization of $1.9 trillion. BTC is moving even closer to the $100,000 mark but continues to struggle to pass this resistance level. Crypto analysts commented that since Trump’s election, Ethereum has outmatched Bitcoin as the leading altcoin has reached new heights, riding on the overall optimism in the cryptocurrency sector. Reports illustrated that the Ethereum ETFs hit an all-time high of $1.1 billion in net inflows, saying that ETH is keeping up with the Bitcoin surge. Analysts noted that a net inflow of $333 million was recorded from nine Ether EFTs on November 29, adding that BlackRock led the charge wherein its ETHA had a total inflow of $2.1 billion. In the last week of November, SosoValue revealed that Ether ETFs garnered more than $466 million while having an outflow of $71.60 million in the prior week. Moreover, its price also increased by 48% in the last seven days. According to CoinGecko, the largest altcoin is being traded at $3,619 with a total market capitalization of more than $435 billion. In a post, digital asset analyst Markus Thielen suggested that Bitcoin’s supply might be drying up, noting that there is a dwindling Bitcoin balance on cryptocurrency exchanges. “Unlike late summer, when a sudden large inflow temporarily replenished exchange balances, this time, no additional inventory is appearing,” Thielen said on LinkedIn. The analyst said that Bitfinex, Binance, and Coinbase are the only crypto exchanges with sufficient Bitcoin in their inventories. Some reports suggested that the latest inflows into BTC are significant, and a bearish outlook might be premature. However, he noted that the crypto’s market capitalization is growing but its dominance waning down by 60% to 56%. Could this indicate that the altcoin season has arrived?

Title: Salinas Loses $5.5 Billion in a Day on Elektra Slump
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/salinas-loses-5-5-billion-in-a-day-on-elektra-slump-11733177662836.html
Time Published: 2024-12-02T22:14:22Z

(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Grupo Elektra tumbled 71% on Monday as trading resumed following a months-long halt, wiping off $5.5 billion from the fortune of billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego and pushing him out of the world’s top 500 wealthiest list. Shares of Elektra ended the session at 274.27 pesos per share compared to a 944.95 price where they last traded in July. Bolsa Mexicana de Valores said in a filing early Monday that it had been asked by regulators to let the stock trade even it blew past circuit breakers in the premarket auction — a mechanism which had barred it from resuming for days. Trading resumed even as Elektra said in a statement before market open that it had a court order keeping it blocked, adding that anyone dealing in the stock could be held responsible. “It is our obligation to reiterate that the resumption of trading in these, in addition to causing irreparable damage, could involve shares obtained improperly,” Grupo Salinas spokesman Luciano Pascoe said in a response to questions. 4-Month Halt Salinas himself had triggered the trading halt back in July, alleging he was a victim of potential fraud. His lawyers claimed a creditor had used the company’s shares to fund a $110 million loan, and later discovered most of the shares appeared to have been sold, pushing the stock price down. The rest, they say, was pocketed by the creditor, who has denied any wrongdoing. “It is important to remember that any eventual consequences are the exclusive responsibility of their buyers and sellers,” Pascoe said. After a month of no trading, Elektra got booted from the country’s main stock gauge. Now, it’s facing selling pressure from exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock Inc and The Vanguard Group, which need to dump shares. Volume on Monday surged to a more than seven year high. Officials had been trying for days to lift the halt, but the low bids immediately triggered a market circuit breaker designed to limit volatility, suspending it again. Lawyers for Salinas had argued to keep the stock from trading, saying it would cause “irreparable damage to the company.” $5.5 Billion Salinas’ nearly 75% stake in the company is now worth about $2.2 billion, down from $7.6 billion on Friday. That gives him a net worth of $5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Salinas, 69, has long been the third-wealthiest Mexican behind Carlos Slim and German Larrea. Heading into this week, he was ranked the world’s 262nd-richest-person by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. With the plunge, Salinas is no longer on the list of the 500 wealthiest people. Beyond Salinas’ stake, ETFs and other index-tracking funds hold around 4 million in shares out of 47.8 million in free floating shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the slump is vaporizing Salinas’ wealth on paper — which had been a key fixture of his ability to take loans out against Elektra’s value — it could make a bid to de-list the shares easier. Elektra said last week it would hold a meeting in late December to discuss taking the company private. --With assistance from Carolina Wilson.

Title: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Among Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Top Stock Picks Heading Into 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Ken Fisher's other top stock picks. Ken Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors. Fisher said, "I've gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn't believe, and don't believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused." Besides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors. In the past year, Fisher's firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher's firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips. READ ALSO: 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 99% of Billionaire Abrams’ Portfolio is in These 11 Stocks. Even though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there's no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn't predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better. "Bull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly," Ken Fisher said. Ken Fisher's portfolio is heavily invested in the "magnificent seven" stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions. "If you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find. I think that will continue to be the case because I am optimistic on the market as a whole moving forward", Fisher said in a video interview. Our Methodology We looked through Fisher Asset Management's portfolio to find Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks for 2025. We focused on his biggest investments and ranked the stocks from smallest to largest based on the firm's stake at the end of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Fisher Asset Management’s Equity Stake: $8.32 Billion Number of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes: 286 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a company that built its name as a retail giant on the sale of consumer products and advertising. It has since diversified its business empire with investments in cloud computing and the sale of electronic devices. About 38% of online sales in the US happen in the company's online store. Consequently, the company is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of e-commerce industry sales. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is succeeding in fending off competition in online sales. The launch of ultra-cheap products through Amazon Haul has strengthened its edge in attracting more sales through the mobile-only marketplace. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also boasts the largest cloud computing unit. Amazon Web Services is emerging as a key growth and profit driver amid the digital revolution. Grandview Research expects the cloud market to grow by about 21% annually by 2030. Likewise, AMZN should be the biggest beneficiary as it controls 33% market share in the segment. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also invests in artificial intelligence solutions to enhance its cloud computing solutions. Consequently, AWS sales rose by 19% in the third quarter to $27.5 billion. The increase came as the company rolled out new services, improvements, and solutions for its cloud unit and e-commerce site. Parnassus Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended the quarter slightly down, so our underweight position contributed to relative return. We added the stock after the share price declined significantly, and the timing of the purchase proved beneficial: after we initiated the position, shares rebounded strongly as sentiment around the consumer improved.” Overall AMZN ranks 4th on our list of Ken Fisher's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. The debate around AI systems hitting a “data wall” or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said: “All it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it’s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI’s Alexander Wang to Anthropic’s Dario Amodei to Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi weighing in.” Jensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said: “A foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it’s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we’re learning, however, is that it’s not enough that we’ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.” Read Huang’s comments in detail here. Bosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said: “…..also acknowledge that this alone isn’t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). manaemedia / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279 Barclays recently highlighted what Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) could gain in the search market in certain scenarios of the outcome of the DoJ’s case against Google. “With Bing being a small part of the Microsoft top-line (5% of total revenue in FY24), the ramifications of any developments here seem to have been largely ignored based on our investor discussions, particularly with many software investors not having the context of the ongoing trial,” analyst Raimo Lenschow wrote in a note to clients. “However, following the Department of Justice’s long-awaited Proposed Final Judgment, we think that Microsoft investors should pay closer attention to any final rulings that come from the case.” Lenschow, who has an Overweight rating and a $475 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), noted that if the remedies include ending revenue-sharing agreements between Google and other parties, or if Google starts syndicating its search offering, Bing could gain market share. This might force Google to make some of its technology stack available to partners and offer search text ads for one year to U.S. partners while keeping just 10% of gross revenue. “In tandem with this, Google is only allowed to syndicate 25% of search text ads, meaning that partners (like an Apple) would need to backfill their remaining search ads either through their own tech stack or through a new partner like Bing,” Lenschow added. “This, in theory, would open up a unique opportunity for Microsoft to capture share for a period of time.” Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. The company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the quarter, shares detracted from performance after Microsoft reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter revenue growth in its Azure cloud segment. Additionally, management’s fiscal first[1]quarter 2025 Azure revenue guidance came in slightly below estimates. Despite this shortfall, management highlighted that AI contributed 7% to cloud growth, up from 6% last quarter and 3% a year ago. We continue to believe that Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain a leadership role in AI, given its innovative approach and significant growth potential.” Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

On Monday, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reiterated its equal-weight rating on AT&T Inc. (NYSE:NYSE:T) with a price target of $19.00. The rating comes as AT&T prepares to host its Analyst and Investor Day on Tuesday in Dallas, which will be webcast live starting at 2pm ET. In a note to clients, analysts at Morgan Stanley detailed their expectations of the event. The focus of the event is set to be on the company’s investment-led growth strategy and capital allocation plans. "We expect the company to announce a new buyback program, and an expanded fiber build program, while the company may provide some preliminary financial expectations for 2025," Morgan Stanley said in its note to investors. AT&T's stock has seen a 16% increase in the past three months, outperforming Verizon (NYSE:VZ)'s 6% despite recent rises in long-term interest rates. AT&T's stock currently trades at just over 10 times earnings and offers a free cash flow (FCF) yield of over 10%, with the company proposing a competitive dividend yield of approximately 5%. Morgan Stanley expects AT&T to reveal a multi-year buyback program in the $5-8 billion range per year, which could equate to about 6% of shares outstanding over two years. For 2024, AT&T has guided to approximately $17-18 billion in free cash flow, which includes around $3 billion from DTV. Dividends are expected to be just over $8 billion. The firm suggests that AT&T is likely to maintain leverage at around the 2.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA range over time, aiming to reach their net debt to adjusted EBITDA target of 2.5x by the first half of 2025. In terms of fiber expansion, Morgan Stanley expects AT&T to extend its current in-region fiber build target from 30 million to 40-45 million consumer and business locations by the end of 2025. The company has noted the benefits of convergence between fiber and wireless services, with about 40% of fiber customers also subscribing to AT&T wireless services. Additional details are anticipated regarding the Gigapower Fiber joint venture with Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), which initially targeted passing 1.5 million fiber locations, as well as other fiber partnerships out of region. While formal guidance for 2025 may not be provided at the upcoming meeting, AT&T is expected to discuss key trends for the next year, including resilient wireless service revenue growth and the potential for consistent growth in consumer wireline backed by fiber. Morgan Stanley is also interested in AT&T's cost efficiency opportunities, particularly those leveraging artificial intelligence for productivity, which could contribute to modest EBITDA growth in 2025.

Title: Form and function – Brian Maye on architect and novelist James Franklin Fuller
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irish-diary/2024/12/02/form-and-function-brian-maye-on-architect-and-novelist-james-franklin-fuller/
Time Published: 2024-12-02T18:55:00Z
Full Content:
James Franklin Fuller, who died 100 years ago on December 8th, could well be described as a renaissance man. A distinguished architect, he was also a successful novelist and published on history, archaeology, antiquarianism and genealogy. He was born near Derryquin, Co Kerry, in 1835 (date and month unknown) into a family of minor gentry; his father, Thomas, was a landowner, and his mother, Frances Bland, was of Derryquin Castle. Tutored by James Murphy, who later conducted the Crown case in the trial for the Phoenix Park murders, he then attended boarding school at Blackrock, Cork, where he befriended Thomas Newenham Deane, afterwards a well-known architect. Moving to England in 1850, he worked as an actor for a time and was a mechanical-engineering apprentice for a year before studying architecture in London and Manchester. In London, he contributed literary work to journals such as Truth, Dark Blue and Once a Week, and joined volunteer regiments while working in Manchester, Sheffield and London. In 1860, he married Helen Prospére, a descendant of one of Napoleon’s generals, and returned to Ireland. Appointed architect of the Irish Ecclesiastical Commissioners (a government Church of Ireland agency), he oversaw the building and renovation of churches all over Ireland. When the Church of Ireland was disestablished (1869), he used the compensation he received to set up practice in Dublin on Brunswick (now Pearse) Street. An early commission was the restoration of Annaghmore House, near Collooney, Co Sligo, which was carried out “in an unusually restrained classical style”, according to the Historic Houses of Ireland website. The Church of Ireland Representative Church Body had replaced the IEC and he was fortunate to be appointed its architect and continued to work for it for 40 years. Commissions for new churches followed as well as for important restoration work on cathedrals but he also received commissions for secular buildings such as Dalkey town hall, the maternity hospital at the Coombe and several schools in Dublin. Linde Lunney and Andrew O’Brien, who wrote the entry on him in the Dictionary of Irish Biography, described him as “the leading architect of country houses of his day” and list Kylemore Castle (Galway), Ashford Castle (Mayo) and Tinakilly House (Wicklow) as among his restorations, as well as Farmleigh House in the Phoenix Park. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland and a member of the Royal Irish Academy. For his published fiction, Fuller used the pseudonym “Ignotus” and, occasionally, “An Old Boy”. In his three-volume novel, Culmshire Folk (1873), the Scotsman newspaper detected similarities to George Eliot’s work, which was quite a tribute. Lunney and O’Brien believed that “the strongest part of his writing was dialogue and character observation”. Other stories published by him were John Orlebar, Billy, or The Young Idea, Chronicles of Westerly and Doctor Quodlibet. An article in this newspaper by Gemma Tipton (October 22nd, 2015) described his fiction as “melodramatic”. He also published extensively in local history, antiquarianism and genealogy, in such periodicals as the Journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, the Kerry Archaeological Magazine and the Genealogist, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland and of the Society of Antiquaries of London. His memoir, entitled Omniana: The Autobiography of an Irish Octogenarian, published in 1916, “is a rambling but engaging recollection of a varied life”, according to Lunney and O’Brien. In it “he gives some space to outlining his ancestry to prove his pretensions to the aristocracy, tracing his family back to Charlemagne – which turned out to be true”, The Irish Times article referred to above tells us. Curiously, there is little reference in Omniana to his architectural achievements but The Irish Times article just cited may have the explanation: “The things that mattered most to Fuller – pedigree, social connections, a ‘gentlemanly’ disdain for the necessity of working for a living (which perhaps accounts for his attitude to filing and the relative lack of any architectural musings or descriptions in his autobiography) – are ironically perhaps the most potent reasons why he is relatively forgotten today.” He died at his residence on Eglinton Road, Donnybrook and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery. His wife, son and daughter survived him; three other children predeceased him. His wife died eight months after him and on their gravestone in Mount Jerome is carved: “Their spirits departed in peace with the viaticum of a conscience void of enmity of offence.” The actress Peggy Cummins was his great-granddaughter. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar These Days. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) stands against other top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. The debate around AI systems hitting a “data wall” or plateau is heating up in the tech industry with many arguing that the performance of AI models is not showing signs of further improvement amid a lack of quality inputs, causing scaling issues in the industry. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa recently discussed this debate in a program and said: “All it feels like anyone is talking about right now in tech is this debate over scaling laws and a data wall, which continues to rage in Silicon Valley. This is the idea that more data and bigger models will always lead to better AI, with some arguing that progress has peaked or is starting to plateau. Put another way, it’s a debate over a core assumption in AI that could have massive implications for the industry, from valuations to the GPUs powering it, and of course, the Nvidia story. I was at the Newcomer AI conference yesterday here in San Francisco. It was the theme of the day, with everyone from Scale AI’s Alexander Wang to Anthropic’s Dario Amodei to Databricks’ Ali Ghodsi weighing in.” Jensen Huang was also asked about the issue of AI systems hitting a data wall and possible scaling issues in a latest earnings call. Here is what he said: “A foundation model pre-training scaling is intact and it’s continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we’re learning, however, is that it’s not enough that we’ve now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling.” Read Huang’s comments in detail here. Bosa mentioned some other tech leaders pushing back against the idea of AI hitting a data wall and said: “…..also acknowledge that this alone isn’t enough to push AI further, and progress will come from post-training scaling, which is the development of AI applications on top of existing models. He and others say this will still require massive amounts of compute power.

With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Copyright: gmast3r / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 116 Deutsche Bank recently increased its price target for Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) after conducting research around the company’s Agentforce product. “Partners we spoke with noted strong momentum in Data Cloud, particularly with multi-cloud customers, along with high interest in Einstein 1 for Sales and Service clouds. Finance and Healthcare sectors were also mentioned as positives within industry clouds,” analyst Brad Zelnick wrote in a note. He raised his price target for Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) to $365 from $325 and maintained his Buy rating. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “In the third quarter, we purchased new positions in Apple and Oracle and eliminated our small positions in Nike and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM). We exited our position in Salesforce to fund better opportunities in Shopify and MSCI. Salesforce is seeing slower revenue growth than we would have expected, given the weakening macroeconomic environment. Furthermore, since its core end markets in customer relationship management (“CRM”) and Service are fairly mature, a lower growth level versus our expectations could persist for some time.” Overall, CRM ranks 6th on our list of top AI stocks on investors’ radar these days. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Morgan Stanley Analyst Says Meta Platforms (META) ‘Farthest Along’ in AI Monetization

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in December. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stands against other trending AI stocks to watch in December. Jared Cohen, Goldman Sachs president of global affairs, co-head of the Goldman Sachs Global Institute, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that amid rising data center-driven energy demand because of AI, the US would need to collaborate with other countries via “diplomacy.” “If you look at data centers for cloud workloads versus data centers for AI workloads, data centers for AI workloads require ultra-high density. They need a concentrated power source, and so intermittent power like wind and solar doesn’t fit the bill. You need base load power, so I think nuclear, coal, and natural gas are necessary, and we have plenty of that in the US. The problem is we can’t transport it from where it is through multiple jurisdictions because of the ‘not in my backyard’ issue. So, the US is going to need some kind of overflow option if it wants to continue leading in this space. There’s not a single geography that I would say represents a panacea to this problem.” Answering a question about whether the return to relatively cheaper and reliable energy sources like coal could satisfy the AI-driven energy demand, the analyst said the US would still need to look beyond just relying on its own sources because the need for power is huge. “We’re going to have to probably bring another 35-plus gigawatts of power online relative to the 17 gigawatts of power that are already online feeding these data centers in just the next couple of years. That’s not enough, that’s not enough time. So, you know, the US is going to continue to lead in the space, but it’s not going to be able to lead on its own.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are getting investors’ attention on the back of latest news.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Bloomua / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 235 Brian Nowak, head of U.S. internet research at Morgan Stanley, while talking to CNBC in a latest program explained how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is using AI for monetization of its huge user base and said the company is “farthest along” in AI monetization. “Meta continues to be the company showing the most early signals on how to monetize generative AI and GPU-enabled machine learning. They are building better models to analyze all of their data more effectively. As they analyze more data, time spent per user is growing off already large numbers. You already have 30 to 40 minutes per user per day across Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms, and that time is growing. On top of that, the way they monetize this time through more relevant ads—ads with higher click-through rates that actually drive more transactions—is also improving. So, when we think about this early generative AI cycle, Meta continues to be the company farthest along in building new models to better analyze its leading first-party data, drive more engagement, and monetize that engagement more effectively.” Despite posting strong quarterly results, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shares fell as rising AI-related expenses yet again spooked investors about ROI. However, Meta platforms (NASDAQ:META) bulls believe Zuckerberg’s plan to keep spending on AI is totally justified. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is driving usage and ads revenue by improving its algorithms and user experience thanks to AI. Meta also reported strong adoption of its Llama AI model, attracting over 500 million monthly active users across its platforms. This progress positions Meta well for robust profitability in the next two years as it scales its AI infrastructure. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s advancements in Reels and WhatsApp are helping manage CapEx growth as the company strives to stay competitive in AI. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s clear monetization strategy for its generative AI, especially with Llama3, makes it a strong contender against rivals like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s substantial user base of 3.3 billion provides a data and distribution edge that could capture a significant share of the GenAI market. Although short-term investors may be concerned about Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)’s increased AI spending, its forward P/E ratio of 24x, based on FY 2025 EPS estimates of $24.62, makes it the second-most affordable big tech stock, after Google, within its peer group (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google). According to some estimates, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is on track to potentially achieve $25-26 per share in EPS next year, slightly above the consensus estimate. Factors such as a strong U.S. economy, lower inflation, favorable online ad pricing, and AI investments could fuel earnings growth. If Meta’s valuation aligns with the industry average P/E of 26.6x, shares could reach over $600. Alger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world’s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from advertising, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal second quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings beating analyst estimates. Management also raised their fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, citing improved advertising monetization. CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that AI has played a key role in these successes, as the company is leveraging AI to enhance targeting, measurement, ranking, and ad delivery. Higher user engagement, driven by video ranking, content recommendations, and single video views, has also supported growth. Additionally, the optimization of ad placements within videos and automation of ad campaigns are further boosting monetization.” Overall, MU ranks 2nd on our list of trending AI stocks to watch in December. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Republican AGs File Suit Against Asset Managers Alleging Coal Repression Scheme
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/republican-ags-file-suit-against-asset-managers-alleging-coal-repression-scheme/
Time Published: 2024-12-02T17:47:14Z
Full Content:
Eleven states filed a complaint against BlackRock Inc., State Street Corp. and the Vanguard Group Inc. for allegedly both working to constrict coal markets through anti-competitive practices and misleading investors in funds that do not take environment, social and governance factors into consideration. Attorney generals from the 11 states filed the complaint in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, on Wednesday, with lead representation from the Buzbee Law Firm, based in Austin, Texas. The states allege that the asset managers took “substantial” holdings in U.S. coal companies, which they leveraged to press the companies to focus on green energy goals, such as reducing coal output by more than half by 2030. The plaintiffs also claim that the asset managers used positions in organizations such as the Climate Action 100+ and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative to signal their work to reduce coal output, which the plaintiffs allege led to cost increases for coal-powered electricity. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  “For the past four years, America’s coal producers have been responding not to the price signals of the free market, but to the commands of Larry Fink, BlackRock’s Chairman and CEO, and his fellow asset managers,” the complaint states in its opening. “As demand for the electricity Americans need to heat their homes and power their businesses has gone up, the supply of the coal used to generate that electricity has been artificially depressed—and the price has skyrocketed.” The lawsuit is led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and includes the attorneys general of Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming. The plaintiffs are seeking billions in damages, according to a press release by the Buzbee law firm. In the complaint, the attorney generals also call on the asset managers to divest their investments in coal company stock and for the firms to be restrained from any further “deceptive, or misleading acts or practices” related to the positioning of funds. BlackRock said via emailed statement that its holdings in energy companies are regularly reviewed by regulators and that “we make these investments on behalf of our clients, and our focus is on delivering them financial returns. The suggestion that BlackRock has invested money in companies with the goal of harming those companies is baseless and defies common sense. This lawsuit undermines Texas’ pro-business reputation and discourages investments in the companies consumers rely on.” State Street wrote in a statement that the firm “acts in the long-term financial interests of investors with a focus on enhancing shareholder value. As long-term capital providers, we have a mutual interest in the long-term success of our portfolio companies. This lawsuit is baseless and we look forward to presenting the facts through the legal process.” Vanguard did not respond to request for comment. Per the complaint, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street held $108.787 billion, $101.119 billion and $35.736 billion in coal investments, respectively, as of February 15, 2022. Clayton Act For its key argument, the complaint cites Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which prohibits the acquisition of stock when “the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition.” By having substantial holdings in coal companies, the complaint alleges that the asset managers “acquired the power to influence the policies of these competing companies and bring about a substantial lessening of competition in the markets for coal.” According to the attorneys general, as publicly traded coal companies have reduced output, smaller, private companies have increased production. Those firms, according to the complaint, struggle to meet the demand and cannot get the financing and loans to needed to increase capacity. The complaint details the companies in question, such as Peabody Energy, NACCO Industries and Warrior Met Coal, and the percent of shares held by the asset managers: 30.43%, 10.85% and 31.62%, respectively, as of June 30. The plaintiffs refer extensively to public comments by high-level executives at the asset managers, including Fink, regarding the promotion of efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and increase the market share of the clean energy industry. The complaint also notes stock voting positions the firms took that allegedly supported reductions in output and divulges information regarding climate disclosures. Clean Energy Initiatives The complaint refers to all three firms joining the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative, intended to reduce the CO2 emissions from coal more than 58% between 2020 and 2030. Vanguard withdrew from that initiative in 2022. In addition, the complaint notes that BlackRock and State Street joined the Climate Action 100+, an organization whose stated goal is to reduce coal output by more than half by 2030. BlackRock and State Street eventually withdrew from the Climate Action 100+; Vanguard never joined it. Climate Action 100+ has more than 600 signatories, representing more than $68 trillion in assets under management. The Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative represents more than 325 signatories with $57.5 trillion in AUM. In the complaint, the attorneys general also argue that BlackRock, in particular, misled investors who were seeking to invest in ”non-ESG” funds by using those holdings to advance its climate goals. “In addition to joining with the other two major institutional asset managers to bring about a reduction in the output of coal, Defendant BlackRock went further—actively deceiving investors about the nature of its funds,” the complaint states. “Rather than inform investors that it would use their shareholdings to advance climate goals, BlackRock consistently and uniformly represented its non-ESG funds would be dedicated solely to enhancing shareholder value.” Last year, 26 attorneys general filed a lawsuit seeking to overthrow the Department of Labor’s final rule permitting ESG factors to be used when selecting retirement plan investments. That lawsuit was dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Northern Texas but is currently under appeal to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Is Talking About These 10 Stocks Heading Into December. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) stands against other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about as heading into December. Jim Cramer in a recent program talked about President-elect Donald Trump’s Treasury pick and highlighted his enthusiasm for the stock market. “On the other hand, President Trump was all about Nielsen ratings when he was on The Apprentice, and as president, he repeatedly said, The Dow Jones Industrial Average all-time high, and the S&P 500 were his new Nielsen ratings. He likes being rated, he likes to win, and he wants that stock market to go up to ratify his performance. That’s a big reason why the market exploded higher when he won.” Cramer also discussed Trump’s Treasury pick Scott Bessent’s possible 3-3-3 plan that calls for bringing the budget deficit down to 3% of GDP, 3% growth and producing 3 million barrels of oil per day. Jim Cramer said he is skeptical about Elon Musk’s efficiency plans in the upcoming Trump administration. “Can there be a legitimate top-to-bottom change in the efficiency of our government and its associated costs? Count me as a skeptic about any attempt to change the government, including Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s Doge thing, because every penny of spending in the budget has a constituency. When you add all those proposed cutbacks together, you face tremendous opposition. But that’s not the point. What matters is that this Treasury Secretary-designate is a serious person.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he is talking about. With each stock we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A successful business person confidently managing their finances on a mobile device. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 36 Jim Cramer in a Mad Dash episode on CNBC sounded bullish on Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) because of the company’s success in attracting younger Americans who are interested in investing: “This is the king, okay? These guys have the next generation. The other guys have the people who watch fire shows and hospital shows and detective shows. These guys have the young; they watch TikTok, they watch YouTube, and they watch their handhelds and trade crypto.” Can HOOD shares go higher in the future? In the latest earnings call with analysts, Robinhood’s CFO, Jason Warnick, highlighted the company’s significant growth in recent quarters, which has pushed it to an all-time high of 2.2 million Robinhood Gold subscribers. This growth, he noted, is part of Robinhood’s unique approach. Few other brokers manage to charge a subscription fee for using their platform. Robinhood Gold plays a crucial role in monetizing the company’s user base, but it’s only one aspect of its broader strategy. “And one of the most exciting new parts of the Gold program is our Robinhood Gold card. When I’ve talked to Robinhood customers in recent months, the Gold card almost always comes up. If someone has it, they love it. If they don’t have it, they want to know when they’re going to get it. And I hear you. We’re working hard to increase the rollout, but we’re also being patient and carefully studying customer behavior as we grow so that we manage credit risk to profitably scale over time. While it’s still early, I wanted to share some emerging data from our 100,000 Gold card customers. First, customers love the Gold card. App store ratings continue to be five out of five with over 10,000 five-star reviews. Customers tell us they love the metal card, the digital app, and of course, the 3% rewards,” the company’s CEO Vlad Tenev said on the call. Read the entire call transcript here. Recently, Robinhood expanded its reach by acquiring TradePMR, a firm specializing in brokerage and custodian services for Registered Investment Advisors (RIA), in a deal valued at approximately $300 million. The move is seen as part of Robinhood’s push into the retirement account market. As of Q2 2024, the Investment Company Institute reported around $40 trillion in retirement investment assets in the U.S. Robinhood’s estimated forward revenue growth stands at 26.79% year-over-year, nearly 393.55% above the sector median of 5.43%. Overall, HOOD ranks 7th on our list of stocks Jim Cramer is talking about as heading into December. While we acknowledge the potential of HOOD, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HOOD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance Tumbles as Altcoins Rumble: Crypto Daybook Americas

In the coming weeks, this daily update will replace the First Mover Americas newsletter, and arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin is starting the week on a despondent note, trading 2% lower at $95,000 amid risk-off sentiment in traditional markets. European stocks are falling and the euro is diving against the dollar as concern the French government is on the verge of collapse pushes its bond yields to levels matching those of debt-ridden Greece. BTC's decline follows a failed attempt to break through the multimillion-dollar wall of sell orders near $100,000 over the weekend and MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor's bitcoin presentation to Microsoft. Still, bulls shouldn't lose hope just yet, because the supply scarcity is real, with nearly 75% of bitcoin classified as illiquid and less than 14% in centralized exchanges, according to Andre Dragosch of Bitwise. There's chatter about countries adopting BTC as a strategic reserve, with a Middle Eastern nation potentially unveiling something big at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week that runs Dec. 9-12. The noise could get louder as the event draws close. Ether's technical analysis is particularly bullish, reminiscent of BTC's positioning in mid-October, which was signaling a massive rally even before the U.S. elected crypto-friendly Donald Trump as president. Market flows are on the same page. On Friday, net inflows into nine ether ETFs listed in the U.S. hit nearly $333 million. That's even more than the BTC funds' $320 million. Talk about the change in market leadership. In addition, ETH whales have snapped up ETH worth $5.7 billion in 20 days, according to IntoTheBlock. Meanwhile, XRP has surged over 27% in just 24 hours, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value and pushing Tether's USDT to fourth place. The rally was accompanied by record volumes in South Korea, indicating strong retail participation. While a surge of 350% in four weeks may look overstretched, that's not necessarily the case. XRP's market value-to-realized value (MVRV) ratio, a popular metric modeled alongside the price-to-book ratio in equities and tracked by Santiment, has bounced only to its lifetime average, meaning prices need to rise more before we can start talking about overvaluation. On the macro front, this week's focus is the U.S. ISM non-manufacturing PMI on Wednesday, along with Friday's payrolls and average hourly earnings report. If the employment component and wage growth exceed expectations, the dollar could get a lift while trimming Fed rate-cut bets. Additionally, there's talk of more easing from China, though the impact of earlier measures has been downplayed. Stay alert! By Oliver Knight HyperLiquid’s native token, HYPE, hit the market last week to become one of the most profitable airdrops of the year. It tripled in price over the weekend after debuting at a $1 billion market cap. The token is now trading at $8.57 after touching a record high of $9.79. Unlike many other generic native tokens that offer utility through governance votes, HYPE can be staked to secure HyperBFT, the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm that powers the HyperLiquid exchange. It is also being used as the primary token for paying transaction fees on the network. True to its ticker, the token garnered notable attention among crypto enthusiasts on X (the so-called Crypto Twitter community) with almost all of the well-known influencers mentioning, recommending and occasionally scrutinizing it. The bull case for HYPE is in the tokenomics because supply is skewed toward the community as opposed to venture capitalists and early investors. As a result, it is trading more like a meme coin with a viral following without the risk of supply suppression by anyone who bought in a funding round at a cheaper price. Quant trader Flood, who goes under the X account @ThinkingUSD, wrote that they were “adding huge” under $4 on the day of release. Since then trading terminal Insilico announced it was strategically accumulating a HYPE reserve, allocating 25% of weekly revenue. BTC's dominance rate has slipped below an ascending trendline that tracks its year-to-date rise. The breakdown points to a continued investor preference for altcoins over bitcoin.

We recently compiled a list of the 9 Trending AI Stocks On Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks. xAI founder Elon Musk has raised billions in funding for his AI startup in the past few months. Recent comments from the eccentric billionaire suggest that he is planning to launch an AI-powered gaming studio through xAI that will rival the game studios that are owned by massive corporations. He made the remarks in a post on social networking platform X. The startup has ballooned in valuation over the past few years. The Grok developer recently raised $5 billion in new funding, bringing the valuation of the startup to $50 billion, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Just like xAI, other AI startups are also turning heads in the venture capital world. For example, tech news platform TechCrunch reports that Pathway, an AI startup, just raised a $10 million Seed round to build live AI systems that, the company claims, think and learn in real-time as humans do. Per the report, the Pathway offering includes what it calls infrastructure components that power live AI systems, feeding on structured and unstructured data, meaning that enterprise AI platforms can make decisions on up-to-date knowledge.

Latest reports, published by tech news platform TechRadar, contend that the chipmaker will reveal the RTX 5090 cards at the CES 2025 show in January. Per the report, the AI-capable RTX 5090 cards would be a GPU targeted at professionals, rather than PC gamers, to justify a possible price hike. The RTX 5090 will reportedly feature a 22.2% increase in die size over the RTX 4090, which translates to better performance but a heftier price tag.

Title: These 5 ‘Special’ Dividends Are More Than One-Hit Wonders
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/12/02/these-5-special-dividends-are-more-than-one-hit-wonders/
Time Published: 2024-12-02T12:30:00Z
Full Content:
Piggy bank with business stuff, business and finance concept, vintage color tone. Today we’ll discuss a 5.4% dividend that actually annualizes to 7%. A 5.7% payer that really dishes 12.4%. And even a headline 15% yield that is understated because the company handed out 16.1% last year. Wait. What? These “typos” fool the mainstream financial websites. We are discussing special dividends today. Payouts that are awarded as a bonus to regular quarterly dividends. Only a select few firms dish specials. Sometimes, it’s thanks to a sudden influx of money. Let’s take billboard and transit display giant Outfront Media (OUT) which sold its Canadian business for C$410 million in cash in June. Fast forward to November, and Outfront announced a massive 75-cent special dividend on top of its 30-cent quarterly dividend, vaulting its 12-month yield from a healthy 6.3% to a mouth-watering 10.2%. This, of course, was a one-off special—not one that we are looking to bank on annually. We want “the other” type of special payer. The company that says it’s a one-off, but makes the payment every single year. These tend to fall into one of two camps: These are the stocks that can pay us more specials in the future. Their current yields are often understated today, because specials don’t count in the annual yield calculations. Today we’ll review five generous special payers. Mainstream financial websites list their yields between 5.4 and 15.0%. But they actually paid 7.0% to 16.1% over the past year. Let’s see if history is on pace to repeat or, at least, rhyme. Ford (F) Listed Dividend Yield: 5.4% Dividend Yield With Specials: 7.0% Ford (F) hardly needs an introduction—it’s an American automotive pioneer, and its F-Series has held the title of world’s best-selling truck for nearly a half-century. But Ford doesn’t necessarily have the world’s happiest shareholders. On a pure share-price basis, Ford—across a number of ups and downs—is effectively flat since 1994. That’s zero price returns—if anyone has held for two decades, their only gains as of right now have come from the dividend. That dividend, however, is mighty interesting. Ford temporarily suspended its dividend in 2020 as COVID reared its ugly head, then brought it back at 10 cents per share for a few quarters before returning it to the pre-pandemic 15-cent level. However, instead of just raising its regular past 15 cents, Ford has spent the past two Februarys announcing special dividends—first 63 cents in 2023, then a more modest 18 cents in 2024. That’s part of a stated plan to distribute 40%-50% of free cash flow every year—and if the regular doesn’t do the job, shareholders will get a supplemental payout. (Ford’s FCF in 2023 was $6.8 billion; it’s guiding for $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion this year, so we could assume a decently higher special in 2025 compared to 2024.) But we need more than a nice dividend. And on that front, it’s tough to be overly positive. Ford’s earnings are expected to decline by about 10% this year before leveling out in 2025. The company’s traditional, hybrid and fleet vehicles are generally doing well, though its electric-vehicle arm continues to struggle and deliver thick (albeit shrinking) losses. Meanwhile, while Ford should reach its expected $2 billion in cost cuts this year, warranty costs and inflation are still holding the automaker back. But F shares are cheap, at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of around 6.5, and a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) of 0.65. (A stock with a PEG below 1.0 is considered undervalued.) Equinor (EQNR) Listed Dividend Yield: 5.7% Dividend Yield With Specials: 12.4% Equinor (EQNR) is little-known to most American investors, though it will occasionally pop up on the radar of anyone seeking out great yields in the energy patch. This Norwegian energy firm is actually two-thirds state-owned, has operations in roughly 30 countries (though most of its production comes from the Norwegian Continental Shelf), and produces roughly 2.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day. While it’s heavy in traditional oil and gas operations, Equinor has increasingly delved into renewables and low-carbon solutions, and has pledged to become a net-zero energy company by 2050. It owns a nearly 10% stake in Danish wind firm Orsted, and generated 677 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable power in its most recent quarter. Indeed, its focus on green energy—largely a product of Norway’s more ambitious energy targets—has hamstrung the firm compared to energy majors such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), which are still doggedly investing in traditional energy extraction. Equinor also has one of the most potent special dividends. Indeed, Equinor has paid out “ordinary” and “extraordinary” dividends over the past few years. Its past three specials have been equal to the 35-cent regular distribution, with the fourth coming out to 60 cents per share. All told, those extraordinary dividends have added a whopping 6.7 points to EQNR’s yield. That’s on top of what has been an uber-generous buyback program. But this is where diving into company reports comes in handy. Seeing as how Equinor isn’t exactly a first-to-mind energy stock to most Americans, there hasn’t been much (some, but not much) reporting on that extraordinary dividend floating away. But indeed, a bullet point in the company’s 2023 full-year report noted: “Expect to conclude extraordinary cash dividend after 2024.” The ordinary dividend will not only stay, but EQNR has pledged to grow it by 2 cents per share annually. That should result in a still-nice yield in this Norwegian energy major—but nothing approaching the wild 12.4% its most recent specials have produced. Business development companies (BDCs)—effectively private equity for us regular Joes—are extremely over-represented among companies offering regular-and-supplemental payouts. Among them are: Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX) Listed Dividend Yield: 8.9% Dividend Yield With Specials: 10.0% I’m on record as saying Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX) has “sterling dividend stewardship,” and that’s still the case today. Sixth Street is a flexible provider of funding to middle-market companies, dealing in senior secured loans, mezzanine debt, non-control structured equity and common equity. A quick look at its ideal investment prospects: Its portfolio currently sits at 115 companies spread across 15 “sector franchises,” such as sports/media/entertainment/telecom, credit market strategies, asset-based finance, and real estate. It boasts exciting names like gen-AI provider Sprinklr and parking compliance platform Passport, but also challenged retailers such as J.C. Penney and Bed Bath & Beyond. TSLX has largely been a well-managed BDC, though last quarter, it added a non-accrual (Lithium Technologies) to bring its total to three, representing roughly 2% of investments at fair value. That’s still a low level, however—Sixth Street still has a great track record of delivering high RoE and making intelligent deals. It also has a smart distribution system in which TSLX pays a core dividend, then distributes 50% of net investment income (NII) in excess of that core dividend as supplemental payouts, keeping the BDC from overextending itself. Over the past 12 months, specials have accounted for about 1.1 extra percentage points’ worth of yield. But we pretty much have to overpay to buy shares. TSLX stock routinely trades at a massive premium to net asset value (NAV), and that’s still the case today—its 22% premium puts it among the five most expensive BDCs right now. BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC) Listed Dividend Yield: 15.0% Dividend Yield With Specials: 16.1% BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC) is another BDC, this one externally managed, that invests in the debt of middle-market companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $1.5 billion. TCPC currently has 156 companies in its portfolio, spread across a few dozen industries. But it does have a few heavier concentrations—internet software and services (~14%), software (~14%) and diversified financial services (~13%) earn double-digit weights. Earlier this year, TCPC merged with BlackRock Capital Investment Corp., which I previously mentioned came with a tangible benefit: a 25-basis-point reduction in base management fees, to 1.25%, bringing it a little lower than the industry midpoint. But I was also curious to see whether BlackRock TCP Capital would still keep its special dividends. Yes, I know—what does it matter if TCPC is already doling out a massive 15%? Well, it means that TCPC isn’t necessarily overpromising on its regular dividend. That said, the most recent dividend announcement marked a fifth consecutive regular payout of 34 cents per share, keeping it a penny shy of its pre-COVID levels and raising a little concern that TCPC’s dividend might be plateauing, at least in the short-term. The flip side? We can buy TCPC at a decent discount of 10% to NAV. However, portfolio quality isn’t as ideal as it is with TSLX. Non-accruals are close to 4% at fair value, and watchlist investments increased from 2.6% to 3%. Higher debt costs are weighing on operational performance, too. Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD) Listed Dividend Yield: 9.5% Dividend Yield With Specials: 11.1% Carlyle Secured Lending (CGBD) is another externally managed BDC, and that manager is a subsidiary of multinational asset manager Carlyle Group (CG). CGBD invests primarily in U.S. middle market companies with between $25 million and $100 million in annual EBITDA. Its investments lean heavily toward first-lien debt (68%), though it also works through second-lien debt and equity, and it also holds investment funds. Its 128 portfolio companies cover a couple dozen industries, including healthcare/pharmaceuticals, software, aerospace/defense and leisure products/services. CGBD came public in 2017, but it has spent its short publicly traded life putting up extremely respectable returns, including mammoth outperformance coming out of the pandemic lows. Better still? Investors have been treated to both a growing base dividend (including an 8% raise in 2024), as well as regular supplemental payouts that have boosted yield by 1.6 percentage points over the past year. CGBD is building a stellar track record, but a few pockmarks are emerging. Lower short-term rates are putting downward pressure on its portfolio yield (it declined 70 bps last quarter), NAV per share and net investment income also declined in Q3, and repayments continue to run ahead of originations. Shares are even a little overheated, at a slight premium to NAV. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Why Is Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) Among the Stocks Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Is Crazy About?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Is Crazy About These 15 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) stands against the other stocks Ray Dalio's Bridgewater is crazy about. Ray Dalio, a seasoned global macro investor with over 50 years of experience, founded Bridgewater Associates from his two-bedroom apartment in New York City and led the firm for most of its 47-year history. Over the years, Dalio has been regarded as one of the most influential investors, renowned for accurately predicting major financial trends, including the 2008 financial crisis. TIME magazine recognized him as one of the “100 Most Influential People in the World” for the significant impact of his insights on global macroeconomic policies. Bridgewater Associates has since become one of the world’s largest and most successful hedge funds. Known for its innovative use of macroeconomic analysis to shape investment strategies, particularly in global markets, the firm introduced groundbreaking approaches like the “Pure Alpha” strategy. These methods, designed to perform consistently across varying economic conditions, solidified Dalio’s reputation as a visionary in asset management. Ray Dalio began investing in China in 2023, allocating approximately $3 billion to the market. He has previously suggested that a significant economic restructuring might be necessary to support China’s economy. One of the key challenges is the country’s struggling property sector, where declining prices and developer defaults have heightened economic risks. Speaking at the 2024 Milken Institute Asia Summit in Singapore, Dalio compared the situation to Japan’s economic stagnation beginning in 1990. “They need to have a restructuring of the debt. It’s a very complicated and politically charged thing,” he remarked. Despite these challenges, Dalio highlights the immense potential of the world’s second-largest economy, home to the largest and rapidly growing middle class. Millions of Chinese citizens enter the middle class each year, and if the government can successfully restructure debt in critical sectors like housing, China’s long-term growth prospects remain significant. While the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio has nearly tripled over the past decade—fueling skepticism as sectors like real estate struggle under mounting debt payments—Dalio envisions a “beautiful deleveraging” process. Having coined the term after the 2008 crisis, the billionaire believes this approach could make holding cash in banks unattractive, encouraging investment and economic revitalization. Although concerns about China’s debt burden persist, it’s notable that the country has historically doubled its GDP roughly every five years, and if it manages to address its debt and leverage issues, Dalio’s strategic bet could yield significant returns. That said, the billionaire highlighted the need for caution when investing in China, emphasizing that every country experiences economic cycles with periods of growth and decline. He advised against over-concentrating investments in any single nation, including China, to prevent it from disproportionately influencing a portfolio. He stressed that the critical factor is carefully managing the size and structure of such investments to balance risk and opportunity effectively. Bridgewater Associates recently partnered with State Street’s asset management division to expand into the retail investment market, marking a strategic shift for the hedge fund. Announced on November 19, the collaboration will introduce the "All-Weather" ETF, which leverages one of Ray Dalio’s most renowned strategies. Bridgewater will act as a sub-adviser, providing a tailored daily model portfolio for the fund. This move reflects a growing trend among hedge funds venturing into the $14 trillion ETF market, which has flourished due to its liquidity, tax efficiency, and typically lower fees. Originally developed in 1996 to manage Ray Dalio’s trust assets, the All-Weather strategy employs a risk-parity approach. Instead of concentrating heavily on high-risk assets like stocks, the strategy diversifies across asset classes, including bonds and commodities, using leverage on lower-risk investments to achieve comparable returns with reduced volatility. Our Methodology We examined Bridgwater Associates’ stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm’s stake value in each holding. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician operating an automated semiconductor processing machine with laser accuracy. Bridgewater Associates' Stake Value as of Q3: $225.28 million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 58 Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a leading technology company specializing in equipment and services essential for semiconductor manufacturing, a cornerstone for powering artificial intelligence. The company’s strategic edge stems from the rapid adoption of AI technologies, driving demand for its solutions. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) commands a strong position in the semiconductor equipment market, particularly in the NAND segment, where it holds over 30% market share in capacity upgrades. This dominance positions the company advantageously as demand for memory solutions accelerates. The company's edge is further reinforced by its focus on the "4 Horsemen" technologies: Gate All Around (GAA), Backside Power, Advanced Packaging, and Dry Resist, which are poised to drive growth beyond the pace of the overall wafer fabrication equipment market. Deutsche Bank revised its outlook on Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) on October 24, lowering the price target to $75 from $88 while maintaining a Hold rating. This adjustment followed the release of the company’s earnings report, which showed strong performance driven by robust demand for advanced DRAM technology, solid sales in China, and growth in its Customer Support Business Group, particularly in spares, services, and upgrades. While the short-term results exceeded expectations, Deutsche Bank flagged concerns about the 2025 outlook, noting a lack of detailed guidance and potential headwinds from an economic slowdown in China and a tepid recovery in other markets. The bank now projects Lam Research’s CY25 revenue growth at 10% year-over-year, down from its prior estimate of 16% and below the consensus forecast of 18%. Artisan Partners mentioned Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “The top contributors to performance for the quarter were Alphabet, Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) and Elevance. Lam Research shares rose 10% during the quarter and are up 67% over the past year, primarily due to optimism around the pending investment cycle in semiconductor capital expenditures. Lam is one of the largest equipment manufacturers used to make semiconductor chips. This equipment, commonly referred to as WFE (wafer fabrication equipment), is expected to experience significant growth due to a combination of a cyclical rebound in memory chips and growing demand for new AI-related chips. Lam’s product portfolio is particularly well positioned to benefit from both trends and should grow even faster than the overall market. Its shares now trade at ~30X prior peak earnings, which suggests this dynamic is well understood by the market and is mostly priced in.” Overall LRCX ranks 11th on our list of the stocks Ray Dalio's Bridgewater is crazy about. While we acknowledge the potential of LRCX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LRCX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(Reuters) - Private equity firm EQT and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC will acquire a majority stake in UK's Calisen, more than four years after the smart metering company was taken private by a consortium of investors, they said on Monday. The Financial Times first reported the deal earlier in the day, saying that the stake acquisition was valued at about 4 billion pounds ($5.08 billion). Calisen was acquired in 2020, less than a year after its IPO, by a consortium which included units of BlackRock, Goldman Sachs and Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment for 1.43 billion pounds. EQT and GIC said they would buy the stake from BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners, the infrastructure business of Goldman Sachs Alternatives, and Mubadala Investment. Equitix will remain a minority investor, the new majority owners said. ($1 = 0.7871 pounds) (Reporting by Aatrayee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Varun H K) Sign in to access your portfolio

During the investment conference held in London by the Athens stock exchange and Morgan Stanley, Greek companies will mainly refer to acquisitions that they have already planned this year, but also to their expansion in new markets During the investment conference held in London by the Athens stock exchange and Morgan Stanley, Greek companies will mainly refer to acquisitions that they have already planned this year, but also to their expansion in new markets. They will focus on the disclosure of their investment programs, which will include the construction of new factories and the creation of new products. At the same time, foreign funds will be asked how they will deal with the imposition of tariffs by the Trump administration, while foreigners will want to know how they will respond to the raw materials market. Foreign funds are expected to show particular interest in companies in the energy sector, especially in the country’s transition to a lower-emissions mix. Also, leading international funds will request information on the course of reforms (especially in the judicial system), but also on the progress of investments within the framework of the Recovery Fund. 90% of the capitalization of the Stock Exchange, which currently represents a market value of 85 billion euros, is represented by the presidents and CEOs of the 38 listed companies who have been in London. The listed companies participating are: IPTO, Aegean Airlines, Alpha Bank, Athens stock exchange, Athens International Airport, EYDAP, AustriaCard, Autohellas, Avax, Bank of Cyprus, Cenergy Holdings, Coca Cola HBC, Ellaktor, Eurobank, Fourlis, GEK Terna, Terna Energy, OPAP, OTE, Helleniq Energy, Intrakat, Intralot, Kri Kri, Lamda Development, Metlen, Motor Oil, National Bank, Optima bank, Piraeus Bank, PPA, Profile, PPC, Sarantis, Titan, Trade Estates, Viohalco, ElvalHalcor and Noval Properties.

These are BlackRock, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Fidelity Management & Research, Goldman Sachs, GSO, Hamblin Watsa Investments Council, Invesco, JP Morgan, One Investments, Schroders, Soros Fund Management, Stewart Investors, Trowe Price, TT International and Wellington. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is expected to open the conference on Monday. He will participate in a meeting with institutional investors and talk with the vice-chairman of Morgan Stanley’s Investment Banking, Luigi Rizzo. Energy issues will also be raised. A fireside chat with Evangelos Mytilineos and Michael O’Dwyer, Managing Director for Oil & Gas Investment Banking at MS, will follow. Also scheduled for today is, among other things, a panel with companies that were recently listed on the Athens Stock Exchange, such as Athens International Airport, Optima and Bank of Cyprus. The first day closes with the discussion of the Prime Minister’s economic advisor, Alexis Patelis, with Mike Wilson (Chief Strategist for US Equities and Chief Investment Officer at MS) and Ellen Zentner (Chief Economic Strategy and Head of Thematic and Macroeconomic Investments at Morgan Stanley Wealth). The appointments of listed companies with fund managers and analysts are numerous, between 750-800, while several have also been booked on the sidelines of the conference that will be held at Morgan Stanley’s facilities overlooking Cabot Square and the London docks. This year’s roadshows will conclude on Thursday, December 5, in Geneva, where the Athens stock exchange is organizing an event with the participation of listed companies of the mid-cap. On Monday, December 9, Capital Link is organizing a conference in New York where John Paulson, a close associate of newly elected US President Donald Trump, will be present and speak.

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will open the conference and participate in a closed roundtable discussion with institutional investors, followed by a discussion with Morgan Stanley representatives Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will open the conference and participate in a closed roundtable discussion with institutional investors, followed by a discussion with Morgan Stanley representatives. The investors in Athens are awaiting the prime minister’s official position when asked about the rumors that have circulated in Athens’ stock exchange offices about possible taxation of banks’ profits, a fact that seems to be denied by sources close to the prime minister. The prime minister will be accompanied in London by the head of his Economic Office, Alexis Patellis, who will also participate in a discussion with Morgan Stanley analysts. Within the framework of the two-day conference, three thematic panel discussions will also be held that will focus on Greek banks, the energy sector and the Athens Stock Exchange. The Greek government is placing great emphasis on developing policies that are pro-investment and an environment that will be attractive to strong international capital. The government’s aim is to restructure and strengthen the domestic stock market in order to support and develop businesses through the smooth flow of capital. Foreign funds are expected to show particular interest in energy companies, especially with regard to the country’s transition to a lower-emissions mix. Greece has relied on lignite for decades, while the transition has been implemented over the last two decades, through a mix of natural gas, wind farms and photovoltaics. The meetings with international institutional investors that will be held during the two days of the Roadshow (one-to-one & group meetings) will be attended by high-ranking executives from the following listed companies: IPTO, Aegean Airlines, Alpha Bank, EXAE, Athens International Airport, EYDAP, AustriaCard, Autohellas, Avax, Bank of Cyprus, Cenergy Holdings, Coca Cola HBC, Ellaktor, Eurobank, Fourlis, GEK Terna, Terna Energy, OPAP, OTE, Helleniq Energy, Intrakat, Intralot, KRI KRI, Lamda Development, METLEN, Motor Oil, National Bank, Optima bank, Piraeus Bank, Piraeus Port Authority, Profile, PPC, Sarantis, Titan, Trade Estates, Viohalco, ElvalHalcor and Noval Properties.

Title: The powerlessness of Germany’s next chancellor
URL: https://www.politico.eu/article/powerlessness-germany-next-chancellor-friedrich-merz-olaf-scholz/
Time Published: 2024-12-02T03:00:00Z
Full Content:
Friedrich Merz wants to make Germany great again, but his country is confronting global risks beyond the control of any domestic leader. BERLIN ― Friedrich Merz, Germany’s likely next chancellor, is campaigning on his own version of MAGA, vowing to restore his country’s lost sense of greatness in profoundly insecure times. But given the immense global challenges that Germany now confronts, from industrial decline to war in Europe, Merz may find himself virtually powerless to realize his nostalgic vision of restoring economic growth and a sense of security. “Europe and the world should once again look at Germany with admiration and not with bewilderment,” Merz said in a video message after announcing his candidacy for the chancellor role earlier this year. “I will put all my strength,” he added, into building “a Germany that we can be proud of again.” Merz and his conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) appear set to assume power within months following the November collapse of Germany’s left-leaning three-party coalition. With an early election slated for Feb. 23, Germany’s conservatives are far ahead in the polls on 32 percent support. That puts Merz, a 69-year-old corporate lawyer by trade, on the cusp of fulfilling his longtime dream of becoming chancellor. He could scarcely have imagined, however, that his dream would come true at a time of such peril for Europe — and for Germany in particular. The country is facing vexing economic and political woes while the EU confronts its own array of difficulties — among them the threat of a new debt crisis emanating from France; a rising far right; Russian sabotage and influence operations; and an escalating war in Ukraine. With Germany’s economic engine sputtering and its politics increasingly fractured by the rise of radical parties, Berlin simply lacks the strength to lead Europe out of the morass. The problem for Merz is that despite his ambition and the likelihood of a clear governing mandate, Germany is now uniquely vulnerable to global events beyond the immediate control of any national leader. For decades, the country’s security and prosperity have relied on three pillars: a U.S. defense guarantee; virtually unfettered international trade, allowing its export-oriented economy to flourish; and cheap energy from Russia to bolster German industry. As Merz prepares to take up the reins and vows to lead Germany in a fundamentally new direction, the country lacks a sweeping vision to replace those outmoded pillars. Merz has outlined a conservative vision for how he’ll govern. He plans to cut welfare benefits, sharply reduce the number of asylum-seekers coming to Germany, cut regulations to incentivize more private investment, and make military spending a higher budget priority while maintaining fiscal discipline. But it’s unclear whether those policies, even if realized, would suffice to meet the monumental challenges Germany now faces. Merz’s core mission is to undo the legacy of Angela Merkel, his CDU predecessor who served as chancellor for 16 years. After winning a party power struggle with Merz in 2002, Merkel effectively exiled him from the CDU leadership. After years on the political sidelines, Merz left the German parliament to go into business, eventually chairing the German arm of U.S. investment fund BlackRock. But as Merkel drew the CDU toward the center and allowed more than a million asylum-seekers to enter Germany during the refugee crisis of 2015, Merz and other right-wing conservatives quietly stewed. Merkel’s centrism, they believed, had opened up room on Germany’s political spectrum for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) — currently the second strongest party in the country, according to polls. Shortly after the 2021 election that brought Chancellor Olaf Scholz to power, CDU members overwhelmingly elected Merz to lead the party, cementing his political comeback and drawing the party back to the right. Merz’s sharp-tongued and sometimes populist rhetoric also represents a significant break from the reserved tones of Scholz and Merkel. German voters don’t seem particularly fond of him — other conservative politicians are more popular, according to surveys — but Merz, his party colleagues say, is still the right person for the job. “Friedrich Merz is not really very beloved, but he is respected,” said Günther Oettinger, a former senior CDU politician and European commissioner. “He doesn’t win over the hearts of the people. But the situation in Germany is difficult. We’re in a recession. We have an unsolved migration problem. We’re losing competitiveness. We have a failed energy transition. People now need a restorer. And that’s exactly his profile.” CDU politicians also believe that Merz’s brand of conservativism and blunt style will position him far better to deal with Donald Trump, who harbored a particular antipathy toward Merkel and Germany during his first term as U.S. president. Merz also believes he’ll be able to stand up to Trump far better than Scholz. “Trump will drop you like a lightweight,” Merz told the left-leaning chancellor in a recent parliamentary debate. The question is whether Merz would fare any better in his dealings with the next American president. In both economic and security terms, Trump’s return poses a unique existential threat to Germany. At a time when Russian President Vladimir Putin is increasing his assaults on Ukraine and conducting a hybrid war on Europe, Trump has repeatedly assailed Germany for being “delinquent” on defense spending. Earlier this year he said he had encouraged Moscow to “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO countries that “don’t pay.” The president-elect has also threatened to withdraw U.S. military support for Ukraine, a move that would leave Europe on the hook even as Germany’s intelligence agency warns the Kremlin is preparing for the possibility of a “direct military confrontation with NATO.” Trump’s threats to slap tariffs on European goods could hit Germany’s export-oriented industrial sector particularly hard in the midst of an economic contraction that is seeing factory closures and mass layoffs. The Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research estimates that future tariffs could cost Germany €33 billion, and that exports to the U.S. could drop by 15 percent. Merz has vowed to stand up to Trump by advocating Germany’s foreign policy interests more assertively. When it comes to the details, however, Merz has offered only vague promises to meet the next American president “with an upright posture and clarity,” and a willingness to cut “deals.” Merz has suggested he will buy American weapons in order to please Trump, while CDU politicians say they will urge the president-elect to forgo tariffs on Europe by arguing that free trade between the EU and the U.S. makes sense if both want to reduce their dependence on China. “Let’s rather facilitate transatlantic trade, as we have a common challenge to reduce our economic dependencies on China, especially in the area of raw materials and critical infrastructure,” said Thomas Silberhorn, a conservative Bavarian politician, summarizing the arguments Merz will make. “For us to succeed, we must become stronger in transatlantic trade and not weaken each other.” Still, Germany remains at the mercy of Trump’s decisions. After decades of post-Cold War disarmament, its army is incapable of fighting an extended war, and even in 2023 Berlin spent only 1.5 percent of GDP on defense ($66.8 billion). Meanwhile, convincing Trump of the benefits of free trade, if only with Europe, seems a long shot given that tariffs are the basis of the U.S. president-elect’s economic agenda. Merz still insists Germany can thrive despite the global challenges. “We have to go from being a sleeping middle power to a leading middle power again,” he told German magazine Stern. But as the world returns to great-power rivalry and Europe suffers from broader political and economic weakness, Germany’s fate as a middle power may largely rest on forces beyond its borders. It’s a particularly bad time for Berlin to be experiencing political paralysis pending formation of a new government. The U.S. president’s visit to Berlin comes at a time of particular peril for Kyiv. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s move to establish new border controls risks generating an EU rift. The far-right Alternative for Germany party won the Thuringia state election, dealing a blow to the country’s coalition government.

Title: Local Bitcoin funds record returns of 30%
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/investment/2912405/local-bitcoin-funds-record-returns-of-30-
Time Published: 2024-12-02T02:38:00Z

Two Thai Bitcoin mutual funds have posted returns reaching 30% following their launches in June, drawing demand from investors as prices continue to spike, approaching US$100,000 following Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. Only two asset management companies -- One Asset Management (ONEAM) and MFC Asset Management (MFC) -- have been approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch mutual funds investing in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The SEC restricted investment in mutual funds tied to spot Bitcoin ETFs to institutional investors and ultra-accredited investors (UI) because of the high risks associated with cryptocurrencies and digital assets. These investors are required to have extensive knowledge and the capacity to manage significant investment risks. The world's largest cryptocurrency rose 0.9% to $95,964 on Friday, with analysts expecting the price to reach $100,000 later this year. One of the funds is ONE Bitcoin ETF Fund of Funds Unhedged (not for retail investors), with a ticker of ONE-BTCETFOF-UI, launched by ONEAM on June 6. The fund has diversified investments in several master funds, including Franklin Bitcoin ETF (50.6% of the portfolio), iShares Bitcoin Trust Fund (38.4%) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (10.5%). Total assets as of Nov 26 amounted to 327 million baht. Pote Harinasuta, chief executive of ONEAM, said ONE-BTCETFOF-UI achieved returns of more than 30%, mirroring the performance of its master funds. "Investor interest has surged as Bitcoin reached all-time highs, driven by Trump's pro-Bitcoin policies," he said. Investing in digital assets through regulated mutual funds offers benefits such as exemption from withholding tax and reliable asset custody by SEC-regulated management companies. This makes such funds a safer and more secure option than non-regulated platforms, said Mr Pote. MFC Bitcoin ETF Tracker Fund (not for retail investors), with a ticker of MBTCETF-UI, invests in Bitcoin ETFs, particularly through iShares Bitcoin Trust, managed by BlackRock, the world's largest ETF provider. Chaovakorn Chotibunt, executive vice-president and head of investment strategy at MFC, said MBTCETF-UI delivered a return of roughly 30% since its inception on June 7. As of Nov 23, iShares Bitcoin Trust yielded a return of 99%, while Bitcoin itself delivered a 134% return. Mr Chaovakorn attributed the price surge to market speculation driven by Trump's policies, which have created optimism about Bitcoin's potential roles in the financial system. Based on rising demand, MFC expanded MBTCETF-UI's registered asset size from 2 billion baht to 5 billion on Nov 14. As of Nov 27, the fund's net asset value reached 2.5 billion baht. "Bitcoin and digital assets are alternative investments with very high risks," he said. "We generally recommend allocating only 1% of your portfolio to this segment, or an amount aligned with your risk tolerance." Younger investors show more interest in digital assets, while some investors are turning to Bitcoin because of concerns about the US dollar's stability, said Mr Chaovakorn.

Title: It Used to Be One of the Main Ways Men Talked to Each Other. Then Everyone Went Silent.

In 2005 I received a copy of World of Warcraft for my birthday. The game clocked in at 3 gigabytes—a behemoth by the standards of the early 2000s, so big that it had to be distributed across four different CDs. I installed those discs onto our creaking, overworked family PC and, hours later, created my first avatar: a humble dwarf paladin named Pumaras, who set off to explore a realm he would soon call home. World of Warcraft was a singular experience, and completely unlike the lonesome corridors of Halo or Call of Duty. Millions of living, breathing human beings logged on to the game at the same time. They were dispersed across a massive digital landscape—digging up treasure, exploring catacombs, and, most importantly, creating a flourishing social milieu in the chat box at the bottom of the screen. Few feats could be accomplished by yourself in this place. Do you want to slay the dragon brooding at the summit of Blackrock Mountain? Then you must band together with a small army of fellow combatants to stand a chance. Need to stock up on some health potions? Then you’ll be bartering with someone who has mastered the alchemical arts. That was the magic of World of Warcraft. Play long enough and you’ll be enmeshed in a nation. You’ll find fellowship and rivalry. You might even make pals for life. And I did. I played World of Warcraft nearly every day until I left for college, and as Pumaras scoured the map for adventure, he soon found communion with a small cadre of ride-or-die cohorts. Some were around my age, others were considerably older, but all of us were united in a sublime trinity of priorities: kill monsters, gain loot, and make jokes until the wee hours of the morning. It’s been too long for me to remember how I originally met those friends, but that’s the point. World of Warcraft was designed to function like a social organ: You’d see the same players congregating in its capital cities, searching for compatriots to join them on their next dungeon crawl. With time, those mercenary contacts cohered into something deeper and more real. Our usernames were saved in each other’s respective friends lists, and before long, we were chopping it up on voice chat. I was a lonely teenager in some respects, but my life in World of Warcraft was rich. I had friends in North Carolina, Arkansas, and Sydney. I didn’t know much about their inner lives, but we had the most important thing in common: We wanted to conquer the world, and we wanted to do it together. World of Warcraft still exists in 2024. The game’s 10th expansion was released in August, and while it doesn’t command quite the same influence as it did during its early-millennium prime, millions of players still step through its portal every day. But the dynamic I’m describing—the complex social contract, the acquaintances waiting to be forged into brotherhood—is nowhere to be found. The chat box that used to chirp with shitposts, gossip, and hyperlocal banter is conspicuously barren. If you do partner up with someone for an adventure, words are rarely exchanged. When the final boss is toppled, everyone leaves the group and dissolves into the ether. It used to be something of a faux pas to play without a microphone, but I honestly can’t remember the last time one of my fellow dwarves has beckoned me to join a voice channel. This is part of a shift that can be felt across video game culture writ large. Even though some of the biggest franchises in the world—Fortnite, Call of Duty, League of Legends—pit a server’s worth of players against one another in lethal combat, the softer interactions those places once fomented are on the decline. We are all in front of our computers, paradoxically together and separate, like ships passing in the night. This is a difficult trend to prove empirically, but it certainly has been felt by lifelong gamers. There are multiple somber YouTube video essays about the lack of conviviality in multiplayer lobbies, and most of them bear titles that gesture toward an elemental wound in the culture. (One video, titled “Modern Gaming Is Becoming More and More Isolated,” has over 500,000 views.) A similar despondence has struck the domains of Reddit and GameFAQs, which have historically served as the premier watering holes for fans of the hobby. (“No one uses voice chat these days,” wrote one user. “People don’t chat in gaming anymore,” added another.) On a more macro level, about half of Americans are currently experiencing loneliness, particularly among millennials and Gen Z, who represent the industry’s primary consumers. All of this is evidence of a generation that has come to believe that a reliable source of intimacy—even if it’s down the scope of a sniper rifle—has gone awry. I would find it pathetic if I didn’t totally relate. Nina Freeman, a game designer and Twitch streamer, crystalized this sensation perfectly in her 2015 project Cibele. The game, which draws heavily from Freeman’s own life, allows the player to watch a World of Warcraft–like friendship bloom in real time. You take control of a girl who has met a stranger in the wide-open plains of a multiplayer RPG. As they cull monsters and empty coffers, the two souls grow closer—eventually falling in love. Cibele is an attempt to mirror the warmth that can be found between avatars. If it has a fundamental principle, it’s that video games can reveal surprising vulnerability when two people are in the same place with a common task. That, more than anything else, is what those GameFAQs threads are mourning. “I think [games like World of Warcraft] can affect one’s willingness to open up to someone. You don’t have to deal with the layer of bodies. You don’t have to worry about the physical barrier. All of that is stripped away when you’re speaking through a video game,” said Freeman. “So I do think digital spaces are sometimes good at bringing people together, and make connecting easier. There is room for a closeness to develop when all you can do is talk.” I never had a multiplayer romance, but like Freeman, when I think back on those days, the memories that surface have little to do with nuts-and-bolts gameplay. All of the dungeons we cleared served as a backdrop for long, elliptical moonlit conversations that teenage boys in the mid-2000s tended to have (Radiohead, the Iraq war, the comedy stylings of Dane Cook). Mitchell Winkie, a screenwriter in Los Angeles and my brother, was also a degenerate World of Warcraft sicko in his youth, and he recalls a moment when—after a long night in one of the game’s most daunting battlefields—he told his party leader that he needed to go to bed. “I brush my teeth, shut down my computer, and my fucking Razr phone rings,” he told me. “It’s my party leader, who is begging me to log back on, in a very sweet, not-scary way, just desperate because they don’t have enough man power to kill the final boss.” Sure enough, Mitchell popped out of bed and put his talents to use. “I don’t think anything dropped for me, but I was a minor hero,” he continued. “And, looking back, obviously everyone knew I was such a young kid from my squeaky voice, but they all treated me very kindly and big-brotherly in a way I’ll never forget.” Still, the positive social interactions players have found in video games over the years are easily outweighed by the negative ones. What is the cultural stereotype of a Call of Duty match on Xbox Live? Slurs, obscenities, and heavy-duty profanity, whipsawing back and forth at impossibly loud volumes. (I am reminded of this clip, in which a bright-eyed kid asks the rest of his team, in a prepubescent voice, how much candy they got for Halloween. Someone instantly shouts back, “Shut the fuck up!”) This problem is intensified further if you are gaming while not—precisely—a white heterosexual male. Racial epithets are commonplace, alongside standard-issue dude-bro misogyny. When the Anti-Defamation League surveyed this issue, it found that more than half of gamers have faced some form of discrimination in multiplayer settings. So I was not surprised when Freeman told me that these days she seldom switches her microphone on during gaming sessions. “I play a lot of DOTA, and I’ve had it on anonymous mode for the last year,” she said, referring to an anti-harassment feature that automatically prevents other players from sending her in-game chat messages, or seeing her username at all. This is the standard diagnosis for why video games have gotten less social. These arenas are rife with disruptive hate that can be difficult to moderate, so players have responded by turning inward. Ian Larson, a sociologist at the University of California, Irvine, who studies video games, notes that the public squares in this hobby have largely moved off game servers and ensconced themselves on Discord—a platform that allows the creation of private chat servers for curated segments of the population. Within a Discord sanctum, argues Larson, players are able to fill their need for social interaction without wandering into the disarray of the digital public. “I know people who have game communities formed around a podcast they listen to, or a sports team they like,” said Larson. “I think people have found Discord to be more tuned to what they’re looking for than just going out into the wild.” Joanna Lewis, at the University of Northern Colorado, researches the relationship between video games and loneliness and takes this premise even further. Lewis argues that the generation eager to play a massively multiplayer online video game in 2005 was itself a uniquely self-selecting group—akin to the Discord communities of today. I think she’s onto something. My early World of Warcraft friends were curious about the emergent technology represented by the game, and perhaps more willing to actualize its metaversal possibility. It was genuinely exotic to go online and communicate with a stranger at the turn of the century, but we simply do not have that relationship with the internet anymore. Everyone is on the internet now, and naturally, that has brought a much more unwieldy influx of humanity into digital environs. “We’re being exposed to everyone’s perspective,” said Lewis. “That can be good, and it can be bad, but it’s made people a bit more cautious about what we open ourselves up to.” The downside of this drift is that game designers have made an effort to purge the social faculties from their products. There was a time when a World of Warcraft dungeon run required a tight balance of coordination and logistics, actions that could be fostered only through rapid-fire communication. Today, though, much of the game is intended for solo play. (One of the defining features of the game’s latest expansion is a new archetype of content, called Delves, that can be completed all by yourself.) This issue is even more glaring in games like Call of Duty, in which the primary means of interacting with strangers is to gun them down and rip the resources from their bodies. To me, this reads as a tacit concession that most gamers regard one another as nuisances to be subjugated, rather than potential collaborators. And maybe that issue can be solved only by rewiring the playing field and creating more incentives for players to be good to one another. Larson believes that this isn’t as hard as it looks. He points to Final Fantasy XIV, a game similar to World of Warcraft, which is buoyed by a mentorship program. Newcomers can be taken under the wings of more experienced players, an experience that rewards each of them with tangible in-game benefits. “You just want to create little buds that might sprout eventually,” he said. Freeman cites a more outré example. The 2012 classic Journey featured an abstract take on multiplayer where, during a grueling expedition through a psychedelic desert, you might come across another traveler, who becomes connected to your game. The two characters cannot impede or harass their partner, nor can they communicate outside of a few rudimentary sounds. The only asset they can functionally provide is companionship, which is far more interesting than yet another headshot. “You’re taking away the words, and sometimes taking away people’s ability to speak can be good,” said Freeman. “But that shouldn’t be the end-all, be-all. There should be a way to improve that.” In fact, Freeman believes that the silence that has struck video games runs parallel to the toxicity and distrust seeping into all corners of digital culture. Pessimism about the internet is at an all-time high. The consensus states that the web is a place of rampant misinformation and vicious harassment. It is destroying democracy. It has made us lonelier and more paranoid. It is where decency goes to die. So why do I hold out hope that things could be different? To keep the faith that the internet can, indeed, be a kind and loving place? Simple: I’ve seen it myself. I may not have solutions, but I do know that the world is a better place when a dwarf and an elf can meet in the whirring gears of a multiplayer server and, shortly afterward, become best friends. Surely, we can’t be so far away from reclaiming that dream. “We were early users of this weird social construct of talking online through avatars,” said Freeman. “All of this stuff has become a fixture of the mainstream fabric of life. We have to find ways to deal with this problem, because it’s not going away. We need to make it better, rather than moving away from it altogether.” Thanks for signing up!

The transition of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. from Democrat to independent to (gasp!) Republican was a popcorn-grabbing sideshow of the 2024 election season — until it became the main event. The defection of Bobby Kennedy to Team Trump was a seismic shift in an already bizarre presidential election, but it also formed a more perfect union — between MAGA and MAHA (Make America Healthy Again). And if President-Elect Donald Trump fails to deliver on his MAHA commitments, MAGA will collapse in the broken bargain. MAHA was not merely a clever pivot of campaign messaging; it was a melding of policy platforms necessary to reclaim Americans’ creed of “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” MAGA is not about returning the nation to the 1950s; it is about restoring the Rule of Law, fiscal integrity, regulated borders, citizen security, and trust in the government. It is about reclaiming free speech and worship; equality of all, regardless of race or identity alphabet; and accountability for government agencies that lied about the Steele Dossier, Hunter Biden’s laptop, and the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 “interventions.” MAGA is about re-establishing basic constitutional liberties for all Americans. No MAGA, no MAHA. What good is liberty without health? The merging of the Kennedy platform with Trump’s offered Americans a dual vision — not just for economic growth and safer streets, but safer meals and a shift toward reducing illness, especially for children. Kennedy is correct about the health crisis unfolding in America. Who could possibly oppose MAHA? Democrats, for one. If Donald Trump advised taking daily vitamins, Democrats would likely dump their Geritol and Flintstones chewables into their toilets. However, another group is even more opposed to the MAHA plan: industrial agriculture and food processing interests. Politico reported on the battle over Trump’s choice for USDA that “some in the agriculture industry and on Capitol Hill ... [are] relieved the president-elect did not tap someone more openly aligned with Kennedy and his critiques of the current agriculture system.” The battle for USDA chief represents the battle for the soul of the nation’s future: [Kennedy has] openly promised to go to war with large agriculture interests he argues are at the root of Americans’ twin obesity and chronic health crises. But those fights lie within USDA, which oversees a $430 billion–plus yearly budget and 100,000 employees, touching nearly every part of the country’s $1.5 trillion food and agriculture industry. Not HHS. Farm state lawmakers on Capitol Hill have also been skeptical that Trump would actually allow Kennedy to follow through on his promises to upend the food system and go to war against big corporate agriculture interests, including those that are protected by rural Republicans. Several candidates for Cabinet posts even tried to lean on the strong ties to the corporate agriculture sector within Trump’s inner circle. A war on conventional agriculture is not in the cards even for Kennedy — the nation cannot transition away from its industrial food dependency as easily as Bobby did from toxic Democrats. However, if the industrial stranglehold on Americans’ food production and processing is not broken, the nation’s children, along with its water, soils, and food supplies, will continue to decline. There are trillions of dollars of federal subsidies involved in food production. The industrial “stakeholders” (not consumer “steakholders” or local farmers) are ultimately the beneficiaries of all those tax dollars. They will not allow Bobby to take away their cash cow without a fight. If Donald Trump does not deliver on promises to improve Americans’ health and food supplies, he will do more than merely break a political pledge — he will fall on the battlefield with banner in hand before even being sworn in. There is no life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness without healthy, local food supplies. Control the food, control the people — and their guns, worship times, political views, and ability to live. It is a tactic older than siege warfare. Stalin and Mao were mere dabblers compared to what the globalist cabal of the U.N., WHO, and WEF have in store for the global human population. Syngenta, Bayer, and BlackRock all sit as “partners” at the WEF table, crafting totalitarian plans to subjugate all food production under an industrial system that creates absolute dependency. Humans must eat plants and eliminate cows — but is that to save the world or to solidify corporate profits and globalist domination? These same companies, and many others, sit also in the corridors of the federal government, determined to retain their regulatory capture not just of the EPA and FDA, but of the pivotal USDA. Democrats claim they oppose corporate profiteers, but they have flung open the nation’s bureaucratic doors to corporate control — how about those PFAS being generated by renewables manufacturing? Forever chemicals for the little children, anyone? There is no persuasiveness for conservatives targeting renewables polluters if Big Ag is left in charge of food supplies. Control the food, control the people. Make the food healthier and more secure, and win We the People over for 2026 and 2028. Abandon food production to globalist profiteers, and all is lost. No MAHA, no MAGA. MAHA and MAGA go together. Free speech for cancer patients and obese children is not a life of liberty and pursuing happiness, but an irreversible dystopian doom. Kennedy has committed his entire being to thwart industrial domination of food. If Donald Trump does not heed Bobby’s warnings, the promises of MAGA will ring hollow as Americans’ health and life expectancies continue to plummet. Conservatives will lose all credibility with the electorate they promised to rescue from food enslavement, and they will sicken themselves and their children in the political process.

Title: ‘Every torch on the shore, every light at sea, represented someone who cared’ for teacher Máire Ní Fhatharta

Recovery of body gave family and friends space to grieve the loss of sea swimmer Máire Ní Fhátharta was described as 'kind' and 'dedicated' in tributes from family and her employer Volunteers at Silverstrand in Galway during the search for Máire Ní Fhatharta. Picture by Andy Newman. Máire Ní Fhatharta and her partner Dan King, who took a leading role in the search for her body Máire Ní Fhatharta, who died after going for a swim nearly three weeks ago Thick fog enveloped the northern shores of Galway Bay on the morning of November 12, and it never really lifted for the next 10 days. True, there were days of bright sunshine and falls of snow that transformed the Burren, along with icy winds that stung the skin. But over the second week of the search for Máire Ní Fhatharta, there was no talk of elections in Galway West — only a growing sense of apprehension as Storm Bert approached. The 32-year-old teacher would have known the bay’s vagaries, growing up close to its shores at Doire Locháin Thoir between na Forbacha and An Spidéal. Like musician Johnny Duhan, she was a morning sea swimmer. Silverstrand, a popular spot west of Salthill’s Blackrock, with a commanding view of Black Head, became busier for winter dippers during the Covid-19 pandemic. On that fateful morning nearly three weeks ago, the sea was calm and still below dense and freezing fog. For anyone there early, low tide at 7.42am required a walk out from the shoreline. Disorientation and hypothermia could have set in within minutes. The initial alarm was for Mr Duhan, who had not returned home. It was only when Ms Ní Fhatharta did not arrive at work that a second search ensued in the early afternoon, led by the Irish Coast Guard’s Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre in Valentia, Co Kerry, and Galway gardaí. By then, the 74-year-old songwriter’s body had been recovered on the incoming tide. However, the lingering fog precluded a helicopter search for the young woman. Galway Bay inshore lifeboat was launched and was quickly joined by kayakers, stand-up paddleboarders, inshore fishing and sea angling vessels, sailing club members and others with access to rigid inflatable boats (RIBs). Volunteers at Silverstrand in Galway during the search for Máire Ní Fhatharta. Picture by Andy Newman. Down at Silverstrand, gardaí set up a command structure where volunteers were encouraged to register. The Civil Defence joined in, as did Coast Guard units from Costelloe Bay, Cleggan and Killaloe, and drone searches were initiated by Cleggan and Doolin Coast Guard. Meanwhile, a WhatsApp group had been set up by friends and family, named “Bring Máire Home”, where volunteers were given regular updates on the location and time of shore team searches extending from Oranmore to An Cheathrú Rua. Family, including Ms Ní Fhatharta’s sisters, Fionnuala and Maighréad, moved into a camper van parked at Silverstrand, where friends joined them to help provide support. Onshore searches were co-ordinated from there by Ms Ní Fhatharta’s brother Tomas and brother-in-law Jack. Many who have had direct experience of the bay’s hazards were first to offer help, including Deirdre and Johnny Glynn. In August 2020, their daughter Ellen and her cousin Sara Feeney were rescued after over 15 hours at sea when their paddleboards were swept out from Na Forbacha beach by a northerly wind. She was the kindest, funniest, most special person I’ve ever known and probably will ever know ​As the Glynns and others discovered during their own long night of darkness, Galway Bay may be named Loch Lurgan, but it is a vast territory of over 300 square kilometres. The paddleboarders were rescued by Patrick and Morgan Oliver, but many families have not been so fortunate. During the early days of the search for Ms Ní Fhatharta, the body of a 45-year old woman from Cork, whose car had been found in Liscannor, Co Clare, was recovered from the water off the Aran island of Inis Oírr. Ms Ní Fhatharta had a lot to live for. She had taught in Scoil Iognaid and Gaeilscoil de hÍde, and had just started a new job in August as an Irish language planning officer with Fóram Cois Fharraige in An Spidéal. Her sisters painted a portrait of her in an interview with RTÉ Radio News at One. “Everyone who met her fell instantly in love with her, she was just something else,” Maighréad said. “She was the kindest, funniest, most special person I’ve ever known and probably will ever know. She was the best sister and friend, and partner to Dan, and we’re all very lucky to have known her.” Máire Ní Fhatharta and her partner Dan King, who took a leading role in the search for her body Describing her as a woman with a “wealth of skills”, Fóram Cois Fharraige said: “It was clear from that first day that she was a dedicated, serious, energetic woman, with a particular commitment to the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.” The shape of each day was framed by the checking of tide tables and the weather as family and work routines were amended or suspended. At night, and under a full moon during the first week, the beams of hundreds of torches became a regular feature on the many parts of the long, rocky, indented shoreline, stretching 45km from Oranmore to Indreabhán alone. Young friends and family, some of whom flew long distances to help, were assigned zones and team leaders. There were regular reminders that safety was paramount, but there were several minor incidents in challenging weather. Ms Ní Fhatharta’s partner, Dan King, knew how to co-ordinate the community element of the search at sea. An experienced sailor, he was previously a member of the Galway RNLI inshore lifeboat crew. He has windsurfed and stand-up paddleboarded at a high level for most of his life. In a cutting north-easterly wind, six layers of clothing could not keep the cold out in RIBs Search tracks were uploaded daily by boats and diving teams from Galway and Athlone and as far away as Mallow and Monaghan. There were also updates of the Marine Institute’s “Adrift” tool, which uses tidal, weather and river-flow data to provide a realistic simulation of missing persons at sea. By Sunday, November 17, the weather was more challenging, and by early that second week the forecast was for ice and snow. In a cutting north-easterly wind, six layers of clothing could not keep the cold out in RIBs. For kayakers and jet-skiers, it was a particularly arduous endurance test. “Our WhatsApp group for the on-land search was capped at 2,000 people and we frequently exceeded this cap,” said Mr King. “On water, we had over 60 vessels, 300 people per day ranging from commercial fishing vessels — from the Aran islands, Rossaveal and Clogherhead, Co Louth — to the Coast Guard, RNLI, Civil Defence, along with private boats, sub-aqua clubs, stand-up paddle boards, kayaks and swimmers.” Máire Ní Fhatharta, who died after going for a swim nearly three weeks ago In another cruel twist, there was a power cut in the early hours of Thursday, November 21, across much of south Connemara. The ESB network infrastructure had been badly damaged by snow. With the weekend storm approaching, word was that the state rescue agencies would have to stand down at some point. Those with experience of searches knew days seven to 10 would be key. ​That Thursday evening on WhatsApp, Mr King gave a rallying call to all the volunteers: “Let’s hope tomorrow is the day.” Across the city and county, quiet tears were shed And so it was. At around 4pm on Friday, November 22, just hours before Storm Bert, there was a sighting by the Rescue 115 helicopter near Silverstrand. A kayaker was asked to investigate. Ms Ní Fhatharta’s body was located, not far from where she had left for her swim. Across the city and county, quiet tears were shed. One volunteer who had been on many searches tried to articulate the feeling. “It’s the power of the collective at a time of wider bleak world events beyond our control, and it was so palpable,” they said. “Every torch on the shore, every light at sea, that represented someone who cares.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: Why Is Chevron Corporation (CVX) Among the Best American Energy Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Energy Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against the other American energy stocks. The energy industry includes stocks that are involved in the production or supply of energy. Companies engaged in oil and gas drilling, refining, and discovering and developing oil or gas reserves are all part of the energy sector or industry. The energy industry also comprises integrated power utility companies that use renewable energy and coal. Energy companies continue to suffer challenges as oil supply exceeds demand. Oil prices have been below $70/barrel since early September. According to U.S. Bank Asset Management's senior investment strategy director, Rob Haworth: "The oil market is one that remains well supplied but isn’t well demanded." Although the U.S. economy is strong, other major oil users like China and Germany are experiencing economic challenges. As a result, global demand is lagging.” Nonetheless, a number of energy companies have made encouraging achievements in 2024, and investors have reaped financial rewards as the energy sector of the broader market has grown by 12.74% since the start of the year. Based on exceptional results in 2021 and 2022, it has increased by 19.89% in just three years and by 10.61% growth over the previous five years. However, according to RSM’s Energy Outlook 2024 report, the North American energy sector will confront significant potential problems due to a global move toward renewable energy sources, aging infrastructure, and rising electricity consumption. Infrastructure limitations continue to be a major obstacle. Scalability concerns have been brought to light by record U.S. oil and natural gas output as well as a boom in renewable energy, affecting projects like solar farms in California and drilling in Texas. These challenges show how urgently infrastructure modernization investments are needed. As per the aforementioned report, North America's demand for electricity has increased to levels not seen in many years. Emerging technologies like green hydrogen, the use of electric vehicles, and growing data centers are important drivers. The use of machine learning and other analytical AI technology is growing among energy companies. This change alters the energy sector and aligns with tax incentives and the company's environmental, social, and governance goals. Most importantly, integrating clean energy is essential as companies adjust to meet rising demand sustainably. According to BloombergNEF, $303 billion was spent on U.S. renewable energy in 2023, a 22% increase from the year before, showing the continued pace of the energy transformation. Globally, $1.77 trillion was invested, signifying a strong push toward decarbonization. Even though renewable energy requires more cash, companies of all sizes—from startups to established oil and gas companies—are shifting their focus to renewables as the case for clean energy grows. This change sets up the energy industry for a significant and sustainable future. We sifted through holdings of Energy ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 American Energy stocks. Then we selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among institutional investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024. We have used the stock's market cap as of November 21, 2024, as a tie-breaker in case two or more stocks have the same number of hedge funds invested.

Full Content:
The first day of counting is drawing to a close with the number of seats filled surpassing 30 - those include the larger party leaders Simon Harris, Mary Lou McDonald and Micheál Martin. Counting is continuing in six constituencies. Both Harris and Martin have expressed their optimism that they will be part of any government formed in the coming weeks, although they look set to fall short of an majority. Meanwhile, the performance of Gerry Hutch has been the big talking point of the day. Could he be elected? Our writers give an update on the Dublin Central situation. [ Election 2024 key race alerts: We analyse the count contests that matter mostOpens in new window ] You can follow all of our counts in amazing detail, with really excellent tables, stats and graphic on The Irish Times Results Hub. As of now, 35 seats out of 174 have been filled. The final percentages will depend on the last few first counts to be held but it’s interesting to see that the order of the three larger parties from last night’s exit poll have been reversed. Fianna Fáil is the lead party with 21.5 per cent of support. Fine Gael has 20.7 per cent support. And Sinn Féin has 18.7 per cent. Labour and the Social Democrats are very close, both at about 4.7 per cent. The Greens managed to get 3 per cent of the vote but that might not translate into any seats. I did a run through all 43 constituencies to make a seat projection. As of now, my projections for seats are: Fianna Fáil: 49 Fine Gael: 40 Sinn Féin 38: Independents: 19 Social Democrats: 10 Labour: 8 Independent Alliance: 5 People Before Profit: 3 Aontú: 1 Green Party 1. There is a big health warning with that as the last seats will be very keenly contested, and I suspect Fianna Fáil’s total may slip a little on critical seats on the final counts. For example, I’ve projected three seats for the party in Carlow-Kilkenny but that might not materialise. Likewise, I have only assigned one to it in Mayo but it may end up getting two. Cork North West will be very close. So will Dublin Mid West where Fianna Fáil might lose out to combined transfers of centre-left parties and candidates. What looks a possibility at this stage is that Fianna Fáil will be the biggest party with Fine Gael marginally ahead of Sinn Féin. If these projections are correct Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will be close to a majority, but will probably seek a third party to give the Government stability. Thank you for staying with us during the course of the evening and night. We will be back early in the morning! Stephen Maguire reports: Pearse Doherty’s huge surplus has swept his running mate Padraic Mac Lochhlainn to the second seat in the five-seat Donegal. The Inishowen TD did not need too many of the 6,000 spare votes as he was close to the quota himself after Count 1. Vivienne Clarke reports: The Offaly count is concluded with Fianna Fail’s Tony McCormack and Fine Gael’s John Clendennen, both seasoned councillors, taking the final two seats, narrowly defeating Sinn Féin’s Aoife Masterson. In the seventh count, Mr Clendennen, with 8,627, had only 116 votes to spare over Ms Masterson who had 8,501. Tony McCormack was a little ahead at 9,151. David Forsythe writes: The leader of Independent Alliance Michael Collins has been elected in the three-seat Cork South West. The three outgoing TDs - the other two are Social Democrats leader Holly Cairns and Fianna Fáil Christopher O’Sullivan - are expected to be re-elected. Mr Collins total of 12,295 votes exceeded the quota of 11,824. Mr Collins said: “I’d like to pay tribute to my canvas team and the people of Cork South West who put their faith in me again.” He said he expected Independent Ireland to return to the Dáil with “two or three” extra TDs. He added: “Where Independent Ireland was on the paper we were strong and it looks at this present time that we could take between five and eight seats. If a party that had three TDs can return with six I’d be very pleased with that.” Could Gerry Hutch be elected? Well-known criminal remains in contention for Dáil seat in Dublin Central https://t.co/nPAWHfUEpm via @IrishTimes Stephen Farrell reports: Peter Burke of Fine Gael is elected after completion of long awaited first count. Counting adjourned until tomorrow morning. You can see the full results here. Burke won 17.56 per cent, getting 10,884 votes. Fianna Fáil’s Longford TD Joe Flaherty looks like he is in trouble, with Fine Gael set to gain a second seat through Michael Carrigy. Arthur Beesley reports: Fine Gael’s Frank Feighan topped the poll in the first Sligo-Leitrim count with 8,890 first-preference votes, leaving the incumbent TD 2,401 votes short of the quota. The result of the first count was declared by deputy returning officer Paraic O’Grady shortly after midnight, more than 15 hours after boxes were opened at 9am on Saturday. Martin Kenny of Sinn Féin came second with 7,764 votes, followed by Michael Clarke of Independent Ireland on 5,979 votes and Eamon Scanlon of Fianna Fáil with 5,913 votes. Kenny’s running mate Chris MacManus is on 5,173 votes. Scanlon running mates Edel McSharry is on 4,466 votes and Paddy O’Rourke is on 4,066 votes. Independent TD Marian Harkin is on 4,347 votes. Mr O’Grady adjourned the count until 9am on Sunday after eliminating Independent Diarmuid MacConville, Independent Ireland’s Caroline Corcoran and Party for Animal Welfare candidate Molly Candon. Cian O’Connell reports that Independent TD Seán Canney is the first to be elected in Galway East. Stephen Maguire reports: Pearse Doherty has amassed the highest number of first preferences in the State with almost 19,000 votes, over 6,000 above the quote in five-seat Donegal. As the second count gets underway, his surplus of 6,127 now being distributed. His running mate Pádraig Mac Lochlainn has an outside chance of getting in on Doherty’s surplus but it could be a long night at the Aura Leisure Centre in Letterkenny. Sinn Féin will take two seats with Fianna Fáil looking poised to take two with the final seat looking like a battle between Independents Thomas Pringle and Charles Ward. David Raleigh reports that veteran Fianna Fáil TD Willie O’Dea has been elected on the sixth count. Sinn Féin’s Maurice Quinlavin and Kieran O’Donnell look set to be elected in later counts with a battle between five candidates for the last seat. Elisa O’Donovan of the Social Democrats looks like she has the slight advantage here. On the back of topping the poll in Limerick City, FF veteran Willie O’Dea says he is currently writing his memoirs to be published after he retires from political life - but first, tonight, after waiting on six counts to be reach the quota in this four-seater, he is going to the pub with his supporters to celebrate. Fianna Fáil candidates have finished in the top three positions in five-seat Carlow-Kilkenny, with a chance of getting all three elected. John McGuinness topped the poll, followed by Jennifer Murnane O’Connor and Peter ‘Chap’ Cleere. Sinn Féin’s two candidates have done exceptionally well despite neither being an elected representative. Fine Gael’s Catherine Callaghan is the front-runner of her party’s three candidates. Green Party Minister Malcolm Noonan with 4.18 per cent of the vote is not going to hold onto his seat on those figures. Latest results from Carlow-Kilkenny here. John Fallon reports: The first count has been finally announced in Galway West. Sinn Féin’s Mairéad Farrell has done exceptionally well and has topped the pool with 8,164 votes, a little under 2,000 votes short of the quota of 10.047. The big surprise has been the poor showing of celebrity candidate Gráinne Seoighe who has won 2,929 votes (about 6 per cent) and will not be in the running for a seat. Her Fianna Fáil running mate, John Connolly, is in second position with 7,197 votes and looks like he will take a seat. Independents Catherine Connolly and Noel Grealish also look like they have polled strongly. Hildegarde Naughton looks the stronger of the two Fine Gael candidates. Get the latest Galway-West results here. Vivienne Clark is at the count centre for The Irish Times. OFFALY poll topper sitting Independent TD Carol Nolan is elected on the fifth count. pic.twitter.com/IcdCqHKbLm Sarah Burns reports: Count 6 in Dublin Central has been completed. Malachy Steenson has be eliminated. Gary Gannon is at 6,363 votes, Paschal Donohoe at 5,730, Gerard Hutch is at 3,733, Marie Sherlock is at 2,917, Mary Fitzpatrick is at 2,553 and Nease Hourigan is at 2,315. Counting adjourned for the night for Dublin Central and will resume at 10am. Hutch is currently almost 800 votes ahead of Sherlock and Steenson’s transfers will widen that gap. The only pathway for Sherlock is for transfers from Neasa Hourigan and Mary Fitzpatrick to tilt heavily in her direction. A thousand votes plus is still a big gap to make up in Dublin Central, especially with Gannon and Donohoe still in the race, and attracting transfers. Jack White reports: Fine Gael councillor Maeve O’Connell received the majority of Neale Richmond’s transfers following the second count for Dublin Rathdown, though no candidates have been elected. Independent candidates Kevin Daly and Conor Murphy, and the National Party’s Garrett McCafferty have all been eliminated. Their votes are now being distributed among the 11 remaining candidates. Ms O’Connell remains in the lead with 6,573 votes, having received 198 of Mr Richmond’s 292 transfers. She is followed by Fianna Fáil councillor Shay Brennan (5,943) who received 30 transfers, independent councillor Michael Fleming (4,394) who received 14 transfers and Social Democrats candidate Sinéad Gibney (4,281) who received four transfers. Green Party minister Catherine Martin is in fifth place with 4,161 votes after receiving 15 transfers. Dublin-Rathdown results here. Emmet Malone writes: It is all over in Dún Laoghaire where Richard Boyd-Barrett and Cormac Devlin have both exceeded the quota after Shane O’Brien’s votes were distributed, and Barry Ward, who was 2,480 votes ahead of Hugo Mills of the Social Democrats, was deemed to be elected without reaching the quota. They all join Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, who had become the first candidate elected to the new Dáil, about six hours ago. Busy here now in Leopardstown where the seventh count will shortly wrap things up. Richie Boyd Barrett, Cormac Devlin and Barry Ward all set to bb elected with Jennifer Carroll MacNeill having topped the poll and made it in on the first count about six hours ago. pic.twitter.com/6iPCVWzDTS Marie O’Halloran reports: Fianna Fáil’s Jim O’Callaghan benefited most from the transfers of former Fine Gael TD Kate O’Connell who was eliminated on the fifth count in Dublin Bay South with 1,956 votes. Mr O’Callaghan secured 399 transfers with Fine Gael’s Emma Blain receiving 351, the second highest number. Labour leader Ivana Bacik secured 310 transfers from Ms O’Connell while Fine Gael’s James Geoghegan received 291. Green Party candidate Hazel Chu was the next highest recipient with 171 transfers. Mr O’Callaghan is now just 59 votes behind Ms Bacik who is in second place with Mr Geoghegan still on course to be first elected to the four-seat constituency. Our reporter Sorcha Pollak has posted this video: Fine Gael Senator Emer Currie has been elected in Dublin West, securing the constituency’s third seat. She joins FF’s Jack Chambers and SF’s Paul Donnelly who were elected on the first count earlier today. The count for the hotly contested remaining two seats continues tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/SSsjudEPFO Cormac McQuinn spoke to former Green Party leader about his party’s performance in the general election. There is a risk it will all its 12 seats. Former Green Party leader Eamon Ryan on a poor election for his party: “It’s been a hard day for us but we’re resilient and we will come back”. pic.twitter.com/wvDXy0ljNi Michael Lowry has been elected as Tipperary’s first TD in the newly-drawn two-seat constituency. Representing Tipperary North, he topped the poll - making his seventh consecutive General Election win. Asked if he will be talking to whoever forms the next government, and he replied: “Absolutely.” Mr Lowry, who met with outgoing Taoiseach Simon Harris before the election, added: “I’ve always been positive in my approach to politics.” He smiled as he dodged questions about what he talked about and what he hoped he could gain by supporting any government Mr Harris would be a part of or even lead. “I’m not in the business of saying,” he said. “Being successful in supporting a government is to know when to say nothing. “All I can say is that I have worked with Bertie Ahern, Brian Cowen, Enda Kenny, Leo Varadkar and with Simon Harris. “It’s a case of, how shall I put it, knowing when to ask and you have to know when to ask.” On his Dail win, he added: “I am only as good as the supporters who made me.” Conor Gallagher reports: Fianna Fáil councillor Aisling Dempsey has become the third and final TD elected in Meath West. She will join returning along with Sinn Féin TD Johnny Guirke, who topped the poll, and Aontú leader and returning TD, Peadar Tóibín, into the 34th Dáil following the completion of counting late on Saturday night. Ms Dempsey, the daughter of former Fianna Fáil minister Noel Dempsey, narrowly beat Fine Gael councillor Linda Nelson Murray in a fierce battle for transfers and surpluses. She received 17 per cent of first preference votes compared to Ms Murray’s 16 per cent. The contours of the race were obvious from the early afternoon when tallies showed Mr Tóibín and Mr Guirke all but certain to take a seat and either Ms Dempsey or Ms Murray in contention for the third. Former Fine Gael turned independent councillor Noel French, who received 11 per cent of first perferences was quickly out of the running while the remaining seven candidates hardly featured at all. Six of them polled at 1.5 per cent or less. Mr Guirke was the first candidate returned, repeating his poll-topping perforamce of 2020, albeit with a significantly reduced vote. His supporters hoisted him on their shoulders alongside a Tricolour and sang Oró, Sé Do Bheatha ‘Bhaile in celebration. “Absolutely delighted. After losing a big area of west Meath where I got 40 per cent of the poll, to come in here and top the poll,” Mr Guirke said. Aisling Dempsey hugs her father, ex FF minister Minister Noel Dempsey after being elected as the third and final TD in #Meathwest. We're done and dusted. Amazing work by the count staff here pic.twitter.com/iOSWyeSzJc Barry Roche reports: From Barry Roche, Cork Tanaiste and Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin has romped home on the first count in Cork South Central with over 4,000 votes to spare in his ninth election since he first won a Dáil seat in 1989. Martin polled 14,742 in 2002 when he polled 26.69 of the vote and he was just 226 votes short of that total when he came in on this occasion 14,526 confirming his status as the most popular Fianna Fail leader in Cork since Jack Lynch Martin’s huge surplus of 4075 looks like propelling running mate Seamus McGrath – brother of former Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath if not over then close to quota with McGrath polling a highly credible 7794 to take second spot. After Martin’s surplus was distributed after the first count, McGrath was at 9,940, only 500 votes short of the quota. Sinn Fein’s Donnachadh O Laoghaire looks poised to hold his seat with 6,947 while Fine Gael are set to hold Simon Coveney’s seat most likely through Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Jerry Buttimer who leads his running mate Shane O’Callaghan by 4407 to 3364. Aside from Martin’s storming home on the first count, the story of Cork South Central is that of Social Democrat Padraig Rice, a native of Camp in West Kerry, who looks to win the Soc Dems’ first seat in Cork city after he polled an impressive 5368. Former Lord Mayor of Cork, Independent Mick Finn is still in with a slim chance of the last seat after he polled 3,582 – ahead of Labour’s Laura Harmon and Sinn Fein’s Michelle Cowhey Shahid, Anna Daly of Aontu, Úna McCarthy of Fine Gael and Dr Monica Oikek of the Greens. OFFALY results of 4th count, Carol Nolan now only 200 votes off quota of 9347. Fifth count has commenced. Keep up to date with @IrishTimes live election blog pic.twitter.com/ydkyf1MDll Kevin O’Sullivan writes: On the election outcome, Sadhbh O’ Neill, who stood for Labour in Waterford, expressed dismay that climate change did not feature strongly in the debates and hustings. “It feels like the election took place inside a bubble of denial and delay. No matter who ends up forming a government, it is vital that Ireland acts to develop plans to help us prepare for weather extremes. “Candidates and parties should have been interrogated on how they plan to both adapt to and mitigate climate change in Ireland. “Even non-controversial areas of decarbonisation like bringing our public transport up to European norms were not addressed in any meaningful way by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin. “That makes me very fearful of how these parties will tackle more challenging topics like data centres, high electricity costs and sustainable land use, because if the next government doesn’t act we’re all in big, big trouble.” Ms O’Neill is a noted environmental activist and was formerly a member of the Green Party. Arthur Beesley writes from Sligo: With the Sligo-Leitrim first count still awaited 13 hours after boxes were opened, Independent TD Marian Harkin has acknowledged she faces a struggle to retain her seat. Ms Harkin’s secured in region of 7.6 per cent of the first-preference vote, according to the tally, down from 11.5 per cent in the 2020 election. “We had hoped for better because we got such a positive response,” she said just before 10pm at the Sligo count centre. “What I’m hoping is that that positive response will translate into twos and threes. As I said earlier, there’s a pathway. It’s narrow and it’s slippy.” She faces a battle against Chris MacManus of Sinn Féin and Michael Clarke of Independent Ireland for the fourth and final seat. Tallies suggest the first three seats are likely to go to Fine Gael’s Frank Feighan, Martin Kenny of Sinn Féin and Eamon Scanlon of Fianna Fáil. Fiachra Gallagher reports that the Kildare North count has been suspended until 9am tomorrow. They are yet to get a first count. Emmet Malone writes: Sinn Fein’s Shane O’Brien has been eliminated in Dún Laoghaire after receiving just 100 of Ossian Smyth’s transfers and being overtaken by Hugo Mills of the Social Democrats who got 2,003. O’Brien’s departure from the race should be very good news for Richard Boyd-Barrett who got about 80 per cent of his transfers when he went out four years ago, enough to push the People Before Profit candidate well over the quota on that occasion. Fifty per cent would be more than enough to get Boyd Barrett over the line this time but if he somehow doesn’t make it, it’s hugely unlikely Hugo Mills will overtake him. The gap is 1,023. The count centre is filling up, meanwhile, with the other remaining candidates and their supporters as the process approaches its end. Barry Ward of Fine Gael has been receiving a lot of congratulations from well wishers including MEP Regina Doherty. Barry Andrews has also around the place showing support for Cormac Devlin. Both men also look set to be elected within the next hour. Neil Michael writes: Mattie McGrath had topped the poll in South Tipperary with 10,014 votes after the first count. But as it was just shy of the 10,270 quota, it now goes to a second count before his win can be confirmed. Five candidates were eliminated and their votes distributed. A last minute but unspecified issue has held up the first count of the Tipperary North constituency, where Michael Lowry has topped the poll. In Tipperary South, Michael Murphy (Fine Gael) looks poised to take the second seat with a three-way battle for the third seat between outgoing Sinn Féin TD Martin Browne, Fianna Fáil’s Imelda Goldsboro, and Independent Séamus Healy. Carl O’Brien writes: Taoiseach Simon Harris has been elected on the first count in Wicklow while Fianna Fáil TD and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly is facing a battle to retain his seat. Mr Harris topped the poll with 16,869 votes, exceeding the 11,415 quota by more than 5,000 votes. Bray-based Sinn Féin TD John Brady is in second place (8,450 votes), followed by Social Democrats TD Jennifer Whitmore (7,699). Both deputies look set to retain their seats. A tight race is unfolding for the final spot in the four-seat constituency between Stephen Donnelly (3,553), Independent candidate and former Fine Gael councillor Shay Cullen (3,232) and Fine Gael’s Edward Timmins (3,050). Mr Harris’s transfers look set to play a key role in deciding where the final seat goes. While a strong transfer rate to the Taoiseach’s Fine Gael running mate in west Wicklow is expected, tallies indicate significant numbers will also go to Donnelly who is based in the Taoiseach’s hometown of Greystones. Newtownmountkennedy-based Shay Cullen decided to stand as an independent after missing out on a place on the Fine Gael ticket. Independent Bray-based candidate Cllr Joe Behan is further behind in the contest (2,909) followed by sitting Green Party TD Steven Matthews (2,366) who looks set to lose his seat. Marie O’Halloran writes: Former Fine Gael TD Kate O’Connell has been eliminated after the fourth count in Dublin Bay South. Ms O’Connell ran as an independent and garnered a total of 1,956 votes. Poll topper James Geoghegan is on course to be elected first. He has 6,171 but he is still 1,800 votes short of the quota of 7,957. Interest in the next count will be on where Ms O’Connell’s transfers go. Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín has been re-elected in Meath West after reaching the quota on the fourth count. Johnny Guirke (Sinn Féin) already elected. Battle between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil for the last seat. Sarah Burns reports: The first count has come in for the ‘People’s Republic of Dublin South Central’. Sinn Féin’s Aengus Ó Snodaigh has topped the poll with 4,497 first preferences, followed by Fianna Fáil’s Catherine Ardagh with 3,988 votes, Sinn Féin’s Máire Devine with 3,854 votes, the Social Democrats Jen Cummins with 3,347 votes, People Before Profit’s Hazel de Nortúin with 3,331 votes, Sinn Féin’s Daithí Doolan with 3,290 votes and Fine Gael’s Mary Seery Kearney with 3,056 votes. Independent Ireland candidate Michael Fitzmaurice has been elected on the first count, topping the poll. It looks like Claire Kerrane (Sinn Féin) and Martin Daly (Fianna Fáil) will fill the other two seats here. Fitzmaurice disclosed in an interview a short while ago that Daly was his family GP. It also means that two of the three TDS in the constituency will be from Co Galway, albeit both of them in parishes within a stone’s throw of Roscommon. Sarah Burns reports: Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has been elected on the third count in Dublin Central. Following the transfer of Sinn Féin’s Janice Boylan transfers, Gerard Hutch is at 3,295 votes, Labour’s Marie Sherlock at 2,521 votes, Fianna Fáil’s Mary Fitzpatrick at 2,446 votes. Jack White writes: Fine Gael’s Neale Richmond has been elected while the Green Party minister Catherine Martin was placed sixth following the first count for Dublin Rathdown. Mr Richmond received 10,044 votes against a quota of 9,752. He was followed by Fine Gael councillor Maeve O’Connell (6,375), Fianna Fáil’s Shay Brennan (5,913), independent councillor Michael Fleming (4,380) and Social Democrats candidate Sinéad Gibney (4,277). The Green Party’s Catherine Martin came sixth in the four-seat constituency following the first count, receiving 4,146 first preference votes. She was narrowly behind Social Democrats’ candidate Sinéad Gibney. It was a significant fall from her 8,958 first preference votes in 2020, the highest number received that year. Mr Richmond’s surplus of 292 will be transferred tonight. Dublin Rathdown saw a turnout of 60.60 per cent, a slight reduction from 63.65 per cent in 2020. Following his election, Mr Richmond said he and councillor Maeve O’Connell were given a “very clear task” by Taoiseach Simon Harris to retain two seats for the party. “It looks like we will, but personally, obviously I’m chuffed, and hopefully we’ll see a lot more Fine Gael seats elected over the coming hours and days,” he said, anticipating the party to return more TDs than in 2020. “We ran as a really united ticket that delivered two seats for Fine Gael in Dublin Rathdown once again, even though many people said we couldn’t do it,” he said, adding that he expects Ms O’Connell to be elected on Sunday morning. Jack Horgan-Jones reports: Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe has arrived to the RDS, delivering a stinging verdict on Sinn Féin while saying his party is “in the early days” of a very positive result. “Until a few days ago I heard many predictions of a very difficult election for Fine Gael, and that’s not going to happen,” he said. Asked about the performance of gangland figure Gerry Hutch, who has a definite pathway to a seat in Dublin Central as well, Mr Donohoe said that it was important to note the vast majority of people in Dublin Central had not voted for him. “We will have to reflect in due course regarding why he performed like he did, but the big picture today is one of the centre holding.” “At a time when incumbent governments all over Europe are struggling to get re-elected, the two larger parties within this government and in particular Fine Gael, are going to deliver a very strong performance.” Regarding Sinn Féin’s performance, he said it was “now very evident they are the weakest opposition party in Europe” Despite a cost of living crisis and the lingering effects of Covid, he said any gains for Sinn Féin would be minimal, accusing the party of being unable to answer basic questions on the campaign trail. “Their share of vote and any electoral gains they make will be amongs the weakest of any opposition party in Europe.” Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond has been elected following first count in Dublin Rathdown Fine Gael’s Neale Richmond has been elected following the first count for Dublin Rathdown, receiving 10,044 votes against a quota of 9,752 pic.twitter.com/GbxcMZHrGm Cian O’Connell writes: the second count is finished in Galway East. The big story from Galway East is that the 25 year-old chairman of Galway County Council has topped the poll, seemingly at the expense of outgoing Fianna Fáil TD Anne Rabbitte, who received just 4,056 first preference votes, over 6,000 short of the quota. It will come as a blow to the party. Ms Rabbitte is the current Minister of State for Disabilities and has held a high profile since first being elected to the Dáil in 2016. Treatment of workers in the care sector became a major issue during the election campaign after footage emerged of outgoing Taoiseach Simon Harris’ interaction with disability worker Charlotte Fallon in Cork. Concerns raised by Ms Fallon led to widespread criticism of the government’s handling of the care sector. If Ms Rabbitte is to lose her seat in Galway East, it will raise further questions on the issue. The minister will be hoping for a turnaround through transfers, but she faces a very difficult battle. Read the detailed breakdown on the Galway East Counts here. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has been elected in Dublin Central on the third count. Carl O’Brien reports: Taoiseach Simon Harris said he is “very confident” that Fine Gael will have a “very significant role” to play in Government formation talks. Speaking at the count centre in his Wicklow constituency, he said that while it was difficult to say who will be the biggest party in the next Dáil, he was “cautiously optimistic and excited about the weeks ahead.” He said the Fine Gael parliamentary party which he will lead will be “massively different” with new TDs who will bring “new ideas and new perspective to Leinster House”. Mr Harris said it was clear the party “will gain seats” and “top the poll in at least 10 constituencies” and add second seats across a number of constituencies. “I think the people of Ireland have now spoken. We now have to work out exactly what they have said. That is going to take a little bit of time ... “We need to be patient in relation to that. Of course, my party will act responsibly in the days ahead,” he said. “I am really grateful to the Irish people for the mandate they have given me and my party.” In relation to Sinn Féin, he said there has been “so sign of a Sinn Féin surge” and claimed the party’s vote was likely to be down on the last election. “The two larger parties are likely to receive significant support from the electorate. So, definitely politics in Ireland has gotten much more fragmented,” he said. In relation to the performance of Gerard Hutch in the election, Mr Harris said the “people are sovereign” but said he believed he “wasn’t nailed on yet”. With 11 TDS already elected to the Dáil, our political editor Pat Leahy has projected that the two outgoing Coalition partners will have more than 80 seats and will be close to having the numbers to form a Government, albeit needing support. Here is Pat’s take: Projections for the vote share of the three biggest parties suggest that Fianna Fáil will win the largest share of votes, with 21.9 per cent of first preferences, with Fine Gael in second on 20.5 per cent and Sinn Féin in third place on 19.1 per cent. Those figures are subject to revision when first counts are all in but party analysts do not expect them to change substantially. Extrapolating seat numbers from those vote chare figures is notoriously tricky. But Fianna Fáil has some things working in its favour – including lots of incumbent candidates and strong transfers from Fine Gael. Most seat projections for the party put them somewhere in the mid-40s, with some suggesting nearer to 50, though party insiders play down the most optimistic scenarios. Fine Gael believes that it will be in the low 40s, anticipating favourable results in s amll number of place that would bring it over the 40 mark. If both these estimates are right, it will mean that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil between them will be in the mid-80s – not all that far away from the magic number of 88 which constitutes a majority in the next Dáil. But enough to need the support of either another party or a bunch of independents to form a Government with a workable majority. Johnny Guirke was elected on the third count in Meath West, having topped the poll. Supporters in the hall Trim GAA Club hoisted him on their shoulders alongside a Tricolour and sang Oró, Sé Do Bheatha Abhaile in celebration. “Absolutely delighted. After losing a big area of west Meath where I got 40 per cent of the poll, to come in here and top the poll,” Mr Guirke said. “I’m delighted for the Sinn Féin team, I’m delighted for the party and I’m delighted for myself and my family.” Mr Guirke said he intends to prioritise local issues in the 34th Dáil, including the building of the proposed Navan rail line. “I work hard on the ground. I’m not one of these that looks for media attention. My strengths are on the ground and the people have honoured that today.” On his party’s performance nationwide, he said: “If you said a couple of weeks ago we are where we are today, we’d have taken the hand off you. I think we’re flying across the country.” The counting is continuing with Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín looking likely to be returned next on the back of the transfers independent councillor Noel French, who has been eliminated. That leaves Fianna Fáil councillor Aisling Dempsey (17 per cent) and Fine Gael councillor Linda Nelson Murray (16 per cent) in a fierce battle for the final seat. Just 275 votes separate the women. Fianna Fáil’s James O’Connor, the youngest TD in the 33rd Dáil is in joint 1st place to retain his seat according to tallies but the seats will ultimately come down to transfers, he said pic.twitter.com/ioBxCRaBmv Jade Wilson reports: The first count has been completed in Louth, and Sinn Féin’s Ruairi Ó Murchú topped the poll with 8,728 votes, followed by fellow Sinn Féin candidate Joanna Byrne, who received 8,169 votes. Labour’s Ged Nash is polling third with 7,594 votes. However, no candidate has reached the quota in Louth in the first count, which requires 10,623 votes to be elected. Others following closely behind include Fianna Fáil’s Erin McGreehan at 5,772 votes, and Fine Gael candidate Paula Butterly with 5,646 votes. But John McGahon, who has been involved in controversy over a 2018 assault, now looks unlikely to win a seat for Fine Gael with just 4,021 first preference votes. One candidate, independent David Carroll, was eliminated, with his 40 votes to be redistributed. Taoiseach Simon Harris has just said that it’s unlikely that McGahon will be elected and Paula Butterly is his party’s best chance of winning a seat in Louth, based on the first count returns. Sorcha Pollak writes: Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers and Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly have both been elected to the Dublin West constituency. Mr Chambers secured 9,446 first preference votes, far exceeding the quota of 7,373. Mr Donnelly also exceed the quota on the first count, securing 7,731 votes. The total poll for Dublin West was 44,593 out of an electorate of 78,034, while 357 spoiled votes were registered. The total valid poll was 44,236. A surplus of 2,073 votes will now be distributed in the second count. Fine Gael’s Emer Currie is still on track to secure the constituency’s third seat, with 6,791 first preference votes. Ms Currie is expected to benefit substantially from Mr Chambers’ transfers. PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger is sitting in fourth place, with 3,552 first preference votes, while Green Party Leader Roderic O’Gorman is holding on to fifth place with 2,909. The Green Party leader will be in a huge battle to retain his seat. Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers has topped the poll in the Dublin West count with 9,446 first preference votes, securing the first seat in the constituency. pic.twitter.com/dUujfcu0UD Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly and his family celebrate his election in Dublin West. Donnelly secured the second seat in the constituency in the first count with 7,731 votes, following Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers’ poll topping 9,446. pic.twitter.com/oSSQ56Fntt Kitty Holland reports: Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin is the second Sinn Féin TD home, exceeding the quota in Dublin Mid West, topping the poll with 9,892 first preferences and elected on the first count. The quota in this five-seater is 7,913 on a valid poll of 47,476. He is followed by his running mate, Mark Ward TD, who garnered 5,323 first preferences and who will pick up a substantial number of Ó Broin’s almost 2,000 transfers. Emer Higgins (Fine Gael) is coming in third on 4,798 votes, followed closely by Fianna Fáil’s Shane Moynihan on 4,746. Sitting TD Gino Kenny, People Before Profit, with 2,608 votes is trailing behind Fine Gael’s Vicky Casserly (3,723), Independent Paul Gogarty (3,646) and the Social Democrats’ Eoin Ó Broin (2,907). Kenny’s vote appears to have been squeezed by both a crowded left – including Labour’s Francis Timmons on 2,270 votes, and by the right in his north Clondalkin neighbour, Glen Moore of the Irish Freedom Party, on 1,435 votes and Linda de Courcy of Independent Ireland on 1,823.

Another ballot paper included the message " none of these at all”. In Dublin Bay South some voters wrote down their preferences for actors, singers and celebrities including Abba and American singer and actress Demi Lovati, who appeared on Barney & Friends. Count officials in Dublin Central said there were 127 votes for consideration they believed should be allowed as they displayed them for candidates’ election agents to peruse. They included papers with 1,2 and 3 preferences followed by two ticks. The first three preferences were allowed. Some 11 papers were left blank. In Dublin Bay South one voter showed a liking for sequences marking – 1,2,2 and then 1,2,2 all the way down the list of candidates. And another voter put a tick beside every candidate’s name.

Spoke with Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald - here’s her thoughts on when talks on government formation might start @IrishTimes pic.twitter.com/3GW2NUd7Zi Gordon Deegan reports: Róisin Garvey, the Green Party candidate in Clare has said: “It is hard being a Green as Kermit the Frog used to say.” The Deputy Leader used it to explain the poor General Election poll performance by the Green Party today. Speaking at the count centre at Treacy’s West County hotel in Ennis after posing for photos with the extended Garvey clan, the Inagh native said: “When you are the smallest party in Government you get a kicking and we got a kicking today.” She said: “I am not surprised. I think we were brave to go in as Coalition partners and what happened today has happened historically.” On her own performance, Senator Garvey said that 6 per cent of the first preference vote “is pretty good for a Green in Clare”. She said: “I am very pleased with how I have done.” However, Senator Garvey conceded that the gap between herself and Sinn Féin candidate, Donna McGettigan was too big to make up. She said: “I will do well on transfers but I don’t think I will do well enough. I cannot see myself passing her out.” Jennifer Bray sent us this post on X Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik says hers is a party of “deep roots and green shoots” - says “we are serious about delivering change.” She says govt formation talks will start next weeks and she will first speak to the left @IrishTimes pic.twitter.com/lkXfAHlp3w From Barry Roche, in Cork: Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has romped home on the first count in Cork South Central with over 4,000 votes to spare in what is his second ever vote since he first won a Dáil seat in 1989. Martin polled 14,742 in 2002 when he polled 26.69 of the vote and he was just 226 votes short of that total when he came in on this occasion 14,526 confirming his status as the most popular Fianna Fáil leader in Cork since Jack Lynch. Martin’s huge surplus of 4,075 looks like propelling running mate Seamus McGrath – brother of former Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath, if not over then close to quota with McGrath polling a highly credible 7794 to take second spot. Sinn Féin’s Donnachadh Ó Laoghaire looks poised to hold his seat with 6,947 while Fine Gael are set to hold Simon Coveney’s seat most likely through Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Jerry Buttimer who leads his running mate Shane O’Callaghan by 4407 to 3364. Aside from Martin’s storming home on the first count, the story of Cork South Central is that of Social Democrat Padraig Rice, a native of Camp in West Kerry, who looks to win the Soc Dems’ first seat in Cork City after he polled an impressive 5368. Former Lord Mayor of Cork, Independent Mick Finn is still in with a slim chance of the last seat after he polled 3,582 – ahead of Labour’s Laura Harmon and Sinn Féin’s Michelle Cowhey Shahid, Anna Daly of Aontú, Una McCarthy of Fine Gael and Dr Monica Oikek of the Greens. Returning Officer, Martin Harvey and his staff have begun the second count where they re-examine all Martin’s 14,526 papers to enable them to allocate his 4075 surplus to the remaining 21 candidates on a proportionate basis. Emmet Malone writes: Barry Ward has picked up about 60 per cent of Jennifer Carroll MacNeill’s 551 surplus in dun Laoghaire and is just under 2,500 off joining his running mate in the next Dáil. Carroll MacNeill said she was pleased to see her running mate, Barry Ward, in a strong position to take a second seat for the party in a constituency where it is generally regarded as having let one slip through its fingers last time around. “Two weeks ago we had a poll that showed me in a very, very, very, very strong position in the constituency. So we worked within our Fine Gael community to try to balance out that vote,” Ward finishing third on the first count, initially 2,797 off the quota, she said, had shown the strategy had worked. Elsewhere, she said the party was in contention for two seats in a number of constituencies and could be in for a better day than the exit poll might have suggested but, she said, “I think the best analysis I’ve seen is, ‘there’s a long way to go’.” Regarding her own election, said she was “really thrilled” to be elected again for the constituency and “really proud to be one of the small number of women who will be elected on first counts across the country”. Fianna Fáil’s Cormac Devlin picked up 116 second preference from Carroll MacNeill, the only other candidate to gain in any way significantly. Ossian Smyth picked up 23 transfers and still looks to have a huge fight on his hands to avoid being the constituency’s big loser this time around. Michael O’Doherty (Independent) and Cathy Lynch (The Irish People) are now being eliminated on 344 and 650 votes respectively. We have a comprehensive results hub on The Irish Times website including tables from each constituency. Sarah Burns reports: The first count completed in Dublin Central, and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has topped the poll with 6,389 votes. However, McDonald has just fallen short of the quota and did not get elected on the first count. The other dramatic development has been the showing of Gerard Hutch who is currently lying in fourth place, some 600 votes ahead of Marie Sherlock of Labour. She was followed by Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe with 5,493 votes, the Social Democrat’s Gary Gannon (4,353 votes), Independent Gerard Hutch (3,098 votes), Labour’s Marie Sherlock (2,465 votes), Fianna Fáil’s Mary Fitzpatrick got 2,344 vote and the Green Party’s Neasa Hourigan (1,952 votes). Independent Malachy Steenson received 1,602 first preferences, followed by People Before Profit’s Eoghan Ó Ceannabháin at 1,471, Independent Clare Daly with 1,317 and Sinn Féin’s Janice Boylan with 1,257. Vivienne Clarke is in our count centre in Offaly. Independent TD Carol Nolan has topped the poll in Offaly with 8,282 votes, a little over 1,000 short of the quota of 9,347. Fianna Fáil’s Tony McCormack (6,349) and Fine Gael’s John Clendennen (6,580) look favourites to take the remaining two seats, even though Aoife Masterson of Sinn Féin is also in contention with 6,211 votes. Full Offaly results here. Ellen O’Riordan writes: With 8,820 first preference votes, first time candidate Brian Brennan, a hotelier, has topped the poll as Fine Gael’s sole candidate in this new, three-seat constituency. Senator Malcolm Byrne – one of two Fianna Fáil candidates here – is a close second with 8,311 votes. In third is Sinn Féin councillor and Gaelscoil teacher Fionntán Ó Súilleabháin on 7,719. Fianna Fáil’s second candidate, Pat Kennedy, comes in a bit behind in fourth, with 5,478 votes. The 648 votes of Independent Ireland candidate Frances Lawlor and 168 votes of independent Lise-Marie Nolan will now be distributed, as they have been eliminated. Fine Gael’s James Geoghegan has topped the poll in Dublin Bay South with 6,060 votes in the first count, almost 2,000 short of the quota of 7,957. Labour Party leader Ivana Bacik is second on 5,684 with Jim O’Callaghan of Fianna Fáil in third with 5,536. Chris Andres of Sinn Féin lies fourth with 4,875 with Fine Gael’s second candidate Emma Blain amassing 4,102 votes. The Green Party seat looks at risk as Hazel Chu has 3,250 votes, which will make it difficult for her to retain the seat. The new Social Democrats candidate Eoin Hayes is ahead of her at 3,615 votes. Kate O’Connell, who stood as an independent, received 1,772 votes. The new three-seat constituency will have a new TD. Veteran Fine Gael councillor Willie Aird is to be elected at this first attempt at the Dáil with 9,269 votes. He was first elected as a councillor in 1979. Sitting Fianna Fáil TD Sean Fleming will be comfortably elected and is sitting at 8,123 votes. Brian Stanley, who left Sinn Féin in controversial circumstances, amassed 6,782 votes with a buffer of almost 2,000 votes over the Sinn Féin candidate, Maria McCormack, who garnered 4,914 votes. Darragh O’Brien of Fianna Fáil has topped the poll in Dublin Fingal East with 8,906 votes in the first count, some 500 votes short of the quota. There is a gap of over 3,000 votes between him and the next three candidates: Anne Graves of Sinn Féin, Duncan Smith of Labour and Alan Farrell of Fine Gael. All three are grouped between 5,379 and 5,450. The last two seats will therefrom be determined on transfers, and sitting TD Alan Farrell will find himself in a real battle to hold on to to his seat ahead of Sinn Féin. Sorcha Pollak writes: Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers, who is on track to top the poll in the Dublin West constituency, says he expects his party to “exceed 40 seats” in the general election. Speaking ahead of the first official count, the outgoing Minister for Finance and Fianna Fáil director of elections said it was “clear” his party would exceed the exit poll. “We’re in strong position for gains in many parts of the country, and obviously we have to wait the final counts and the general counting over the next 24 hours,” he said. Fianna Fáil is “in a strong position” and there is “real optimism in the party about possible gains”. Asked whether he would like to be reappointed as Minister for Finance in the next Dáil, Mr Chambers said the conversation was “not about positions” but “about the substance of policies”. “I’m happy to play whatever role I’m asked to say if we form a Government,” he said. Our colleague Jack White recorded Catherine Martin as she arrived at the count centre. She says that she is “very disappointed” with the party’s performance and says her sense it is the old story of the smaller party in Government suffering. She said the party has really delivered this time. She maintained that Roderic O’Gorman and Ossian Smyth remained in contention for the last seats in “very tight” contests. She also said she was still in a battle in Dublin Rathdown. Speaking to reporters at the Dublin Rathdown count in the last few minutes, Catherine Martin said it has been “a very disappointing day for the Green Party.” pic.twitter.com/mc4sAevKtG From David Raleigh: The Fine Gael Minister for Higher Education has been elected on the first count in Limerick county. He won 11,563 votes, some 200 votes above the quota of 11,385. It is likely that the two other seats in the three-seater will be filled by the incumbents, Niall Collins of Fianna Fáil (9,284) and Richard O’Donoghue of Independent Alliance (10,540). The next nearest candidate is Joanne Collins from Sinn Féin on 6,006. Jennifer Bray writes: Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said her “first port of call” when the votes are counted will be to reach out to parties on the left. Speaking in the RDS, McDonald said she felt her party had performed “very well” in the 2024 general election. “The first thing I want to say is to acknowledge every single person right across this state who came out to vote for Sinn Féin. You have given us, again, a powerful and strong mandate and we understand the trust you have placed in us to make life better for you and we are determined to do just that. This has been an incredible performance by all of our candidates. “Over a short number of weeks we have achieved a result that many people a few weeks ago would have thought was impossible, so thank you, thank you to everyone who voted for us. I said in the course of the campaign that I believed another five years of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil is bad news for our society, our communities, for families who are struggling, for our housing crisis and nobody should forget the record homeless number we saw on election day itself. “We are now at a really important decision point for Irish society and politics, and we need change. We intend, when the votes are counted, and when we know the lie of the land, that we will be talking to people about Government.” McDonald said she felt her party had done “very very well.” “We have now confirmed that we have broken the political mould in this state. Two party politics is gone, it has been consigned to the dust bin of history. The question now arises for us, what do we do with that?” “The counts are still under way. We know we are in play in a number of constituencies: five, six, maybe seven. Other parties of the left similarly have secured a mandate. My first port of call will be with those parties.” Jade Wilson writes: Louth is now 100 per cent tallied. Topping the poll is incumbent Ruairí Ó Murchú (SF) at 13.52 per cent, followed by local councillor Joanna Byrne (SF): 13.03 per cent. Then Labour’s Ged Nash, who is at 12.02 per cent followed by Erin McGreehan (FF): 8.97 per cent, Paula Butterly (FG) at 8.83 per cent, and ‘local celebrity’ candidate, Alison Comyn (FF) at 7.78 per cent. On these figures it looks unlikely that John McGahon, on 6.21 per cent, will become a TD. Incumbent Sligo-Leitrim Fine Gael TD Frank Feighan believes his party will form the next Government with Fianna Fáil but left the door open for them to coalesce with any of Labour, the Social Democrats or Independents. After scraping into the Dáil on the 15th Sligo-Leitrim count in 2020, Mr Feighan expects swifter election this time out. The final tally put him leading the pack at 15.8 per cent, although the formal result of the first count is still some hours away. “It’s a great honour to be elected TD for Sligo-Leitrim-south Donegal,” Mr Feighan said at the count centre. “It’s too early to comment but it looks like it may be a good election for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and the numbers will dictate what Government,” he said. “I think the two main parties are there. After that I don’t know will it be Labour or Soc Dems or Independents. That will be a matter for people higher up in my party.” Incumbent Sinn Féin TD Martin Kenny is well-placed to return to the Dáil, as is former Fianna Fáil TD Eamon Scanlon. “I’ll be hopeful that if things fall right for me that I will be able to hang in,” Mr Scanlon said. “I think we’re holding up,” he said of Fianna Fáil’s performance. Independent Ireland candidate Michael Clarke is in contention for the fourth and final seat. But Sinn Féin believes a strong showing in Sligo for Chris MacManus gives it a chance of winning a second seat. Conor Gallagher writes: The first count in Meath West has been completed with no candidates reaching the quota and six being eliminated. Sinn Féin TD Johnny Guirke remains in poll position with 8,604 first preference votes followed closely by Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín on 7,563. Both men look all but certain to retain their seats in the three-seat constituency. Fianna Fáil councillor Aisling Dempsey (6,535) and Fine Gael councillor Linda Nelson Murray (6,164) are in a battle for the final seat. Former Fine Gael turned independent councillor Noel French in fifth on 3,969, followed by Ronan Moore of the Social Democrats on 2,542. Half the field were eliminated on the first count and their second preferences will now be distributed. They include Seamus McMenamin (Green Party), Ben Gilroy (Liberty Republic) and Sandy Gallagher (Labour). Just under 58 per cent of eligible voters cast a ballot. There were 230 spoiled votes. Jennifer Carroll MacNeill has been elected on the first count in Dún Laoghaire with 11,685 votes. She narrowly exceeded the quota of 11.134. Cormac Devlin of Fianna Fáil is in second place (8,831 votes) with Fine Gael’s second candidate Barry Ward lying third with 8,337. People Before Profit’s leader Richard Boyd-Barrett has 6,795 votes and looks poised to take one of the four seats. As of now the Green Party’s Ossian Smyth with 4,297 votes looks like he will lose his seat unless he gathers transfers strongly from other candidates and stays ahead of other candidates of the centre-left. That looks unlikely. A gain for Fine Gael looks likeliest here. Martin Wall writes: Arriving at the Fingal East count he indicated he would like to continue in the housing portfolio. “This is the start of really significant chapter of Fianna Fáil in Dublin In Dublin in particular we are doing well. We will retain what we have and possible gain another three or four additional seat.” “We worked very hard over the last four and a half years to make our country better.” “If fortunate to be part of next Government, I will serve in whatever capacity I am asked to serve in.” “We are making progress in housing. We have a lot more work to do in housing and I would love to be part of that. But that is above my station.” Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald has arrived in the RDS to some pretty loud cheers and a wild scramble. What it’s like being in a scrum for Mary Lou McDonald.. @IrishTimes pic.twitter.com/hmbqjhvBBS It is looking like a good day for the Soc Dems. Deputy leader Cian O’Callaghan indicates that his party is open to talking to arch rivals Labour about government formation pic.twitter.com/O3Akx44j6T Sinn Féin’s Johnny Guirke has topped the poll in Meath West with 8,604 votes, less than 1,000 short of the quota of 9,427. The second placed candidate is Aontú leader Peadar Tóibín who has 7,563. Fianna Fáil Aisling Dempsey is at 6,535 votes ahead of Linda Murray from Fine Gael who is at 6,164 votes. There will be a battle for the third seat between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael with the transfers of Independent Noel French, who got nearly 4,000 votes, and Ronan Moore of the Social Democrats who received 2,542 votes. Carl O’Brien writes: The Social Democrats want to go into Government if the party can secure commitments on key policy areas, the party’s childcare spokesperson Jennifer Whitmore TD said. The party, which hopes to secure at least 10 seats – up from six in the last election – may have a crucial role to play in Government formation talks. “We have been really clear from the get-go: we want to go into Government, but we’re not going to go in just to make up the numbers,” Ms Whitmore said. “If we go in, it is to make real change and achieve real change.” The party has “five non-negotiables” which it would bring into any Government formation talks. They include 50,000 affordable homes; a public childcare system; the roll-out of Sláintecare; a minister for disabilities; delivering on climate change commitments. “We want to make sure we can deliver,” she said. Ms Whitmore looks set to be reelected with a larger personal vote in Wicklow and is set to take third seat in the four-seat Wicklow constituency, according to tallies. What a battle it’s turning out to be. And a slow one. By this time four years ago, the first constituency in the State, Galway East, had already declared its first count – done at about 3.30pm. We are an hour later than that and still no sign of a first count. We are also getting indications from the tallies that the order of the first three parties may be reversed from last night’s exist polls with indications that Fianna Fáil will finish first, Fine Gael second and Sinn Féin third. That said, they were close last night and they are still very close. I was talking to Pat Leahy last night just after our exit poll was published and he said his sense was the Fianna Fáil vote was perhaps a little understated – and he was right. It’s an intriguing battle. All of the parties will lose a few seats but all will make gains with Fianna Fáil poised to be the biggest party in terms of seats, but not too far ahead of Sinn Féin and Fine Gael. The other big stories. Despite getting close to 4 per cent the Greens could end up losing all their 12 seats, almost a worse calamity than 2011. The Social Democrats has done really well and Labour also look like they will make some gains. And then there is the story that will become a headline not just here but abroad ... the possible election of Gerard Hutch to Dáil Éireann. First count from Fingal West coming in now. No one elected but SF’s Louise O’Reilly topped the poll with 6,965 votes – 565 short of the quota of 7,530. Three candidates including Ben Gilroy have been eliminated and their votes will be distributed now. Labour’s Robert O’Donoghue has 5,044, Fine Gael’s Grace Boland 4,583 and Fianna Fáil’s Lorraine Lee-Clifford 4,417. The Carlow/Kilkenny constituency’s final tally indicates that Fianna Fáil’s John McGuiness is likely to top the poll with just more than 9,000 first preference votes and 14 per cent of the vote. Suzanne Pender reports that McGuinness is followed by his Fianna Fáil running mates Jennifer Murnane O’Connor on 7,541 or 11.8 per cent and Peter “Chap” Cleere 6,660 or 10.4 per cent. Fine Gael’s Catherine Callaghan is next, according to tallies, at 6,223 or 9.7 per cent, followed by Sinn Féin’s Áine Gladney Knox at 6,008 or 9.4 per cent of the vote. The tallies indicate that Fine Gael candidates Michael Doyle is at 4,648 or 7.2 per cent while David Fitzgerald is at 4,359 or 6.8 per cent The Green Party’s Malcolm Noonan looks in real danger of loosing his seat with 2,664 or 4.2 per cent while Sinn Féin, with a second candidate Natasha Newsome Drennan on 5,037 or 7.9 per cent, looks likely to hold the seat vacated by MEP Kathleen Funchion. Tallies appear to show that FF will win two seats but are in with a strong chance of securing a third, FG should hold the seat vacated by John Paul Phelan, while Sinn Féin look set to retain its seat. However, with very little separating the top nine candidates, the transfers of the remaining 11 candidates on the ballot paper will determine a lot. You may have noticed that our seat count currently stands at one, with Fianna Fáil allocated that solitary seat. You haven’t missed any first count completions and no TDs have been elected yet. The one in question is Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl who was automatically elected. We are already running behind the timings of the 2020 general election. Last time out the first seat was filled just after 3pm with Galway East doing the honours. It is now 4:20pm with no TDs elected yet. Tallies indicate that Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty will romp home in Donegal with 19,213 first votes with a quota of 12,959. With 99 per cent of Sligo-Leitrim boxes tallied, TDs Martin Kenny of Sinn Féin and Frank Feighan of Fine Gael are well placed for re-election. Former Fianna Fáil TD Eamon Scanlon has good prospects of returning to the Dáil, writes Arthur Beesley. Independent TD Marian Harkin has not polled well, leaving Independent Ireland candidate Michael Clarke well positioned. However, a strong showing in Sligo town for Chris MacManus of Sinn Féin means he may be in contention for a second party seat as left-wing candidates are eliminated. The 99 per cent tally shows Feighan at 15.8 per cent, although he lacks a running mate for Fine Gael transfers. Kenny is at 13.6 per cent, with Mr MacManus at 9.1 per cent. Mr Scanlon has 10.4 per cent, followed by running mates Edel McSharry at 7.8 per cent and Paddy O’Rourke at 7.2 per cent. Ms Harkin’s vote has dropped to 7.6 per cent, according to this tally, down from 11.5 per cent in the 2020 election. Mr Clarke is at 10.5 per cent. Sinn Féin is potentially on target to secure three seats in the five-seater Cavan-Monaghan constituency for the first time in the party’s history, writes Seanin Graham. The final tally of first preference votes put Sinn Féin poll topper Matt Carthy in first place with 13.55 per cent (9371 votes) followed by party colleague, councillor Cathy Bennett, at 10.03 per cent (6936 votes). Bennett, a theatre manager in Monaghan town, fist-pumped a supporter when tally results appeared on a screen at Cavan Leisure Centre. Fine Fáil’s Brendan Smith – and former incumbent – is in third place with 9.58 per cent (6628) followed closely by Sinn Féin’s Pauline Tully at 9.36 per cent (6478). Fifth place is Fianna Fáil Senator and former Garda Robbie Gallagher. Sinn Féin took a political gamble fielding an unprecedented three candidates in this border constituency and much now depends on transfers. Last time around, Tully was elected on the second count following transfers from her running mate, Carthy. The shock departure of Fine Gael Minister Heather Humphreys – who held a seat since 2011 – has the party pinning its hopes on her protégé, Monaghan councillor and undertaker, David Maxwell. However, Maxwell came sixth, at 8.86 per cent (6129 votes). Good news for our man in Waterford Kevin O’Sullivan as the First count is racing ahead. Based on 54,014 (estimated) total votes the quota expected to be circa 10,742 with 58 per cent turnout. The completed tally has David Cullinane (SF) at 11,835 1st prefs (22.4 per cent) and he is set to be elected on the first count; second and third seats look safe for Senator John Cummins (FG) at 10,203 (19.3 per cent); Mary Butler (FF) at 9,894 (18.7 per cent). The last seat looks like a dogfight between Conor McGuinness (SF) at 5,727 (10.8 per cent) and Matt Shanahan (Ind) at 5,218 (9.9 per cent) but don’t rule out Mary Roche (Soc Dems) at 2,631 (5 per cent). While last seat is probably between McGuinness and Shanahan, Roche is expected to be transfer-friendly among parties of left including Marc O Cathaisagh of the Greens - with 1,635 1st prefs (3.1 per cent). It may not be enough to challenge for last seat and if eliminated her votes are expected to benefit Shanahan. The complete tally for the four seat Clare constituency has Senator Timmy Dooley (FF) comfortably topping the poll in Clare. According to Gordon Deegan, the tally of the 180 boxes has the east Clare senator set to return to the Dail after missing out in 2020 on 11,041 tallied first preferences - or 18.29 per cent of the vote - which will leave him around 900 votes shy of the expected quota of around 12,000 votes. Outgoing deputy, Cathal Crowe (FF) is expected to return to the Dail with 13.69 per cent of the vote in a seat gain for Fianna Fail with 8,264 tallied votes in a strong showing for FF. First time General Election candidate, Cllr Joe Cooney (FG) will secure a seat for Fine Gael while Donna McGettigan (SF) is favourite to secure the fourth seat on 12.44 per cent of the vote. A member of Clare Co Council, Cllr McGettigan lies 2,281 tallied votes ahead of nearest competitor, Leonora Carey (FG) who has 5,228 tallied first preferences. Outgoing Independent TD, Violet Anne Wynne has polled only 286 tallied votes and looks likely to be eliminated after the first count. The former Sinn Fein candidate was the story of the 2020 General Election in Clare when she topped the poll taking 15.11 per cent of the first preference vote. The final tally shows FF with 38 per cent of first preferences with FG having 25 per cent followed by SF on 12 per cent. The first count in Galway West is expected “around tea-time’” and when is tea time in Galway West? Well, John Fallon has been told by one experienced member of the counting staff that itmeans “sometime between five and half-seven”. We’re glad we could clear that up. With tallies now complete in Longford-Westmeath there has been a lot of movement at the top of the leaderboard, writes Stephen Farrell. Peter Burke (FG) has moved into first position, followed by Robert Troy (FF) in second and Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran (Ind) in third. Slipping down to fourth position is Micheál Carrigy (FG), with Sorca Clarke (SF) holding fifth position. Also moving down the rankings is sitting TD, Joe Flaherty (FF) who is almost 1800 first preference votes adrift of Clarke and is certainly in a battle to retain his seat. According to the tallies Burke is on 17.7 per cent of the vote with 10,798 votes, followed by Troy on 8,031 votes (13.2 per cent) and Moran who is on 7,992 votes (13.1 per cent). Carrigy, who was flying high in pole position earlier on, has achieved 6,866 votes (11.3 per cent) and is only 27 votes ahead of Clarke. Apathy amongst people in the urban areas has been an issue. “No matter what the results today there will be a strong Green Party in Ireland,” Eamon Ryan has said this afternoon. “We have deep roots in the community and it’s a very distinct political philosophy and I think there is still space for that in Irish politics, for sure.” Mr Ryan said he did not believe his decision to retire, and the timing of his announcement in June this year, had affected the party’s showing. “Unfortunately – and this is just one of those days – we didn’t get the number of votes,” he said. “We’ll look back and see what are the lessons, and what can we learn and what can we do differently. It’s just one of those days when we didn’t have a good day.” Final tally figures show Fine Gael farmer Willie Aird from Portlaoise set to top the poll in Laois, with over 9,000 first preferences, says Carmel Hayes. Sitting TDS Seán Fleming (FF) and Brian Stanley (Ind) look set to take the remaining posts in the three-seat constituency, with Fleming tallying at 7,923 and Stanley at 6,514. While down on his poll-topping performance for Sinn Féin in 2020, Stanley is well placed to retain the seat as an Independent following his controversial departure from the party in October. Sinn Féin’s new candidate Maria McCormack is doing well on 4,712, according to the final tallies but will require huge transfers to have any hope of outrunning her former party colleague. Is this Michael Healy Rae having his say on social media? https://t.co/RMjrQbivGa pic.twitter.com/0COeAEm0Pj Barry Roche has an update from Cork where returning officer Martin Harvey is predicting they will have a first count in Cork North Central at around 6pm. Looking at the tallies, it doesn’t seem likely anyone is going to be elected on the first count in the five seater. Doing a quick tot on the tallies, some 57,055 people voted in Cork North Central – and doing the math, that should mean a quota around 9,509 – which means even the front runners, Padraig O’Sullivan (FF) and Tommy Gould (SF) on 7,470 and 7,129 are each over 2,000 votes shy. It could be a long night in Cork North Central and Cork South Central is likely to be even longer as Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin is set to comfortably clear the quota, meaning count staff will have to recount his estimated 14,000 plus first preference to distribute his surplus proportionately. It is neck and neck in Cork East with three candidates on 12 per cent according to the final tally, reports Liz Dunphy. First time candidate Mark Stanton will be one of the first elected in Cork East for Fine Gael. The 32-year-old from Midleton looks likely to take the seat from his father, long serving TD and former Minister of State David Stanton who has stepped down. Fianna Fáil’s James O’Connor, who was the youngest TD in the 33rd Dáil, and Sinn Fein’s Pat Buckley, who topped the poll in the last general election, are both also on 12 per cent. Fianna Fail councillor Deridre O’Brien and Fine Gael councillor Noel McCarthy are on 11 per cent. But Social Democrats – and former Green Party councillor - Liam Quaide is also still in the running for a seat, depending on transfers, as is Independent and former Fianna Fáil councillor William O’Leary who are both on 10 per cent. Independent Mary Linehan Foley, former Fianna Fail councillor and county mayor, is on 8% Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are both on 23% of the vote; ‘Others’ which are essentially independents, are on 27%; Sinn Féin is on 13%; and the Social Democrats are on 10%. The Green Party is on 3%. In the four seat constituency, two of the incumbents are not challenging for their seats. Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers is safely on track to secure the Dublin West’s first seat and be elected by 4pm today, writes Sorcha Pollak. It’s expected most of his transfers, numbering around 3,000 votes, will be divided between his running mate Lorna Nolan and Fine Gael’s Emer Currie. Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly is due to clinch the constituency’s second seat on first preferences, while Ms Currie is expected to be elected to the third seat on the second count. Her transfers are forecast to go to the Green Party’s Roderic Gorman who is fighting to secure the 5th seat in the constituency. PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger remains comfortably in fourth place, while Labour’s John Walsh and Aontú's Ellen Troy’s are currently sitting in joint sixth place. It is looking like a good day for the Soc Dems. Deputy leader Cian O’Callaghan indicates that his party is open to talking to arch rivals Labour about government formation pic.twitter.com/O3Akx44j6T Green Party Minister of State Joe O’Brien has acknowledged that he will not be returning to the next Dail, writes Martin Wall. Speaking at the Fingal West count centre in north Dublin the junior minister at Department of Rural and Community Development and at the Department of Social Protection said: “Clearly I have lost my seat anyway. " He said the key issue was the re-drawing of the constituency . The previous five-seat Dublin Fingal has now been broken into two three-seat constituencies, Fingal East and Fingal West. “I lost over half of my base and then the tide was out. The combination of those things was going to make it difficult.” Mr O’Brien said he hoped the Green Party was not wiped out completely. “We are under pressure everywhere but I hope we hold on to a few seats so that the things we got done in the last four and a half years do not slip away in the next Dail.” “We knew going in four or five years ago that there was a strong chance that a bunch of us would lose out seats, which made us extra foused on getting things done. We knew that risk. We had hoped our level of achievement would push that back. Maybe it will. We have to see how things pan out.” Paul Donnelly has said his party should be open to “talking to whomever” when it comes to Government formation, reports Sorcha Pollak The Sinn Féin TD, who topped the poll in 2020 and is on track to secure the second seat in Dublin West, said the constituency’s third, fourth and fifth seats would “go down to a couple of 100 votes”. Once the party has a clearer idea of how many seats it has nationally, then the talks can begin, he said. “I think people should be open to talking to whomever, because it’s about the people. And the people speak in the in the general elections, they give their voice, and it’s up to us to make sure that that voice is heard.” Mr Donnelly said it had been a “tough campaign” but that canvassers had succeeded in convincing people “that there is a different way, and that we can change the way that we run this country, and we can change it in terms of housing, in terms of health and education.” “Across the state, there are opportunities for Sinn Féin, those towards fourth, fifth seats, which we didn’t take the last time. We ran a very important campaign in terms of giving people choice.” In Louth, a 5-seater, it is looking like at least 2 Sinn Féin, 1 Labour so far. Other 2 still too close to call. First count a way off yet in the constituency with the longest ballot in the country (24 candidates). The Social Democrats are set to top the poll in Dublin Bay North based on the tally estimate of 15 per cent of the vote for their housing spokesman Cian O’Callaghan, writes Marie O’Halloran. Sinn Féin TD Denise Mitchell is in a comfortable second place with 14 per cent, down from her whopping 29.8 per cent in 2020 but with a running mate this time around, the party is on 20 per cent. Fianna Fáil’s Tom Brabazon is on 10 per cent of the tally and 18 per cent in total for the party’s two candidates. Fine Gael’s Naoise Ó Muirí is in fourth place on 9 per cent followed jointly by Fianna Fáil’s Deirdre Heney and Fine Gael’s Aoibhinn Tormey, both on 8 per cent. Independent Barry Heneghan and Sinn Féin’s Micheál MacDonncha are both on 6 per cent, while Labour’s Shane Folan and Aontú's James Morris both have 4 per cent of the tally. Green Party candidate David Healy, People Before Profit’s Bernard Mulvany and Independent John Lyons are all on 3 per cent. Early predictions suggest seats for Cian O’Callaghan (SocDem), Denise Mitchell (Sinn Féin), Tom Brabazon (FF) and Naoise Ó Muirí (FG) with a battle for the fifth seat, mainly between Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin and Independent Barry Heneghan. It looks like a very difficult mountain to climb for Labour’s Shane Folan to keep the seat held by the party’s new MEP Aodhán Ó Riordáin and for Independent John Lyons without phenomenal transfers. Tough day for the outgoing TD. Former Green Party leader Eamon Ryan on a poor election for his party: “It’s been a hard day for us but we’re resilient and we will come back”. pic.twitter.com/wvDXy0ljNi Barry Roche has the latest from Cork. With over 80 per cent of votes in Cork South Central tallied, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin is on course to be elected on the first count with almost 25 per cent of first preference with running mate Seamus McGrath on 8.8 per cent and Sinn Fein’s Donnachadh O’Laoighaire on 11.5 per cent set to follow him home. The final two seats look to be between Padraig Rice of the Social Democrats on 9 per cent and Jerry Buttimer of Fine Gael with Independent Mick Finn on 6.5 per cent and Fine Gael’s Shane O’Callaghan on 6.4 per cent also in with a shout and Labour’s Laura Harmon on 5 per cent still in with a slim chance. Much will depend on Martin’s surplus and where it goes especially in terms of how much goes to the lower placed runners such as Fianna Fail’s Margaret Kenneally, Una McCarthy of Fine Gael and Dr Monica Oikek of the Greens which will affect the sequence of their elimination. Their elimination along with that of Sinn Fein’s Michelle Cowhey Shahid and Anna Daley of Aontu will in turn be critical – is there a chance that all five women might transfer in numbers to the likely last remaining woman in the race, Laura Harmon of Labour ? Time will tell. Diarmuid Ferriter’s surgical evisceration of much of our political class is well worth a read. First triumphant video of the day... it won’t be the last. Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly, who is on track to secure the constituency’s second seat, arrives at the Dublin West count centre. Mr Donnelly received 17% of the first preference votes and is set to exceed the quota on the first count. #GeneralElection2024 pic.twitter.com/YshjN6jBiE Now you know. My best piece of Monk trivial is I used to serve him when I worked in a chipper in the inner city. His order was a regular burger with extra onions (€2.60) Senator Martin Conway (FG) says “it is clear now” that first time Fine Gael general election candidate, Cllr Joe Cooney (FG) will secure a seat for Fine Gael in the four seat Clare constituency, reports Gordon Deegan Speaking at the count centre at Treacy’s West County Hotel in Ennis, Senator Conway said that Cllr Cooney’s election campaign “catured the imagination in Clare”. The north Clare based Senator Conway made his general election prediction as the latest tallies give Cllr Cooney 13 per cent of the vote, lying in second overall place in the tallied vote in Clare. In a strong showing for Government party candidates, they have secured 70 per cent of first preference votes in the tally with three FF candidates securing 37 per cent - more than double the 19.5 per cent share of the vote that the party is predicted to receive nationally by the General Election 2024 Exit Poll. Senator Timmy Dooley (FF) remains out front with 20.5 per cent of the vote and will regain the seat he lost in 2020. Sitting TD, Cathal Crowe’s (FF) tallied percentage vote has increased as the tally has continued with now 10.5 per cent of the vote. Sinn Fein candidate, Cllr Donna McGettigan has a strong shout of securing one of the final seats in Clare with the tally showing that the Shannon woman has 10.9 per cent of the vote. Senator Conway said that party colleague Leonora Carey will be in the shake up for the final seat and the sister of retired TD, Joe Carey (FG) has 8.5 per cent of the vote. Michael Lowry is still the clear favourite to top the poll in Tipperary North with 27.3 per cent of the tallies so far, followed by Alan Kelly who has 15.1per cent, according to Neil Michael. The Labour TD had shown a poor start in early tallies, but he has since overtaken Fianna Fail’s Ryan Meara, who is in third place with 13 per cent. In Tipperary South, Mattie McGrath is still topping the poll, with 25 per cent of tallies, followed by Fine Gael’s Michael Murphy, who has 20.8 per cent. While veteran Seamus Healy had a clear chance at a third place earlier in the day, he has since been overtaken by Fianna Fail’s Imelda Goldsboro, who has 13.4 per cent. of tallies, compared to his 11.6 per cent.. Closely behind Mr Healy is Sinn Fein’s outgoing TD Martin Browne, who has 11.4 per cent.. With all boxes tallied in Dublin Bay South it looks increasingly difficult for the Greens to hold former party leader Eamon Ryan’s seat, writes Marie O’Halloran. On the figures Cllr Hazel Chu is in seventh place on 8.3 per cent in the four-seat constituency. Fine Gael’s James Geoghegan looks set to top the poll on 15.3 per cent with his party colleague Emma Blain in fifth on 10.4 per cent. Labour leader Ivana Bacik is in a comfortable second place on 14.4 per cent with Fianna Fáil’s Jim O’Callaghan on 13.8 per cent and Sinn Féin’s Chris Andrews on 12.1 per cent. Social Democrats Cllr Eoin Hayes has 9.1 per cent of the vote ahead, 0.8 per cent ahead of Ms Chu. Independent and former Fine Gael TD Kate O’Connell is on 4.4per cent, dashing her dream of returning as a TD for the constituency. With the health warning that it is the tally, not the full count or any transfers included, it looks like Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin will return TDs to Dublni Bay South. The final tally is in for Galway East reports Cian O’Connell and looking nailed on for seats are Albert Dolan (FF) on 19 per cent and Seán Canney (IND) on 18.4 per cent, though neither look set to be elected on the first count, with a quota of around 10,400 votes required. The battle for the two remaining seats in the constituency is difficult to call. Louis O’Hara (SF) is on 13.7 per cent but may struggle for transfers down the line. Anne Rabbitte (FF) has not polled as well as expected on 7.5 per cent but could recover through transfers after her fellow party member’s impressive, poll-topping performance. Pete Roche (FG) on 9.8 per cent is also in the race, polling ahead of FG’s two other candidates Clodagh Higgins on 6.4 per cent and Niamh Madden on 5 per cent. So too is independent Declan Geraghty, who is currently on 9.5 per cent. Labour may well be on course to win a seat in Cork North Central with Mallow based Cllr Eoghan Kenny on 5,63 per cent and breathing down the neck of outgoing PBPS TD Mick Barry who is on 6 per cent with all 160 boxes tallied, reports Barry Roche. Kenny’s running mate, Cllr John Maher from Mayfield is on 4.54 per cent and could leapfrog Kenny but the combined vote of 10.17 per cent means that Labour must favoured to take a seat at the expense of Barry who may benefit whose two candidates will have almost 6 per cent of votes to distribute. Otherwise sitting TDs, Padraig O’Sullivan of Fianna Fail, Tommy Gould of Sinn Fein and Colm Burke of Fine Gael on our course to hold their seat along with Independent Ireland’s Ken O’Flynn who is on 9.82 per cent of first preferences. With just over half of boxes in the Longford Westmeath constituency counted so far the Fianna Fáil vote is down over 10 per cent on the vote the party received in 2020, reports Stephen Farrell. Four years ago Fianna Fáil received almost ten thousand votes but so far have only garnered 3,451 votes. While this has been reflected in the vote that both Fianna Fáil candidates, Westmeath based Robert Troy and Longford based Joe Flaherty, have received, there are also areas where both candidates have polled well. With 55 per cent of votes counted Senator Micheál Carrigy (FG) is in first position with 15.2 per cent of the vote, followed by his party running mate and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Peter Burke who is on 14.7 per cent. In third place is Independent candidate Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran on 12.3 per cent, while sitting TD Joe Flaherty is in fourth on 11.1 per cent and Sorca Clarke (SF), also a sitting TD, is in fifth position on 10.7 per cent. Indications so far are that turnout in the constituency has been disappointing, at 50.2 per cent, with a higher turnout in Westmeath. The Longford town area turnout has registered at just 41 per cent so far, while Ballymahon is registering just over 60 per cent. A third of the way through the tallies in Kerry, Michael Healy-Rae is a clear leader in the five seater single constituency, writes Anne Lucy. He has over 23 per cent of the first preference vote, just under a quarter, according to the tally of first preference votes. After him candidates are bunched - Sinn Féin justice spokesman Pa Daly is at 14 per cent; Education Minister Norma Foley (FF) at just under 13 per cent; and Danny Healy-Rae (Ind) is at 12.2 per cent. The real interest here is on an emerging battle between Fine Gael candidate, former footballer Billy O’Shea and Fianna Fáil councillor Michael Cahill - both are on par at 10.8 per cent and 10.2 per cent respectively and are likely to fight for the last seat. The third Fianna Fáíl candidate Linda Gordon-Keller is at just 2.7 per cent. Labour’s Mike Kennedy - the party once held two seats in Kerry, most notable was Dick Spring - is at 2.7 per cent; former Fianna Fail TD and now with Independent Ireland Thomas McEllistrim is at 1.2 per cent and Green candidate Cleo Murphy is at 2.6 per cent, a drop of support for her on her second time out. We have some news in from Donegal courtesy of Stephen Maguire. The Fine Gael vote in Donegal has dropped considerably. Tallying is only halfway through but candidates John McNulty and Nikki Bradley are not tallying well enough to be even considered. Barring a miracle, Donegal will be without a Fine Gael TD for the first time since 1937. The tallies for Dublin South West are in and it is not surprise that veteran Sinn Féin TD Seán Crowe is topping the poll, says Ronan McGreevy. He is on 14.8 per cent of the first preference vote, but his vote is half what it was in 2020 when he topped the poll with a 29.72 per cent share and a massive 20,077 first preferences. Dublin South West was one of the constituencies where Sinn Féin could have got a second seat had Crowe a running mate. This time he has one in South Dublin County Councillor Niamh Whelan. She has polled 6 per cent of first preference. Combined though the two Sinn Féin candidates are on 21 per cent of the vote, still well down on 2020. Fine Gael’s Colm Brophy on 12.7 per cent and Fianna Fáil’s John Lahart on 12.4 per cent are expected to be re-elected. The last two seats are between five candidates, Labour’s Cllr Ciaran Ahern on 8.7 per cent, outgoing People Before Profit TD Paul Murphy, who is on 7.6 per cent of the first preferences – an improvement from last time out, Fianna Fáil councillor Teresa Costello who is polling very well at 7.1 per cent, Cllr Sarah Barnes, the daughter of former Fine Gael minister Monica Barnes, who is on 6.6 per cent of the first preference vote and also in the mix is the Social Democrats Ross O’Mullane on 5.8 per cent. The big story in the Dublin South West constituency is the collapse in support for Green Party TD Noel Francis Duffy. He has just 2.9 per cent of the first preference vote. In 2020 he achieved 7.34 per cent. He came to prominence in the election campaign when it was revealed that he objected to a housing development in his constituency of 330 homes because they overlooked his kitchen. He claimed that he was not objecting to the development completely, just the bits that contravened the local development plan. Crowe (SF) - 14.8% Brophy (FG) - 12.7% Lahart (FF) - 12.4% Ahern (LAB) - 8.7% Murphy (PBP-S) - 7.6% Costello (FF) - 7.1% Barnes (FG) - 6.5% Whelan (SF) - 6.0% O’Mullane (SD) - 5.8% Edge (IND) - 5.4% Ní Chónaráin (AON) - 3.8% Holohan (IND) - 3.6% Duffy (GP) - 2.9% Mac Oireachtaigh (NP) - 2.1% Hade (IND) - 0.2% O’Keeffe(IND) - 0.2% Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman says he only expects his party to secure between 2-3 seats in the 2024 general election, down from the 12 TDs currently in Gov. “It's clear the Green Party has not had a good day", he told media at Dublin West count centre. Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman has said “it is clear that the Green Party have not had a good day”. Speaking at lunchtime he acknowledged that it is clear a number of his party colleagues will lose their Dáil seats. “Undoubtedly, it is a disappointing result for our party today,” he told reporters. He said it is “hard for a smaller party in Government” and that has “long been the tradition in Ireland”. Social Democrats outgoing TD Gary Gannon, who is looking good for the third seat in Dublin Central, has said the vote for Gerry Hutch is a reflection of how poorly working class communities have been treated for many years. Speaking on RTE Radio he said that “when people are in a dark place they’ll search for very strange options and that’s what happened here. That’s a plague on all of our houses, it’s a reflection of politics as a whole. “For those of us who actually went into the communities and did the work there’s a little bit of a vindication but I think we’ve all got a job to do. Gannon pointed to the “huge level of media” Gerry Hutch received which he said was “disproportionate”. “He had access to one of the most popular podcasts in the country over the course of three episodes, that makes a huge difference.” With 100 per cent of boxes tallied in Dublin North West, Dessie Ellis looks certain to again top the poll with 17 per cent of the 1st preference vote, writes Olivia Kelly. Unlike last time out he is potentially on track to bring in a running mate with former Dublin city councillor Cathleen Carney Boud on 14 per cent. If two seats go to Sinn Féin in this three-seater, that seems to leave the scrap for the last seat between Fianna Fáil’s sitting TD Paul McAuliffe and newcomer Social Democrats Rory Hearn both, also, on 14 per cent of the first preferences. Former Fine Gael TD Noel Rock, who lost his seat here in 2020 is behind on 12 per cent. Conor Reddy of People Before Profit/Solidarity who almost got a seat last time out taking the lion’s share of Ellis’s transfers is on 9 per cent, and is likely to suffer from the appearance of Carney Boud on the ballot paper. Independent Gavin Pepper is on 6 per cent, followed by Aontu’s Edward MacManus and Independent Stephen Redmond both on 4 per cent. Former Green Party Lord Mayor Caroline Conroy is on 3 per cent, with Centre Party Ian Croft and Independent Diarmuid Mac Dubhghlais both on 1 per cent. Early tallies in Cavan-Monaghan has Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy nailed on with 20 per cent of the vote. writes Seanin Graham. Almost half of the 260 boxes have been opened and in second place is Fianna Fáil’s Niamh Smyth followed by Fine Gael’s David Maxwell, Aontú's Sarah O’Reilly and Fianna Fáil’s Robbie Gallager. One Sinn Féin source said he is confident that the party’s Pauline Tully will retain a second seat for the party – and possibly gain a third in the republican border county constituency. “We’re going to fasten down two – and it’s too early to dismiss the chance of a third seat,” he said. Last month’s shock departure of Fine Gael minister Heather Humphreys – who held a seat since 2011 - led Sinn Féin to field a late candidate, councillor Cathy Bennett, a theatre manager in Monaghan town. Ossian Smyth is among the senior Green Party figures looking to be in real trouble after all of the boxes were opened in Dún Laoghaire and the tallies completed, reports Emmet Malone. Smyth, a Minister of State in the current government, is reckoned to on just 7.5 per cent, roughly half the first preference vote of Barry Ward who some had seen as potentially a rival for the constituency’s fourth seat. Ward is on 14.9 per cent and should benefit from Jennifer Carroll MacNeill’s projected first count surplus of about 1,000 votes. Another one who was regarded as possibly being destined for the fourth seat dogfight was Cormac Devlin of Fianna Fáil but he has polled well, with the tallies putting him on 15.8 per cent, high enough to ease the party’s concerns about where he might get transfers. As it is, party sources believe he is picking up a healthy number of Fine Gael second preferences in some areas and there would be an expected boost when Aontú Mairéad Tóibín is eliminated. Richie Boyd Barrett is on 12.3 per cent but would be expected to do well from Sinn Féin transfers in the event Shane O’Neill is eliminated but Smyth’s route back from the brink is unclear. He looks to have stayed ahead of Social Democrat, Hugo Mills, but only just and he needs an awful lot of transfers from him and Labour’s Martha Fanning to have a chance of surviving. Cork South West may prove to be a bastion of political stability with all three incumbents looking very likely to retain their seats, according to current tallies with 66 per cent of boxes now open in Mallow GAA grounds, reports Liz Dunphy. Independent Ireland leader Micheal Collins is currently in the lead with 25 per cent of the vote followed by Social Democrat leader Holly Cairns, who gave birth to a baby girl on polling day yesterday. Ms Cairns is in second place to take a seat according to current tallies on 20.1 per cent of the vote. Fianna Fail’s TD Christopher O’Sullivan is coming in to take the third and last seat with 19.2 per cent of the vote according to current tallies. But Fine Gael, between its two candidates Senator Tim Lombard on 9 per cent of the vote and Noel O’Donovan on 12.9 per cent of the vote are currently the county’s leading party with 22 per cent of the total vote, sounding some caution for Mr O’Sullivan and Ms Cairns as these candidates will most likely transfer votes in later rounds to each other. With all boxes now opened and tallied in Dublin Rathdown, Green Party minister Catherine Martin could be in danger of losing her seat, according to Jack White. Fine Gael, meanwhile, look set to retain their two seats, despite Josepha Madigan’s retirement from politics. Minister of State Neale Richmond leads the tally results with 20 per cent, followed by Fine Gael councillor Maeve O’Connell (13 per cent). Fianna Fáil councillor Shay Brennan ended at 12 per cent in the cross-party tally, while independent councillor Michael Fleming and Social Democrats candidate Sinéad Gibney find themselves at 9 per cent. Although minimally behind Ms Gibney, the Green Party’s Catherine Martin faces losing her seat at 8 per cent. Sinn Féin’s Shaun Tracey ended at 7 per cent, while former Fine Gael minister and now-independent candidate Alan Shatter ended at 4 per cent, according to the tally results, which noted a turnout of 59 per cent. It appears that Green Party TD Francis Noel Duffy will lose his seat in Dublin South West, writes Ronan McGreevy. The husband of Government minister Catherine Martin has just 2.8 per cent of the vote in the constituency with 82 per cent of the tallies done. He came to prominence in the election campaign when it emerged that he objected to 330 homes in his own constituency which he claimed was overlooking his home. He claimed the development overlooked his kitchen. This is a pretty sobering tweet for the Green Party. If, as looks possible, Greens lose all their Dáil seats, it’s a salutary warning to Labour and Social Dems who will come under fierce pressure to go into government with FF and FG. The Greens did a lot better in this last government than they did previously but to no avail #GE24 All boxes are open in Dublin West and Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers and Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly are set to secure the first two seats, reports Sorcha Pollak. With 100 per cent of boxes tallied, Mr Chambers had secured 22 per cent of first preference votes (9,396 votes) followed by Mr Donnelly with 17 per cent of votes (7,631). The estimated quota for the constituency based on the opening of all boxes is 7,281. In a solid third place is Fine Gael Senator Emer Currie who is on track to secure the third vote in the constituency, with 15 per cent of first preference votes (6,663). PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger remains on eight per cent while Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman is holding onto a marginal lead of seven per cent to secure the fifth seat in this constituency. Labour’s John Walsh and Aontú's Ellen Troy’s are holding a joint six per cent of first preference votes. About 57.1 per cent of Dublin West registered voters cast a ballot in this general election, closely mirror national turnout of 56.35 per cent. “It’s really scary at this stage, just watching the boxes being opened,” Cork North West Fianna Fáil TD Aindrias Moynihan on the tally at Mallow GAA #GE24 ⁦@irishexaminer⁩ pic.twitter.com/CjMI8k3Di3 Ireland First leader Derek Blighe, who is running in Cork North Central, expects Independent Ireland’s Ken O’Flynn to be the main beneficiary when he is eliminated from the poll after polling, according to tallies, approximately 4 per cent of first preferences “I’m happy with how I’m doing so far – I canvassed all over, I did Mallow, I did the northside of the city, Glanmire, Watergrasshill, Glenville, Carrignavar, Whitechurch – I’m only just in but I got a decent amount of support in Mallow and a decent amount of support on the Northside. “The way it’s looking at the moment, I’m not going to make it – I would imagine a lot of votes will go to Ken O’Flynn, some might go to Sinn Fein – after that, I don’t know,” Blighe told The Irish Times at the Nemo Rangers Count Centre in Cork. Pat Leahy has a moment in time assessment of the state of play. In the four-seat Cork East constituency with 25 per cent of the boxes open Fianna Fáil’s Deirdre O’Brien is the early front runner on 13.6 per. cent followed closely by Sinn Féin’s Pat Buckley and independent Mary Linehan Foley both on 11 per cent, writes David Forsythe. Also in the mix are Noel McCarthy (FG) and James O’Connor (FF) both on 10 per cent of the vote. Independent Willie O’Leary, Social Democrats Liam Quaide and Mark Stanton of Fine Gael are all on 9 per cent. With more than a third of boxes open at the Waterford Count, it is clear five candidates are in a battle for four seats, with Sinn Fein led by David Cullinane topping the poll by a decisive margin – and Green Party outgoing TD Marc O Cathasigh unlikely to retain his seat, reports Kevin O’Sullivan. The tallies indicate that if Sinn Fein transfers strongly with Cullinane, based in Waterford City having a big surplus, Cllr Conor McGuinness based in Dungarvan could take a second seat for the party. He is also polling strongly in western parts of the constituency. By mid-morning, Cullinane has 28 per cent of the vote with Sinn Fein at 36 per cent, while outgoing Fianna Fail TD Mary Butler had 17 per cent of the vote and is likely to be re-elected. With 18 per cent of the vote, Senator John Cummins is expected to win back a Fine Gael seat lost in 2020. Its expected outgoing independent TD Matt Shanahan (10.7 per cent) will be in a battle with McGuinness for the final seat. Labour’s Sadhbh O’Neill was at 2.8 per cent and Mary Roche of the Social Democrats at 6 per cent. The sorting of votes is now well underway in Mallow GAA ground where ballots from the three Cork county constituencies are being counted, writes Liz Dunphy Fianna Fáil TD Aindrias Moynihan said that initial tallies show “a lot of uncertainty” regarding the retention of his seat. “It’s all up in the air. It’s really scary at this stage, just watching those boxes being opened,” he said. “I’ve seen a few snapshots and it’s really tight at this stage.” “Everything” for him is riding on winning a seat, he said. The three constituencies being counted in Mallow are the four seat constituency of Cork East and the three seat constituencies of Cork North West and Cork South West. As expected, with roughly two thirds of boxes tallied in Galway East, outgoing independent TD Seán Canney looks set to comfortably retain his seat having so far accumulated 25 per cent of first preference votes. writes Cian O’Connell. Minister of State Anne Rabbitte (7 per cent) is facing a battle, with fellow Fianna Fáil candidate Albert Dolan (15 per cent) in a strong position. Mr Dolan looks likely to take the second of four seats in the constituency. Fine Gael’s Pete Roche (10 per cent) is currently outperforming his party’s other candidates Niamh Madden (5.5 per cent) and Clodagh Higgins (5.7 per cent). It is still early days, but Mr Roche should benefit from transfers down the line to claim a seat. Sinn Féin’s Louis O’Hara (13 per cent), who narrowly missed out on a shock win in 2020, has started positively. A strong showing in Tuam augurs well for the Athenry native, though he may struggle to compete with rival candidates on transfers. Votes from Athenry are among those yet to be counted, where Mr O’Hara will be hoping for another boost. We have some updated tallies in. First up is Martin Wall. The chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party Alan Farrell is in a battle to retain his seat in the new constituency of Fingal East. Tally figures suggest that Farrell is slightly behind Ann Graves of Sinn Féin. With all boxes open in Fingal East, tally figures suggested that Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien is set to top and poll. Tally figures indicate that O’Brien has received about 23 per cent of the first preference votes. According to the tally figures Farrell is running about 65 votes behind Graves who narrowly lost out on a seat in the local elections earlier this year. Just slightly ahead is out-going TD Duncan Smith of the Labour Party. Tally figures suggest that Graves is on 14.6 per cent, Smith on 14.5 per cent and Farrell on 14.4 per cent. Mick Wallace, who entered the race late on, looks to be out of the running in Wexford. KILDARE SOUTH It's very early doors, but former Sinn Féin TD Patricia Ryan looks to be in serious trouble. With 18pc of boxes tallied, Ryan is polling at less that 1pc. Ryan resigned from Sinn Féin in October 2024.#ge24 @irishtimes Outgoing Minister for Justice Helen McEntee is topping the polls in the Meath East constituency, according to early tallies. Shauna Bowers reports that a total of 25 of 127 boxes have been tallied to date, meaning there are health warnings attached to the indications. McEntee, Fianna Fáil’s Thomas Byrne and Sinn Féin’s Darren O’Rourke are the incumbents in the constituency. The boxes opened to date would geographically favour Ms McEntee and Mr Byrne. As it stands, McEntee has 21 per cent of votes, followed by Byrne at 13 per cent, and O’Rourke close by at 12 per cent. The Sinn Féin candidate was the first elected in the area in the 2020 election. The constituency has seen the number of seats it holds upgraded to four from three, with a number of candidates currently neck and neck to claim the final seat. Both Sinn Féin’s Maria White and Fine Gael’s Sharon Tolan currently stand at 9 per cent, while Fianna Fáil’s Caroline O’Reilly is at 7 per cent. Aontú's Emer Tóibín, the sister of party leader Peadar Tóibín, is at 6 per cent. In total, Fine Gael currently has 29 per cent of votes, followed by Sinn Féin at 22 per cent and Fianna Fáil at 19 per cent. Early days, but here are those leading the tallies for Louth so far, with 26% tallied: Joanna Byrne (SF) 15.30%Ged Nash (LAB) 12.25%Ruairí Ó Murchu (SF) 11.08%Erin McGreehan (FF) 8.98%Paula Butterly (FG) 8.72%Alison Comyn (FF) 8.09%#Election2024 Gino Kenny of People Before Profit looks set for a rollercoaster battle to keep his seat in Dublin Mid West, writes Kitty Holland. With almost all 126 boxes tallied in this five-seat constituency, Sinn Féin’s two TDs here, Eoin Ó Broin and Mark Ward, are powering ahead on 21.4 per cent and 12.6 per cent respectively. Fine Gael’s Emer Higgins is close behind on 9.5 per cent, with Fianna Fáil’s Shane Moynihan on 9.1 per cent. It looks like a battle royale for the fifth seat, between Francis Timmons (Labour) on 5.2 per cent; Eoin Ó Broin (Social Democrats) 6.1 per cent; Gino Kenny on 5.6 per cent and Paul Gogarty (Independent) 6.9 per cent. It appears Kenny’s vote has been squeezed by both the Social Democrats and his neighbour in Clondalkin Glen Moore, running for the Irish Freedom Party, who is on 3.3 per cent. And we have more in from Dublin West where Roderic O’Gorman is in trouble, reports Sorcha Pollak. Fianna Fáil’s Jack Chambers and Sinn Féin’s Paul Donnelly were leading the charge by 11am with 58 per cent of boxes open. Fianna Fáil deputy leader Jack Chambers is currently at 21 per cent, followed by Mr Donnelly at 19 per cent. Fine Gael Senator Emer Currie is at 13 per cent, PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger is at 8 per cent with Green Party leader Roderic O’Gorman and Labour’s John Walsh Green Party both holding 6 per cent. With a population of 138,547, Dublin West is one of the fastest growing constituencies in the country and has five seats up for grabs in this general election. All the boxes in Dublin Central have now been opened. The tally figures have Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald at 20 per cent, Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe at 17 per cent, Social Democrats Gary Gannon at 13 per cent, Independent Gerard Hutch at 9 per cent, Labour’s Marie Sherlock at 7 per cent, Fianna Fáil’s Mary Fitzpatrick at 7 per cent, Green’s Neasa Hourigan at 6 per cent and Independent Malachy Steenson at 5 per cent. Janice Boylan (SF) and Clare Daly (Ind) and Eoghan Ó Ceannabhain (PBP) all at 4 per cent Sinn Féin is on track for 40-plus seats, Martin Kenny has told Arthur Beesley in Sligo The TD pointed to a “little swing” in the last two days of the campaign which could see the party increasing its Dáil presence from 37. Mr Kenny is on course for a smooth re-election in Sligo-Leitrim, with running mate Chris MacManus in the hunt for a second party seat. “We felt a little swing in the last couple of days. We could feel it coming along. Certainly in the last week the difference was there. We could see it building,” he said in the count centre after tallying Sligo boxes. “We’re going to get probably over the 40 seats nationally – and how many over that, it could be down to transfers for the last seat in a lot of the constituencies. So we’re happy enough from that perspective from what we were last June in a poor enough local election.” The chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party Alan Farrell is facing a battle to retain his seat in Fingal East, writes Martin Wall. With more 80 per cent of boxes now open, tally figures suggest he is neck and neck with Ann Graves of Sinn Féin. Each have just more than 14 per cent. Fianna Fáil’s Darragh O’Brien seems set to top the poll. Former Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley, who controversially left the party in October, is polling strongly across the county according to early tallies, as he bids to regain a seat as an Independent. Early indications are that Willie Aird (FG) and Minister of State Seán Fleming (FF) are also performing well. Elaine Mullally (Ind), Maria McCormack (SF) and former FG councillor Aisling Moran (Ind) are also pulling in votes from across the three-seat constituency. Minister of State Ossian Smyth facing a battle to retain his seat in Dún Laoghaire with the Green Party candidate on just over 7.5 per cent, reports Emmet Malone. Fine Gael on about 34 per cent combined with party sources saying Blackrock and Wyvern boxes currently being opened having the potential to boost that slightly. Jennifer Caroll MacNeill currently on course to be elected on first count and they feel if Ward can add a percentage point or two to his 12.7 per cent he would be in a. good position to take the fourth seat. The Taoiseach Simon Harris is on course to top the poll in Wicklow while Fianna Fáil Minister for Health is facing a battle to retain his seat, writes Carl O’Brien. Based on just over a quarter of boxes tallied, Mr Harris is in first place (28 per cent), followed by Sinn Féin’s John Brady (15 per cent) and Social Democrats’ Jennifer Whitmore in third (14 per cent). There looks to be a battle for the final seat in the four-seater constituency between Fine Gael’s Edward Timmins in fourth (6.8 per cent) and Fianna Fáil’s Stephen Donnelly (6.6 per cent) in fifth. Joe Behan (Ind) is further behind (4 per cent), followed by sitting Green Party TD Steven Matthews (3.6 per cent), who looks set to lose his seat on what looks like a miserable day for party. Former Fine Gael minister and retiring TD Richard Bruton has expressed his disappointment with media coverage of the election campaign, writes Marie O’Halloran. “I think the headline in one of the newspapers saying Fine Gael was in free fall was a little bit inaccurate to say the least,” he said. The outgoing Dublin Bay North TD said what he saw was “the blowing up of very small errors to dominate the campaign. And whether that is fair or reflective of the issues, I have my doubts.” Mr Bruton said “I think traditional media sort of followed the social media line of the sensational over the substance. “That’s what I felt disappointing about the election- the media coverage was just instantaneous click bait coverage.” On the outcome in Dublin Bay North Mr Bruton said it was still early days but it looked like a seat for Fine Gael, Social Democrats, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin with a fight for the fifth seat. He said Denise Smith’s party colleague Cllr Micheál MacDonncha is contention for a second Sinn Féin seat. He is in a battle with Independent Barry Heneghan for the last seat while Labour faces a difficulty in holding on to the seat formerly held by MEP Aodhán Ó Riordáin with Independent John Lyons “not doing as well as people might have hoped for him”. At 9am the Limerick count centre was told that the city count would go ahead despite candidates not appearing in alphabetical order on the ballot paper, writes David Raleigh. As it currently stands, 29 of 137 boxes have been tallied & is showing that three outgoing TDs Willie O’Dea, (FF) is on 20 per cent Kieran O’Donnell (FG) is on 14 per cent and Maurice Quinlivan (SF) is on 12 per cent. On the face of it outgoing Green TD Brian Leddin is struggling on 5 per cent.

Local county councillor Ali Farren of the 100% Redress Party managed to find the owner and a happy reunion was made. With 87 per cent of boxes open in Fingal West, tally figures suggest Green Party Minister of State Joe O’Brien is struggling to retain his seat. Tallies indicate he is on 6.5 per cent in the three-seat constituency. Is Gerard Hutch in with a shout of a seat? With three quarters of the boxes in Dublin Central open, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald is at 21 per cent, reports Sarah Burns. She is followed by Fine Gael’s Paschal Donohoe at 13 per cent. Independent Gerard Hutch and Social Democrats Gary Gannon are both at 12 per cent. Oh and we have our first wedding ring. It was found in a ballot box in Athlone. With nearly two thirds of boxes tallied in Fingal West, Robert O’Donoghue of the Labour Party seems well in the hunt for a seat, writes Martin Wall. Louise O’Reilly of Sinn Féin is leading on 23.1 per cent of tallies, with O’Donoghue on 18.2 per cent. Grace Boland of Fine Gael is on 15.1 per cent and Lorraine Clifford Lee of Fianna Fáil on 12.4 per cent There are three seats in the new Fingal West constituency. Simon Harris on course to top the poll in Wicklow.Donnelly in trouble? @irishtimes #GE2024 pic.twitter.com/5PMUL2cJzE Early tallies in Wicklow based on 10% of boxes opened show Taoiseach Simon Harris in first place (27%), followed by SF’s John Brady (15%), Social Democrat Jennifer Whitmore (14%), FG Edward Timmins (10%) FF Stephen Donnelly (6%) and Green’s Steven Matthews (3%). @irishtimes #ge24 pic.twitter.com/yNFRTJk2Ze It is very early days but Roderic O’Gorman, the Green Party leader might be in trouble in Dublin West – or at the very least he will be in a fight for the last seat. Fianna Fáil’s Stephen Donnelly, the outgoing Minister for Health might also be in a dogfight in Wicklow. A pretty bleak, early assessment from a Green Party stalwart. Suspect today will be a tough day for @greenparty_ie. @rtenews exit polls traditionally over-estimate Green vote-share, and bar 2019/2020 we almost always rely on strong second preferences to get across the line. My hunch is 3 seats #GE2024 Tally from Dublin West with 25% of boxes open - SF Paul Donnelly at 21%, FF's Jack Chambers is at 20%, FG Emer Currie is at 14%, PBP-Solidarty's Ruth Coppinger has 9% and GP Roderic O'Gorman and SD Ellen Murphy are on joint 6%. As part of the exit poll, people were also asked about what they mainly used to help them form their opinion before voting, reports Cormac McQuinn. Twenty-five per cent of respondents said it was TV programmes while the next highest figure, 13 per cent said social media or online messaging. Eleven per cent said online news sites like irishtimes.com, rte.ie or thejournal.ie while another 11 per cent said national radio and a further 11 per cent said local radio. National printed newspapers stood at 4 per cent and local newspapers were on 2 per cent. Podcasts were also on 2 per cent while 18 per cent of respondents said “something else” helped them to form their opinion before voting. According to the exit poll social media was the main form of media helping form the opinions of 18 to 24-year-old voters with 37 per cent of respondents in the age category reporting this. This compares to just 2 per cent among the over 65s and 6 per cent in the 50 to 64 age categories for whom TV programmes were the main response to this question. The poll, which is a joint project of The Irish Times, RTÉ, TG4 and the Political Science Department of Trinity College Dublin, was conducted by Ipsos B&A among 5018 voters as they left 253 polling stations across all 43 constituencies yesterday. Meanwhile, voters were also asked about the trustworthiness of politicians, writes Corman McQuinn. A total of 53 per cent said their view is most politicians are trustworthy. More men (56 per cent) than women (51 per cent) were of this opinion. Forty-five per cent of the respondents said most politicians are untrustworthy. The highest level of trust in politicians was to be found among Green Party supporters with 78 per cent of these saying most politicians are trustworthy. The same answer was given by 73 per cent of Fine Gael voters and 66 per cent of Fianna Fáil supporters. In terms of those who expressed the view that most politicians are untrustworthy, 68 per cent of Aontú voters responded in this way as did 67 per cent of Sinn Féin supporters. More than half of voters, 53 per cent, made up their minds on who they would cast their ballot for in during the election campaign, according to the exit poll. The decision of almost a third came n the last couple of days or on polling day itself. The results demonstrate the importance of the campaign period in Irish elections with many voters yet to make their final decision in the weeks leading up to polling day. The results mirror the 2020 exit poll when 52 per cent of people made up their minds over the course of the campaign. Labour stalwart Kevin Humphreys gives us his hot take @IrishTimes pic.twitter.com/T9ciCXYcsd Ballot boxes have been opened across Ireland. Follow the tallies, the exit poll latest and the constituency-by-constituency results as it happens #GE24 #election24 https://t.co/YoSd05lGs6 pic.twitter.com/IY4COxnS2n Gavin Jennings on Morning Ireland has just asked if we “are having a Bobby Ewing in the shower moment”? It’s a fair question for sure give the exit poll and the likely outcome of the election but there won’t be many people under the age of 50 who have any idea what he is talking about. Potentially very interesting story coming out of Dublin West, writes Sorcha Pollak. With 12 per cent of the boxes open FF’s Jack Chambers and SF’s Paul Donnelly are steaming ahead. Chambers is on 22 per cent and Donnelly is on 21 per cent. FG Senator Emer Currie is on 12 per cent, PBP-Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger is on 9 per cent and Independent candidate Tania Doyle is coming in fifth position at 7 per cent. Leader of the Green Party Roderic O’Gorman is trailing in eighth position with 4 per cent. But – and we can’t stress this enough – it is early days so all the health warnings apply.

Early tallies @IrishTimes #GE2024 pic.twitter.com/kc1f1CBv0w A fresh update from Dublin Bay South, this time from Marie O’Halloran. Tallies predicting in Dublin Bay South that James Geoghegan will top the poll with Labour’s Ivana Bacik in second. Jim O’Callaghan of Fianna Fáil in third with transfers of Social Democrats Cllr Eoin Hayes determining the fourth seat. He is transferring to Ms Bacik and the Greens’s Cllr Hazel Chu. Labour tallyman Kevin Humphreys predicts a tight contest between Sinn Féin’s Chris Andrews and Ms Chu but that Sinn Féin should hold on. It could be that Fine Gael’s Emma Blaine will lose out. Considerable disquiet in Galway West that tally people were not allowed in before the boxes were opened at 9am, writes John Fallon. Former FF Minister Frank Fahey said it’s the first time he has experienced that and fears that it might impact on tally figures. News from Dublin Bay South – two seats for FF looking unlikely although the usual health warnings apply. Dublin Bay South Geoghegan to top the pole, no two seats for FG #GE24 Former Social Democrats leader Róisín Shortall said the party is “certainly very encouraged by the 5.8 per cent” in Friday’s exit poll, writes Marie O’Halloran. “It’s really good and it’s almost double what we had in the last election,” she said. Arriving at the RDS, Ms Shortall said “if that holds up in terms of the actual votes today, we would be very happy and we should certainly make gains”. She declined to put an estimate on those gains. “It’s just there’s so many variables in constituencies. It’s just very hard to predict but we’re very happy with that kind of starting point. almost 6 per cent. It’s great.” News (very, very early news) in from Dublin Central. Gerard The Monk Hutch doing very well in North Strand area of Dub Central. Very early tallies @IrishTimes pic.twitter.com/HkNpRWxEmO The political parties, Independents and others are attempting to co-operate on the tallies at the RDS for Dublin counts,” writes Marie O’Halloran. Not the easiest thing in the world however as “everyone has different views on how to do it” says one tally man. The efforts follow hit and miss tallies in the local elections. The ballot boxes are now being opened at the counting has started. We should start getting first round results in the early afternoon. Peadar Tóibín of Aontú was very upbeat and said his party could get up to 4 per cent and might be contention for as many as four seats. “We’re growing and we’ve passed out People Before Profit, Independent Ireland and if the votes go the way I think they’re going we may even pass out the Green Party.” He said a key “objective was State funding. We’ve done all of this growth without State funding and it looks like we’re going to reach the threshold for State funding ” Richard Boyd Barrett of People Before Profit has also been on radio and he pointed to the “historic decline” of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. He said there combined vote would be around 40 per cent, down 3 per cent on 20 years ago. He suggested that two years ago there was “a big momentum behind the idea of a left of centre alternative ... and then it faltered.” Fianna Fáil’s director of elections Jack Chambers has said the election is “too close to call”. Speaking on RTE’s Morning Ireland he denied that there was no difference between his party and Fine Gael and as a result little alternative for voters “We ran different campaigns with different priorities and very much a different platform.” He said the “real story” was the Sinn Féin vote. ' A year or two they were in the mid 30s they’re now back around 20 per cent.” The Green Party’s director of elections Pauline O’Reilly has said that while she doesn’t want to “count chickens before they’ve hatched” she believes the party will be returning to the Dáil with some seats. “It’s only a question now of how many,” she told Morning Ireland. “We benefit from preferences down the line and across the board [and] it’s the preferences down the line that are going to determine this.” Housing and homelessness was the most important issue for 28 per cent of people when deciding how to vote followed by the cost of living on 19 per cent and health on 17 per cent. According to the exit poll, economic stability was on 9 per cent), climate change on 4 per cent and, crime, local transport and roads and childcare all on 2 per cent, writes Pat Leahy Immigration – which had been prominent in the list of issues of public concern for much of the year – played a minor role, nominated by just 6 per cent. The housing issue was more prominent among younger voters with 42 per cent of those under 34 nominating it as the most important issue. We have an update on the exit poll from our Political Editor Pat Leahy that points to what voters may want to happen next. Almost half of voters in yesterday’s general election favour a coalition government based on the combination of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, according to the Irish Times/RTÉ/TG4/TCD exit poll. Nearly a third of voters (31 per cent) said they would prefer a coalition of just Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil; a further 9 per cent preferred a government of those two parties plus independents; while a further 9 per cent said they would like to see a government of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and one or more smaller parties. Combined, this is a total of 49 per cent of voters in the exit poll who want to see a Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil-led government. The next most popular choice is a government led by Sinn Féin without Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, which was chosen by 22 per cent. Another 7 per cent said they wanted to see a Fianna Fáil-Sinn Féin coalition (including just 9 per cent of Fianna Fáil voters), while 21 per cent said they wanted to see “something else”. The most popular choice for Taoiseach is the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, who was the preferred choice of 35 per cent. He pips the Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald, who is on 34 per cent, while the Fine Gael leader Simon Harris is on 27 per cent. Just 5 per cent gave no response. So, how is the day and the weekend going to pan out? The ballot boxes will be opened at the count centres around the country at 9am after which the ballot papers will be sifted and sorted. By 11am some decent tallies will start coming in that should give us an even better sense of where things are going than the exit polls did. By mid to late afternoon we will have the first seats filled and the counting will continue across the country late into the night. It will start all over again on Sunday morning and by midnight tomorrow we should be done. The people have spoken, now we just have to figure out what they said, as the old saying has it. The exit poll we published last night put the three main parties clustered at around 20 per cent and – based on those figures – the next Government will be made up of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and others. But as keen election watchers will well know a lot can change as the votes are counted and the seats get filled. So, we’ll start – unusually, perhaps – by quoting a Letter to the Editor published this morning from Paul Delaney in Delgany. “It’s all over bar the counting: the excuses, the recriminations, the finger-pointing, and the inevitable lengthy political horse-trading that takes place before the establishment of a coalition government. The people have spoken; but it’s going to take quite a while to figure out what exactly they said. ” © 2024 The Irish Times DAC
