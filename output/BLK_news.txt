January 25, 2026 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to my weekly report, issue number 39. Driven by our dual-engine EAI strategy, this week, I’d like to first share major progress on our EAI robotics business, along with a piece of good news from the capital markets: 1. The first FF EAI robotics product has completed U.S. regulatory certification and is about to officially enter sales. Regulatory approvals for the remaining products in our initial batch are advancing and are expected to be finalized soon. This progress brings us closer to realizing our ‘launch is sale, sale is delivery’ model, with the goal of starting product deliveries within the same month as the launch. Our robotics strategy focuses on creating real-world use cases and user value, directly addressing the industry’s current lack of true 'must-have' demand. By integrating Web3 and blockchain technologies, we aim to lead the industry into a new phase of commercialization driven by authentic user needs and value creation. Our goal is to become the first U.S. company to deliver humanoid robot products with positive contribution margins, and to rapidly scale deliveries to enter the ranks of leading EAI robotics companies in the U.S. 2. In terms of R&D, we are continuing to establish clear empowerment pathways from EAI EVs to EAI robots, aiming to transfer and apply the AI DNA and years of auto-grade AI capabilities that FF has built since its founding to empower the “brain” and “cerebellum” of our robots. In addition, FF is the only company in the U.S. market with the "EAI+Crypto" dual flywheel ecosystem, which has a natural advantage in cross-scenario, cross-domain, and cross-ecosystem technology feeding back, which will build up our core differentiated technology barriers in the EAI field. 3. The FF EAI Robotics Product Final Launch and the FF/FX Par Partner Recruitment Conference on February 4 will center around the theme of “Robot &Vehicle +”. We will provide a comprehensive introduction to how FF leverages its Dual-Flywheel, Dual-Bridge, and Dual-Public-Companies structure and applies an original AI innovation + bridge model approach to systematically address industry pain points across application scenarios, cost, user experience, and ecosystem development—leading the arrival of a new era of EAI. Next, let me share with you select portions of the product design for our first batch of robots. I’d love to hear what you think. On February 4, at the Las Vegas Convention Center, during the NADA Show — the largest auto dealer conference in North America — we will unveil even more exciting updates. Please stay tuned. In addition to that, one of the world’s largest asset management institutions, BlackRock, increased its holdings in FFAI once again. According to its latest Q4 Schedule 13G filing, as of December 31, 2025, BlackRock held approximately 9.5 million shares of FFAI common stock, up from 6.8 million shares disclosed as of September 30, 2025 — an increase of about 40%. S5, Capital and Finance: A public company research firm that we compensated for its coverage issued a new report after the Stockholder Day event reiterating its “Buy” rating and a 12-month target price of $5 per share. The report highlights their belief that FFAI’s current share price is undervalued relative to peers. On S6 Middle East: This week, FF made a high-profile appearance at the UMEX 2026 exhibition held in Abu Dhabi from January 20 to 22, showcasing the FF 91, FX Super One, and our EAI robotics strategy. The booth drew strong attention throughout the event, including visits from the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and other senior UAE officials, making FF a clear focal point of the show. Moving on to AIxC, Crypto Flywheel: AIxC announced that it has launched an accelerated global talent recruitment initiative this week to support faster execution across its three-core driving-force businesses, including RWA EAI ecosystem development. AIxC also launched the X Space series of events this week, with the first event receiving a strong response. Going forward, when circumstances permit, I may personally participate in future X Space sessions to engage directly with the community—sharing industry insights, discussing future trends, and providing updates on key company-level developments. Stay tuned and see you all next week!” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global intelligent Company founded in 2014 and is dedicated to reshaping the future of mobility through vehicle electrification, intelligent technologies, and AI innovation.

Title: How BlackRock just lost control of the $10B tokenized Treasury market to Circle for one simple, mechanical reason

USYC hit $1.69B AUM on Jan. 22, narrowly topping BUIDL’s $1.684B. The real advantage is buried in collateral rails. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry. His expertise primarily focuses on the Brazilian blockchain ecosystem and developments in decentralized finance (DeFi). Tokenized US Treasuries crossed $10 billion in total value this week, a milestone that confirms the category has moved from proof-of-concept to operational infrastructure. Yet, something happening underneath this achievement is just as important: Circle's USYC has edged past BlackRock's BUIDL as the largest tokenized Treasury product, signaling that distribution rails and collateral mechanics now matter more than brand recognition in determining which on-chain cash equivalents win. As of Jan. 22, USYC holds $1.69 billion in assets under management compared to BUIDL's $1.684 billion, a gap of roughly $6.14 million, or 0.36%. Over the past 30 days, USYC's assets grew 11% while BUIDL's contracted 2.85%, a divergence that reads less like marketing success and more like net creation flowing in one direction while redemptions drain the other. This isn't a story about Circle beating BlackRock in a brand war. It's about collateral workflow design outperforming logo recognition. Additionally, it maps directly onto the infrastructure question that regulators and institutions are now asking out loud: who shapes the stack that turns idle crypto capital into productive, yield-bearing collateral? Tokenized RWAs are dominated by Ethereum, but one unexpected blockchain rival just surged 28% to outpace the leader. USYC's clearest structural advantage is distribution through exchange collateral rails. On July 24, Binance announced that institutional customers could hold USYC and use it as off-exchange collateral for derivatives, with custody handled through Banking Triparty or Ceffu and near-instant redemption into USDC. Binance added BUIDL to its off-exchange collateral list on Nov. 14, four months after USYC. That sequencing matters. If the cash collateral stack is built first inside prime brokerage and derivatives workflows, the product that integrates earlier captures the flow. USYC didn't just get listed, it got embedded into the operational layer where institutions manage margin and collateral automation. Circle positioned USYC explicitly as yield-bearing collateral that travels alongside USDC rails, meaning institutions that already route stablecoin flows through Circle's ecosystem can onboard USYC without building new operational pathways. BlackRock's BUIDL entered the market with brand authority but without the same plug-and-play integration into crypto-native collateral systems. BlackRock’s tokenization thesis puts 65%+ of tokenized assets on Ethereum, but newer RWA data shows share can drift. RWA.xyz labels the two products differently under “Use of Income.” USYC is marked as “Accumulates,” meaning interest accrues within the token balance. BUIDL is marked as “Distributes,” meaning returns are paid out separately. This distinction is mechanical, not cosmetic. Collateral systems, especially automated margin and derivatives infrastructure, prefer set-and-forget balances where value compounds without requiring operational handling of payouts. An accumulating structure integrates more cleanly into collateral automation than a distributing one. For institutions building collateral rails that need to scale across multiple venues and counterparties, the simpler the structure, the lower the operational drag. RWA.xyz lists materially different entry requirements for the two products. BUIDL restricts access to US Qualified Purchasers, requiring a minimum investment of $5 million in USDC. USYC targets non-US investors with a minimum of $100,000 USDC. The funnel difference is structural. Qualified Purchaser status in the US requires $5 million in investable assets for individuals or $25 million for entities, a narrow gate that excludes most crypto-native funds, prop desks, and smaller institutional players. USYC's $100,000 minimum and non-US eligibility open access to a broader set of offshore institutions, family offices, and trading firms that operate outside US regulatory perimeters but still need dollar-denominated, yield-bearing collateral. BlackRock's brand carries weight, but the brand doesn't override access constraints. If a fund can't meet the Qualified Purchaser threshold or operates outside the US, BUIDL isn't an option. USYC is. The addressable market for on-chain collateral skews heavily toward non-US entities and smaller institutions, exactly the segment USYC is designed to serve. New smart contract enables real-time, transparent BUIDL share transfers to USDC. The simplest explanation for the flip is the cleanest: flows moved. Market-moving headlines and context delivered every morning in one tight read. Free. No spam. Unsubscribe any time. USYC grew by 11% over the past 30 days, while BUIDL shrank by 2.85%. That's not a marketing differential. It's net issuance into one product, offset by net outflows from the other. The recent flip suggests a discrete event or allocation decision rather than gradual drift. USYC's Binance integration, its accumulating income structure, and its lower entry threshold all reduce friction. BUIDL hasn't added comparable distribution momentum in the same window. Tokenized Treasuries at $10 billion remain a small fraction of the $310 billion stablecoin market, but their role is shifting from niche experiment to operational default. The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) noted in recent guidance that tokenized money market funds are increasingly used as stablecoin reserve assets and as collateral for crypto-related transactions. This is precisely the interlinkages driving USYC's growth. JPMorgan framed tokenized money market funds as the next frontier after stablecoins, centered on portability and collateral efficiency. The bank's analysis treats tokenized Treasuries not as an alternative to stablecoins but as an evolution of them. They are programmable cash equivalents that settle faster, move across blockchains more easily, and integrate into collateral systems with less operational overhead than traditional custody arrangements. With stablecoin yields near zero, tokenized Treasuries offer a risk-free on-chain rate without requiring users to exit crypto rails. Instead of parking cash in non-yielding stablecoins or moving it off-chain to earn returns, institutions can now hold yield-bearing collateral on-chain that functions like cash but compounds like Treasuries. Tokenized US Treasuries grew from $2 billion to $9 billion in 18 months. BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Circle now offer on-chain T-bills as margin collateral, DeFi building blocks, and stablecoin alternatives. The $10 billion milestone is less important than the capture rate it represents. Tokenized Treasuries currently account for roughly 3% to 4% of the stablecoin float. If that rate doubles over the next 12 months, which is a conservative assumption given current flow momentum and collateral integrations, tokenized Treasuries could reach $20 billion to $25 billion. If collateral flywheels accelerate and more venues replicate Binance-style off-exchange rails, the range stretches to $40 billion to $60 billion. The metrics that matter are all measurable: net issuance trends, collateral integration announcements, changes to eligibility requirements, and shifts in income-handling preferences. USYC's 30-day growth rate and BUIDL's contraction are early signals. The Binance integration timeline is another. The funnel gap is a third. USYC didn't flip BUIDL because Circle outspent BlackRock on marketing. It flipped because distribution, mechanics, and access constraints aligned with how institutions actually use on-chain collateral. The category crossed $10 billion not because one flagship product dominated, but because multiple products are now competing on infrastructure terms: who integrates faster, who reduces friction, who widens the funnel. Brand recognition opened doors. Collateral workflow design is keeping them open. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. A new comms lead, an institutions portal, and “Get in touch” CTAs suggest Ethereum thinks perception is becoming adoption. Collateral mobility is the pitch, yet delivery-versus-payment depends on an on-chain cash leg that isn’t fully ready. Integrating the “Fusion Engine” for seamless spot trading and leveraged lending, PinPet enhances risk management with new protocols and third-party security audits. Closing out 2025, Lista DAO achieved its highest TVL of over $4.5 billion, leading the BNB staking market with nearly 50% and booking over $1 million in monthly revenue twice.

Only two of the top six won on an unpredictable day in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League on Saturday, with Young Munster the prime movers as they climbed from sixth to third thanks to their 37-20 victory over Terenure at Tom Clifford Park. A key moment in the Cookies registering their fourth win in succession was a big defensive set in front of a large segment of the home crowd by the club house on half-time. This led to a scuffle and a relieving penalty in preserving a 17-6 interval lead after tries by Bailey Faloon and Stephen McLoughlin. After a try by number eight and man of the match Luke Murphy, Aran Egan responded for Terenure, and then another Munster academy player, scrumhalf Jake O’Riordan, scored a length-of-the-pitch intercept try as ‘Nure pressed to make it a one-score game. Oisín Pepper, the Cookies’ quick and skilful 21-year-old centre, who was released by the Munster academy, marked his second game after a six-month absence following shoulder surgery by scoring after good work by John Poland and Shane O’Leary. Pepper was one of 12 players from Limerick schools in the matchday squad. Jordan Coghlan scored a brace in Clontarf’s 10th consecutive win, overcoming an improving Nenagh 35-24 in their first ever visit to Castle Avenue. Second-placed St Mary’s were held to a 16-all draw at home by Ballynahinch, with Mick O’Gara converting Mick McCormack’s late try in taking his tally for the season to 115 points. UCD and Old Belvedere underlined the competitiveness of 1A with 20-15 and 18-12 home wins over Lansdowne and Cork Con respectively. Lansdowne led 15-7 at the break thanks to tries from Bobby Sheehan, his sixth of the season, and Harry van Eaden, but Evan Moynihan and Eoghan Walsh added to a first-half try by James Culhane as the Students completed a double over the visitors. Belvo are coming to grips with life in 1A, tries by Justin Leonard and captain Calum Dowling helping them establish an 18-5 interval lead. Con, missing the influential Jack Kelleher (hamstring), responded with Danny Sheehan’s seventh try of the season before Belvo withstood late pressure. In 1B Blackrock College were surprise 20-7 winners over Instonians, Old Wesley pulling 10 points clear with five second-half tries to beat Queen’s University 36-7. MU Barnhall and Galwegians remained unbeaten at the top of 2A and 2B thanks to 11-3 and 50-15 home wins over Greystones and Navan. ‘Wegians outside centre Rob Deacy, the leading try scorer across all five divisions, scored his 12th in nine games, the home side recording their 11th bonus-point win in 11 games before many among a big crowd at Crowley Park rolled down the hill to the unveiling of the Clan Stand and the interpro between Connacht and Leinster.

Title: XRP Charts Flash Familiar Signal As Analyst Calls For $11, Then $70

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A growing number of chart watchers are pointing to a long stretch of sideways trading for XRP and saying this setup has come before big rallies. According to a widely followed analyst known as CryptoBull, the current price action echoes earlier runs in the token’s history. The signal is simple: long quiet periods sometimes lead to sharp moves when buying pressure returns. That does not mean a jump is guaranteed. Markets can stay quiet for a long time, and timing is uncertain. Based on reports, XRP’s weekly structure shows a stretch of range trading after strong breakouts from earlier years. The comparison reaches back several cycles. In past examples, long ranges eventually gave way to impulsive runs that pushed the price far above prior highs. The next impulse will take #XRP to $11 and the last wave to $70. The price pattern is copying the previous bullrun, only difference is time, which makes sense, as we need longer accumulation for higher prices. pic.twitter.com/WJxzYDVRKT — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) January 23, 2026 CryptoBull argues the present consolidation has lasted longer than previous ones, which, he says, could compress price action and build fuel for a larger expansion when momentum flips. The idea rests on history repeating itself in broad strokes, not in exact moves. Some analysts see a sixfold move as plausible if the same pattern plays out. That kind of rise would put XRP near $11, a figure being discussed by multiple commentators. There is also talk of a further, final wave lifting the token much higher in a later stage — talk that reaches $70 in extreme scenarios. A bottom test—where price revisits support to confirm strength before a new push—has appeared in a few past cycles and is being watched closely now. The presence of such tests can either validate a base or warn that the range has more work to do. Timelines are vague, and a long accumulation period can stretch for years before any decisive breakout. Reports that BlackRock may use Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin have added fuel to the fire. News like that has pushed sentiment upward and sparked fresh technical calls, with some forecasts ranging from $6 to $14 in near- to mid-term scenarios. Other voices go far beyond, naming targets that would imply market caps so large they would be hard to reconcile with today’s market size. These more extreme numbers should be treated with caution, because they assume near-perfect conditions and massive capital flows that may never arrive. Still, adoption whispers can tilt sentiment and speed up moves when buyers pile in. Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food.

Title: The World Economic Forum on a Course of Self-Destruction

Word has it that the 2026 World Economic Forum (WEF) Davos event went down as the worst ever in WEF’s history. Maybe it has to do with Trump’s showing up and everybody, including the Swiss Government, falling on their knees to please the emperor without clothes; and / or because Larry Fink, the BlackRock Chair, now literally owns the WEF and calls the shot on everything. Everyone below him, even the co-chairs, are YES-people. What is playing out ever clearer is a digital-financial dictatorship, largely run by robotized humanoids. As long as the money flows – and flowing it does, better believe it – everything is allowed. President Trump was literally uprooting Davos, the Swiss Government, and foremost the Swiss air traffic – see below. He also uprooted the stock market, not by accident. When Trump first talked about his “sanctioning” the eight (8) EU countries and NATO partners that opposed his invasion of Greenland, the stock market slumped by record rates: The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 870 points (approx. 1.8%-1.9%), while the S&P 500 fell 2.1% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.4%. When shortly after his WEF speech, Trump reversed his decision on the 10% tariff for EU opposition, the stock market rebounded. Guess who are the main winners and losers of this algorithmically-driven game? Right, the ultra-rich, like the Elon Musks of this world. The common people as usual are the losers. On freedom of speech of the so-called democracy – which was and is a scam — has never existed, not even in Greece of 2,300 years ago, Delphi was a farce perpetuated to this day, as the Greek know very well – so, on freedom of speech, for example, Trump tried to block California’s Governor Gavin Newsom from attending Davos. Mr. Newsom came anyway – see this and this. Everything, including WEF’s treatment of staff, was horrible, although up-front the Davos organizing staff were praised for a good job. In reality, they were treated by WEF “superiors” like slaves, with insults, and disrespect. And that after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) and Financial Times (FT) had already investigated the WEF in 2024 and 2025 for suspected “irregularities” – concerning especially Klaus Schwab, and for sexual harassment of female employees, regarding Schwab and WEF management. An investigation by lawyers hired by the very WEF vindicated Schwab and the WEF in 2025 from any wrongdoing, as could be expected. So, the WEF management starts on a new slate, so to speak. But the old dirt shines through the new slate, and becomes even worse, as Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, by far the largest financier of the WEF, has become one of WEF’s co-chairs, and now effectively owns the WEF. BlackRock and Vanguard, the two intimately connected and legally interchangeable financial behemoths, manage worldwide corporate assets valued between US$ 25 and US$ 35 trillion. They basically run and decide over every vital sector in the world, including food, energy, banking, production, military and services industries – you name it – with a majority ownership. Speaking at the WEF, Larry Fink, sounded like a polite financial autocrat, clearly pointing the way to an all-digitized monetary system, controlled by electronic IDs, insinuating to be monitored by BlackRock-Vanguard (although never mentioning Vanguard by name). In other words, Larry Fink and his ilk pretend to control your money, the way you spend it – or not – and whether you behave in style with the elite oligarchs’ narrative to continue being able to use your earned money, or have it blocked for misbehavior. We are in the hands of psychopaths, who are allowed covering a worldwide audience with their annual Davos event, another nail in the WEF’s coffin. To complement Larry Fink’s finance-digital ruling, Elon Musk made a surprise appearance in Davos on 22 January, engaging in a 30-minute conversation with Larry Fink. His remarks focused on technology’s role in securing humanity’s future through an absurdly promised abundance, multi-planetary expansion, and cautious AI advancement. The tech oligarch pointed to their companies’ shared goal: maximizing civilization’s probability of a great future by extending consciousness beyond Earth, adding that his SpaceX’s 9,000 satellites confirm that there is no evidence of aliens “out there”, that life is indeed a “rare tiny candle” in a vast darkness. Elon’s sci-fi mind aspired to die on Mars “just not on impact,” [hahaha]; and aging reversal seems solvable via a body-wide “clock”. Whatever that means. AI will probe existence’s mysteries. In brief, he painted the oligarch’s usual rosy “bla-bla-picture” that any thinking individual knows, means exactly the contrary. See this. Back to the 2026 WEF and Trump in Davos: what no mainstream will report — the airport in Zurich was blocked on Wednesday morning with numerous Trump planes, several cargos, C-130’s and the sort, for Trump’s limousine convoys and private helicopters flown in from Washington. The so called “plane spotters” at 6 AM on 21 January were crushing barricades at Zurich airport to see Trump arrive, whenever he arrived, later than he should have, due to a last-minute change of airplane. Several planes carrying heads of state to go to Davos, i.e., from Greece and Cyprus, could not land at Zurich airport. There was no more space, since in addition to Trump’s extra planes, there were an unprecedented 850 private jets also parked at the airport from WEF attendees. Compare this with 65 for the COP29 (November 2024) Summit at Baku, Azerbaijan. The politicians who could not land – and many others, of course — had to cancel their attendance in Davos. For sure, no big loss. Some of the 3,000 attendees in Davos, heads of State, highly educated (or one would think) corporate CEO’s, managing trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of people, caused literally a stampede to enter the room where Trump was blabbering for over 70 minutes – when normally heads of states are allocated 10 to 20-minute slots. These high-level WEF attendees were running – charging – into and over the organizing staff, crushing them against the walls, hurting one lady so badly she had to leave, so they could enter the special conference room where Trump was to speak. That demonstrates a conscience level of high-flying WEF attendee-billionaires comparable to football fans. Swiss military, two rows of them, were placed inside the room, instead of outside, to help prevent a stampede. Stupidity increasingly worldwide knows no frontiers. The entire WEF meetings had to be reorganized and last-minute restructured for Trump, and of course BlackRock calls the shots on everything. As Trump and BlackRock’s Larry Fink indicated, though not in words, in their WEF speeches – we are racing towards the goals of the 2030 Agenda which never left us. This 2030 agenda, also called the Great Reset, prepared for over 100 years, represents a complete destruction of civilization’s orders and laws, towards societal chaos and ever-changing values – from where they, the monsters behind the WEF, expect the emergence of a “New World Order”, under a “One World Government.” This One World Government may be based on “multiple pillars” [they call it multi-polar to once again deceive the public at large], pillars, represented by world powers other than the United States, like Russia and China. This explains why and how Trump could invade Venezuela on January 3, 2026, and kidnap President Maduro, killing over 100 people, without any material interference of Russia and China, at the time also present with their respective navies in the Caribbean. They were informed in advance. Their protests came in words, no actions. Words are blowing in the wind. These secondary thoughts and ideas are expressed in hidden messages by the WEF and its elite attendees, because they represent a worldwide Cult which is currently in control of our civilization. And you may guess, who is behind this Cult. According to Cult wisdom – call it Cult science – any actions or plans MUST be announced in one form or another to the populace concerned, so that it will be successful. Hence the many “predictive” monster and horror movies produced by Hollywood. Just look at the current list of the “10 best movies” as the 2026 Oscar nominees. See this. They all keep humanity on low vibrations which is a MUST for them manipulating human minds, preventing them from ascending to a higher level of consciousness. As an example, look at horror-vampire flick, “Sinners” which was literally nominated for every category of Oscars. The coordination between the WEF, those who pull the strings behind it, and all the 2030 Agenda agents and actors used to control humanity, among them Hollywood, is perfect. But there comes the point where the apparently limitless exuberance of sugar-charged energy brains, à la “We can do what we want, nobody stops us” – like Trump’s – will backfire. So, in the end, this horrifying organization called WEF is self-destructing. It MUST be. The faster the better. At the same time, think THE NOW gives humanity a chance for a new start outside of the slavehood of our digital monetary system and digital control-gulag. May there be soon an end to our dystopian Cult world. Instead, let us open our hearts and souls for Love and Light to emerge on our Blue Planet’s sentinel beings. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Tariffs, Treasuries and the Quiet Risk to America’s Financial Power

Standing in the Rose Garden last April, flanked by American flags, US President Donald Trump declared war on free trade. Nine months later, the most striking feature of that declaration is not how much commerce has collapsed, but how quickly it has rerouted. Trade did not stop; it flowed around obstacles. As a DHL Express company executive observed, trade “will find its way” — behaving, in effect, like water flowing around obstacles under high-tariff regimes. That image of water seeking a new channel captures the first-order reality of the Trump administration’s trade policy. Tariffs have risen sharply, and the costs are landing where economists would expect: higher prices for tariff-sensitive goods, stress on firms reliant on imported inputs, and an implicit tax on households and businesses. Yet the system has adapted. The US is buying less directly from China, but more from Chinese-owned factories operating in lower-tariff jurisdictions such as Vietnam. Mexico has emerged as an unexpected winner. And Beijing’s leverage over rare earth minerals has spurred new efforts to secure alternative supply — an industrial-policy subplot nested inside a tariff story. The second-order reality is more subtle: Trade policy uncertainty also influences the US Treasury market through financial market sentiment. Asset-manager commentary from institutions such as BlackRock and Amundi emphasizes that tariff escalation can increase macroeconomic uncertainty, raise bond market volatility and affect term premia. In this environment, investor demand for duration becomes more cautious, implying an indirect but economically meaningful link between trade policy uncertainty and Treasury yields beyond mechanical supply-and-demand effects. Understanding the Treasury channel requires starting with the obvious, then moving to the consequential. Obviously, tariffs raise revenue. Consequentially, the Treasury market is where America prices its future, and where policy uncertainty becomes a term premium that households and businesses end up paying. CAPTION: Term premium on a ten-year zero-coupon bond. Via Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Tariffs are blunt. When imposed broadly, they raise costs across wide swaths of the economy. A tariff on an imported refrigerator is not just a tax on the foreign producer; it becomes a higher landed cost for the importer, which becomes either a lower profit margin, a higher price for the consumer or a combination of both. Tariffs can also lift the price of domestic substitutes: If imported steel becomes more expensive, domestic steel producers can raise prices too, even if their cost base didn’t change as much. For consumers, the effect shows up in specific aisles: higher prices for furniture, toys and clothing; higher prices for some foods like beef, bananas and coffee; and price pressures that spread unevenly across regions and income groups. For firms, tariffs are less a doctrine than a daily problem to be managed. One small but telling example comes from the trade-law trenches. Dan Harris, a Seattle lawyer who recently began working on tariffs, now advises importers on how to legally reduce duty exposure. The methods are not dramatic — restructuring contracts, separating allowable costs, adjusting declared values within the rules — but they absorb time, capital and attention that would otherwise be spent on production or expansion. This logic repeats across supply chains. A buyer who purchases an injection mold outright avoids embedding that cost in the tariff base of every imported unit. The decision is rational and lawful, yet it underscores a broader pattern: tariffs redirect effort toward avoidance rather than efficiency. The same dynamic appears in Vietnam, where factories have seen sudden order surges as US buyers shift away from China — only to face capacity constraints and renewed uncertainty as tariffs spread. Supply chains adapt, but the adaptation itself is costly, unstable and rarely conducive to long-term productivity growth. The US budget deficit is large by historic standards — 6.2% of GDP in recent readings, roughly double the average pace from 1980 through the pre-Covid-19 pandemic era. Bigger deficits mean more Treasury issuance. If all else is equal, more supply requires either more demand or higher yields to clear the market. Tariff revenue can, in principle, reduce the borrowing needed at the margin. Customs receipts have risen sharply in the high-tariff world, creating what some policymakers see as a fiscal cushion. But the margin matters: If tariffs generate tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars in annual revenue, that is meaningful — yet it is not transformative against structural deficits driven by entitlement spending and debt service costs. The more important issue for markets is not just how much tariff revenue is collected, but how reliable that revenue is. Tariff receipts are unusually exposed to legal risk (court challenges to executive tariff authority), negotiation risk (trade deals that reduce rates or carve out exemptions) and macroeconomic risk (recessions or demand shifts that shrink import volumes). As the Bipartisan Policy Center explains, tariff revenue fluctuates with trade policy, legal outcomes and import behavior, making it an inherently volatile source of funding rather than a stable offset to deficits. That volatility matters because bond markets price expectations and risk, not static arithmetic. Even when tariff revenue rises into the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, it remains small relative to structural deficits driven by entitlement spending and rising interest costs. PBS NewsHour shows that claims of tariffs meaningfully stabilizing the fiscal outlook break down once the scale of federal spending and borrowing is considered. Treasury yields therefore respond less to the existence of tariff revenue than to uncertainty around the longer-term fiscal path. When investors believe deficits may widen — because tariff revenue falls short, spending rises faster than expected or borrowing needs surprise to the upside — they demand higher compensation to hold long-dated debt. Because Treasury yields anchor mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs, that repricing quickly tightens financial conditions across the economy. Tariffs may reduce borrowing at the margin, but by introducing uncertainty into revenue projections, they can also raise risk premia — offsetting part of the perceived fiscal “cushion.” If supply is one side of Treasury pricing, demand is the other — and trade policy influences demand most clearly through foreign investor behavior. Foreign investors hold roughly one-third of the US Treasury market, making their portfolio decisions central to US interest rate dynamics. During periods of tariff escalation, Council on Foreign Relations reports often raise concerns about a potential “sell America” trade, in which foreign official institutions reduce exposure to US assets as trade relationships deteriorate. Historically, however, such fears have rarely materialized in abrupt form. Even during episodes of trade conflict, foreign holdings of Treasuries have often remained stable or increased, reflecting Treasuries’ role as the world’s deepest and most liquid pool of safe collateral. In an environment of global uncertainty, investors typically prioritize liquidity and capital preservation, even when they are uncomfortable with the policy environment generating that uncertainty. The more relevant risk, therefore, is gradual erosion at the margin. Central banks and sovereign wealth funds rarely engage in headline-grabbing sales. Instead, they can diversify quietly over time by allowing maturing Treasury holdings to roll off and reinvesting incrementally elsewhere. Over years, these slow-moving adjustments can meaningfully affect demand conditions at the margin. Trade relationships matter in this process. Reserve composition has historically been influenced by trade networks, with countries tending to hold reserves in the currencies of their primary trading partners. If US protectionism leads to sustained shifts in global trade toward alternative hubs, reserve portfolios may adjust gradually in parallel — without a single triggering event, but with cumulative effects over time. From a market perspective, this distinction holds weight. Treasury demand remains deep and resilient, but it is not immutable. Persistent trade fragmentation can slowly reshape the composition of global reserves, subtly reducing marginal demand for US debt even in the absence of overt selling pressure. Such shifts are easy to overlook in the short term, yet increasingly relevant for long-term rate expectations and term premia. The third channel operates through the macro economy: how tariffs affect inflation and growth, and how those effects are ultimately priced into financial markets. Tariffs tend to raise prices directly by increasing import costs and indirectly by expanding domestic firms’ pricing power. At the same time, they can weigh on growth by raising input costs, disrupting supply chains and provoking retaliation. The resulting combination, higher inflation risk alongside weaker or more uncertain growth, is precisely the configuration that markets associate with elevated macro risk rather than a straightforward demand slowdown. Markets typically express this tension through the yield curve. When investors believe tariffs will push up near-term inflation while clouding the longer-term outlook for growth, productivity and policy stability, longer-dated yields can rise even as growth expectations soften. This reflects the role of term premia. The long end of the curve is not simply a forecast of future short rates; it also embeds compensation for inflation volatility, fiscal uncertainty and policy risk. Recent market behavior reinforces this interpretation. Gold prices have continued to rise even as US yields remain elevated, signaling that higher yields are no longer being read as a clean indicator of safety. Instead, both gold prices and long-term Treasury yields appear to be responding to the same underlying force: a rise in uncertainty and risk premia. When yields increase because investors demand additional compensation for fiscal, geopolitical and policy risk — rather than because growth prospects are improving — the opportunity cost of holding gold becomes less binding. In that sense, gold is not competing with Treasuries on yield, but reacting to doubts about their reliability as the world’s unquestioned safe asset. Geopolitical shocks can accelerate this dynamic. Recent US military actions involving Venezuela briefly pushed gold prices higher, not because they altered global trade flows in a material way, but because they reinforced perceptions of geopolitical fragility layered on top of trade and fiscal uncertainty. Such episodes matter less for their direct economic impact than for what they reveal about market psychology: When policy and geopolitical risks stack, investors demand protection that sits outside sovereign balance sheets. This framework helps explain why JP Morgan’s bullish outlook for gold remains intact even without aggressive Federal Reserve (or Fed) easing. As long as term premia stay elevated, central banks continue to diversify reserves and geopolitical flashpoints remain unresolved, higher US yields do not suppress gold prices. Instead, they reinforce incentives to diversify away from US financial assets altogether. In that sense, gold’s rise toward $5,000 per ounce by late 2026 would not represent an anomaly driven by temporary fear, but a new equilibrium consistent with a more fragmented and risk-conscious global financial system. The implications extend beyond gold. The same uncertainty that lifts demand for alternative stores of value also pushes up term premia in the Treasury market. Long-term yields rise not in anticipation of stronger growth, but as compensation for volatility and unpredictability. That repricing feeds directly into higher borrowing costs across the economy, tightening financial conditions even when the underlying trade shock itself appears manageable. For households and firms, this channel is where trade policy becomes tangible. The ten-year Treasury yield anchors borrowing costs across the economy, including mortgage rates, auto loans and corporate financing. If tariffs contribute to persistently higher term premia, it results in a durable tightening of financial conditions, often outweighing any localized employment gains associated with reshoring or import substitution. Higher yields also feed back into public finances. Rising interest rates increase government debt service costs, tightening the fiscal constraint and reinforcing deficit dynamics over time. What begins as a trade policy shock can therefore reappear as a budgetary one, amplifying longer-term sustainability concerns. Globally, higher US yields tend to transmit tighter financial conditions abroad through capital flows and exchange rate pressures, increasing stress in more vulnerable economies. In that sense, the macro consequences of tariffs are not confined to domestic prices or output; they propagate through global financial channels. For these reasons, Treasury yields are not merely an economic statistic. They are a strategic price — summarizing how trade policy, inflation risk, fiscal dynamics and global financial conditions intersect in real time. The industry stories from the tariff era are familiar by now: lawyers building compliance playbooks, factories booming in Vietnam, Mexico benefiting from trade diversion, grocery importers cancelling shipments, governments accelerating rare earth strategies. Together, they reinforce the comforting saying that trade behaves like water: Block one channel and it simply flows around the obstacle. That metaphor is only half true. Trade does reroute. The world does not stop trading because one country raises tariffs. But rerouting is not costless. It can be inflationary, as supply chains move to higher-cost locations. It can lower productivity by fragmenting production networks built for efficiency. It can shift bargaining power across firms, workers and countries. And most importantly for markets, it raises uncertainty. In financial markets, uncertainty comes with a price. In the Treasury market, it appears as a higher term premium — the extra return investors demand to hold long-dated US debt when the economic and policy outlook feels less predictable. That premium does not stay in the bond market. It is transmitted directly into mortgage rates, corporate financing costs and global capital flows. Because US Treasuries are the benchmark asset of the global financial system, changes in their pricing ripple outward. What begins as a trade policy shock can become a broad tightening of financial conditions, shaping investment decisions at home and exporting stress abroad. This is where trade policy becomes strategic. As economists Emmanuel Farhi and Matteo Maggiori argue in their model of the international monetary system, the global role of US debt rests on credibility — the belief that American public liabilities are safe, liquid and insulated from short-term political shocks. That credibility allows the United States to borrow cheaply and at scale. Paradoxically, a policy framed as strengthening national power, if mishandled, can weaken the foundation of that power. Tariffs may redirect trade. But if they also raise uncertainty and risk premia, they can quietly erode the credibility and attractiveness of US debt — the asset on which American economic power ultimately rests. The trade war has not broken global commerce but redirected it. Firms and countries are adapting quickly — routing around tariffs, shifting production footprints, building new compliance strategies and rebalancing trade relationships. That adaptability is real and will likely persist. But adaptation carries costs, and the most important costs may not appear on a customs receipt. They may appear as a higher term premium in the Treasury market — a subtle repricing of US policy uncertainty that raises borrowing costs for households, businesses and the federal government itself. This year and beyond, the most strategic way to think about tariffs is as a variable that interacts with Treasury supply, Treasury demand and the Fed’s inflation calculus. A trade policy that treats the Treasury market as an afterthought risks turning a tariff shock into a bond shock. In an economy built on the benchmark of US yields, a bond shock becomes everyone’s problem. If “trade is like water,” then Treasuries are the riverbed. Policy can redirect the flow, but if it erodes the bed, the flood will not stay contained.[Lee Thompson-Kolar edited this piece.] The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.

Title: Coinbase CEO Shares 6 Takeaways From WEF Davos 2026 – Details

While Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao made the headlines following his interview at the just-concluded World Economic Forum, where he called a Bitcoin supercycle in 2026, his crypto counterpart and Coinbase CEO, Brian Armstrong, has come forward with feedback from the global event held in Davos, Switzerland. In a January 24 post on the social media platform X, Armstrong shared a few key “themes and takeaways” from the latest edition of WEF. After admitting that the conference offered a productive time of meeting people one-on-one, the Coinbase CEO revealed that the major focus was on pushing crypto adoption globally. Starting his list of takeaways, Armstrong highlighted that everyone was talking about tokenization, which is beginning to expand to every asset class in the world. The crypto leader said to expect some major progress in the tokenization sector in 2026, especially as the Fortune 500 business leaders continuously lean in. Secondly, the Coinbase CEO shared that crypto legislation and the CLARITY Act were another area of focus, as the government of the day looks to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. According to Armstrong, most of the bank CEOs he met at the WEF in the past week are actually pro-crypto. Armstrong wrote on X: One CEO of a top 10 global bank told me crypto is their number one priority, and they view it as existential. Furthermore, the Coinbase CEO lauded the Trump administration as the most crypto-forward government in the world at the moment. Armstrong acknowledged their progress with the crypto market structure, stating that these clear rules are crucial for global competitiveness and will put money back in people’s pockets. In what seemed like a cheeky tone, Armstrong mentioned that ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) topics didn’t come up throughout the forum. According to the crypto founder, the week felt productive, as it centered around real, global progress — all thanks to BlackRock CEO and new WEF co-chair Larry Fink. The Coinbase leader touted crypto and AI (artificial intelligence) as the most talked-about technologies in today’s world. Highlighting their compatibility, Armstrong stated that AI agents will eventually default to using stablecoins for payments, as they cannot be KYC’d like human beings. Finally, Armstrong revealed that the Coinbase, Circle, and Bermuda partnership to build a fully on-chain economy was announced at WEF Davos 2026. “Excited to make progress on this and create a compelling case study for other nations to follow,” the crypto CEO concluded.

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Record $1.33 Billion Outflow In 2026 See-Saw Performance

The Bitcoin Spot ETFs continue to witness a volatile start to 2026, with back-to-back weeks showing sharply contrasting performance. After netting a staggering $1.42 billion in weekly netflows on January 16, market momentum soon swung the opposite way in line with a Bitcoin decline, forcing a net outflow of $1.33 billion over the last week. A similar phenomenon was seen in the first two weeks of the year, after an initial net deposit of $458.77 million by January 2 was followed by a net outflow of $681.01 million by January 9. This investor behavior suggests a highly reactive market with little long-term confidence. In analyzing the most recent wave of withdrawals in the Bitcoin Spot ETF market, data from SoSoValue shows that the fourth trading week of January recorded no single day with a positive netflow. The heaviest outflows totaled $708.71 million on January 21, followed by the smallest daily outflow of $32.11 million on January 22. Looking at individual funds, BlackRock’s IBIT, the market leader, suffered the largest net outflows valued at $537.49 million. As usual, Fidelity’s FBTC ranks a close second with redemptions surpassing deposits by $451.50 million. Other Bitcoin Spot ETFs with heavy net outflows also included Grayscale’s GBTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and Ark Invest’s ARKB, which suffered losses estimated at $172.09 million, $66.25 million, and $76.19 million, respectively. Meanwhile, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC also experienced net outflows between $6 million and $11 million. Notably, Grayscale’s BTC, Invesco’s BTCO, WisdomTree’s BTCW, and Hashdex’s DEFI recorded the least activity with zero netflows. At press time, total net assets for the Bitcoin Spot ETFs stand at $115.88 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT accounting for over 54% of these holdings, as the undisputed market leader. Meanwhile, total cumulative net inflow is presently valued at $56.49 billion.

Similar to its Bitcoin counterpart, the BlackRock ETHA also produced the largest net withdrawals valued at $431.50 million. Presently, the total net assets for the Ethereum Spot ETFs are valued at $17.70 billion, representing 4.99% of Ethereum’s market cap. Meanwhile, the cumulative total net inflow is valued at $12.30 billion. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Analyst Says You’re Not Bullish Enough On Ethereum – What Does He Mean?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. A growing number of analysts believe Ethereum’s current price action is being misunderstood. Although frustration is growing due to Ethereum’s inability to hold above $3,000, some technical analysts are quick to point out that the structure forming beneath the surface tells a very different story. According to one analyst, the real risk right now is not being bullish on Ethereum and trying to short in anticipation of a downside breakout. The analyst’s technical view on Ethereum is focused less on short-term momentum and more on the structure developing on the chart, which he argues is even clearer than what is currently visible on Bitcoin’s chart. Notably, Ethereum’s price action is carving out a series of higher lows on the daily candlestick timeframe chart to form a tightening triangular pattern since December 2025. This kind of behavior shows that each pullback is being absorbed at progressively higher levels, which is how strong trends reset before continuation. Ethereum needs to avoid a breakdown below key support zones in order for this trend continuation setup to still be valid. According to the analyst, a dip under $2,860 would begin to weaken the pattern, while a close below $2,780 would invalidate the higher-low structure. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,950, which is dangerously close to the lower boundary of this setup. Therefore, some traders will be tempted to short Ethereum at this level, but the analyst called it the dumbest thing to do here. As long as those levels ($2,860 and $2,780) hold, the analyst sees no technical justification for betting against ETH, especially near the lower boundary of the channel where buyers have repeatedly stepped in. If support holds, the next move would be a gradual return to the upper trendline of the channel, which is just below $3,340. A move into that region would bring price back into direct contact with overhead resistance and set the stage for a breakout if buying pressure continues to increase. Ethereum Price Chart. Source: @Tryrexcrypto on X Ethereum is entering 2026 without clear bullish momentum, a reality that has dampened sentiment across the spot and derivatives markets. Spot ETF inflows into Ethereum and Bitcoin have slowed down, and issuers have been highlighted with consistent days of outflows. Nonetheless, major asset managers are still holding huge amounts of Ethereum and are working on diversifying their activities on Ethereum. BlackRock, for example, filed with the SEC in December to launch a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund, a move that will bring in more institutional investors into the Ethereum ecosystem. Speaking of staking, BitMine Technologies recently amped up its ETH staking to over $5.71 billion worth of Ethereum. On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows that the firm has staked an additional 171,264, worth $503.2 million, pushing its total stake to over 1.94 million ETH.

Title: $7 Trillion Player Is Moving Into Bitcoin, Can This Trigger A Surge To $200,000?

Swiss banking giant UBS, with assets under management (AuM) of up to $7 trillion, is set to launch Bitcoin trading for some of its clients. This comes amid predictions that regulatory clarity and broader adoption could send the BTC price to as high as $200,000. Bloomberg reported that UBS is planning to launch crypto trading for some of its wealth clients, starting with its private bank clients in Switzerland. The bank will reportedly begin by offering these clients the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum. At the same time, the crypto offering could further expand to clients in the Pacific-Asia region and the U.S. The banking giant is currently in discussions with potential partners, and there is no clear timeline for when it could launch Bitcoin and Ethereum trading for clients. This move is said to be partly due to increased demand from wealth clients for crypto exposure. UBS also faces increased competition as other Wall Street giants are working to offer crypto trading. Morgan Stanley, in partnership with Zerohash, announced plans to launch crypto trading in the first half of this year, starting with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The banking giant may soon also be able to offer its crypto products, as it has filed with the SEC to launch spot BTC, ETH, and SOL ETFs. Furthermore, JPMorgan, another of UBS’ competitors, is considering offering crypto trading to institutional clients, although this plan is still in the early stages. The bank already accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral from its clients. Last year, it also filed to offer BTC structured notes that will track the performance of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. Kevin O’Leary predicted that Bitcoin could rally to between $150,000 and $200,000 this year, driven by the passage of the CLARITY Act. His prediction came just as White House Crypto Czar David Sacks said banks would fully enter crypto once the bill passes. As such, there is a possibility that BTC could reach this $200,000 psychological level in anticipation of the amount of new capital that could flow into BTC from these banks once the bill passes. BitMine’s Chairman, Tom Lee, also predicted during a CNBC interview that Bitcoin could reach between $200,000 and $250,000 this year, partly due to growing institutional adoption by Wall Street giants. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that a BTC rally to $200,000 is the “most obvious thing in the world” to him. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $89,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: XRP Ledger Enters The AI Era As Ripple Merges Two Mega Trends

Time Published: 2026-01-24T21:30:04Z

The XRP Ledger has entered a new phase of innovation as Ripple integrates to bring together two of the most powerful technology trends shaping the global economy. Long known for its speed, low transaction costs, and enterprise-grade reliability, the Ledger is now expanding beyond payments to data-driven and automated financial applications. By merging AI with decentralized settlement, Ripple is positioning the Ledger to support smarter workflows and more efficient liquidity management. An analyst known as SMQKE on X has shared a case study of an AI implementation in the cross-border payment, in which Ripple has successfully combined blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness of global transactions. As a leading provider of real-time cross-border payment solutions, Ripple leverages the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain that enables real-time cross-border settlement. Related Reading: Surge In XRP Transactions: 1.45 Million Daily Users Could Signal Price Rally Ahead, Says Expert What sets this integration apart is the use of AI to optimize transaction flows and routing decisions in real time. Ripple AI-powered systems continuously process large volumes of payment data in real time, allowing financial institutions to make dynamic decisions on the most effective payment paths. BlackRock is now using Ripple’s RLUSD as collateral, which is extremely bullish for XRP. JackTheRippler revealed that the altcoin is being positioned as the future infrastructure, which is being built with the potential to hit over $10,000 per coin. With the REAL token launching on January 26th, trillions in global capital could flood into the XRP Ledger. According to JackTheRippler, some projections suggest up to $800 billion could flow into the REAL token on XRP Ledger, potentially sparking a powerful supply shock. The rise of the phoenix XRP is here. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull highlighted that Caroline Pham isn’t just another name in crypto. Pham played a role in pushing utility regulation into the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), helping shift policy toward real-world use cases. Currently, she is at MoonPlay and posting about the phoenix on X. Related Reading: How Donald Trump’s Latest Crypto Move Will Boost Demand For XRP Years ago, Brad Garlinghouse drew that same phoenix, and it became one of the biggest pieces of XRP lore. While the market chased narratives, Ripple has been building institutional-grade crypto products for years. Meanwhile, the token, RLUSD, and the XRP Ledger are now live operating, and recognized among the most compliant blockchain assets in the crypto world. This is the same asset that survived the SEC’s biggest regulatory battles in crypto history, and is now on the other side with legal clarity, growing integration, and increasing relevance to government infrastructure in its favor. Xfinancebull concluded that Caroline has helped clear the regulatory path, Brad and Ripple built what actually runs on that path, and they have been aligning all along, which is how the real adoption happens.

Title: Bitcoin price to hit $180,000 if it overcomes this hurdle, analyst says
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/bitcoin-to-180000-if-one-thing-does-not-happen/
Time Published: 2026-01-24T17:51:24Z

About us Copy link Fears of quantum computing breaking Bitcoin’s encryption continue to plague Bitcoin investors. In fact, Eliezer Ndinga, global head of research at 21Shares, reckons that unless developers address the concern, Bitcoin won’t enjoy a rally anytime soon. But if developers act? It’s clear, blue skies. “If we get past the quantum threat, then Bitcoin can go to $180,000,” Ndinga told DL News. For now, however, “it’s a cloud in the air.” Every day more market watchers are cropping up and labelling quantum computing Bitcoin’s most pressing threat. Adding to Ndinga, Sergio Ermotti, CEO of Swiss investment bank UBS, said that Bitcoin needs to prove itself able to overcome quantum computing. Ray Dalio and BlackRock have made similar comments. They aren’t the only ones, however. Just last week, Christopher Wood, of Jefferies Group, removed Bitcoin from his long-standing portfolio recommendation. Instead, he’s urging investors to double down on gold and gold-mining stocks. “In the world of institutional allocation, virtually everyone I have talked to is quietly concerned about Bitcoin,” Nic Carter, a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, previously told DL News. Of late, Bitcoin developers and the broader community are finding themselves fighting over a vulnerability that hadn’t been taken seriously. Why are investors so fearful now? Because advances in quantum computing are coming at a rapid pace, and if the technology falls into the wrong hands, it could potentially break Bitcoin’s entire encryption model. Researchers at Chaincode Labs discovered that 20% to 50% of all Bitcoin could be stolen by actors using quantum computers. We’re talking about $400 billion to $900 billion that could be lost — including Satoshi Nakamoto’s alleged 1 million Bitcoin stash. In an interview with DL News, the first thing that Ndinga said was that quantum computing is a real threat. “The challenge is that we’re drowning in information but starving for a reason,” Ndinga said. “Crypto has to get past its teenage years and address this seriously.” When asked to rate the quantum threat on a scale of one to ten, Ndinga broke it down into two dimensions: timing and magnitude. “On magnitude, you’re talking about potentially 50% of all Bitcoin at risk,” he said. “On timing, it’s harder to pin down. We could be talking about a couple of years or a couple of decades.” That uncertainty is exactly what’s creating headwinds for institutional investors, according to Ndinga. And unless he acknowledges the vulnerability, he’ll lose credibility among investors. “I won’t be taken seriously if I don’t talk about quantum computing,” he said. While institutional concern mounts, there are Bitcoin developers working on solutions — although progress is slow. One of the proposals is BIP 360, authored by developers Hunter Beast and Ethan Heilman, and podcaster Isabel Foxen Duke. “Nearly everyone has been very grateful that we are taking the problem seriously,” Beast told DL News. “Our whole motto is: prepared, not scared.” Rather than forcing a sudden network-wide upgrade, BIP 360 would introduce a new type of Bitcoin address that allows users to voluntarily move funds into quantum-resistant protections, reducing long-term exposure without breaking existing wallets, the Lightning Network, or Layer-2 systems. BIP 360 is now into its second year of development, and according to Beast, it remains one of the most widely-discussed draft BIPs in Bitcoin’s history. That means little, however, since the notoriously lethargic Bitcoin Investment Proposal process means activation could still be years away. Beast acknowledged the urgency but cautioned against rushing. “We must remain thoughtful and diligent, while not rushing a half-baked solution,” he said. “Fortunately, the general consensus is that we still have time.” Pedro Solimano is a markets correspondent based in Buenos Aires.

Blade’s return following a five-week layoff is one of just three changes made by head coach Stuart Lancaster. Out-half Josh Ioane is named outside Blade, while Dylan Tierney-Martin comes in at hooker in place of the injured Dave Heffernan. Connacht have over 850 caps worth of experience to call upon from the bench with Bundee Aki, Jack Carty and Denis Buckley all named among the replacements. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO Meanwhile, Niall Smyth is set to make his Leinster debut as Leo Cullen navigates a tricky period of injuries among his tightheads. Smyth, who won a Leinster Schools Senior Cup with Blackrock in 2024, partners Jack Boyle and Gus McCarthy in the front row. Harry Byrne starts at out-half once again, while captain Caelan Doris is set to win his 100th Leinster cap. 15. Sam Gilbert 14. Shane Jennings 13. Harry West 12. Cathal Forde 11. Finn Treacy 10.

Ruben Moloney Referee: Eoghan Cross (IRFU) Just over five minutes to go until kick-off in Galway. The last time the sides met, only last month, Leinster were runaway winners in the end — but Connacht were excellent in the first half of that game at the Aviva. Imbued with home advantage and the sense of occasion in a new-look Dexcom Stadium, let’s see if this one is more competitive for 80. Nick Elliott / INPHO Nick Elliott / INPHO / INPHO Fantastic performance on the pitch pre-game, with all 26 Connacht clubs represented. Ballina man Caelan Doris leads Leinster onto the pitch to a fairly warm reception. And now here come Connacht to some serious noise! Dexcom Stadium is HOPPING. And it looks absolutely fantastic. Here we go! 1′ – CON 0-0 LEIN: Harry Byrne gets us underway at The Sportsground! Taken by Cathal Forde and Connacht exit through Caolin Blade. A little bit of argy-bargy before the first lineout. Brilliant! 6′ – CON 0-0 LEIN: Billy Bohan wins a scrum pen on Leinster debutant Niall Smyth and Connacht get a lineout on the Leinster 22′, but Josh Murphy spills it forward at the front. Leinster exit through Fintan Gunne, who booms it to touch on halfway. Then a half-break by Gus McCarthy who snatches one from Blade’s hands — and Leinster eventually win a penalty deep in Connacht territory as they impede Leinster at lineout time. 8′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! Fintan Gunne! The scrum-half crashes over after a sharp Leinster start in attack. Byrne converts for 7-0, and there’s a further double blow for Connacht: Cathal Forde and Sam Illo are gone off, replaced by Bundee Aki Jack Aungier respectively. Not sure if either of those were HIAS — will try to keep you posted. 11′ – TRY FOR CONNACHT! Dylan Tierney-Martin! Connacht respond immediately! Ferocious Leinster defence, phase after phase, but Tierney-Martin burrows over with a brilliant close-range finish. That’s a serious reaction by the hosts, and Sam Gilbert chips over the afters. He’s well over 90% from the tee since arriving at Connacht — I think he’s missed only one kick?! Seven each in Galway! 15′ – CON 7-7 LEIN: First chorus of ‘The Fields’ as Eoghan Cross sets up a scrum after some brilliant Connacht defence forced a Leinster error on midfield. And in the game’s second scrum, Connacht win their second scrum penalty. This time it’s Sam Illo on Jack Boyle. Connacht lineout outside the Leinster 22′. 16′ – CON 7-7 LEIN: Alex Soroka gets hands on Connacht ball in a ruck just outside the Leinster 22′ and referee Cross pings Connacht for side entry. Leinster lineout just inside the Connacht half — but Doris knocks it on on halfway. 20′ – CON 7-7 LEIN:Play stopped with Jack Boyle down, appearing to hold his calf. Andy Farrell will be holding his breath here — but Ireland’s loosehead injury crisis looks set to deepen. Stretcher coming on. Ah, Jeayyysus. Poor Boyle! That’s a massive blow to Ireland ahead of the Six Nations. 23′ – CON 7-7 LEIN: Boyle is replaced by Jerry Cahir. And Billy Bohan immediately wins another penalty on Smyth. Meanwhile, Sam Illo and Cathal Forde are both back on the field having passed their HIAs. Connacht back to their starting side. The hosts then win a further penalty as Lowe infringes in a ruck. Gilbert chips over three points from close range and Connacht lead for the first time! 26′ – CON 10-7 LEIN: Leinster attempting to play with tempo but another attack in the Connacht half breaks down as Gunne tries to feed the intended decoy in Doris but passes it forward. Leinster win a scrum pen, though, as Illo is pinged for not driving straight. Harry Byrne does what Gilbert did seconds earlier and pops over the easy three points. 29′ – CON 10-10 LEIN: A madcap passage of play leads to a Gunne chip through, which dribbles into touch deep inside the Connacht 22′. Connacht lose their second straight lineout — and Leinster are knocking on the door! Penalty advantage to the visitors also. 31′ – CON 10-10 LEIN: Connacht scramble well but concede two penalties in the process. Leinster will take three points once more from close range — surprising considering Connacht are on an official warning now. 32′ – CON 10-13 LEIN: Shane Jennings wins the restart — he’s been excellent in the air once again — and Connacht wind up earning a penalty outside the Leinster 22′ as Will Connors impedes Blade on the floor at the base of a ruck. Connacht will take a shot at goal, this one from left of centre. And Sam Gilbert does what Sam Gilbert does: we’re level once more! 36′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Cian Prendergast catches Snyman with a seatbelt tackle just inside the Connacht 10′. Advantage comes to nothing and Leinster go to touch — lineout just inside the home 22′. 37′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Sean Jansen melts Gus McCarthy off the Leinster lineout and forces the knock-on. Dexcom Stadium goes nuts! What a hit. It was borderline high but the TMO has checked it in the background and can’t find any head contact. Connacht scrum inside their own 22′. Terrifically enjoyable half if far from free-flowing! Vicious, pulsating stuff. Ireland will be sweating after Jack Boyle was stretchered off for the visitors. James Crombie / INPHO James Crombie / INPHO / INPHO Connacht on top in the scrum, where they lead 3-1 on penalties. But where it matters, it’s 13-13 following first-half tries by Fintan Gunne and Dylan Tierney-Martin, with the rest of the points coming from the respective boots of Harry Byrne and Sam Gilbert. Nick Elliott / INPHO Nick Elliott / INPHO / INPHO Catch you shortly! 41′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Back underway at Dexcom! A big 40 minutes ahead on what’s been a superb occasion so far. 45′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: A really open, loose start to the second half! Connacht have a scrum well inside the Leinster half after Ciarán Frawley knocked on during an attempted rip. The hosts almost got around the Leinster blitz there — but still savage defence by the eastern province! Alex Soroka, meanwhile, looks like he’s going off for a HIA. 47′ – CON 13-13 LEIN: Superb carry by Cathal Forde and he makes serious yardage deep into the Leinster 22′! Connacht go very close and Leinster concede the pen. Advantage comes to nothing, so Connacht go again with the tap. Paul Boyle reaches for the line but Leinster hold him up! Unreal defence by debutant Niall Smyth who had a tough first half! 48′ – TRY FOR CONNACHT! Harry West! What a score! Magic, magic, magic Connacht! The outstanding Sean Jansen and Finn Treacy combine and West collects the offload on the inside to score, pretty much under the sticks. Handbags afterwards and officials getting involved but the try will be good! Gilbert converts and Connacht lead! 51′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Sublime line-break by Fintan Gunne and he finds Snyman in support! The huge lock takes it close but Cian Prendergast wins the jackal penalty on the scramble and The Sportsground erupts again. What a piece of attack and defence by each side. This is cracker. 54′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Leinster have a penalty advantage inside the Connacht half — and now a penalty as Sam Gilbert and co. stop James Lowe and Ciarán Frawley down Leinster’s left. There’ll be a Leinster lineout deep in Connacht territory shortly, but Rónan Kelleher is just getting a bit of treatment. He looks alright. 56′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Connacht defend their line! Sean Jansen — man of the match by a wide margin to this point — wallops Scott Penny in contact and forces another knock-on. Connacht will get the scrum on their own 5′. The Fields of Athenry reverberates around Dexcom once again. 57′ – CON 20-13 LEIN: Leinster win the scrum penalty on the Connacht 5′! 57′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! RG Snyman! The visitors tap and go and after a first effort by Charlie Tector, RG Snyman breaches the whitewash and dots down! Harry Byrne brings us level again. What a final quarter we have in store. 59′ – CON 20-20 LEIN: Leinster’s tempo is starting to give Connacht big problems. 60′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! Charlie Tector! That’s inexcusable defence by Connacht, to be honest. Off first phase, Tector runs through Tierney-Martin and Aungier and goes right under the sticks from just outside the Connacht 22′. Leinster have turned this game on its head: they lead 27-20! 64′ – CON 20-27 LEIN: Connacht win a scrum pen near halfway. Jack Carty gives them a lineout up towards the Leinster 22′. 66′ – CON 20-27 LEIN: Another Connacht pen just outside the 22′ — Tector not rolling away — and Connacht take the three points. Gilbert brings the gap down to four as the rain begins to descend from the heavens over Galway again. 69′ – CON 23-27 LEIN: Nice grubber down the left by James Lowe and Leinster get a five-metre scrum after an error in judgement by Finn Treacy! The Connacht wing clips the ball with his instep ahead of the try-line and then dots it down. Leinster can kill it here. 70′ – TRY FOR LEINSTER! Ciarán Frawley against his future employers! That should do it! Leinster win a penalty advantage and eventually cross in the left-hand corner through the Connacht-bound Frawley, who just about gathers Harry Byrne’s delayed pass to score. Byrne converts from the left-hand touchline and Leinster lead by 11 with just under 10 minutes to go. That’s also the bonus point secured by Leinster. 72′ – CON 23-34 LEIN: Luke McGrath pins Connacht back with a beautiful box-kick over the top which rolls into touch near the Connacht 5′. Leinster have turned the screw here. That’ll do it: a special occasion for Connacht but they just about ran out of gas and, unfortunately for them, leave with nothing. Leinster take maximum points after another second-half surge against the Westerners, but that was a super game. Thanks for joining us. Keep an eye on The 42 for Murray Kinsella’s report and reaction.

Title: Aave Price Structure Hinges On Crucial $145 Level — Here’s How

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As the crypto market suffered a widespread decline, Aave (AAVE) prices dipped by nearly 10%, reaching a local bottom around $153. Presently, the altcoin is trading within a range of $155-$160, but an emerging chart pattern indicates an impending price breakout. In an X post on January 23, popular market expert Ali Martinez shares an insightful analysis of the AAVEUSD 4-hour chart, showing the altcoin is approaching a critical market juncture. Notably, a key support zone of $144 sits at the base of a broader descending structure that has defined AAVE’s price action since last year. Martinez’s analysis shows that AAVE is trading within a falling wedge formation, characterized by a series of lower highs capped by a descending trendline and relatively stable support near the $145 region. This price formation often represents a period of consolidation following sustained downside pressure, as sellers gradually lose momentum while buyers defend a key floor. For context, since topping out above the $350 level earlier in the cycle, AAVE has experienced a steady corrective move, with price stepping down through multiple horizontal levels near $240, $200, and $162. The loss of these zones shifted short-term momentum firmly in favor of sellers, making the current support range even more important. At present, AAVE is trading in the mid $150s, leaving limited room before a direct retest of the $144.93 support. However, this level has already acted as a demand zone multiple times during the current downtrend, reinforcing its significance. According to Martinez’s analysis, a clean break below $145 could force an accelerated downside move, with the next major support area set around $125. In that scenario, price acceptance below the wedge structure would likely confirm a continuation of the broader bearish trend. Conversely, holding the $145 support may provide the conditions for a technical rebound. A successful defense of this level, combined with a break above the descending trendline, could allow AAVE to reclaim higher resistance zones around $162 and potentially $200 over time. While such a move would not immediately invalidate the larger corrective structure, it would suggest improving market balance and decreased selling pressure. At press time, Aave trades at $156.99, reflecting a decline of 0.76% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the daily trading volume is up by 6.07% and valued at $362.59 million. With price compressing toward the apex of the falling wedge, traders should expect increased volatility in the coming AAVE trading sessions. For now, the price moves at $144.93 as a pivotal inflection point for determining the next directional move.

Title: A Ghost is Haunting Davos! The WEF Summit
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/ghost-haunting-davos/5913196
Time Published: 2026-01-24T12:52:19Z
Full Content:
The 2026 Davos Summit of the World Economic Forum (WEF) will undoubtedly go down in history. Just as the fall of the Berlin Wall symbolized the end of the First Cold War with the victory of the United States, I believe the Davos Summit, which began on Monday, is declaring the end of American hegemony. To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Español, Русский, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. The World Economic Forum shouldn’t be taken lightly. Founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a student of Kissinger who was a former lawyer for Rockefeller, this foundation has been renowned for shaping the course of the capitalist world for 50 years. Note: The WEF’s founding date coincides with the year the US dollar was removed from the gold standard. Image: Brende in 2023 (Public Domain) At this year’s summit, Borge Brende, a low-profile Norwegian right-wing politician who has taken over the seat of the now-retired Klaus Schwab, is attempting to keep the foundation afloat; Even if he says, “The World Economic Forum isn’t about responding to current events. It’s about orchestrating the right conditions to move forward,” it’s all in vain. There’s great chaos at the top level. The culprit is Emperor Trump, who, like a bull in a china shop, is destroying everything in the Western establishment. Trump is actually feigning madness, but he knows perfectly well that his country is in a terrible situation. Its total debt has reached $40 trillion, and for the first time in history, its annual interest payments exceed its military spending by one trillion dollars. To address this, Trump has increased the Pentagon budget to $1.5 trillion by 2026. What Trump is doing, continuing with “Iran, Venezuela, Mexico, Greenland, Canada,” is like a powerful opponent overturning the table after losing the game. In my opinion, Trump is playing the role of a madman to prevent the inevitable collapse of the US. He probably doesn’t need to act that much, given his nature. As the spoiled and useless child of a wealthy contractor whose father was a Jewish lobbyist, nonsense and perversion are in his blood. But the bitter truth is emerging at the annual meeting of finance capital in Davos. The Western world is accepting defeat. For example, what did Larry Fink, the famous CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, say? “Global elites have lost the public’s trust and are currently facing ‘deep institutional distrust.’ If the WEF wants to be useful in the future, it must regain that trust.” Fink is referring to the Plandemic and the Great Reset scenarios. And of course, he’s describing the horrific income inequality in the world and the savagery of neoliberalism, or finance capital, that ran rampant after 1980. He’s practically confessing the sins of capitalism’s as a grey cardinal! “Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the greatest wealth in history has been created, but this money has gone into the pockets of a tiny minority, enough to disrupt social peace. No society can sustain such an unjust distribution for long; eventually, the system will crack.” The End of White-Collar Workers: “Just as globalization hit the factory worker, Artificial Intelligence will now do the same to office workers, lawyers, and analysts. I’m not talking about the future, I’m talking about today!” You’d think he was about to sing the international anthem! But Fink, burning with rage as gold, silver, and copper soared while stock markets and the dollar crashed, wasn’t alone. The announcement of the collapse of the West’s “rules-based order” was made by the US’s immediate neighbor. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivered a speech that was at least as important, perhaps even more so, than Fink’s: “We knew the narrative of a rules-based international order was a lie. We knew that the most powerful actors would exempt themselves when it suited them. But this construct was convenient.” Carney also admitted that he had accepted American hegemony because it suited the purposes of his government. But now the system had broken down. The former central banker-turned-prime minister alluded to Vaclav Havel’s famous story of the greengrocer. In the story, a greengrocer in the Soviet Union hangs a sign in his shop that reads “Workers of the world unite,” even though he doesn’t believe it. But one day he decides not to conform and takes it down; this spreads, and communism collapses! “This fiction was useful. That’s why we put the sign up in the window. We are not in a transition period, but in the midst of a rupture. We are aware of what is happening and we are determined to act accordingly. We know that a rupture requires more than just conformity. It requires honestly accepting the world as it is. We are taking the sign down.” This was a response to Trump’s “initiation of illegality” and the very announcement of the specter haunting Davos: the collective acceptance by the West of the end of US hegemony. Like Fink and Carney, Belgian Prime Minister (right wing-conservative) Bart De Wever stated: “On Wednesday, together with King Philippe of Belgium, we will meet with Trump. But this will have a different character than we planned. The message we will probably have to give is: You are crossing red lines here. Either we stand together or we are divided; if we are divided, it will be the end of 80 years of Atlanticism, a real era will close. And you know, as Gramsci said: “While the old is dying, the new is not yet born, now is the time of monsters. It is up to him (Trump) to decide whether he will be a monster or not, yes or no?” The Italian communist philosopher Antonio Gramsci, like the famous Czech anti-communist Vaclav Havel, was declaring the end of the Second Cold War and the defeat of the US long after his death (through the mouths of the most ardent capitalists). While all this was happening, the EU announced it was canceling its trade agreement with the US. The US was offering Denmark $700 billion to buy Greenland (including a one-time payment of one million dollars to each Greenland citizen to accept US citizenship), and Iran was preparing for what was likely an imminent US-Israeli attack. At Davos, the club of the wealthy where the future of the world and capitalism was discussed, the familiar rhetoric of global warming was also shelved. In fact, it would become clear at this summit that the chemicals sprayed into the air under the pretext of global warming were not a conspiracy theory. Journalist James O’Keefe secretly filmed at the World Economic Forum, recording elites confessing to things long dismissed as “conspiracy theories.” World Economic Forum in casual conversations with O’Keefe, the elite openly admitted that chemicals were being sprayed into the atmosphere and even agricultural areas to cool the planet. One company executive acknowledged that many of these operations were being carried out quietly and behind closed doors by the US military; “A large part of the work is actually done by the (US) military. They do it constantly, and it’s actually quite cheap.” Those lines we saw in the sky were indeed chemicals dropped from planes! In short, the end of Pax Americana was announced in Davos, and the ghost of reality began to howl in the Swiss Alps. The panic among the bosses shows that the world has now reached a turning point. Whether good or bad… Note: Meanwhile, China and Russia seem to be enjoying the taste of winning without doing much. What the Chinese delegation said in Davos suggests that Western leaders (like Mark Carney) will soon be heading to China. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng said in Davos: “The world cannot return to the law of the jungle where the strong prey on the weak.” “China is ready to be not only the world’s factory, but also the world’s market,” he said. However, when Trump arrived in Davos, Switzerland, there was no one to greet him. There was no official welcome. No delegation was present. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Citi has largely put the dog days of its multiyear transformation behind it, and CEO Jane Fraser signaled a shift from remediation to competition. The next step is cultural. In a memo to employees last week, Fraser told Citi's more than 200,000 workers that "the bar is raised" and that it was time to ditch bad habits. When Fraser took over as Citi's chief executive in 2021, the bank was under intense scrutiny — bogged down by regulatory pressure, dated and weak technology, and investor doubts about whether it could still compete with Wall Street's most established names. Five years in, the stock is up about 40% over the past year and more than 80% over the past five — signs that investors are increasingly confident the firm has moved past its worst problems. Central to the bank's efforts are three executives she hired to run businesses that are key to Citi's growth: investment banking, wealth management, and technology. Brian Mulberry, a portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, offered a sports analogy. "If Jane Fraser is the quarterback, you need really strong skill positions — the receivers and running backs — to carry the ball over the goal line. These are the five-star recruits you'd want on that team," he told Business Insider. "They're now on offense." Corporate dealmaker Viswas Raghavan has earned an industry reputation for pushing his people. Andy Sieg is the politically savvy denizen of the white-glove world of money management. And Tim Ryan is the steady hand from consulting, tasked with reinventing the bank's technology backbone. Their rise has fueled some quiet succession chatter, though Fraser has given no indication she is considering stepping aside anytime soon. As her no-nonsense year takes shape, here is how those three executives have fared in reshaping their units and how they're helping enforce her mandate. Title: Executive Vice Chairman and Head of Banking Since Viswas "Vis" Raghavan took over Citi's investment banking business in June 2024, the unit is showing clear signs of momentum. Investment banking fees rose 35% year over year in 2025, with M&A revenues jumping 84%, according to Citi's fourth-quarter results. Fraser highlighted some of the bank's most prominent client wins during the earnings call, including mandate work for Boeing, Pfizer, Nippon Steel, Johnson & Johnson, and private-equity firms Blackstone and TPG. Last year, Citi advised on Nippon Steel's roughly $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel, and on Charter Communications' announced nearly $35 billion combination with Cox Communications. As head of banking, he oversees investment banking, corporate banking, and commercial banking — a sprawling remit that puts him at the vanguard of many of Citi's most financially important relationships. Raghavan is known in the industry for his high expectations. A 25-year JPMorgan veteran, Raghavan ran the firm's league table-topping investment banking franchise and oversaw its business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Landing Raghavan's star power was a boon for Citi, Mulberry said. "It absolutely matters who is backing the deal. Having that specific hire, with the confidence he brings" in the eyes of the kinds of clients Citi wants, is a triumph for the bank, he added. His credibility has helped him rebuild Citi's senior dealmaking ranks from rivals — especially JPMorgan. He's lured JPMorgan bankers Drago Rajkovic and Guillermo Baygual to serve as global co-heads of M&A at Citi. Former Goldman Sachs partner David Friedland joined Citi last summer as co-head of North America investment banking. And the Wall Street Journal reported this week that former JPMorgan banker Alex Berkett, an ex-Paramount executive, would join to build Citi's media business. Title: Head of Wealth In a note sent to employees of his division following earnings results last week, Andy Sieg said key focuses for the division would include leading the way in wealth advisory, deepening the integration of wealth offerings through the US retail bank, and incorporating AI into regular, daily workflows. He shared a chart showing Citi Wealth revenue up 22% in two years. And he doubled down on Fraser's empathic message. "For 2026, the bar has been raised," he wrote in the memo, which was viewed by Business Insider and confirmed by a Citi spokesperson. "Jane speaks of scale for the bank; it will be our watchword as well. Strong, sustained organic growth will be ours if we double down on a set of strategic priorities," including fomenting "a culture of ownership, accountability, and innovation," he added. Sieg joined Citi in late 2023 to fix its wealth business. Sieg previously oversaw roughly 25,000 employees at Bank of America, where he had risen to the role of president of Merrill Wealth Management. The bank said wealth revenue grew 14% in 2025, according to fourth-quarter earnings. Mulberry said Citi could rebuild wealth gradually over time, but argued that Sieg's background speeds things up. "I think on the wealth management side, there's a fair argument you could do that organically," he said, "but it helps to have a weighty name that's been successful in gathering assets at a place like Merrill Lynch." Sieg has moved away from the single global private-bank head structure and made targeted hires, including former BlackRock portfolio manager Kate Moore to run the chief investment office and ex-Morgan Stanley executive Dawn Nordberg to deepen ties between wealth and banking. Citi has also added senior private bankers like Clinton Warren, a former JPMorgan private banker, to lead teams in the central US. He has also had notable exits, including longtime private bank chief Ida Liu, who left in early 2025; and Valentín Valderrábano, chief operating officer for global wealth, whose exit was announced this month. He is following Liu to her new employer, HSBC. It's also been reported that Sieg was the subject of an internal investigation into his conduct. A Financial Times report from October raised some questions about how the probe was conducted, but Citi told the FT that it approaches "all internal complaints appropriately by conducting unbiased, thorough, and complete investigations", and noted a "commitment to a workplace where everyone is treated fairly and has equal opportunity to succeed." Title: Head of Technology and Business Enablement Citi is pushing deep into artificial intelligence as it moves out of its long-running cleanup phase. More than 80% of Citi's transformation programs are now at or close to their target state, Fraser said on the latest earnings call. That progress has enabled the bank to shift its focus toward growth and innovation. That next phase is being largely driven by Tim Ryan, who joined Citigroup in 2024 after spending nearly two decades at PwC, most recently as the consulting firm's US chair. Fraser tapped him to run technology and business enablement as Citi worked to move past years repairing outdated systems and addressing regulatory shortcomings. Early on, he was tasked with turning around Citi's substandard data management systems. Last summer, he was named one of the senior executives overseeing Citi's AI strategy. Citi has begun embedding artificial intelligence into core processes across the firm — from know-your-customer reviews to loan underwriting — starting with more than 50 of its largest and most complex workflows. Employees in 84 countries have already used the bank's proprietary AI tools tens of millions of times with adoption exceeding 70% across the workflow. According to the bank's third-quarter earnings report last year, Citi used generative AI to conduct one million automated code reviews, saving approximately 100,000 hours per week across its developer population. In the fall, Ryan wrote on LinkedIn that Citi had rolled out prompt training to help workers get more out of the tech, and cheered the bank's plans to rev the engine on agentic AI. But competition is rife. The broader finance industry is being rapidly reshaped by AI, with powerhouse firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan spending billions to supercharge their workforces. The fight to secure top AI talent has intensified. Citi has spent years defined by baggage from its past that it's been under pressure to fix. Now, it has the rare chance to define what it wants to be. Fraser wants her staff to know there's no time to lose. She concluded her memo with a clear directive: "Let's get it done." Jump to

Title: Take a look at the fanciest private jets and government aircraft that took the rich and powerful to Davos

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people traveled to Switzerland this week, to attend the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos. That meant some of the world's fanciest aircraft descended on nearby airports, too. Business Insider has been tracking the private jets and government aircraft that arrived there this week. On Monday alone, there were around 160 private jet arrivals from over 40 countries spread across five continents. The majority appeared to land at Zurich Airport, which is 75 miles from Davos. In a press release, the airport said it expected more than 1,000 extra takeoffs and landings due to the WEF. Others landed at Friedrichshafen, over the border with Germany, or St Gallen, also near Lake Constance. From Elon Musk's Gulfstream G650 to Air Force One, here's some of the most impressive aircraft. On Monday, 31 of the 157 private jet arrivals were Gulfstream G650s. Throughout the week in Switzerland, data from JetSpy showed such planes belonging to: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Blackstone, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase. Gulfstream jets are known for their large, circular windows, which give high-flyers great views. Business jets can be configured in different ways depending on what the customer wants. Sometimes, they have double beds and an on-board shower. It's more likely that a billionaire flying solo would choose that, whereas a company would probably prefer more seats. These are pretty rare to see since they're so spacious compared to other business jets. A Boeing Business Jet version of the 737 Max costs about $100 million. Flight-tracking data showed a private 737 that flew from Dubai to Zurich on Sunday. Another one from Dubai went to Friedrichshafen, a lakeside German city just over the Swiss border, on Tuesday. Some governments also use the 737 to transport political leaders. In Switzerland this week, flight-tracking data showed such planes belonging to the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands. Due to its size, the Boeing 737 business jet is even more customizable than Gulfstream or Bombardier aircraft. Sometimes they are laid out like a typical airliner, with six seats abreast. But there is room for all sorts of amenities, too. Business Insider toured one in 2024, which had an on-board bar, two double bedrooms, and two showers. The first Gulfstream G800 was only delivered last August, so they're still relatively rare to see. It costs about $70 million to buy one. A handful of them flew into Swiss airports this week. JetSpy data shows they included ones owned by Visa, Qualcomm, and Pfizer. It's big enough to have room for four living areas on board. Passengers also shouldn't feel as fatigued as flying commercial, because the G800's cabin pressure makes it feel like the altitude is 2,480 feet. On the newest airliners, like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the cabin altitude is more like 6,000 feet. According to data from JetSpy, the above jet is owned by Robert F. Smith, the billionaire founder of Vista Equity Partners. The private equity firm's logo is on the tail. Flight-tracking data shows this Global 7500 flew from Atlanta to Zurich, about 75 miles from Davos, last Saturday. JetSpy data showed that other Bombardier plans that landed in Switzerland this week include ones owned by: Avram Glazer, the Manchester United co-owner; Steve Witkoff, the special envoy to the Middle East; and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma. This is the interior of a Global 7500 owned by VistaJet, a private charter firm that operates the most such jets. Several of its planes touched down in Switzerland during the week of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. Emmanuel Macron appeared to arrive in Davos on Tuesday. That morning, two French government jets — a Dassault Falcon 7X and a smaller Falcon 900 — flew to Zurich from an air base near Paris. However, it appears he left before Trump's speech. Even the president couldn't help compliment Macron's eyewear, which spawned plenty of memes and jokes online. "Those beautiful sunglasses," Trump said. "What the hell happened?" Macron has worn them in public in recent days due to an eye problem. A Dassault Falcon 8X arrived in Zurich from Scottsdale, Arizona, on Tuesday, flight-tracking data showed. It costs about $60 million to buy a new one, or $14,000 an hour to charter. More popular than the Falcon 8X in Switzerland this week was the smaller Falcon 2000 jet. Trump was supposed to fly to Zurich aboard the usual presidential jet, a Boeing VC-25A. It's a militarized version of the Boeing 747 airliner. However, 30 minutes into his journey, the plane U-turned and went back to Joint Base Andrews. He instead flew on a Boeing C-32A. It's not quite as fancy and is usually used as the Vice President's Air Force Two. Any plane carrying the president is designated as Air Force One while he is on it. This week served as a reminder of Trump's impatience with Boeing over delays in building the new Air Force One. His press secretary took the opportunity to mention the 747 that he was gifted by Qatar. That plane is currently undergoing modifications and refitting by the Air Force. The Sikorsky VH-60N White Hawk flew in a convoy of at least five helicopters. They took about 40 minutes to fly from Zurich Airport to Davos on Wednesday. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has had a busy start to the year. He flew on a military version of the Airbus A330. It first arrived in Beijing on January 14, flew to Doha a few days later, and then to Zurich on Monday. Carney won plenty of attention for his speech in Davos about the change in world politics since Trump's election. "We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition," he said. The above Azerbaijani private jet landed in Zurich on Tuesday. The Argentine government's Boeing 757 jet, registered as "ARG-01," arrived in Zurich on Tuesday. Flight-tracking data showed it departed Buenos Aires on Monday evening, then stopped in the Canary Islands, before heading to Switzerland. The journey took about 15 hours. Jump to

Title: Ethereum Outlook Splits Wall Street as BlackRock Bets on Tokenization While JPMorgan Remains Cautious
URL: https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-outlook-splits-wall-street-as-blackrock-bets-on-tokenization-while-jpmorgan-remains-cautious/

Ethereum’s 2026 outlook appears to have split Wall Street giants BlackRock and JPMorgan. While the $14 trillion asset manager BlackRock notes that tokenization might benefit the network, JPMorgan notes that Ethereum is still not out of the woods yet. The diverging opinions come amid a surge in network activity, despite the ETH price stalling amid a bearish trend across the broader market. Earlier this week, BlackRock stated that Ethereum is set to dominate the tokenization industry. The asset manager noted that the network could emerge as the gateway for traditional companies looking to dip their toes into blockchain. According to the head of equity ETFs at the asset management firm, Jay Jacobs, if the number of firms using the Ethereum network to tokenize real-world assets increases, ETH could be on a bullish trajectory. BlackRock also notes that as demand for tokenization increases, trading activity on the network will increase, and so will the issuance of various assets, such as stablecoins. The report comes nearly two years after the asset manager launched its first tokenized fund on Ethereum, known as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). The fund currently has a stablecoin market cap of more than $221 billion. Despite BlackRock’s bullish take, the firm’s iShares Ethereum Trust has been bleeding for the last three consecutive days. During this time, the ETF has seen more than $387 million in outflows, a trend that has coincided with a nearly 12% drop in ETH prices over the last week. JPMorgan has taken a cautious outlook on Ethereum, saying that the recent uptick in network activity might not be sustained. According to the banking giant, the factors that previously hampered network usage might still be at play, which could trigger a bearish correction in the future. Analysts at the bank added that the recent surge in activity might be due to the Fusaka upgrade that went live towards the end of 2025. However, historical data shows that these upgrades only improve network activity for a short time before stalling. JPMorgan also notes that user migration from the mainnet to layer two networks could stall activity, making it challenging for the ETH price to sustain an upward trajectory.

The top five teams in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League have opened up a 10-point gap to the bottom four, adding significant to the clash between Young Munster (28 points) in sixth and third-placed Terenure (32) at Tom Clifford Park, where the visitors last won in 2017. What’s more, Munsters are seeking a second consecutive double over Terenure after a 29-19 win at Lakelands Park in early December. Despite winning just one of their first six matches, it was clear the Cookies’ results were misleading, picking up seven bonus points in those first four defeats. But that win over Terenure sparked a maximum haul of 15 points from their last three games, and this weekend make just two changes to the side that won at Nenagh last time out. Munster and former Connacht and Ireland Sevens winger Andrew Smith returns while Leo Langbridge starts in the backrow. Terenure make one change to the team that ended a three-game losing streak at home to Old Belvedere a fortnight ago, Leinster hooker John McKee returning to the fold as Max Russell reverts to openside after playing for Leinster A in Toulouse last weekend while Ben Blaney is on duty with the Ireland Under-20s. The rest of the top five teams will be favourites to win, although the same was true in early December when UCD produced their best performance of the season to beat Lansdowne 43-38. The students’ make two changes for the return meeting in Belfield, Leinster academy and Ireland Under-20 Grand Slam winner James Culhane coming in at number eight and Thomas Quinn at scrumhalf. Lansdowne make four changes; Harry O’Riordan at inside centre, Jack Matthews and Stephen Madigan in the halfback line, and Harry van Eeden at eight. Leinster scrumhalf Cormac Foley is also among the replacements after a length injury lay-off. Leaders Clontarf (42 points), seeking a 10th successive win, are unchanged at home to Nenagh, who have lost all 10 games this season, while second-placed St Marys (37) make just one change for the visit of seventh-place Ballynahinch (21). Cork Con (fourth, 32) take their four-game winning run to Old Belvedere for a first meeting at Ollie Campbell Park since 2016. The 1B leaders Old Wesley go to Queens, while the 2A and 2B unbeaten duo of MU Barnhall and Galwegians continue their push for promotion at home to Greystones and Navan respectively. Division 1A: Clontarf v Nenagh Ormond, Castle Avenue; Old Belvedere v Cork Constitution, Ollie Campbell Park; UCD v Lansdowne, Belfield; Young Munster v Terenure College, Tom Clifford Park; St Mary’s College v Ballynahinch, Lakelands Park (3pm). Division 1B: Blackrock College v Instonians, Blackrock College School Pitch; City Of Armagh v UCC, Palace Grounds; Highfield v Dublin University, Woodleigh Park; Naas v Garryowen, Rathoe Road; Queen’s University v Old Wesley, Dub Lane. Division 2A: Banbridge v Ballymena, Rifle Park; Cashel v Galway Corinthians, Spafield; Dungannon v Old Crescent, Stevenson Park; MU Barnhall v Greystones, Parsonstown; Shannon v Wanderers, Thomond Park Back Pitch. Division 2B: Clogher Valley v Skerries, The Cran; Galwegians v Navan, Crowley Park; Rainey v Buccaneers, Hatrick Park; Sligo v Enniscorthy, Hamilton Park; UL Bohemian v Malone, UL 4G.

Title: Gonna be golden: join the flight to gold and other precious metals
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fine-art-antiques/2026/01/24/gonna-be-golden-join-the-flight-to-gold-and-other-precious-metals/

Amid persistent geopolitical tensions rise in various parts of the world, precious metals such as gold and silver continue to see strong price growth. “The price of silver and gold has risen greatly in the past 60 days, mainly due to what’s going on in the world, from Greenland to the Middle East to Ukraine,” says John Weldon of Weldon Auctioneers in Cows Lane, Temple Bar, Dublin. Earlier this week, pure silver ingot was on the market for about €2.60 per gramme, compared with €1.39 per gramme in mid-November 2025. “People and banks move cash funds into the safety of silver and gold, not only to guard as an inflation hedge, but also to have a tangible asset,” Weldon says. John Weldon Auctioneers will be selling a commemorative set of silver ingots celebrating 1,000 years of the British monarchy from AD 973 to 1973, at their next auction on Tuesday, January 27th, at 2pm. Weldon says potential purchasers of this walnut-cased set of 50 silver ingots (each of which has a portrait and scene of a British monarch), will be more interested in the gramme weight of the silver rather than the historic significance of the item. The combined weight of the collection is about 3,300g. Although one would imagine that such a collection would sell better in the UK than in Ireland, Weldon says Irish owners have found that post-Brexit import duties have made it much less attractive for Irish owners to sell items of significant historic British interest there. The 1973 limited edition set made by John Pinches in London has an estimate of €5,000-€8,000, with the upper figure representing a little under the market price for silver (which stood at €2.57 per gramme earlier this week). Weldon says gold sovereign coins are another way of storing value. The auction includes three gold sovereign coins with guides of €700-€800 each, and a Canadian silver coin dated 2018 with a guide price of €400-€700. If predictions about people spending less time on their smartphones comes to pass, older-style time pieces such as alarm clocks and watches may well come back into vogue. Watches feature prominently in both Adams Blackrock online auction on January 28th at 7pm, and the aforementioned John Weldon in-person and live online auction on January 27th at 2pm. Elena McCrory of Adams Blackrock says Omega, Rolex, Patek Philippe, Longines and Raymond Weil watches are always in demand. A Rolex GMT-Master II Oyster-Perpetual Date man’s stainless steel wristwatch (€8,000-€9,000), and a Rolex Oyster 18-carat yellow gold diamond woman’s wristwatch (€6,000-€7,000) are included in the auction. Meanwhile, an 18-carat gold Rolex Oyster Date wristwatch with a white face and roman numeral dial (€9,500-€11,500) and an 18-carat Cartier Tank Française Chronograph wristwatch (€5,000-€6,000) are among the watches for sale at Weldon’s auction. The latter includes three sub-dials that track seconds, minutes and hours for anyone in need of such exact measurements for sporting or other pursuits. The Weldon auction also has a stainless steel Rolex Oyster Date wristwatch with a guide price of €3,000-€4,000. Most guide prices for watches at auction are substantially below the retail price of an equivalent watch. Moving on to matters much more mechanical, Wilsons Auctions in Belfast is holding a timed online auction of vintage tractors from Wednesday, January 28th, at 2pm, to Friday, January 30th. Collected over 60 years by Ronnie Deering of Newtownards, Co Down, the John Deere, Case, Chamberlin and Hanomag tractors date from 1918 to 1969 and were sourced in the UK, across Europe and in Australia. David Deering, son of Ronnie and Margaret Deering (who also ran Ballycastle House B&B for a number of years), has fond memories of participating in road runs, agricultural shows and vintage tractor shows over the years. Mount Stewart and Rosemount Estate in Greyabbey, Co Down, and Shane’s Castle, Co Antrim, were among the most popular local venues for such events. At least two of the Deering tractors for sale – a 1922 Case 12/20 Crossmotor tractor and a 1949 Chamberlin tractor – that were used in the Cooley Vintage Festival in 2007. At that event, more than 4,500 tractors helped set the Guinness World Record for the most veteran tractors ploughing simultaneously. Ronnie Deering, who worked for the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland, bought some of his collection in Western Australia when visiting family there. Now in his 80s, he is ready to sell 12 of them, while the family retains eight or nine others, alongside vintage cars for future generations of the Deering family. “Myself and my father have restored many of these tractors over the years and we built an insulated shed to store them,” says David Deering, who expects strong interest in the vintage tractors from collectors here as well as abroad. Viewing takes place at the Deering residence (BT222AL) on Monday, January 26th, 10am-5pm. jwa.ie, adamsblackrock.ie, wilsonsauctions.com Estimate €500-€800 Hammer price €3,000 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €800-€1,200 Hammer price €1,300 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €400-€600 Hammer price €1,300 Auction house Adam’s Estimate €600-€1,000 Hammer price €1,800 Auction house Adam’s Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

Title: Elon Musk on Mars, robots and how AI will be ‘smarter than humans this year’

Larry Fink, president and CEO of investment firm BlackRock, interviewed Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX at the World Economic forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. They spoke about everything from AI to robotics to Mars, and Musk offered a vision of the future that’s coming more quickly than you might think. Here’s an excerpt of their conversation: Larry Fink: So you’re presently building on AI, on robotics, on space, on energy, all at the same time. When you look across those efforts, what do they have in common from an engineering standpoint? Elon Musk: Well, they’re all very difficult technology challenges, but the overall goal of my companies is to maximize the future of civilization, like basically maximize the probability that civilization has a great future, and to expand consciousness beyond Earth. So if you take SpaceX, for example, that SpaceX is about advancing rocket technology to the point where we can extend. Life and consciousness beyond Earth, to the Moon, to Mars, eventually to other star systems. And I think we should always view consciousness, life as we know it, as precarious and delicate. Because to the best of our knowledge, we don’t know of life anywhere else. You know, I’m often asked, are there aliens among us? And I’ll say that I am one, but . . . We have 9,000 satellites up there. And not once have we had to maneuver around an alien spaceship. So I’m like, I don’t know. Bottom line is, I think we need to assume. Life and consciousness is extremely rare, and it might only be us. And if that’s the case, then we need to do everything possible to ensure that the light of consciousness is not extinguished, because the way I view it is, the image in my mind of a tiny candle in a vast darkness, tiny candle of consciousness, that could easily go out. And that’s why it’s important to make life multi-planetary, such that if there is a natural disaster or a man-made disaster on Earth, that consciousness continues. That’s the purpose of SpaceX. Tesla is obviously about sustainable technology and . . . And also, at this point, we’ve sort of added to our mission sustainable abundance. So with robotics and AI. This is really the path to abundance for all. People often talk about solving global poverty, or essentially, how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? I think the only way to do this is AI and robotics, which doesn’t mean that it is without its issues. I mean, we need to be very careful with AI. We need to be very careful with robotics. We don’t want to find ourselves in a James Cameron movie. You know, “Terminator.” But if you have ubiquitous AI that is essentially free or close to it, and ubiquitous robotics, then you will have an explosion in the global economy, an expansion of the global economy that is truly beyond all precedent. Fink: How can that be created? How can it broaden the global economy? Musk: In the benign scenario of the future . . . there will be such an abundance of goods and services because my prediction is that there’ll be more robots than people. Fink: But how do you then have human purpose? Musk: Yeah, I mean, you know, nothing’s perfect, but I mean it is a necessary, like you can’t have both. You can’t have work that has to be done and amazing abundance for all. . . . But if you have billions of humanoid robots, and I think there will be, I think everyone on Earth is going to have one and going to want one. Because who wouldn’t want a robot to, assuming it’s very safe, watch over your kids, take care of your pets? If you have elderly parents, a lot of friends might have elderly parent, so it’s very difficult to take care them. Yeah, it’s expensive and they just aren’t enough young people to take care of the old people. So if you had a robot that could take care of and protect an elderly parent, I think that would be great. That would be an amazing thing to have. And I think we will have those things. So overall, I’m very optimistic about the future. I think we’re headed for a future of amazing abundance, which is very cool, and definitely we are in the most interesting time in history. Fink: So in the future that you talk about, the AI models, autonomous machines, rockets, depends on massive increases of compute, massive increases in energy, expensive energy, manufacturing scale. What are the bottlenecks to get there? Musk: I think the limiting factor for AI deployment is fundamentally electrical power. It’s just, right, it’s energy. I mean, we’re seeing the rate of AI chip production increase exponentially, but the rate of electricity being brought online is negligible, 10%, 4% a year, max. It’s clear that we’re very soon, maybe even later this year, we’ll be producing more chips than we can turn on. Except for China, China’s growth in electricity is tremendous. They’re building 100 gigawatts of nuclear as we speak. Actually, solar is the biggest thing in China. . . . China, just in solar, can do half of US electricity output per year. Solar is by far the biggest source of energy. And that’s why one of the things we’ll be doing with SpaceX within a few years is launching solar-powered AI satellites because the space is really the source of immense power, and then you don’t need to take up any room on Earth. There’s so much room in space, and you can scale to hundreds of terawatts a year. Fink: You and I have had these conversations before, but why don’t you tell the audience what would it take for the United States and what type of geography would it take to have that solar field to electrify the United States? And why aren’t we doing it? Musk: Yeah, so, I mean, I guess a rough way to think about it is 100 miles by 100 miles, I’ll call it 160 kilometers by 160 kilometers of solar is enough to power the entire United States. Yeah, 100 mile by 100 mile areas is, I mean, you could take basically a small corner of Utah. Nevada. Nevada, New Mexico. Obviously, you wouldn’t want it all in one place. But it is a very small percentage of the area of the US to generate all of the electricity that the US uses. And the same is true, actually, for Europe. You could take a small part. You can take. Relatively unpopulated areas of say Spain and Sicily and generate all of the electricity power that Europe needs. Fink: So why don’t you think that there’s a movement toward that here and in the United States? Musk: Unfortunately, in the US, the tariff barriers for solar are extremely high. And that makes the economics of deploying solar artificially high because China makes almost all the solar . . . We obviously don’t control the US tariff policy. But for other countries, China makes solar cells that are incredibly low cost. Fink: I know you’re going to be having a couple of big announcements on robotics and what it can do. I mean, when I went to the factory, you showed me those robots. You talked about billions of robots, but how quickly can they be deployed in a manufacturing setting? How quickly can it be utilized and be functional and create that abundance that you talked about? Musk: Well, humanoid robotics will advance very quickly. I think we do have some of the Tesla Optimus robots doing simple tasks in the factory. Probably later this year, by the end of this year I think they’ll be doing more complex tasks. But still deployed in an industrial environment. And probably sometime next year, I’d say that by the end of next year I think we’d be selling humanoid robots to the public. That’s when we are confident that it’s very high reliability, very high safety, and the range of functionality is also very high. You can basically ask it to do anything you’d like. Fink: You’re already seeing that in Tesla cars, the software changes that you’re doing. And what is it, every quarter now a software change that upgrades the ability of the robot within the car? Musk: Yes, the Tesla full self-driving software, we update it sometimes once a week and recently some of the insurance companies have said that it is actually so safe, Tesla full-self driving is so safe that they’re offering customers half-price insurance if they use has the force of driving in the car. Fink: And that can be monitored by the insurance company? Is that part of the agreement? Musk: Yeah. But I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla’s rolled out a sort of robot taxi service in a few cities and will be very, very widespread by the end of this year within the US. And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe hopefully next month. Fink: Really, that quickly. Musk: And then. Maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully. Fink: I want to move to space, because historically, space is very capital-intensive. It’s historically been done by governments. Obviously, SpaceX changed the whole model. But we’ve seen it slow to scale, and now I’m starting to see it ramping up in what you’re doing and other things.

Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. Musk: Well, the key breakthrough, the major breakthrough that SpaceX is hoping to achieve this year is full reusability. So no one has ever achieved full reusability of a rocket, which is very important for the cost of access to space. We’ve achieved partial reusability with Falcon 9 by landing the booster stage. We’ve now landed the booster over 500 times. But we have to throw away the upper stage. The upper stage sort of burns up on reentry for Falcon 9. So, and the cost of that is equivalent to a small to medium sized jet. But with Starship, which is a giant rocket, it’s the largest flying machine ever made. Fink: That’s a rocket that you’re using for the idea of going to Mars, right? Musk: Yeah, Mars and the moon, as well as for high volume satellite stuff. So Starship, hopefully this year we should prove full reusability for Starship which will be a profound invention because the cost of access to space will drop by a factor of 100 when you achieve full reusability. It’s the same sort of economic difference that you would expect between, say, a reusable aircraft and a non-reusable aircraft. Like if you have to throw your aircraft away after every flight, that would be a very expensive flight. But if you only have to refuel, then it’s the cost of the fuel. And so that’s really the fundamental breakthrough that gets the cost-of-access to space. Below the cost of freight on aircraft. Under $100 a pound type of thing easily. So it makes putting large satellites into space very cheap. And then when you have solar in space, you get five times more effectiveness, maybe even more than that, than solar on the ground. Because it’s always sunny. You don’t have a day-night cycle or seasonality or weather. And you get about 30% more power in space because you don’t have atmospheric attenuation of the power. Any given solar panel will do five times more energy and space than on the ground. Fink: Is there any capacity in doing that and then taking that power and bringing it back to Earth? Is there a way of doing that or are you just taking that power and utilizing it for the needs, like building AI data centers in space? Musk: It’s a no-brainer for building AI, solar-powered AI data centers in space . . . It is also very cold in space, if you’re in the shadow. So you just have, you have solar panels facing the sun and then a radiator that’s pointed away from the sun. So it has no sun incidence and then it just cooling, it’s just a very efficient cooling system. Net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be space, and that will be true within two years, maybe three, three at the latest. Fink: So looking 10 or 20 years out, how would you describe success with AI or space technology, and where do you see it? Are you more certain what’s going to happen the next three years, or five or 10? Musk: I don’t know what’s going to happen in 10 years, but the rate at which AI is progressing, I think we’ve . . . We might have AI that is smarter than any human by the end of this year. And I would say no later than next year. And then probably by 2030 or 2031, call it five years from now, AI will be smarter than all of humanity collectively. Fink: Do you see yourself ever going to Mars in your lifetime? Musk: I’ve asked it a few times, like do I want to, you know, die on Mars? And I’m like, yes, but just not on impact. Fink: Elon, thank you. Any last words? Musk: Well, I think generally, I mean my last words would be, I would encourage everyone to be optimistic and excited about the future. Good. And generally, for quality of life, it is actually better to err on the side of being an optimist and wrong rather than a pessimist and right. Advertisement

Title: Friday, January 23. Russia’s War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine

ByKatya Soldak, Forbes Staff. Dispatches from Ukraine. Day 1,430 Zelenskyy Rebukes Europe At Davos January 23, the final day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, brought Ukraine neither breakthroughs nor fresh commitments from allies, only bold statements. The most important moment for Kyiv was a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Both leaders described the hour-long meeting as “constructive.” Afterwards, Trump emphasized that the war must stop; meanwhile, Zelenskyy, whose arrival in Davos remained in doubt until the last moment due to the acute energy crisis in Kyiv — caused by Russia’s bombing the energy and heating infructrtucture on the coldest week of the winter — used the meeting to underline Ukraine’s need for air-defense missiles to shield its battered energy system. The talks generated no agreements on postwar economic recovery or security arrangements that had been under discussion in recent weeks, as they were clouded by Trump’s aggressive rhetoric about Greenland. Meanwhile, media outlets had expected Ukraine and the U.S. to sign a plan worth possibly billions of dollars, but the agreement was put on hold. Zelenskyy later delivered a pointed speech in Davos, aimed at Europe. In blunt language, he warned that Europe’s internal divisions were a strategic weakness, accusing European allies of failing to “take the lead in defending freedom.” He called Europe a “fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers” that seemed “lost” as it tried to induce Trump to force Russia to end the war. “Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America’s focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost,” Zelenskyy said. After his speech, Zelenskyy presented estimates of Russian military losses. According to cited figures, Russian monthly casualties have doubled over the past year, to about 36,000. Zelenskyy attributed the increase in casualties to the effectiveness of Ukrainian drones, a priority of Ukraine's new defense minister, Mykhailo Fedorov. Russia’s cumulative losses, he claimed, now surpass 1.2 million personnel, roughly a fifth of which have occurred since last June. The Kremlin, however, effectively absorbs these losses through monthly conscription of 40,000-43,000 troops. Zelenskyy also announced a trilateral meeting involving Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia, the first such meeting in years, to be held in the United Arab Emirates on January 23. Meanwhile, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff has arrived in Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukraine In Davos The annual Ukrainian Breakfast in Davos, hosted by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, centered this year on Ukraine’s EU integration and reconstruction. The January 22 discussion brought together European leaders, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. A special guest at the Ukrainian Breakfast was Steve Witkoff, US Special Envoy to the Middle East, and the US negotiator on the Ukraine peace process. He shared updates on the progress in peace negotiations: “I think that we have made a lot of progress,” he said, “We spent the whole dinner last night talking about the upward trajectory for the Ukrainian economy and financial system... The President (Trump) talked about a tariff-free zone for Ukraine, that I think will be game-changing, and you’ll see the industry moving into that area,” he added that he’s headed to Moscow later that day to continue the negotiations with Putin and his government. A recurring theme was how to push Russia toward a peace settlement on terms acceptable to Kyiv. Finnish President Alexander Stubb said Europe and the U.S. might soon converge on a peace plan for Ukraine. In his opinion, however, it was questionable whether Moscow would accept such a plan, and the war would end only if accompanied by further military support for Ukraine. The debate over using frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine's postwar reconstruction, estimated to cost roughly $524 billion, exposed divisions among European countries. Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever, a skeptic of direct confiscation and fearful of legal action from the Kremlin, reiterated that any such disposition must comply with international law. Still, he acknowledged that Russian assets should play a role in rebuilding Ukraine once a peace settlement is reached. Regarding Ukraine’s European track, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Taras Kachka expressed the opinion that Kyiv would be fully integrated into the EU energy market by 2027, even without formal membership. EU Commissioner Marta Kos supported that assessment, noting that Ukraine has completed most of the reforms required for accession. Nonetheless, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said Ukraine’s path to the EU would take several years. Speakers also highlighted Ukraine’s role in defense innovation, particularly in drone warfare. Even with generous reconstruction funds, however, Ukraine’s success is not guaranteed. Referring to what he described as well-designed reforms, Larry Fink said that “Ukraine’s future will depend on whether it can establish strong governance … and integrate itself more deeply into the European and global capital markets.” A January 21 panel, “The Role of the United States in the World,” examined Europe’s security amid shifting U.S. priorities. Former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg shared optimism for future negotiations but warned against trading Ukrainian territory for a ceasefire. He argued time favors Ukraine if it can withstand winter, and that Europe, with U.S. support, could deter Moscow. Russian Attacks Russia launched a sweeping attack overnight on January 20. Although Ukraine's Air Force reported intercepting 27 missiles and 315 drones out of 342 projectiles, the mega-strike, which targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, left half of Kyiv without electricity amid bitter cold. Zelenskyy said the attack employed “updated tactics” and included missiles produced this year. The strikes came just days after Ukraine received a new batch of air-defense missiles, which, Zelenskyy said, limited the damage. In addition, Ukrainian officials reported at least 14 civilians killed and nearly 80 more wounded in Russian strikes in the previous three days in the Kherson, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Donetsk, and Dnipropetrovsk regions.

Title: Ethereum Emerges As Likely Candidate In BlackRock Tokenization Vision – Here’s Why

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Recent remarks from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink have pointed toward the need for a single, unified blockchain for tokenized markets, and have intensified the focus on platforms capable of handling institutional-scale liquidity, compliance, and settlement. With its long track record in smart contracts, extensive developer ecosystem, and growing role in regulated financial products, Ethereum is now emerging as the most likely candidate to serve as the settlement layer for tokenized capital markets. In an X post, the Ethereum Daily shared a video in which BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made it clear that tokenization is necessary. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, Fink said the financial system must move rapidly toward digitization, adding that a single, common blockchain could reduce corruption and improve transparency across the global markets. While Fink did not name a specific network, the most plausible candidate could be ETH, based on BlackRock’s own initiatives and public statements that emphasized the role of ETH in asset tokenization. The firm has consistently highlighted ETH as a core platform for its on-chain strategy. Meanwhile, BlackRock launched its BUIDL tokenized money market fund directly on ETH, a product that has already grown to over $2 billion in total value locked. “There’s no second best,” Ethereum Daily noted. In the staking space, Bitmine has turned Ethereum staking into a multi-billion-dollar business. An analyst known as Milk Road has revealed that the company now has 1.83 million ETH staked, worth roughly $6 million at current prices, and plans to scale that figure toward 4.2 million ETH over time. Over the past months, Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. (BMNR) has accounted for nearly 50% of all new ETH entering the staking queue. Staking at this scale is important because it removes ETH from the liquid supply and locks it into long-term infrastructure rather than keeping it for short-term trading. When one player is willing to commit billions of dollars worth of ETH to staking, it reflects confidence in ETH’s future economic prospects. A lower liquid supply, combined with sustained network demand, will create structural pressure over time. Analyst Milk Road has also highlighted that Ethereum is holding near a critical support zone around $3,000, hovering just above the lower boundary of its long-term rising structure, an area that has acted as a stress test for ETH throughout the cycle. Historically, when ETH drifts into this area, the market will need to decide whether the weakness is temporary or structural. The $2,750 level remains the key line because it has repeatedly stopped downside pressure after macro-driven or narrative-driven pullbacks, making it a reliable floor for the broader trend. As long as ETH holds above that level, the broader multi-year uptrend will remain intact. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets.

One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly.

Title: Wall Street braced for a private credit meltdown. The risk of one is rising

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/23/2026 10:38:52 AM PST by Presbyterian Reporter The sudden collapse last fall of a string of American companies backed by private credit has thrust a fast-growing and opaque corner of Wall Street lending into the spotlight. Private credit, also known as direct lending, is a catch-all term for lending done by nonbank institutions. The practice has been around for decades but surged in popularity after post-2008 financial crisis regulations discouraged banks from serving riskier borrowers. That growth — from $3.4 trillion in 2025 to an estimated $4.9 trillion by 2029 — and the September bankruptcies of auto-industry firms Tricolor and First Brands have emboldened some prominent Wall Street figures to raise alarms about the asset class. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned in October that problems in credit are rarely isolated: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Billionaire bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach a month later accused private lenders of making “garbage loans” and predicted that the next financial crisis will come from private credit. While fears about private credit have subsided in recent weeks in the absence of more high-profile bankruptcies or losses disclosed by banks, they haven’t lifted completely. Companies that are most linked to the asset class, such as Blue Owl Capital , as well as alternative asset giants Blackstone and KKR , still trade well below their recent highs. The rise of private credit Private credit is “lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it’s growing really fast, which doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an interview. Private credit’s boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient. Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC. But concerns about private credit — which tend to come from the sector’s competitors in public debt — are understandable given its attributes. After all, it’s the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. “The double-edged sword of private credit” is that the lenders have “really strong incentives to monitor for problems,” said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay. “But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,” she said. De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it’s difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said. “This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it’s not a public market,” she said. “We’re not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.” In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero. Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report. And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis. Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.

Most nonbank lenders are much more willing to engage in workouts with impaired borrowers and to take possession of and run a business or real estate if the borrower no longer can. Many are experts in the market and even have a “loan to own” strategy in making loans. That is much better than a bank which almost always takes possession of collateral and sells it quickly in a UCC sale, which tends to dampen prices and create a negative spiral in the market. Or they hold the impaired loan on their books for a long time, scared to take any action. 4 posted on 01/23/2026 10:43:38 AM PST by Opinionated Blowhard (When the people find that they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic.)

They also form syndicates to spread risks and impose covenants to protect their investments. Moreover, many smaller businesses do not qualify for bank loans and therefore rely on private credit not only for money but also often for advise and guidance on how to increase value in their companies, thereby lessening risk. Some private lenders will take equity positions or hold warrants that can also help to offset any decreases in NOI from a general lowering of interest rates.

The practice has been around for decades but surged in popularity after post-2008 financial crisis regulations discouraged banks from serving riskier borrowers. That growth — from $3.4 trillion in 2025 to an estimated $4.9 trillion by 2029 — and the September bankruptcies of auto-industry firms Tricolor and First Brands have emboldened some prominent Wall Street figures to raise alarms about the asset class. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned in October that problems in credit are rarely isolated: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Billionaire bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach a month later accused private lenders of making “garbage loans” and predicted that the next financial crisis will come from private credit. While fears about private credit have subsided in recent weeks in the absence of more high-profile bankruptcies or losses disclosed by banks, they haven’t lifted completely. Companies that are most linked to the asset class, such as Blue Owl Capital , as well as alternative asset giants Blackstone and KKR , still trade well below their recent highs. The rise of private credit Private credit is “lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it’s growing really fast, which doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an interview. Private credit’s boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient. Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC. But concerns about private credit — which tend to come from the sector’s competitors in public debt — are understandable given its attributes. After all, it’s the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. “The double-edged sword of private credit” is that the lenders have “really strong incentives to monitor for problems,” said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay. “But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,” she said. De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it’s difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said. “This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it’s not a public market,” she said. “We’re not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.” In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero. Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report. And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis. Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson While fears about private credit have subsided in recent weeks in the absence of more high-profile bankruptcies or losses disclosed by banks, they haven’t lifted completely. Companies that are most linked to the asset class, such as Blue Owl Capital , as well as alternative asset giants Blackstone and KKR , still trade well below their recent highs. The rise of private credit Private credit is “lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it’s growing really fast, which doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an interview. Private credit’s boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient. Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC. But concerns about private credit — which tend to come from the sector’s competitors in public debt — are understandable given its attributes. After all, it’s the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. “The double-edged sword of private credit” is that the lenders have “really strong incentives to monitor for problems,” said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay. “But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,” she said. De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it’s difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said. “This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it’s not a public market,” she said. “We’re not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.” In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero. Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report. And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis. Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.

De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it’s difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said. “This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it’s not a public market,” she said. “We’re not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.” In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero. Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report. And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis. Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.

After all, it’s the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. “The double-edged sword of private credit” is that the lenders have “really strong incentives to monitor for problems,” said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay. “But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,” she said. De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it’s difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said. “This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it’s not a public market,” she said. “We’re not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.” In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero. Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report. And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis. Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.

And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis.

Nonbank lending has its advantages for the economy. Most nonbank lenders are much more willing to engage in workouts with impaired borrowers and to take possession of and run a business or real estate if the borrower no longer can. Many are experts in the market and even have a “loan to own” strategy in making loans. That is much better than a bank which almost always takes possession of collateral and sells it quickly in a UCC sale, which tends to dampen prices and create a negative spiral in the market.

Title: The great power gap: Billionaires are 4,000 times more likely to hold office than you are, and Oxfam warns it’s ruining democracy
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/23/billionaires-4000-times-more-like-hold-office-than-you-threat-democracy-oxfam-report/
Time Published: 2026-01-23T18:07:57Z
Full Content:
There’s not just a K-shaped economy of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. This K shape of diverging paths extends to politics, a new report found, and experts warn it’s threatening democracy as a result. According to Oxfam International’s “Resisting the Rule of the Rich: Protecting Freedom from Billionaire Power” report this week, a billionaire boom has coincided with the rise of the richest exerting political influence, with billionaires 4,000 times more likely to hold office than less wealthy people globally. And if those billionaires aren’t running for office, they’re pouring money into campaigns. Per Oxfam, one in six dollars spent by all U.S. candidates, parties, and committees in the 2024 elections came from 100 billionaire families. The majority of Americans are already concerned the Trump administration will benefit the rich more than ordinary people. A CBS/YouGov poll conducted in December found 65% of respondents believed Trump’s policies favored the wealthy, while 12% believed they favored the middle class, and 1% said his policies favor the poor. According to Nabil Ahmed, Oxfam America’s senior director of economic justice, the rise of billionaires’ participation in politics not only empowers the ultrawealthy few to pursue their agendas; it disempowers everyday people from feeling like their votes or campaign contributions matter. “There is way too much power that is being held in the hands of way too few right now, and that undercuts people’s economic freedom, political freedom, and it also fundamentally undermines the value of one’s participation in the political system,” Ahmed told Fortune. “We actually do face a moment in which there is a fundamental choice between oligarchy and democracy.” The United States is experiencing this reckoning now, the Oxfam report suggested, as powerful figures mix money, business, and policy in service of their own interests. Watchdogs have criticized the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial for its significant overseas investments—as well as the launch of its own memecoin and mining operations—claiming they represent conflicts of interest. The president, with a $6.8 billion net worth, added $1.4 billion in digital assets to his family’s wealth in the first year of his second term, a Bloomberg analysis this week found. “The media’s continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public’s distrust in what they read,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fortune in a statement. “Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.” Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has explicitly proclaimed intentions to influence lawmakers to help Trump. Musk donated at least $132 million to the 2024 election bid of Trump and his GOP allies. He’s back at it for the 2026 midterm election and funneled $10 million this week to the campaign of Kentucky Republican Nate Morris, a pro-Trump candidate bidding to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell following his retirement, Axios reported. In addition to swaying elections, wealth may also be tipping the scales in court. A National Bureau of Economic Research working paper published this month and led by Columbia Business School economist Andrea Prat found pro-wealth policies and actions are correlated with judicial outcomes. In 1953, Democratic and Republican Supreme Court appointees had statistically indistinguishable rulings on matters regarding wealth, the study found. By 2022, Republican justices voted in favor of cases benefitting the wealthy 70% of the time compared to 35% of the time for Democratic justices. “There’s an American tradition and there’s an American tension” in reckoning with how the U.S. government and private sector have both enabled and prevented the growth of wealth and wealth disparities, Ahmed said. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink called out this tension earlier this week, saying in his opening remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that the AI boom resembled a period of concentrated wealth not seen since the Cold War’s end, which sparked a surge of globalization. Without intervention, Fink warned, global tech companies could recreate these dynamics, seeing their own wealth increase at the expense of white-collar workers and the professional class. “Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more wealth has been created than in any time prior in human history, but in advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain,” Fink said. “Early gains are flowing to the owners of models, owners of data and owners of infrastructure.” “The open question: What happens to everyone else if AI does to white-collar workers what globalization did to blue-collar workers?” he added. Oxfam has advocated for a slew of policy changes to curb the political power of the wealthy, including the regulation of lobbies and campaign financing, as well as imposing wealth taxes to reduce the political and economic powers of the superrich. These solutions are proving challenging to implement. California’s proposed wealth tax, which would impose a one-time 5% tax on all assets of state residents with a $1 billion or greater net worth, has drawn criticisms from even more politically progressive figures. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has opposed the potential ballot measure, saying it would cause billionaires with vital resources to leave the state, as illustrated by the exodus of Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Others have suggested that because many billionaires are actually cash poor, holding most of their wealth in illiquid assets, the ultrawealthy get away with paying few taxes even when they are implemented. Edward Gellis Fox and Zachary Liscow, law professors from the University of Michigan and Yale University, respectively, argued the solution to the “billionaire borrowing loophole” is to tax the proceeds of wealth so that borrowing funds is treated like income. “Our nation faces concerningly high wealth and income inequality, and strong revenue needs,” they wrote in a 2024 paper. “Closing the borrowing loophole on the super wealthy would combat both challenges and raise more than $100 billion in a highly progressive and reasonably efficient way.”

Title: Davos Elites No Longer Pretending Their Globalist Shindig Helps Anyone But Themselves

Globalist elites at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, appeared to change their tune from pretending to want to improve the world to simply benefiting themselves. World leaders, including President Donald Trump, gathered for the WEF on Wednesday, which claims that it is “committed to improving the state of the world.” However, The New York Times’ newsletter, “The World,” pointed out on Thursday that elites and CEOs are abandoning this approach to benefit themselves financially. “All the former buzzwords — social justice, sustainability — have gone.” (RELATED: Trump Yanks Canada Invite To Board Of Peace After Davos Clash) It appeared to many that Larry Fink of BlackRock, who is the co-chair of the WEF, was more interested in making this a business conference. “‘Committed to improving the state of the world’ has mostly disappeared from view,” the Times said. 🚨 GLOBALISM JUST DIED IN DAVOS Howard Lutnick just walked into the lion’s den — and told the World Economic Forum exactly what they didn’t want to hear. “Globalism has failed.” Not whispered.Not softened. Declared — on their own stage. He dismantled the entire WEF doctrine… pic.twitter.com/PUzOe0XK7e — Jim Ferguson (@JimFergusonUK) January 21, 2026 Fink was a strong advocate for green energy and has pushed for environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG). In 2023, he announced that he would ditch the term, “ESG,” because of its political connotations. The CEOs of Visa, JPMorgan Chase, Amazon, Cisco and other large companies were present for the gathering of world leaders, according to PBS News. The event was the first to be held without Klaus Schwab, the founder of the WEF. He resigned as chairman in April 2025 after The Wall Street Journal reported allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination against a pregnant employee, age-based firings and research manipulation. The WEF previously used buzzwords such as “social justice” and “sustainability,” though they backed away from using these terms at this year’s gathering. Several attendees attended lavish dinners and parties instead of conducting business or diplomacy meetings. Companies such as Palantir and Meta hosted invite-only dinners, receptions and cocktail hours and outspent traditional corporate participants. Borge Brende, the president and CEO of the WEF, said that the event is not “about responding to current events,” but rather creating “the right conditions that enable us to move forward.” Trump also told the business executives at the event that he has made them much richer, PBS News reported. “I don’t even ask anybody how you’re doing now,” Trump said. “It’s like everybody is making so much money.” All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Things are looking up for a small Italian eyewear company after French President Emmanuel Macron sported its shades at the World Economic Forum this week. Shares of iVision Tech (IVN), which has a market cap of around €20 million ($23.5 million), are up 65% this week, with much of that gain coming on Friday after photos of Macron began circulating showing him wearing the aviator-style sunglasses. Throughout the highly-publicized event in Davos, Switzerland this week, Macron wore a pair of glasses from Maison Henry Jullien, a French company owned by iVision Tech. The latter is based in Milan and listed on the Milan Stock Exchange. Macron has been wearing glasses since January 15 due to a broken blood vessel in his eye, which makes his eye appear red. The 48-year-old French leader said the optical problem is "totally benign." The glasses — Maison Henry Jullien's Pacific S 01 model — aren't cheap. The company's site lists them at €659 ($774). Still, interest in the glasses is soaring. The firm said it had to set up a temporary webpage for the Macron-preferred model due to heavy traffic.

"To ensure stable and secure access for everyone, we have enabled this official temporary page dedicated to purchasing the model." Speaking with Reuters, iVision Tech CEO Stefano Fulchir said Macron's high-profile appearance in the glasses "certainly created ‌a wow effect on the stock." Macron wore the glasses during a panel with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, in a solo speech, and around the Swiss town during the week. It's unclear what caused Macron's eye condition. In his more than hourlong speech in Davos, President Donald Trump himself wondered aloud about it. "I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses," Trump said. "What the hell happened?"

Title: 2026 layoffs news: Which companies are planning job cuts as Amazon is set to trim workforce? Check details

With just over 20 days into 2026, several companies are already planning job cuts. Major companies, including Amazon, aim to cut thousands of corporate jobs across various divisions, potentially marking its largest layoffs yet. Ericsson plans to eliminate 1,600 jobs in Sweden to stay competitive, while FedEx will cut 500 jobs in France but also create new positions. Citigroup and BlackRock have announced significant layoffs. Here's a list of companies planning layoffs recently — E-commerce giant Amazon is set to cut thousands of corporate jobs next week as part of its workforce reduction strategy, Reuters reported on 22 January, citing two people familiar with the matter. These layoffs, possibly the company's largest, are expected to affect white-collar roles across divisions such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), the People Experience and Technology unit (human resources), Prime Video, and retail. However, the report indicated that the plans might change. Telecom equipment manufacturer Ericsson, earlier this month, announced plans to cut up to 1,600 jobs in its home country of Sweden, a move aimed at maintaining the company's competitive position, the firm said in a press release. The company expects to continue laying off employees as part of its cost-cutting and restructuring efforts, CEO Borje Ekholm said on Friday. “You have seen that we have reduced the headcount, for example, by 5,000 over the past year, and we expect to continue reducing headcount going forward,” Reuters quoted Ekholm during a post-earnings call. On Friday, US parcel delivery company FedEx announced a strategic overhaul of its French domestic operations, including a plan to cut up to 500 jobs and invest about 78 million euros ($91.58 million). FedEx plans to streamline its internal structure by cutting its station count from 103 to 86. This move aims to simplify the distribution network and eliminate unnecessary infrastructure across the country. Although job cuts are part of the plan, the reorganisation is also expected to create over 770 new full-time and part-time roles. FedEx stated that employees affected by layoffs would be given priority consideration for these new positions. Banking giant Citigroup is expected to lay off approximately 1,000 employees this month as CEO Jane Fraser aims to reduce costs and boost returns. The current round of job cuts at Citigroup is part of the company's plan, which was announced two years ago, to eliminate 20,000 jobs by the end of 2026, according to a Bloomberg report citing people aware of the development. The Metropolitan Opera of New York announced a round of layoffs on Tuesday as it struggles financially, despite having implemented other significant cost-cutting measures over the past five years, according to a report by The New York Times. Met announced additional cost-cutting measures, including salary reductions for its highest-paid employees and delaying a new production scheduled for the upcoming season. According to the report, the opera house will reduce its administrative staff by 22, decreasing the total from 284 to approximately 262, which is about 10% of the division's workforce. BlackRock earlier this month said it will fire hundreds of employees across the company, Bloomberg reported. According to a report citing people familiar with the development, BlackRock will lay off about 1% of its workforce, or about 250 employees across divisions.

Title: Czech arms maker CSG soars on trading debut

Czechoslovak Group's shares rose as much as 32% in their Amsterdam debut, pushing its market capitalisation to more than €30 billion following a record fundraising for a defence company listing. CSG, seeking to tap into a surge in military spending, sold 30 million new shares and up to 122 million existing shares, including an over-allotment option, in an initial public offering priced at €25 each, raising up to €3.8 billion. Michael Strnad, the 33-year-old owner of the company, will net just under €3 billion in the deal, including the over-allotment, while the rest of the proceeds will go to the company, CSG said. The offering for up to 15.2% of the company gave CSG an initial market capitalisation of €25 billion. By 9.43 am on Friday, CSG's market value had risen to €31.6 billion with shares trading at €31.60, up 26.4%. They had climbed as high as €33.00 in early trading. Tapping into defence sector boom Investors are piling money into the sector and European governments pledge to ramp up defence spending following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. European defence stocks have touched record highs this year. Strnad told Reuters this month that one of the reasons for the listing was to use stock as potential acquisition currency. Recent acquisitions include its $2.2 billion purchase in 2024 of leading U.S. small ammunition maker Kinetic, owner of brands such as Remington. At current prices, CSG has a larger market capitalisation than Czech utility CEZ, the country's biggest listed company. CSG's key customers include Ukraine and it is one of the world's fastest‑growing defence companies, producing large- and small-calibre ammunition, heavy ground equipment and radar. Order books attracted swift demand If fully exercised, CSG's offering would be the largest Amsterdam listing since KKR Private Equity Investors raised $5 billion in 2006, according to Dealogic. Other large European defence groups, such as Franco-German tankmaker KNDS, are also set to list this year. Order books on the CSG offering were quickly covered on Tuesday, a bookrunner said. Funds managed by Artisan Partners, BlackRock and Al-Rayyan Holdings, a subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority, have committed to cornerstone the deal with 300 million euros each. Led by Strnad, whose father began trading old Soviet-era military equipment in the 1990s, CSG has built up its order pipeline and said in November that revenue would rise to 7.4–7.6 billion euros this year, from the more than 6.4 billion expected for 2025. It targets a dividend payout of 30%-40% of net profit, payable from 2027. Source: Reuters © RTÉ 2026. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Fear meets resignation in Davos as Trump dominates WEF agenda

Saturday, 24 Jan 2026 U.S. President Donald Trump walks during the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 22, 2026. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan ‌23 (Reuters) - As President Donald Trump and other top U.S. officials rolled through the icy streets of Davos this week, fear and in some cases loathing ‌were mixed with resignation over the administration's way of doing business. While many people at the event told Reuters they thought some of Trump's positions ‌on global issues, such as demands that Europe spend more on its own security, had merit, they were deeply offended by the way he and his team presented them. "It was kind of overwhelming. It was the full Trump show we got here," said Conradin Cramer, head of the cantonal government of the Swiss city of Basel following Trump's address on Wednesday to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. "He was very ‍outspoken against Europe, against European values, and that was frightening for me," Cramer told Reuters. Business leaders were ‍also nervous, with two U.S.-based bankers admitting at the start they ‌were worried about a full-blown trade war developing that would hit business sentiment. WEF'S MOST EVENTFUL MEETING? Several participants said that by some measures, this was one of the most ‍eventful ​meetings in five decades of the WEF, which had labelled this year's event "A Spirit of Dialogue". Trump struck a Greenland deal on the sidelines with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and oversaw the signing of his new Board of Peace,drawing several world leaders to Davos. The president and other U.S. officials also said they were close ⁠to a peace deal in Ukraine, which came into focus on Thursday when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy ‌travelled to Davos. President Vladimir Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev also held talks with U.S. officials on the sidelines, the first Russian official to come to Davos since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Several participants told Reuters ⁠that the annual meeting -- the ‍first since WEF founder Klaus Schwab's departure last year -- had been a win for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. A spokesperson said Schwab was not available for comment. Fink, who is also WEF co-chair, used his influence to attract big names including billionaire Elon Musk, who made his Davos debut as a last-minute addition to the agenda. Trump said Fink turned everything he touched to gold. Moderators in some sessions ‍appeared to avoid tough questions and the agenda largely skirted issues that the Trump administration has ‌opposed. The programme featured four sessions that referenced climate change, whereas in 2022 there were 16. Trump spoke for more than an hour, well over his allotted time on the agenda, and by the time he sat down for a moderated question-and-answer session a small but steady trickle of delegates were already leaving the room. TRUMP AGENDA LOOMS LARGE Several participants said that while Trump loomed large, business did get done at Davos, with executives meeting clients and customers and discussing issues ranging from geopolitics and trade to stablecoins and artificial intelligence. Francesco Ceccato, CEO of Barclays in Europe, said the meeting had a "mixture of geopolitics that can't be ignored". But there had also been "a lot of really interesting dialogue" around AI and related issues such as investment risk and energy needs, Ceccato told Reuters. The Trump agenda permeated many of the discussions. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick drew sharp reactions when he slammed ‌Europe at a Fink-hosted dinner, which European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde walked out of. The next night at a Bank of America soiree, Lutnick held court with CEO Brian Moynihan, said a source familiar with the event at 'Goals House', where British finance minister Rachel Reeves played chess and Marcus Mumford performed live, including an acoustic version of Bruce Springsteen's 'I'm on Fire'. As usual at the parties and meetings around ​Davos, attendees gossiped and traded rumours, although some triggered anxiety. Early on in the week, one circulated that mobile and internet networks would be shut down when Trump arrived in town. As it turned out, both phones and internet worked fine.

Title: Bitcoin regret is coming for anyone ignoring Coinbase CEO’s 5% rule as banks fight to cap gains

Advisors are building caps, rebalancing rules, and drawdown math while crypto execs sell regret avoidance as the new thesis. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told Bloomberg at Davos that investors who don't have at least 5% of their net worth in Bitcoin will “probably be pretty sad” by 2030. Recently, Morgan Stanley's wealth management division published portfolio guidelines capping crypto exposure at 4% maximum for even its most aggressive growth models. Both used “5%” as their anchor. Neither meant the same thing. The post-ETF era didn't just mainstream Bitcoin ownership, it turned position sizing into the new battleground. Financial advisors, wealth managers, and compliance officers now treat roughly 5% as a responsible ceiling for a volatile satellite holding. Meanwhile, crypto executives are trying to reframe that same number as a minimum effective dose. The collision isn't about whether to own Bitcoin. It's about whether 5% means “cap your risk” or “don't miss out.” Multiple mainstream wealth platforms converged on allocation bands clustered under 5% over the past year, driven not by ideology but by portfolio math. Fidelity Institutional's advisor-facing research suggests allocations of 2% to 5%, extending to 7.5% for younger investors under optimistic adoption scenarios. The framing centers on downside containment, as Bitcoin's structural volatility demands position sizing that won't blow up a portfolio during drawdowns. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management's October 2025 report gets more granular. It recommends maximum crypto allocations by model: 0% for conservation and income portfolios, 2% for balanced growth, 3% for market growth, and 4% for opportunistic growth. The rationale is explicit risk management, with roughly 55% annualized volatility and potential 70% maximum drawdowns at the 95th percentile. The firm emphasizes quarterly rebalancing to prevent positions from “swelling” silently as Bitcoin rallies, turning a controlled 3% sleeve into an accidental 8% overweight. Bank of America's chief investment officer said in December 2025 that a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets “could be appropriate” for investors comfortable with elevated volatility. A $4.6T wealth machine is turning “execution only” into real advice, and it starts with a tiny-sounding sleeve. BlackRock recommended up to 2% in late 2024, warning that above that threshold “Bitcoin's share of total portfolio risk becomes outsized,” a textbook risk-budget argument. The common thread: Bitcoin gets a seat at the table, but only as much as volatility math permits. The Bitwise and VettaFi 2026 Benchmark Survey, fielded from October through December 2025, shows how this plays out in practice. Among client portfolios with crypto exposure, 83% are allocated to less than 5%. The modal band sits at 2% to 4.99%, capturing 47% of advisors. The industry didn't coordinate on this range through central planning. It emerged from parallel risk calculations across wealth platforms, aimed at defending Bitcoin positions, to compliance committees and nervous clients after drawdowns. Armstrong's exact phrasing matters. He didn't say “5% of your portfolio.” He said, “5% of their net worth.” For many households, those denominators tell wildly different stories. The Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances documents that the balance sheet of families in the middle of the net worth distribution is “dominated by housing,” meaning net worth includes large illiquid buckets that never touch brokerage accounts. Consider illustrative math for a household with $2 million in net worth. If investable assets total $800,000, then 5% of net worth equals $100,000, which translates to 12.5% of the liquid portfolio. If investables are $500,000, then the same $100,000 is 20% of the portfolio. At $300,000 in investables, it's 33%. The “quiet implication” of framing Bitcoin as a net worth floor is that it can easily translate into double-digit liquid exposure, far beyond the caps wealth managers are building into their models. This isn't a technicality. It's the difference between “responsible satellite allocation” and “concentrated bet.” Advisors constrained by suitability reviews and model portfolio guardrails can't casually recommend liquid Bitcoin positions of 15% to 25%. However, that's precisely where “5% of net worth” lands for households whose wealth is tied up in real estate, retirement accounts with limited crypto access, or business equity. Advisors are funding crypto by cutting equities and cash, not “play money,” signaling a risk-managed allocation shift. The 5% debate didn't heat up randomly. It emerged because the market structure shifted and the industry moved from “should I?” to “how much?” Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in early 2024 opened access for registered investment advisors and clients who couldn't or wouldn't touch crypto through exchanges or custody solutions. Fidelity explicitly frames the 2024 products as unlocking advisor-client conversations that compliance risk previously shut down. Bank of America's move to have advisors switch from execution-only to recommendation status marks a regime change. Bitcoin went from “we'll let you buy it” to “here's how much we think makes sense.” Institutions build risk budgets, not narratives. Morgan Stanley's emphasis on volatility simulations, drawdown scenarios, and rebalancing schedules reflects career-risk management. The pain for a wealth advisor isn't being wrong about Bitcoin. It's being wrong loudly: allocating 10% to a client portfolio, watching it crash 60%, and trying to explain to compliance why the position exceeded model guidelines. Caps and rebalancing rules are defensive scaffolding that let advisors participate without getting blamed if things go sideways. Market-moving headlines and context delivered every morning in one tight read. Free. No spam. Unsubscribe any time. Meanwhile, executives are selling inevitability. Armstrong's Davos framing is a regret-minimization pitch, not a risk-budget pitch. The subtext: Bitcoin's upside is so asymmetric that the risk of owning too little outweighs the risk of owning too much. That gap widens when institutions finally open the pipes, because the narrative can claim, “The last excuse is gone.” If Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, and BlackRock all offer Bitcoin access, then “I couldn't access it” ceases to be a defense for zero exposure. Armstrong's $1 million by 2030 projection illustrates the math behind aggressive sizing. Bitcoin traded around $89,346.09 as of press time. Reaching $1 million by the end of 2030 implies roughly 63% compound annual growth from here, an 11.2x total return. High upside scenarios mathematically require accepting high variance, which is exactly why chief investment officers talk in caps and rebalancing rules. The gap between 2% ceilings and 5% net worth floors is a gap between institutions managing downside and individuals chasing upside. While gold flirts with $4,900, the BTC/Gold ratio has entered a "trapdoor" that historically precedes a monster mean reversion. As banks and platforms legitimize access through recommended ETF sleeves rather than execution-only workarounds, policy shifts from permissioning to prudence. Morgan Stanley's October report is essentially a blueprint for where “responsible Bitcoin” discourse is heading: volatility-adjusted position limits, model-portfolio integration with explicit caps, and mandatory rebalancing to prevent silent overconcentration. The firm treats crypto like any other high-vol satellite, such as emerging markets equities, commodities, and alternatives, where the default assumption is that unmanaged positions will drift into risk-budget violations. The industry is converging on a sub-5% portfolio norm at the exact moment executives are trying to raise the minimum to 5%. That tension defines the post-ETF era. Distribution is mainstreaming, so the argument moved from ownership to sizing. Advisors can finally add Bitcoin to client portfolios without triggering compliance red flags, but they're doing so with guardrails that crypto maximalists consider cowardly. The denominator problem makes the collision messier. When an executive says “5% of net worth” and an advisor hears “5% of portfolio,” they're describing positions that can differ by a factor of two or three for typical households. The advisor is thinking about risk contribution and drawdown scenarios. The executive is thinking upside capture and regret avoidance. Both are using the same number. Neither is wrong. But they're solving for completely different objectives. The outcome isn't that one side wins. It's that “5%” becomes a Rorschach test, a point of coordination that means whatever the speaker needs it to mean. As major funds dump holdings, a thin order book means every dollar of selling is now significantly more destructive. For wealth managers building model portfolios, it's a ceiling that keeps crypto exposure from dominating total risk. For crypto advocates pitching inevitability, it's a floor that separates the prepared from the regretful. The meme works because it's vague enough to let both sides claim victory while talking past each other.

Conservatism Stephanie Slade | 1.23.2026 10:35 AM On a Thursday night in December, I got a breathless call from a Heritage Foundation senior scholar. John Malcolm and Jessica Reinsch, the director and a deputy director of the think tank's Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, had just been summarily fired. A Heritage spokesman would later accuse Reinsch and Malcolm of conduct inconsistent with the organization's mission and standards and breach of fiduciary duty. Sources close to the situation say they were actually dismissed after their superiors learned they were about to take jobs elsewhere—and realized that they may not be the only ones. A few days later, the bulk of the think tank's economic and legal/constitutional studies teams decamped en masse for Advancing American Freedom (AAF), a nonprofit founded by former Vice President Mike Pence. More resignations would follow. But according to my source on that December night, Heritage President Kevin Roberts and his lieutenants had a message for those who stayed behind: "​​They've been going around the building telling everyone that our whole purpose now is to support and do everything Kevin Roberts wants." While the proximate cause of the ongoing staff exodus is a video Roberts recorded in October defending Tucker Carlson's decision to amplify the white-nationalist influencer Nick Fuentes, the turmoil at Heritage has been brewing for far longer. In fact, Reason has learned, Heritage leadership has been directing employees to read Roberts' 2024 book, which agitates for a "Second American Revolution," and to leave if they can't agree with the positions therein. Scores of board members, employees, and visiting fellows have opted to depart, variously citing antisemitism, misogyny, retaliation against employees who dare to speak up, and an institutional pivot away from free market principles. In conversations with more than a dozen current and former staffers, I repeatedly heard that Roberts' belief that he alone should get to determine all of the think tank's stances has provoked resentment among his own subject matter experts. "The issue is you have the president of an organization committing everybody in it to his position unilaterally," one senior staff member told me in November. "Because Heritage has a one-voice policy, when the president goes out and says Heritage Foundation has this position"—be it support for tariffs or support for Tucker Carlson—"he implicates everybody down the chain, and he makes everybody stand for that." * * * A Heritage statement responding to last month's mass flight to AAF begins with "Our mission is unchanged." Likewise, in a January 1 letter printed in The Wall Street Journal, Heritage Vice President Roger Severino insisted that the think tank has changed tactics but not principles. But multiple recently departed staff members confirm that they were told by superiors to look not to Heritage's official mission statement ("to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense") but to Roberts' book in order to understand the think tank's de facto new direction. The perception was that if they couldn't get behind the ideas in the book, Heritage was not the place for them. "Parts of the building were basically holding Bible studies with it," one former senior scholar quipped. There's nothing controversial about the head of a think tank enumerating his or her views, and indeed, it's a timeworn tradition on the American right for would-be thought leaders to publish books that attempt to define and defend conservatism. But the situation in Roberts' case is complicated by two factors: the aforementioned one-voice policy at Heritage and the contents of this particular book. Dawn's Early Light is a fairly explicit attempt to chart an alternative course for movement conservatism. "If you've read a lot of conservative books or think you have a good sense of the conservative movement," writes then–Sen. J.D. Vance (R–Ohio) in the foreword, "I suspect the pages that follow will be surprising—even jarring." Those pages are replete with scornful references to "wax-museum conservatives" who "don't know what time it is," by which Roberts clearly means the kind of staid Reaganite wonks who care more about hewing to conservative principle than owning the libs—the kind of people, in other words, who have historically populated the institution he leads. Fire and flames are a recurring motif in the book (the original subtitle of which was "Burning Down Washington To Save America" until the publisher apparently thought better of it). The first chapter features a long list of "decadent and rootless" American institutions that Roberts says need to be burned to the ground, including the FBI, The New York Times, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, BlackRock, the Loudoun County Public School System, and the Boy Scouts of America. "We're going to (metaphorically) burn down the LA district attorneys office," he says at one point. "We need to (metaphorically) burn down the selective educational institutions that have such a grip on the formation of our elites," he says at another. "​​If an American institution is incompatible with or contemptuous of public prayer," he says in a third place, Roberts "would be hard pressed to believe that it should not simply be burned down for the common good." This inflammatory (pun intended!) imagery is in keeping with Roberts' open embrace of populism and sympathy for the highly aggrieved "New Right." It's also an awkward fit for a conservative movement that has long counseled respect for inherited institutions and expounded the Chestertonian notion that civilizations are hard to build and easy to destroy. But this book was written to be a postliberal broadside in the culture war. It is polemic, not scholarship. * * * To be clear, not everything in Dawn's Early Light is a departure from the past. There's plenty of standard-fare conservatism (China hawkery, support for secure borders and making English the national language). From a civil libertarian perspective, Roberts' antipathy toward the federal bureaucracy and especially the surveillance state is even rather salutary. But there are also a number of record-scratch moments, particularly when it comes to his discussion of economics. In theory, free enterprise and limited government are core Heritage principles, and the think tank was historically a staunch defender of free trade. Roberts' book, on the other hand, comes out swinging against globalization, in which "US firms sought to make profits all over the world by expanding into new markets, sending factories overseas, running money through international tax havens, developing global supply chains, and employing other new strategies," and calls for using "the immense powers of our federal and state governments" for protectionist ends. It also asserts more than once that President Donald Trump "won" the trade war during his first term. Roberts is equally hostile to the modern financialized "sham economy," which he says is guilty of "funneling money to the parasitical enemies of the American way of life." In his view, the goal of the conservative movement should be to return to an economic system that would allow more men to support families on a single income, and he hopes to "restore the proper use of the government" to bring about his favored outcomes. He's comfortable with trade barriers, industrial policy, and the aggressive use of antitrust regulations "to rein in globalist corporatism," he writes. "Especially when it comes to Big Tech and big banks, we need to consider the nuclear option." The book acknowledges that all of this would require "short-tem sacrifices, including higher prices for some consumer goods," but insists the pain will be worth it. To reiterate, these positions are more closely aligned with the New Right than with old-school American conservatism. And that's not only the case with respect to economics. Roberts' foreign policy views are also seen by many former staffers as antithetical to the long-standing posture of the think tank he heads. This is not the first time Roberts has seemed to commit his institution wholesale to a set of ideas that are more at odds than not with the traditional American right. In 2022, he gave a speech at the National Conservatism Conference in Miami in which he startled observers by declaring that he was there "not to invite national conservatives to join our conservative movement but to acknowledge the plain truth that Heritage is already part of yours." Dismayed by the natcons' will-to-power political approach, a person of my acquaintance (who had been hired by Roberts) left a job at Heritage shortly after that speech. Many have followed in the years since, often for similar reasons. * * * All of this would arguably matter less if not for the think tank's practice of barring employees from publicly dissenting from the Heritage party line. "Speaking with one voice is a distinguishing piece of The Heritage Foundation's strategic advantage," its website proclaims. "While other organizations may have experts advocating contradictory points of view, Heritage employees are always rowing in the same direction." The so-called one-voice policy, which dates back to Heritage co-founder Ed Feulner's time at the helm, "has always—for 49 years—been difficult to implement," Roberts told The Dispatch in 2022. "The difficulty is making sure that there is a conversation internally that gets us to a good spot." Over and over again in my conversations with current and former staffers, I heard that intellectual collaboration under Roberts' predecessors has been supplanted by decrees handed down, literally, from the president's office on the eighth floor. "When Ed Feulner was there, we debated these things, and that's how we came to a one-voice policy," a senior policy staffer (who has since resigned) told me in November. "Under Kevin Roberts, it's just whatever Kevin Roberts and his minions decide, without any consultation from the scholars." "Kevin Roberts, in my opinion, has subverted the one-voice policy," another scholar who left last year told me in December. Ideally, "the one-voice policy at Heritage is that everybody gets together, all the substantive experts on an issue, and they hash it out. They come up with their own internal view, and then people agree that they won't, using a Heritage byline, go out and disagree with that position. What Kevin did differently was, basically, that he constrained the Heritage position to not be contrary to what the Trump administration wanted to hear." Lending a certain plausibility to this claim is that Roberts himself announced in a 2024 interview with The New York Times that he sees "institutionalizing Trumpism" as the think tank's role. (A Heritage spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) "I can directly testify to being told that Dr. Roberts has special knowledge that no one else has," which should influence policy conclusions, a former research staffer told me in December. "That's cult-of-personality stuff. That's not what a think tank's supposed to be….There were instances where it was communicated to us in no uncertain terms, either fall in line or here's what happens to people that don't: They end up gone." Faced with such an ultimatum, more and more Heritage staffers have chosen to go elsewhere. The wax-museum conservatives are calling Kevin Roberts' bluff. Start your day with Reason.

Title: Fear meets resignation in Davos as Trump dominates WEF agenda

By Paritosh Bansal, Dave Graham and Dmitry Zhdannikov DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - As President Donald Trump and other top U.S. officials rolled through the icy streets of Davos this week, fear and in some cases loathing were mixed with resignation over the administration’s way of doing business. While many people at the event told Reuters they thought some of Trump’s positions on global issues, such as demands that Europe spend more on its own security, had merit, they were deeply offended by the way he and his team presented them. “It was kind of overwhelming. It was the full Trump show we got here,” said Conradin Cramer, head of the cantonal government of the Swiss city of Basel following Trump’s address on Wednesday to the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. “He was very outspoken against Europe, against European values, and that was frightening for me,” Cramer told Reuters. Business leaders were also nervous, with two U.S.-based bankers admitting at the start they were worried about a full-blown trade war developing that would hit business sentiment. WEF’S MOST EVENTFUL MEETING? Several participants said that by some measures, this was one of the most eventful meetings in five decades of the WEF, which had labelled this year’s event “A Spirit of Dialogue”. Trump struck a Greenland deal on the sidelines with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and oversaw the signing of his new Board of Peace, drawing several world leaders to Davos. The president and other U.S. officials also said they were close to a peace deal in Ukraine, which came into focus on Thursday when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy travelled to Davos. President Vladimir Putin’s envoy Kirill Dmitriev also held talks with U.S. officials on the sidelines, the first Russian official to come to Davos since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Several participants told Reuters that the annual meeting — the first since WEF founder Klaus Schwab’s departure last year — had been a win for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. A spokesperson said Schwab was not available for comment. Fink, who is also WEF co-chair, used his influence to attract big names including billionaire Elon Musk, who made his Davos debut as a last-minute addition to the agenda. Trump said Fink turned everything he touched to gold. Moderators in some sessions appeared to avoid tough questions and the agenda largely skirted issues that the Trump administration has opposed. The programme featured four sessions that referenced climate change, whereas in 2022 there were 16. Trump spoke for more than an hour, well over his allotted time on the agenda, and by the time he sat down for a moderated question-and-answer session a small but steady trickle of delegates were already leaving the room. TRUMP AGENDA LOOMS LARGE Several participants said that while Trump loomed large, business did get done at Davos, with executives meeting clients and customers and discussing issues ranging from geopolitics and trade to stablecoins and artificial intelligence. Francesco Ceccato, CEO of Barclays in Europe, said the meeting had a “mixture of geopolitics that can’t be ignored”. But there had also been “a lot of really interesting dialogue” around AI and related issues such as investment risk and energy needs, Ceccato told Reuters. The Trump agenda permeated many of the discussions. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick drew sharp reactions when he slammed Europe at a Fink-hosted dinner, which European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde walked out of. The next night at a Bank of America soiree, Lutnick held court with CEO Brian Moynihan, said a source familiar with the event at ‘Goals House’, where British finance minister Rachel Reeves played chess and Marcus Mumford performed live, including an acoustic version of Bruce Springsteen’s ‘I’m on Fire’. As usual at the parties and meetings around Davos, attendees gossiped and traded rumours, although some triggered anxiety. Early on in the week, one circulated that mobile and internet networks would be shut down when Trump arrived in town. As it turned out, both phones and internet worked fine. (Reporting by Paritosh Bansal, Dave Graham, Samia Nakhoul, Dmitry Zhdannikov, Oliver Hirt, Arianne Luthi, Vitalii Yalahuzian, Divya Chowdhury, Mark John and John Revill; Editing by Alexander Smith) Di Paritosh Bansal, Dave Graham e Dmitry Zhdannikov DAVOS, Svizzera, 23 gennaio (Reuters) - Mentre il presidente Donald Trump e altri alti funzionari statunitensi percorrevano le strade ghiacciate di Davos questa settimana, la paura e in alcuni casi il disgusto si mescolavano alla rassegnazione per il modo di fare affari dell’amministrazione. Mentre molte persone presenti all’evento hanno detto a Reuters di ritenere che alcune delle posizioni di Trump su questioni globali, come la richiesta che l’Europa spenda di più per la propria sicurezza, abbiano un merito, sono rimaste profondamente offese dal modo in cui lui e il suo team le hanno presentate. “È stato un po’ travolgente. È stato un vero e proprio show di Trump”, ha detto Conradin Cramer, capo del governo cantonale della città svizzera di Basilea, dopo il discorso di Trump di mercoledì all’incontro annuale del World Economic Forum. “È stato molto esplicito contro l’Europa, contro i valori europei, e questo mi ha spaventato”, ha detto Cramer alla Reuters. Anche i leader del mondo degli affari erano nervosi, con due banchieri statunitensi che hanno ammesso all’inizio dell’incontro che Trump e il suo team hanno presentato.Due banchieri statunitensi hanno ammesso all’inizio di essere preoccupati per lo sviluppo di una vera e propria guerra commerciale che avrebbe colpito il sentiment delle imprese. L’INCONTRO PIÙ EVENTUALE DELWEF? Diversi partecipanti hanno detto che, secondo alcune misure, questo è stato uno degli incontri più movimentati in cinque decenni di WEF, che ha etichettato l’evento di quest’anno “Uno spirito di dialogo”. Trump ha stretto un accordo sulla Groenlandia a margine con il Segretario Generale della NATO Mark Rutte e ha presieduto alla firma del suo nuovo Consiglio di Pace, attirando a Davos diversi leader mondiali. Il presidente e altri funzionari statunitensi hanno anche detto di essere vicini a un accordo con il governo degli Stati Uniti. Il presidente e altri funzionari statunitensi hanno inoltre dichiarato di essere vicini a un accordo di pace in Ucraina, che è stato messo a fuoco giovedì quando il presidente Volodymyr Zelenskiy si è recato a Davos. Anche l’inviato del presidente Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev, ha avuto colloqui con funzionari statunitensi a margine, primo funzionario russo a venire a Davos da quando la Russia ha invaso l’Ucraina nel 2022. Diversi partecipanti hanno detto a Reuters che l’incontro annuale - il primo dopo la partenza del fondatore del WEF Klaus Schwab lo scorso anno - è stato una vittoria per il CEO di BlackRock Larry Fink. Un portavoce ha detto che Schwab non era disponibile per un commento. Fink, che è anche co-presidente del WEF, ha usato la sua influenza per attirare grandi nomi, tra cui il miliardario Elon Musk, che ha fatto il suo debutto a Davos come aggiunta dell’ultimo minuto all’ordine del giorno. Trump ha detto che Fink ha trasformato in oro tutto ciò che ha toccato. I moderatori in alcune sessioni sono sembrati evitare le domande difficili e l’ordine del giorno ha costeggiato in gran parte le questioni che l’amministrazione Trump ha contrastato. Il programma prevedeva quattro sessioni che facevano riferimento al cambiamento climatico, mentre nel 2022 erano 16. Trump ha parlato per più di un’ora, ben oltre il tempo assegnatogli dall’agenda, e quando si è seduto per una sessione moderata di domande e risposte un piccolo ma costante flusso di delegati stava già lasciando la sala. L’AGENDA DI TRUMP SI ALLARGA Diversi partecipanti hanno detto che, nonostante Trump incombesse, a Davos gli affari si sono svolti, con i dirigenti che hanno incontrato clienti e committenti e discusso di questioni che vanno dalla geopolitica e dal commercio alle monete stabili e all’intelligenza artificiale. Francesco Ceccato, CEO di Barclays in Europa, ha detto che l’incontro ha avuto un “mix di geopolitica che non può essere ignorato”. Ma c’è stato anche “un sacco di dialogo davvero interessante” intorno all’IA e a questioni correlate come il rischio di investimento e il fabbisogno energetico, ha detto Ceccato a Reuters. L’agenda di Trump ha permeato molte delle discussioni. Il Segretario al Commercio degli Stati Uniti Howard Lutnick ha suscitato aspre reazioni quando ha attaccato l’Europa durante una cena organizzata da Fink, dalla quale la Presidente della Banca Centrale Europea Christine Lagarde è uscita. La sera successiva, a una cena della Bank of America, Lutnick si è intrattenuto con l’amministratore delegato Brian Moynihan, ha dichiarato una fonte che ha familiarità con l’evento alla “Goals House”, dove il ministro delle Finanze britannico Rachel Reeves ha giocato a scacchi e Marcus Mumford si è esibito dal vivo, con una versione acustica di “I’m on Fire” di Bruce Springsteen. Come di consueto alle feste e agli incontri intorno a Davos, i partecipanti hanno spettegolato e scambiato voci, anche se alcune hanno scatenato l’ansia. All’inizio della settimana è circolata una voce secondo cui le reti di telefonia mobile e internet sarebbero state interrotte all’arrivo di Trump in città. Come poi si è scoperto, sia i telefoni che internet hanno funzionato bene.

Title: Intel stock crashes hard today: why did Intel stock plunge 16% after Q4 2025 earnings despite beating estimates – has INTC collapsed before a potential comeback?

Intel stock ($INTC) suffered a massive 16.20% crash today. The decline wiped out over $30 billion in market value. This happened despite Intel beating Q4 2025 estimates with $13.7 billion in revenue. The company also posted a surprise non-GAAP EPS of $0.15. The real damage came from a weak Q1 2026 outlook. Intel expects revenue between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion. This midpoint is far below the $12.5 billion analysts wanted. Investors were also spooked by a projected breakeven profit for the next quarter.

Title: Ukraine needs energy ceasefire as catastrophe looming, top power executive says

Friday, 23 Jan 2026 FILE PHOTO: Water vapour rises from residential buildings' autonomous heating systems during a power blackout and freezing temperatures, after critical civil infrastructure was hit by recent Russian missile and drone attacks, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine January 19, 2026. REUTERS/Vladyslav Sodel/File Photo DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Ukraine is ‌nearing a "humanitarian catastrophe" after months of Russian airstrikes on energy systems and any future ‌peace deal must include a halt to attacks on energy infrastructure, the head of ‌Ukraine’s largest private power producer said. Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, said Russia - which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago - had been waging an "energy terror" campaign since October 2025, hitting power stations and overwhelming air‑defence systems. The capital ‍Kyiv and surrounding regions are among the most affected, authorities ‍say, and Kyiv's mayor urged residents to ‌leave temporarily if they have somewhere else to go. "We need an energy ceasefire. A ceasefire on ‍the ​energy assets,” Timchenko said. “How can you talk about peace and (keep) attacking people, and knowing that people are freezing? How can these things go in parallel?” Ukraine has endured two weeks of ⁠temperatures between minus 15 and minus 20 degrees Celsius, he ‌said, with Russia striking gas transportation, storage and production facilities. Russia says it is targeting military and energy infrastructure used ⁠in the interests of ‍Ukraine's armed forces. "We are close to a humanitarian catastrophe," Timchenko said. "People get power for 3-4 hours, then a 10- to 15-hour break. We have apartment blocks without heat for weeks already." He said Ukraine was holding on ‍thanks to gas imports, including from the United States, ‌as attacks had forced gas, coal and hydropower plants to run below capacity. DTEK has lost 60–70% of its generating capacity and suffered damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he said. Timchenko said rebuilding the energy sector would cost $65–70 billion, citing World Bank estimates, and in many cases would require entirely new assets. "We are talking rather about building a new energy system in Ukraine rather than just reconstruction," he said. U.S. asset manager BlackRock has emerged in recent days as the main force behind a U.S.-Ukrainian ‌plan to help design a reconstruction plan for the country. Ukraine must accelerate construction of decentralised generation, said Timchenko, including new solar projects, green parks and storage. Decentralisation means the assets will be more difficult to hit by drones and ​missiles, he said. "We cannot count on a peace deal being signed. We need to start preparing today," he said, adding that Ukraine must stock critical equipment and strengthen air defences.
