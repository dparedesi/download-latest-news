Share this article After catching heat earlier this year for bull-posting Ethereum ahead of a sharp decline, Eric Trump finally enjoys a turnaround as the coin bounces back nearly 35% from his promo high. Ethereum’s green candles prompted the US president’s son to celebrate. On Monday, Eric posted the iconic “Mic Drop” minion GIF from Despicable Me as he reshared his February post declaring, “It’s a great time to add $ETH.” https://t.co/MaEelzwY2m pic.twitter.com/YJUZ77qFKm — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) July 22, 2025 “Embrace volatility. If you were smart, you would have also bought the dips (as I said to do),” he replied to an X user. The second-largest crypto asset by market value was trading at around $2,800 at the time of Eric’s February call. It later fell to $1,470 in April, its lowest level since November 2023. However, the asset has since rebounded sharply and is now trading above $3,700, up more than 155% from its April low, CoinGecko data shows. Growing institutional demand and corporate accumulation are key drivers behind Ethereum’s recent rally. Moreover, hopes that the SEC will approve staking features for spot Ethereum ETFs, including a proposal from BlackRock, are helping fuel the momentum. Eric also dropped a “revenge” comment on an April post by market analyst Ted Pillows, who had noted that ETH was down 40% since Eric’s tweet.

Title: China’s Cosco Eyes Veto Rights in Deal for Li Ka-shing’s Ports

China’s biggest shipping company is set to join the global consortium that’s acquiring Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s overseas ports, and is requesting a powerful role in the group in order to secure Beijing’s blessing for the controversial deal, people familiar with the matter said. State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. is asking to have veto rights or equivalent powers in the entity taking over the 43 ports, including two strategically important ones along the Panama Canal, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private matters. Cosco has argued such rights are necessary to block any decisions that are potentially harmful to China’s interests, the people added. Li’s CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. and the original buyer group, which includes BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd., have agreed that Cosco should have full informational access to the operation, the people said. But talks are still ongoing as to the powers that Cosco will have in the consortium and no final decisions have been made, they said. Read: Chinese Firms in Talks to Join Group for Li Ka-Shing’s Ports A 145-day period for exclusive talks between CK Hutchison and the consortium is likely to lapse on July 27, and details of Cosco’s role in the consortium could be settled by the end of September, some of them said. Cosco didn’t respond to calls and a faxed request for comments. CK Hutchison and the Aponte family’s MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co., which controls Terminal Investment, didn’t respond to separate requests for comment. BlackRock declined to comment. Cosco’s demands mark the latest twist for a deal that’s become a proxy for US-China rivalry, after President Donald Trump painted the transaction as the return of Panama Canal to US influence. Chinese regulators have, for their part, vowed to investigate the transaction, and Li and his family have come under intense scrutiny and criticism. The Hong Kong tycoon’s younger son Richard Li’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The original structure of the buyer consortium was designed to give the Aponte family-controlled Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to the BlackRock unit.

ToolGuyd Tool Reviews, New Tool Previews, Best Tool Guides, Tool Deals, and More! Jul 21, 2025 Stuart 89 Comments A frequently repeated mistruth has popped up in the comments section and numerous conversations over the years, and it’s time to once again debunk it. No, Milwaukee Tool is NOT “owned by China.” Here are examples of the misinformation I’ve seen in the comments section here, with similar arguments made in conversations: Advertisement Milwaukee is still owned by the Chinese And does made in the US actually matter if it’s a Chinese company Let’s start at the top. Milwaukee Tool’s parent company is Techtronic Industries, commonly known as TTI. TTI is a publicly-traded company that is listed in the Hong Kong stock exchange. TTI purchased Milwaukee Tool in 2005. Who owns TTI? Well, it’s definitely not China. With TTI being publicly traded, you can look up lists of the major shareholders, which according to various sources include its founders and USA-based institutional investors such as JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Vanguard. Advertisement YOU can purchase a share of the company. TTI is a publicly-traded company that is based in Hong Kong, and Milwaukee Tool is an independent subsidiary that is based in the United States. I often encounter “yes, but” arguments where red herrings and other fallacies muddy the discussion. I have also had many conversations about this topic over the years where the result is “oh, I didn’t know that!” From everything I’ve seen, Milwaukee Tool operates as if it were an independent American company, and one that is committed to American job creation and USA manufacturing expansion. Let’s dig into that a little, as most people don’t know much about that side of the company. Milwaukee Tool is headquartered in the USA. I’ve been to their offices, R&D facilities, test labs, as well as several of their USA manufacturing centers, and it has been evident that the company is steadily growing. I’ve seen their battery cell test lab, their hand tool quality assurance lab, rooms where they test in-progress designs, the machine shop where they can build rapid prototypes, their power tool accessories test and development center, and more. Also see: Milwaukee Tool Rapid Prototyping Shops – Where the Magic Happens. Benjamen visited one of Milwaukee’s power tool accessories factories a while back: Milwaukee USA Factory Tour: How a Typical Sawzall Blade is Made. He also saw how their hole saws are made: How Milwaukee Hole Saws are Made. And their carbide-tooth blades: How it’s Made (in the USA): Milwaukee Carbide-Toothed Sawzall AX Blade. I visited the revamped Empire Level factory, and Milwaukee’s new USA hand tool factory when it first launched. All of these locations are in the USA. In 2017, Steven Richman, then President of Milwaukee Tool, pledged the creation of more USA jobs and expanded USA manufacturing. He made good on that promise. Last year, Steven Richman became CEO of TTI. In 2020, Milwaukee announced USA-made hand tools. They opened the new hand tools factory in 2023, where the tools are made using USA-sourced materials. Late last year Milwaukee announced additional USA expansion: Milwaukee Tool Opens New USA Factory in Mississippi. On top of the newer electrical screwdrivers, pliers, and cutters, Milwaukee also produces select power tools in the USA, Sawzall reciprocating saw blades, hole saws, hard hats, select hammers (via Stiletto), select squares and layout tools (via their own brand and Empire), and additional power tool accessories. In October, Milwaukee said that their USA workforce has grown to over 10,000, and that they invested $675 million in USA expansion projects. They invested more than $250 million over the past few years in Mississippi. I asked Milwaukee Tool for some recent numbers, and they provided the following: They now have 18 facilities in the USA, mainly research, development, and manufacturing, and have invested $1.8 Billion in USA expansion efforts in the last decade. They estimate that their investment has led to over $11 Billion in economic impact in the last decade. Milwaukee says they invest over $10 Million annually towards driving growth in skilled trades, and have committed to invest another $200 Million by 2030. In the past 5 years, Milwaukee expanded its USA footprint by 5.4 million square feet and added 4,000 American jobs. How many construction jobs do they support with their regular expansion projects? Look at their job board. Milwaukee currently has openings at 15 locations, including positions in manufacturing, engineering, and operations. Here are some of their recent full time postings: Few people think about what Milwaukee Tool actually does here, and it’s actually a lot. A lot of people get confused about all the nuances, and it’s easy to see why – things get messy with global corporations, whether publicly or privately owned. Last year a Canadian company bought USA drill bit brands from a Chinese company. Those are American brands that were owned by a company based in China and now a company based in Canada. KKR, a USA-based private investment firm, owns Metabo (headquartered in German) and Metabo HPT (formerly Hitachi). Would anyone argue that either are American companies? Festool’s parent company is based in Germany and owns SawStop, which is based in the USA. So what does that mean about SawStop? A UK-based private equity firm now owns Malco Tools, which is based in the USA. Milwaukee Tool’s parent company is publicly traded, with major shareholders including US investment firms, and the company itself is based in the USA. Is it relevant where its global parent company has its head offices? If TTI moved their headquarters to a different country, would that change Milwaukee Tool’s operations in any meaningful way? From everything I’ve seen and understand, the answer is no. TTI is a publicly-traded company that is based in Hong Kong, and Milwaukee Tool is an independent subsidiary that is based in the United States. That’s as simple as things can be described without losing accuracy. Jane loves knitting. John loves Jane. Therefore, does John love knitting? No. If you were born and raised in California and then adopted by parents who live in Texas, but you still live in California, are you a Californian, or a Texan? Some have tried to argue that since Hong Kong is part of China, TTI is technically based in China, and thus Milwaukee as part of TTI is a Chinese company. This is a logical fallacy that results in false conclusions. Milwaukee is an American tool brand that seems more committed to job creation and USA production expansion than other tool brands. This is something we can argue about. TTI is a publicly-traded company that is based in Hong Kong, and Milwaukee Tool is an independent subsidiary that is based in the United States. These are facts. Sections: Editorial More from: Milwaukee Hon Cho 1 day ago Gotta ask, does ToolGuyd have a financial relationship with Milwaukee or TTI? I believe I recall you mentioning some sort of support from DeWalt (a SBD brand, not TTI) in the past. I assume that if you have a financial relationship with TTI or Milwaukee you would disclose it. There are an awful lot of political elements to the discussion of American vs foreign control and ownership of businesses. The current political environment is beyond the scope of your discussion of TTI / Milwaukee, but it looms large in the general discussion of what is an American business. Stuart 1 day ago Milwaukee is an advertiser (set-and-forget banner spot, NOT content sponsor), but not TTI (Ryobi, Ridgid at HD, Hart). SBD has been a repeat sponsor. You’ll see disclosures for content sponsorship and “advertisement” labels adjacent to most direct-buy ads. I’ve been pushing back on these sensationalist mistruths for a while. For example: https://toolguyd.com/dewalt-flexvolt-plus-new-20v-max-tools/#comment-802998 Somebody at Milwaukee’s headquarters, in China IT’S IN WISCONSIN. I’ve been there and seen with my own eyes that it’s not just a suite in a business center. https://toolguyd.com/milwaukee-cordless-power-tool-battery-tech-2022/#comment-1434010 Here are some earlier ones: 2012: https://toolguyd.com/milwaukee-new-product-media-event-2012-recap/#comments 2016: https://toolguyd.com/milwaukee-questions-2016/#comment-776525 Bring their headquarters back from China. Some of these are from the same person, even after they were corrected multiple times. I noticed that you said Dewalt was owned by a different company. At one point I felt it necessary to clear that up in a post as well. https://toolguyd.com/dewalt-milwaukee-tool-not-the-same-company/ And about HF and Snap-on not being the same company: https://toolguyd.com/does-harbor-freight-own-snap-on-tools/ I was on the phone with an industry friend recently, and after a new Milwaukee tool came up they said something like “you know, they’re owned by China.” I told them that TTI is publicly traded on the HK stock exchange and they fact-checked it in real time. This has become an incessant myth. skfarmer 1 day ago 2 companies i refuse to buy from. milwaukee and tekton.. i just don’t like em. i take abuse for it but i just don’t like how they operate. i don’t hassle people who like em and and i expect the same. Josh 1 day ago I dont think I own any tekton I know I’ve bought some in the past for new techs as part of their signing bonus though. Seemed ok, what’s your issue with them? I feel the same about Milwaukee, being in the auto tech world I was an early adopter but I’ve had a lot of quality issues with the m18 line. I still have my m12 light, 3/8 impact, impact driver and caulk gun that are all about 12 or more years old but those were my last purchases and I have all my M18 stuff away. Mike 11 hours ago “i just don’t like how they operate” They don’t have a reason other than “vibes”. StopMike 9 hours ago Do they need one other than “vibes”? You have detailed explanations for everything you don’t like? Nope, I can tell by your response . Not to mention they literally explained themselves just like you quoted. skfarmer 9 hours ago i am a farmer and have worked in various trades. hvac install and repair, home appliance repair and delivery, grain elevator repair and maintenance, as well as being certified in heavy extrication with my local fire dept. as well as any and all things being a farmer and homeowner can entail. i do not like milwaukee power tools and their ergonomics. i also don’t care for most of their hand tool designs such as socket shape and handle shape. to me, tekton is nothing more than warmed over michigan industrial tools. i want nothing to do with them. as far as their us mfg. let me know when stuart or anyone else has seen their mfg facilities. someone makes it but it sure as hell isn’t tekton. if you want the pliers,, punches, chisels and pry bars, go to wilde and skip the middle man. at least milwaukee is actually proud of their us made stuff, where it is made and who makes it. i will give them that. does that explain the vibes i have mike? they are good enough reasons for me to spend my money elsewhere and not follow the herd. i truly do not like how either company operate and the tools they offer. i think you poking at me for having an opinion you may or may not agree with shows little or no class. Josh 7 hours ago Thank you for taking the time to respond. All good enough reasons for me I was just curious. Agreed on the Milwaukee ergonomics, I get hot spots Olin the webbing of my thumb/finger running a Milwaukee all day. No such issue with my Festool or even Bosch drivers. Big complaint about Busch impacts though is 2 handed bit insertion. Pull ring bank insert bit. Everyone else you just push the bit in and it snaps in place. I actually gave my Bosch one away TomD 2 hours ago Milwaukee especially the M12 really needs the big ham hands; having the battery inside the handle is a huge difference unless you have catcher’s mitts for paws. Luckily, I do, and so I can join the Red Army. What I don’t like is I can’t figure out the deal with them vs that hand truck company. Josh 1 day ago This feels awfully propaganda-ey You left out the factory closures you covered right here on the page, that’s weird. Andrew Holmes 1 day ago Are you talking about the craftsman factory closures? There’s not been an article about Milwaukee closing buildings recently just about them opening them. Stuart 1 day ago Milwaukee did NOT close their hand tool factory, and recently launched new cutters that are made there – https://toolguyd.com/milwaukee-angled-diagonal-cutting-pliers-launch/ . Josh 1 day ago Didn’t they close a Mississippi factory a shortly after opening it? Pretty sure you covered it Stuart 1 day ago Ah – that one closed 2-1/2 years ago – https://toolguyd.com/milwaukee-tool-clinton-mississippi-closure-2023/ At the time they said that 150 workers were impacted. They were expecting to create 800 new jobs at another facility that was also being expanded – https://toolguyd.com/milwaukee-usa-manufacturing-expansion-2022/ . A lot of brands had closures and layoffs around the same time. https://toolguyd.com/stanley-black-decker-closing-facility-south-carolina-2024/ https://toolguyd.com/makita-usa-layoffs-2023/ Closures suck. I tend to look at net increases and investments, especially as they compare across the industry. Scott 1 day ago Might have been easier to keep manufacturing here, rather than ship it all overseas, then start making a few things here and say that your expanding American manufacturing. Stuart 1 day ago Modern cordless power tools were never made here. Even when SBD was assembling select cordless power tools here, key components were imported. https://toolguyd.com/dewalt-built-cordless-drills-in-usa/ Milwaukee Tool only launched hand tools under TTI ownership, and I doubt they would have seen much demand for USA-made tools at the time, let alone been able to build manufacturing from scratch. Half of SBD was a hand tools company and yet they couldn’t manage to successfully build a new production facility. Klein Tools makes a lot of hand tools in the USA but chose to outsource most of their expansion efforts. New jobs and new knowhow is better than nothing. Ask a company like Crescent about when they’re bringing back USA production. Leatherman just launched new USA-made knives, and all anyone is talking about are the prices. I appreciate what USA production we can get, because these days it isn’t much. Scott 10 hours ago But their corded tools have been offshore as well. I just was at my local Ace, and both the corded sawzall and super sawzall say made in China on them. (I do have pics to prove it). Their harbors for holes also use to be made in USA, now they’re imported too. My point was the stuff they used to make in the U S they shipped over seas. If I made 100% of my products in the U.S., then shipped everything overseas, then decided to expand domestic manufacturing by making 1 product in the U.S., that seems like … I don’t know… not honest to me Stuart 10 hours ago Can you send me pics (email, imgur, or social media)? The last I checked I was told they’re still made here. I wouldn’t be too surprised, as the market for corded tools keeps shrinking. I don’t know about arbors, just the hole saw cups. Bonnie 10 hours ago ACME Tools lists their COO as China as well. https://www.acmetools.com/milwaukee-m18-fuel-super-sawzall-bare-tool-2722-20/045242006465.html Going through their holesaws on Acme’s website it looks like the Hole-Dozers are still USA made, but the diamond and shockwave branded ones are all from Taiwan, and the arbors are Chinese. https://www.acmetools.com/milwaukee-7-16-in-large-thread-quick-change-arbor-49-56-9100/045242200832.html https://www.acmetools.com/milwaukee-shockwave-impact-hole-saw-3-piece-set-49-22-4800/045242321162.html Stuart 10 hours ago We’re talking about corded/AC powered, not M18. And standard hole saws, such as this 28pc set at Home Depot, not the couple of impact ones. HD shows individual with-arbor sizes as being made in USA with global materials. You’d have to check the packaging on the arbors to know for certain. Scott 10 hours ago Sent via email Stuart 8 hours ago @Scott, I got it, thanks! Darn I was hoping you weren’t right. I took the corded Sawzall part out, as your images clearly show it being labeled as made in China. They do still produce some power tools here, such as the compact Packout vacuum (again, as of the last time I checked). I ask around regularly, and tool brands are not at all interested in making cordless power tools here. Matt 1 day ago I appreciate this type of article as I was definitely hearing one-sided perspectives that were misleading / confusing. Propaganda and opinions aside, it’s refreshing to read discussions that remind the reader of logical fallacies, muddy semantics and context. All conecepts that are vastly important for a proper discussion. I love tools, especially when they are pushing the edge of market competition for the right intentions. I like to believe Milwaukee, Dewalt, Ryobi, Metabo, Klein, Proto, Snap-On, Craftsman, etc all have/had their niche lane of expertise. Then market share or share holder demands gets the best of every for-profit company. Its how we end up with battery and plastic storage box wars. One humble tool enthusiast just hopes that the competition leads to lower prices while also improving the everyday lifestyles of the neighborhood. For some the neighborhood is as small as a few blocks; for some the neighborhood is as big as continents! Chris D 24 hours ago I’m confused about the purpose of the article. Being an independent subsidiary means they are controlled and influenced by the parent company. That’s how this kind of ownership structure works. TTI being publicly traded does not change the fact that they are a Hong Kong-based (Chinese) company. So Milwaukee, at the top level, is owned, influenced, and controlled by a Chinese-based company, TTI. It’s a fact, and I can’t see how it’s in dispute. I’m purposely avoiding making a value judgement about whether or not this ownership arrangement is a “good” thing, and am not drawing the “false” conclusions you caution about in the article. I’m only reacting to the fact check. I can’t tell if you’re either trying to inform that they are not directly owned by the Chinese government, or if you’re trying to add some separation between Milwaukee and the country of their owner for some patriotic help for the brand, or if you are trying to inform that you know TTI has absolutely no influence on Milwaukee. Either way, I will still be buying M12 tools and other products. I just think this was a bit of a strange article. Stuart 22 hours ago The purpose of this article is for me to not have to repeat the same info every time there’s a claim of “Milwaukee is owned by China!” in the comments section. Given the nature of the comments I have seen over and over again, it seems a lot of people mistakenly believe that Milwaukee is just a name for an overseas company, or that they are somehow directly owned by the Chinese government. Frequently, after erroneously saying something about the location of Milwaukee’s HQ, some will say something like “yes, but don’t they send all of the profits back to China?” Frankly, no one can trace where every dollar ends up, but we do know that Milwaukee is constantly investing in jobs and expansion here, which makes that easy to debunk. Ed 12 hours ago People conflate Milwaukee HQ with that of TTI. It’s lazy and low-information, but that’s the reality of it. Sinclaire 11 hours ago Appreciate the thoughtful article. As you’ve said the question of ownership here is somewhat muddled so I’m sure your detailed explanation has helped clear that up. One of my recent comments is quoted so figured I might as well respond. It wasn’t entirely accurate for me to refer to Milwaukee as a “Chinese company” but it wouldn’t be entirely accurate to refer to it as an American company either. Personally I’ve heard lots of comments on other sites as well as on job sites to the effect of “I buy Milwaukee because it’s an American company and they’re made in the US.” Speaking about power tools usually. I find these comments annoying since they’re patently incorrect and usually made by someone who would scoff at anything Made in China. So, my comment on a previous article wasn’t exactly accurate but stemmed mostly from my annoyance at other misconceptions about Milwaukee. It wasn’t intended as a value judgement either, and Milwaukee’s efforts to increase manufacturing, especially in a state desperate for an economic boost like Mississippi, are extremely laudable. The only thing in this article I would push back on (as others have here) is the notion that TTI being publicly traded somehow means it isn’t a Chinese company. US firms invest in tons of Chinese companies, that doesn’t make them any less Chinese. Stuart 10 hours ago The problem with misinformation is that it’s easy to pick up and repeat, and harder to fact check. I’ve had to correct people who thought Milwaukee is its own company or that they produce everything here. But the “their HQ is in China” and similar has become more pervasive, and often spread maliciously because people prefer other brands or dislike Milwaukee for whatever reason. I try to address any misinformation or misconceptions in the comments, because you never know if it’ll be read and taken as fact by 100 people or 100,000. TTI being publicly traded is an important detail, because there’s a distinction between a company or their head offices being based in China and being “owned by China.” Skipping details is a shortcut that leads to mistakes being made. CM 21 hours ago Your comment summarized my feelings as well. Additionally, because Milwaukee’s parent company is listed on the HKEX, it isn’t held to the same financial metrics and reporting standards as a company on an American stock exchange, which allows it to operate differently. KokoTheTalkingApe 11 hours ago “Being an independent subsidiary means they are controlled and influenced by the parent company. ” Not necessarily true. The level of control varies, and it’s independent of the legal arrangement between the companies. Some subsidiaries are truly managed independently. Some are just shells that exist in name only so the brand can be licensed out. And as Stuart tried to point out, being “Chinese” isn’t a cut-and-dried thing, at least not when applied to corporations. Neither is “American,” for that matter. What would a 100% American company be? Would they ever buy parts from China? Intellectual property? Raw materials? Could their employees be based in other countries? Could they use foreign contractors? The only truly 100% American tool I’ve ever used is a hard-faced mallet some guy made in his garage, except the aluminum probably came from Canada. The fact is we don’t really have the right words to describe these situations easily. There are shades of gray. And things and complex. And change often. But re Milwaukee, at least some of the money I’d spend goes to American workers, more than a lot of other companies. And the tools are good. That’s good enough for me. Chris D 9 hours ago The level of control varies, you are right, but it’s between 100% control and something greater than 0%. There’s no reasonable chance TTI does not influence Milwaukee. It would be irresponsible to the shareholders to let a subsidiary basically run alone, in a vacuum, and not align it to an overall group strategy to maximize the return. To simplify, if a company is “Chinese” or “American”, etc., just see where their global headquarters is. Microsoft’s is in the US. They are an American company that operates globally with a global supply chain. TTI are a Chinese company that operates globally, with a global supply chain. Whatever is the nationality of the company doesn’t give a value judgement. Sinclaire 7 hours ago I don’t get what’s so hard about this particular point. Headquartered in the US, American company. Headquartered in HK/China, Chinese company. TomD 2 hours ago That’s too simplistic- in my personal experience I’ve seen companies headquartered in one country, with the vast majority of R&D and support in a second country, and manufacturing where you’d expect it in a third. And often the headquarters is basically on paper, and the company is mostly lead from a technical subdivision. Shane 23 hours ago Last I checked, they have opened 8 different locations here in my home state of Mississippi so I have no complaints about the company and I love the tools as well. They have made a large investment in a state that is in desperate need of it. Regardless of ownership, the locations are real, the jobs are real and the local economic impact is real. It’s time to put the COO purity test to rest and pay more attention to the investments that some of these manufacturers are making locally. It’s becoming nearly impossible to source everything that goes into a product from one country. Consider everything you own that contains any rare earths. Do you drive a car with a catalytic converter? Own any lithium ion batteries? Some part of these originated in China. The “good ole days” are gone. I own a couple of Veto tool bags. You can’t argue the quality or durability. Made in China. You have to judge things on their merits, not where it came from. Dave F 12 hours ago I live in Mississippi also and Im happy to see the amount of investment Milwaukee has done in Mississippi. SlowEng 18 hours ago Fact check. Milwaukee tool is a Subsidiary of Chinese Company. First being publicly traded has nothing to do with whether or not a company is Chinese or not. BYD, the Chinese car company, has Warren Buffett as an investor along with other major American financial institutions, is BYD therefore not a Chinese company? No it’s Chinese because it’s domiciled in China and has to follow Chinese law. Hong Kong is part of China not a independent nation. I use to work at Yokohama North America. An independent subsidiary of Yokohama Japan. Yokohama North America has headquarters in California and plants in the USA. They were stilled controlled by the parent company. What investments to make and what developments to pursue was all coordinated with the parent structure. Milwaukee is no different. Milwaukee did not setup its own plant in China to build just Milwaukee stuff separate from any other TTi product line. There will be a lot of design and resource sharing between all the TTI brands to coordinate costs and time. Milwaukee tools ultimately has to follow what TTI tells them because they are owned by the parent company. Independent subsidiary is legal term of art. It’s used to setup firewalls for litigation between various entities owned by the same parent entity. If Ryobi, as an example, has battery fires that cause damage to a home, then litigants may only be able to go after Ryobi, but not Milwaukee. Even though both companies are owned by TTI. This is not 100% but an important function of subsidiary companies. The Fact is Milwaukee Tool is subsidiary of Chinese Company. Stuart 16 hours ago But not “owned by China,” which is the common myth. I don’t know the full extent of production sharing. We’ve asked about this, and have been told that many tools from different brands come out of the same factories but from separate lines and with different parts, following independent development. There are times when like-themed products launch from different brands in a good, better, best tiering. Milwaukee operates independently from Ryobi, which is part of the same division as Ridgid. They’ve all said they don’t collaborate across (Milwaukee and TTI North America) brand lines, but it’d be foolish to ignore signs of common strategy at times. I’ve assumed that at higher levels there are “brand is working on a [tool], other brand should too,” directives, or it could come in the form of a customer (Home Depot) request. But how they operate is very different compared to say Craftsman and Dewalt, where teams might be shared between the brands. You don’t have Milwaukee designers working on Ryobi tools, or vise versa, even if you have shared factories. “Milwaukee tools have Ryobi parts” is another fallacy with no known signs or examples of proof. David 14 hours ago Any company that has presence in China controlled by Chinese communist party. China is like Soviet Union. None of them are independent. All their goals are subordinate to CCP. So TTI is owned by China. Hence Milwaukee is owned by China. Stuart 14 hours ago Sorry, but no; Milwaukee Tool is an American company and is not “owned by China.” Josh 13 hours ago Let me ask you this Stuart, since you are knowledgeable about this corporate structure: if TTI decided to close all American plants and relocate the entire structure of Milwaukee to China (I am not asking if this is likely or a good business decision), could they do so? Stuart 12 hours ago I don’t believe so. It’s my understanding that it would ultimately depend on the board of directors and even a shareholders vote. Let’s say that it comes to a vote, the relocation passes, and the US government doesn’t step in (I’m confident they would). In that case, I think that the most likely outcome is that Milwaukee Tool would be acquired or spun off into its own company. There’s no fathomable scenario where Milwaukee Tool could simply be uprooted and moved to China. I don’t see any way for TTI to have the kind of power to do what you’re asking. Chris D 9 hours ago This is where there is a gap in understanding. In the scenario, if “TTI decided it,” then it means it’s been decided by the executive board. The shareholders could disapprove and express it by voting the board members off, but the board would likely not take that decision if they couldn’t defend it (and their jobs) to the shareholders. That’s what is being missed here. TTI is the parent company, and they are in charge. Dave F 9 hours ago Horst Pudwill is the majority stakeholder of TTI. Not China. https://www.forbes.com/profile/horst-julius-pudwill/ Rick 5 hours ago “Any company that has presence in China controlled by Chinese communist party… So TTI is owned by China. Hence Milwaukee is owned by China.” This simply is not true, and claims like this demonstrate why this article is necessary. TTI certainly has to conform to the Hong Kong flavor of Chinese law, but there is no evidence that it is controlled by the Chinese government. TTI is a multinational company which is headquartered in Hong Kong (as opposed to mainland China) for significant tax and business reasons. That’s it. It’s worth spending a few seconds just looking at the directors of the company: https://www.ttigroup.com/company/our-board#executive_directors I expect that there are plenty of American companies with more Chinese faces on their board! And if the board of TTI found that government overreach was beoming a serious problem, I suspect that they could simply shutdown their operation in Hong Kong and move somewhere else. al 17 hours ago Cant say I care wither way, but its a bit disingenuous (if not outright false) to claim TTI is not a Chinese company simply because its shares are traded publicly. That would be like saying Yamaha is not a Japanese company because its stock is listed publicly. Just not true… Stuart 16 hours ago Publicly traded and based in HK/China. How one interprets that is open to opinion. “Milwaukee is owned by China” is often present as fact, and that’s completely inaccurate. What about Cleveland, which traded hands. Are they now “owned by Canada?” Or Stanley Black & Decker’s Facom, or USAG? Are those European brands or American? People seem to change their logic on a case by case basis because they prefer some brands and dislike others. al 16 hours ago Its not open to opinion though, the nation in which a company is incorporated/domiciled is a cut & dry fact. Milwaukee IS owned by a Chinese company. There’s no other interpretation or opinion that enters into the equation. Whether that matters is a matter of personal opinion Stuart 15 hours ago You’re talking about TTI. TTI is domiciled in HK, but Milwaukee Tool is domiciled in the USA. Cleveland Tool was recently owned by a company domiciled in China, and their current parent is domiciled in Canada. Cleveland never uprooted and to my knowledge remains domiciled in the USA. Martinez Tool is domiciled in the USA, but their parent company is domiciled in Sweden. Their parent, Hultafors, also owns Johnson Level, which is domiciled in the USA. If you were born and raised in California and then adopted by parents who live in Texas, but you still live in California, are you a Californian, or a Texan? You’d be a Californian, as a fact, and deviation from that becomes a matter of opinion. An extension of the myth that we see with TTI and Milwaukee would be “neither, you’re owned by Texas.” al 13 hours ago You state in the article that the following claim is inaccurate: “Milwaukee is owned by a Chinese company”. That is wrong. Milwaukee IS owned by a Chinese company (TTI). There’s no 2 ways about it Stuart 12 hours ago “Owned by a Chinese company” is still inaccurate. They are owned by a publicly-traded company based in Hong Kong. Maybe it wasn’t the best example, in which there are countless more that are even more inaccurate. In any case, Milwaukee Tool is an American company. Bonnie 11 hours ago TTI being publicly traded or domiciled in HK doesn’t mean they aren’t a Chinese company Stuart. I don’t understand why you keep repeating that. Hong Kong is part of China, regardless of the “one country two systems” concept (which has been wearing down as of late as the PRC exerts more active control). Would you claim that a Welsh tool company isn’t British? Stuart 11 hours ago @Bonnie, Wales is part of Great Britain but not part of England. Details are important. Bonnie 10 hours ago @Stuart Yes, and the detail here is that Hong Kong is part of China and answers to the PRC. Bonnie 11 hours ago There is an important difference between the statements “Milwaukee is owned by a Chinese company” and “Milwaukee is owned by China (PRC)”. The first is true, the latter is false. The article above is good and important, but I think you are also somewhat conflating these two separate statements. Dave F 9 hours ago Horst Pubwill is the majority stakeholder of TTI. Not China. https://www.forbes.com/profile/horst-julius-pudwill/ Bonnie 9 hours ago No, he is not the majority shareholder. He is the *largest* shareholder, as they state on their website. Majority shareholder means they control 50% or more of controlling shares (Google AI gets this wrong if that’s your source). Pudwill owns just under 20%, with his family holding an additional 1.8%. TTI has no majority stakeholder. Daniel L 16 hours ago Honestly… There’s a really, really salient critique to the kind of layers-upon-layers of obfuscation and ownership in these corporate structures. Alienation is a feature of these systems. Not a bug. Stuart 15 hours ago It’s not a feature and not a bug, just the muddy nature of how things are today with mergers and acquisitions and companies within companies. The same company owns GEICO, Fruit of the Loom, Duracell, Dairy Queen, and Jazwares (toys). How is the average person supposed to know this? Many people see “Milwaukee Tool is owned by China” on social media, take it as fact without checking, and the repeat it somewhere else. Collin 15 hours ago The rabidness in these comments is so strange. People seem to be nearly foaming at the mouth about the corporate structure of Milwaukee. To your point Stewart, the investment from TTI via Milwaukee into American manufacturing and engineering is outstanding. I’d say it’s better than most American-based companies. Just wait until people realize that their “American” Craftsman power tools were/are manufactured by TTI. sdsdv10 14 hours ago “Just wait until people realize that their “American” Craftsman power tools were/are manufactured by TTI.” I thought Craftsman was owned by Stanley Black & Decker, which I believe is a different company than TTI. Stuart 14 hours ago TTI made some Craftsman cordless power tools for Sears. To my knowledge that ended when SBD – Dewalt’s parent company – acquired the Craftsman brand. Regarding the nature of comments, the frequency of off-topic rantings and ramblings has greatly increased over the years, as if people feel personal politics need to be injected into every single conversation. As long as arguments are well and politely articulated, civil discussion is welcome. Bill 13 hours ago TTI owns Milwaukee. Therefore, it would have the final say. It would be pointless to own a company and then not care about any decisions dealing with product development. Therefore, IMO, it is a Chinese run company. And, I don’t care. I love my Milwaukee stuff. I just wish that it was easier on the wallet. I have seriously considered going with Craftsman because I am more of a DIY person, but I love good tools. What am I supposed to do. 🙂 TomD 2 hours ago I mean if we go to “not going to happen final say” then if China orders TTI to do whatever, the US could nationalize Milwaukee. It doesn’t really matter in the actuality of day to day life. Robert 13 hours ago not “owned by China,” Actually, if they are operating out of Hong Kong they are to some degree. Any Chinese nationals there are subject to government dictates. So the Chinese government regardless of the percentage of ownership has influence on TTI to at least that degree. Stuart 13 hours ago John lives in Texas and is subject to local laws. John Jr. lives in Alaska. By your logic, the Texas government would have influence over John Jr’s activities. You fell into a common logic trap. scott 13 hours ago You did too. China dont play fair. If Texas says they will jail ole dad, until John Jr. send them some info, wonder if John Jr sends it. Stuart 12 hours ago John Jr was raised to deny control to blackmailers, so no. “I wonder if” and other conditional hypotheticals are not a basis for determining factual truths. Ed 12 hours ago Except you are affording the same “rights” for lack of a better term to corporations (a legal entity) as you are a person. It does not work that way. Multi-national corporations have defined structures. Ultimately, the proverbial buck stops with TTI in HK. The same applies to Motorola Mobility in HK, Firestone in Japan, or Budweiser in Belgium. All of these are American brands which operate as a subsidiary of a foreign-controlled parent company. Stuart 12 hours ago If we were talking about “TTI Wisconsin,” I might agree with you, but we’re not. The nuances of an American company owned by a publicly-traded company based in HK gets messy, but it remains completely untrue to argue “Milwaukee Tool is owned by China” or “Milwaukee is headquartered in China.” Those are among the most commonly parroted myths about the subject. Ed 11 hours ago The same could be said for the other examples I provided. Spin it any way you’d like, but that’s the case. How much experience do you have working for an “American” company with foreign ownership? I’m not here to question your competence, but I’ve spent much of my career at companies with similar arrangements to Milwaukee. Understanding how these organizations function isn’t something typically understood by someone who hasn’t worked under such an arrangement. Chris D 9 hours ago This is exactly where I’m coming from. I work for a company in the US that, if I told you the name, you would google them and conclude they are a western-European company because that’s where the headquarters is. It’s even publicly traded on a European exchange. I could give you a tour of our US plants, US test labs, and you might think we are a US company. But: we are a subsidiary of the European company, which is a subsidiary of…a Chinese company. And the Chinese company absolutely has a say in how we operate and what we do. We’re a Chinese company. And the profits make their way back there. Again, no value judgement, it’s just the way it is. That’s the perspective I’m trying to add here, as someone who lives in this kind of business each day. scott 13 hours ago As far a owned by China, Jack Ma, would disagree. As he found out, the Party is will to do things to help folks understand, certain things are not tolerated. China does not own TTI, but they can control lots of things if they want to, just as Jack Ma found out. If TTI was doing advanced microchip research you can bet that it was getting shared, power tool research not so much. Anyone doing manufacturing in china has to understand this. Only company that stayed away that I know of was Stihl, and dang do they make some good tools. Most of there US manufacturing is done in Va Beach, and has been for many many years. Dave F 12 hours ago Publicly traded corporations are owned by their shareholders. According to public information, Horst Pubwill is the largest shareholder of TTI. That doesnt seem too Chinese to me. Of course TTI has to abide by Hong Kong law because they are domiciled there. But owned by China, not really. https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/TECHTRONIC-INDUSTRIES-CO–134983/company-shareholders/ Scott K 12 hours ago You’ve addressed this and other misconceptions several times – while I feel as though it’s important to set the record straight and educate people, some aren’t open to hearing different than what they believe. Some people immediately shut down when they hear “China.” Buying Milwaukee tools made in China still benefits Americans because those purchases support the many sales, engineering, and other positions held by Americans in America. This isn’t really a difficult concept to grasp if you’re open to it. Stuart 11 hours ago As you say, some people will ignore facts to believe what they want to believe. With this, “Milwaukee is owned by China” and “Milwaukee is HQed in China” have become sensational myths that some people believe or perpetuate without fact-checking. Generally speaking, Harbor Freight’s Chicago Electric and Pittsburgh brands are just labels attached to imported tools. Many people realize this at different times – or not – and so it doesn’t take much for people to be erroneously convinced that similar might be true for other brands or companies. “Milwaukee is owned by/HQed in China” is inaccurate, but believable if you don’t check the facts. Some people will repeat misinformation as part of some agenda, but there are enough that simply haven’t fact-checked the claims. Norm 11 hours ago Does this mean SK Tools is technically an American company? Stuart 11 hours ago Not much is left of SK, and so I’d say no. As I understand it, SK is now an American brand. Jack 11 hours ago As SlowEng said it rather eloquently below, the term “Independent Subsidiary”, which you are in part hanging your hat on, does not really exist in terms of sensitive or major decisions. Would we be having this same discussion if Milwaukee made defense equipment instead of drills? If you think that the parent company couldn’t access any technology it wanted from the “Independent Subsidiary” whenever it wanted to, you’re being naive. And if it wanted to use a Milwaukee technology in a Ryobi product I think its additionally naive to think there is some sort of “wall” between the brands that would prevent that. I’m not sure why you are speculating that that couldn’t happen. It’s wonderful that Milwaukee has greatly helped the economy in Mississippi and has created jobs. And its kept a great American brand alive and made it a major player in the tool segment. Foreign investment here is not automatically a bad thing. If it makes you feel better to say that “Milwaukee isn’t owned by the Chinese” then fine, I would concede that point. But I’m not sure that’s the right question to begin with. If the parent company is domiciled in China, then various actors in China have ultimate influence and access to the “Independent Subsidiary”, plain and simple, including moving the company out of the US if they see fit, so I disagree with you on that as well. But if its in the best interests of the parent company to keep the mfg. here, then they will continue to do so, but not because Milwaukee is independent. Because of the way in which China competes, and additionally how the Honk Kong stock exchange and its rules differ from ours, your example of Texas / California is not a good one, in my opinion, to the subject here. I love your site and the work you do here, and I’m not meaning to throw shade your way, but I don’t think many folks here are buying your argument. Stuart 10 hours ago then various actors in China have ultimate influence and access to the “Independent Subsidiary”, plain and simple, including moving the company out of the US if they see fit Are there any historical examples where what you propose could happen has happened? KokoTheTalkingApe 11 hours ago Another myth I’ve heard a few times: “Milwaukee is made in the same factory as X so they’re really the same tools and Milwaukee’s high prices are bullshit.” Not true, and even if they were made in the same factory (as happens with some heavy woodworking tools like lathes), that doesn’t mean they are the same tools. They have different parts going into them, they have different quality standards, and they have VERY different after-sale support, return policies, etc. I don’t care if Rikon is made in the same factory as a Harbor Freight. I can call Rikon and immediately talk to an engineer who actually knows the tools, even the discontinued ones. That’s worth money to me. Stuart 11 hours ago Yes – that’s another big misconception, but also one that’s much more difficult to debunk. It’s false, but credible. TonyT 10 hours ago One question for everyone who disagrees with Stuart: Was Milwaukee an American company before TTI bought it? Note that Milwaukee’s previous owner was Atlas-Copco of Sweden: https://www.contractormag.com/tools/article/20875773/milwaukee-electric-aeg-bought and I’ll say that, without doubt, TTI’s ownership has been better for Milwaukee (and American jobs) than Atlas-Copco’s. Stuart 9 hours ago Can we credit TTI for Milwaukee’s success, or Milwaukee Tool’s leaders and decision-makers, with Steven Richman now at the helm of all of TTI as CEO? Luke 9 hours ago Stuart, thanks for helping clear this up for everyone. It’s wild to see people so furiously argue with straight facts. I didn’t realize your average reader was so damn terrified of China. Andy 3 hours ago Right? I’m not sure if it’s scary or entertaining how scared done people are Jason 9 hours ago I’ve often wondered why they don’t just dual list. Plenty of companies do, IIRC Alibaba was trying to get listed on NYSE as a secondary. Andy 3 hours ago I’m going to go ahead and call this the most entertaining post of the year. At least so far. Chris 2 hours ago Milwaukee Tool is American based in terms of its operational footprint, history, and brand identity, but it is not American owned. It is a foreign owned subsidiary. It might have US based leadership, R&D, marketing, and manufacturing facilities in several states including Mississippi, Wisconsin, and South Carolina. Be ownership is by Techtronic Industries (TTI), a Hong Kong-based parent company. ChipBoundary 12 minutes ago No, it is owned by China, because all companies in China are owned and controlled by the government. If a government official comes into a Chinese company, even a publicly traded one, and tells them to do or change something then that is exactly what they do. No questions, no appeals, no hesitations. That’s how China works. All companies are the government, pure and simple. That is the facts. Now, my problem with Chinese products begins and ends with Internet connected products. Outside of that, I do not care. I’m a disabled veteran, as patriotic as they come, and I’m even born and raised in Wisconsin. Milwaukee are the best power tools, period. Anybody that argues otherwise is delusional. I use other brands as they are what I can afford at various times, but the few Milwaukees I have and have used, are second to none. Every union millwright I’ve ever known is exclusively Milwaukee. Are other tools good? Absolutely. Are they better? No. Your email address will not be published.

(Bloomberg) -- George Hongchoy plans to retire as head of Link Asset Management Ltd., the manager of Asia’s largest real estate investment trust. Hongchoy, 63, will remain with the property firm as it searches for a successor, Hong Kong-based Link said in a statement Tuesday. A former investment banker, Hongchoy joined Link in 2009 as chief financial officer before moving to the top job the following year. Link manages the Link REIT, which runs HK$226 billion ($29 billion) in assets across retail, office and logistics, according to its website. Under Hongchoy’s tenure, the LINK REIT has more than doubled the Hang Seng Index, returning 10.2% a year including dividends, compared with a 5% annual gain for Hong Kong’s main equity gauge. Over that time, Link has diversified its portfolio, which initially comprised low-end neighborhood malls in Hong Kong. It now also holds office buildings and shopping malls in mainland China, Australia, Singapore and the UK. Hongchoy has been one of the highest paid executives in Hong Kong, awarded annual pay of HK$70 million. Link has also expanded into fund management. It hired John Saunders, former head of Asia-Pacific real estate at BlackRock Inc., last year to lead the operation known as Link Real Estate Partners. “In a challenging market, Link’s continued resilience shows the underlying strength of the business,” Duncan Owen, chair of Link said in the statement. “We have good momentum in our efforts to grow and diversify our investment platform with the recent launch of Link Real Estate Partners.” More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Fed Should Act As Economy Slows—Will Politics Delay It?

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone, Contributor. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed once again at record highs on Friday (July 18).1 The DJIA was off marginally for both the week (-0.07%) and year to date (-0.79%).2 The Russell 2000, the small-cap index, is the canary in the coal mine. Generally speaking, small caps lead the major averages, especially when the economy slows. And while the Russell 2000 was up marginally for the week and nearly 3% so far in July, it is down nearly -8.3% from its peak and nearly -5.5% year to date.3 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Using a simple average, six of the Magnificent 7 rose for the week (AAPL barely so). Year to date, three (NVDA, MSFT, META) are up double digits, two (AAPL, TSLA) are down double digits, while the other two (AMZN, GOOG) are just above/below the flatline.4 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. Jobs While the headline Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report for June looked relatively strong at +147K, beneath the surface, it wasn’t.5 First, there is the Birth/Death (B/D) model automatic add-on (ostensibly for small businesses that are not surveyed) at +76K.5 This is a large positive number that is simply added on without regard to the economic environment. The fact is applications for new businesses at the state/local level have fallen off a cliff recently.6 In addition, raw data show that state and local governments laid off -310K in June, but through the magic of seasonal adjustment, that number translated into +80K.5 So, that +80K plus the +76K from the B/D model (i.e., +156K) more than offset the total NFP headline number of +147K. Not much substance here! ADP, the payroll processor, has its own payroll series which comes out a couple days before the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ NFP report. Since it processes payrolls, we should take its data seriously. The ADP number for June was a loss of -33K jobs.7 (Note: the narrative that the economy is “strong” showed up in the consensus estimate of the ADP number which was +98K, only off by a whopping -131K!) The ADP survey breaks down the data by business size. In this case: small business: -47K, medium sized: -15K, large businesses: +30K.7 In the ADP report, the Education/Health sector lost -52K jobs (negative for three months in a row and in four of the last five), while Professional & Business Services, a proxy for temporary help, fell -56K.7 The latter is highly correlated with the overall health of the labor market. This weakness in the labor market is backed up by the contraction in the workweek (-0.3% in June vs. May).5 But, in a supposed sign of labor market strength, the U3 Unemployment Rate fell to 4.1% in June from 4.2% in May; markets were expecting a 4.3% reading.8 In fact, had the Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR), the percentage of the working aged population either working or looking for work and the denominator in the U3 calculation, stayed constant, the U3 rate would have risen to that 4.3% number.9 But the LFPR fell. And it fell because, according to the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Survey, jobs are “hard to get,” and those already unemployed have become discouraged and have stopped looking, thus lowering the labor force ranks.9 June 2025 jobs one-month net change According to economist David Rosenberg, “…private sector payrolls slowed sharply [in June], the most sluggish reading in five months. Stripping out the boom in health care/social assistance, we get +15K which is statistically insignificant and an 80% haircut from the average of the prior six months…”10 Conclusion: The labor market has turned soft and, in our view, we are going to see a significant rise in the unemployment rate by year’s end. And it is this factor that will, in the end, cause the Fed to embark upon a rate lowering cycle. Inflation Meanwhile, inflation remained persistent in June with the CPI rising at a hotter than expected +0.3% pace.11 Thankfully, the core CPI (ex-food, energy) is up at an annual rate of only 1.1% in the January to June period.12 While airfares (-0.1%), hotel/motel prices (-3.6%) and new (-0.3%) and used (-0.7%) car prices actually fell in June, we did see a pop in the prices of other key goods, notably appliances (+1.9%), toys (+1.8%), recreational goods (+0.8%) and clothing (+0.4%).11 The Producer Price Index (PPI) was better, coming in flat (0.0%) versus a market expectation of +0.2%.13 For the year/year reading, this index was up 2.3%, down from its May 2.7% rate.13 This is good news as PPI often leads the CPI. Consumer Prices (CPI) The Fed and Interest Rates The Fed continues to be very concerned (overly so, in our view) about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation (i.e., the “tariff effect”) and thus, despite the soft data strongly supporting lower rates, is unlikely to reduce them at its upcoming July meetings (July 29-30).14 Some economists have even discounted a rate reduction at the Fed’s September meeting set.15 That would leave December as the first rate reduction meeting. Because changes in monetary policy impact the economy with a long lag, we believe that the Fed should be cutting interest rates now, as the underlying data are quickly deteriorating. Case in point: credit card delinquencies continue at high levels as shown in the chart below. They are now at their ’08-’09 levels.16 The same can be said for auto loans and bank business loans.16 Clearly, the economy is slowing, and the U.S. consumer will likely be cutting spending to pay down their bloated credit card balances and catch up on their auto payments. This will have a negative impact on consumption going forward. Credit Card Delinquencies (90+ Days) At the press conference of a Fed meeting several quarters ago, Chairman Powell revealed what he called his “super-core inflation index,” i.e., services excluding housing.17 It is a narrower measure than core inflation (which excludes food and energy prices). This measure has now risen at a 1.1% annual rate so far in 2025.17 Hence, it would appear that business and economic conditions are ripe for a rate cutting cycle. But that is the straight economic analysis and excludes political considerations. Anyone who stays in touch with current events knows that the media has hyperventilated over the President’s pressure on the Fed, and Chairman Powell in particular, to lower interest rates.18 The Fed was wisely set-up by Congress in the early 1900s as “independent” from other branches of government, i.e., the President has no jurisdiction aside from the ability to nominate candidates for vacant Federal Reserve Board seats. The press has been reporting that the President is looking for ways to “fire” Chairman Powell, but it is clear that the President doesn’t have such power.18 (Note: There is the “incompetent” argument. The White House thinks that Powell can be removed for such. And they appear to be pursuing the large cost overruns to rehab the Fed’s HQ Building in Washington, D.C. as proof. We doubt this will stick.) One question that remains in the background (and unspoken) is whether the Fed would, to spite the President, not lower rates when they otherwise would have!! We think such a scenario has a low probability; after all, there are 11 other voting members of the FOMC and Chairman Powell has always acted with integrity. Housing Another market needing rate relief is housing. The number of months of supply of existing homes for sale is now above the pandemic highs of 2020 as are rental vacancies.19 Existing Homes Monthly Supply and Rental Vacancy Rates: Houses and Apartments As a result, rents have begun to fall; and that will end up being a positive for the inflation file going forward.19 Net household formation (mainly in the population aged 25-34 that are forming households for the first time) has fallen to <1% at an annual rate, while homebuilders continue to produce new homes at their former rates when net household formation was higher.20 New Tenant Repeat Rent The resulting excess supply will weigh on new home prices and ultimately will reduce construction activity. Markets have already factored this in, as, despite the equity markets’ recent record highs, the Homebuilders’ Index in the S&P 500 is off -30% from its cycle peak.21 Hence, our view that home prices, both new and existing, are at or have passed their peaks for this cycle. Final Thoughts Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed again at record highs on Friday, July 18.1 But the small-cap Russell 2000, the canary in the coal mine, and the old economy industrials, the DJIA, appear to be singing from a different hymn book. Both are down for the year, the Russell by more than -5%.3 They appear to be telling us a different story regarding the state of the economy than are the large caps in the S&P 500. The tech heavy Magnificent 7 are also sending mixed signals. Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta are off to the races, while Apple and Tesla are down significantly year to date. Amazon and Google are flat.4 The payroll report looked strong on the surface, but a deep dive shows emerging weakness. Excluding the automatic add-on from the Birth/Death model calculation and the fact that state and local governments laid off -310K people in June, it is likely that payrolls were flat.5 In fact, ADP, the payroll processor, reported a loss of -33K jobs in June.7 Since they actually process payrolls, their number should be taken seriously. Unfortunately, it isn’t. Interest rates are the topic du jour. Controversy has erupted as the Trump Administration wants the Fed to lower rates with the President name-calling the Fed Chair.18 The CPI and the PPI appear to be slowly moving toward the Fed’s 2% inflation target.11 13 Our view is that, unforeseeable circumstances notwithstanding, because there is a long lag in the transmission of monetary policy, the Fed should be acting to lower rates now, especially since the consumer is starting to struggle (rising delinquencies).16 But the politics of the day may indeed get in the way of good policy.

Title: Institutional Demand Surges As Ethereum Sets New Inflow Records

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum is once again in the spotlight as institutional capital continues to flood into the market at an unprecedented pace. This surge in demand reflects institutional investors who are increasingly viewing ETH as a valuable asset. According to Axel Gaubert’s post on X, ETH is pumping hard after $2.77 billion was added to BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA). This signals immense institutional appetite for the asset and underscores growing confidence in Ethereum’s role as both a financial instrument and a foundational layer for decentralized applications. Gaubert notes that the inflows reflect mainstream validation, but create questions around Satoshi’s philosophy. The core ideals of decentralization and independence from traditional finance are being tested as legacy institutions like BlackRock move in, and Ethereum is a very opinionated blockchain. The fact that BlackRock can now build on Ethereum and accumulate ETH at scale reflects Ethereum’s core philosophy, open access, programmable money, and institutional-grade architecture. Ethereum continues to make history as institutional interest surges to unprecedented levels. In the past week, spot Ethereum ETFs saw $2.18 billion in net inflows last week, which is the highest weekly inflow the products have ever recorded. This surge underscores the growing confidence institutional investors have in Ethereum’s long-term value, particularly as regulatory clarity improves and ETH cements its place as a core layer of infrastructure. As mentioned by Vincent on X, Ethereum has gained momentum, and trading between $3,100 and $3,600 at the time of the post, reflecting a 20% rally within a week. This surge is fueled by strong inflows into spot ETH ETFs and rising institutional demand, both of which are acting as major tailwinds for the asset. The ETF data has confirmed rising interest, and shows over $2.1 billion flowed into spot ETFs last week. This surge marks one of the largest weekly inflows for ETH ETFs, reflecting a broader trend of capital rotation toward crypto contract platforms. BlackRock Ethereum Trust (ETHA) now holds an impressive $9.17 billion in assets, which is nearly half of all capital invested across Ethereum ETFs. Furthermore, the Regulatory developments are supportive. The recent GENIUS Act tightens Stablecoin oversight while reinforcing trust in ETH settlement infrastructure. This dual effect positions ETH as a more credible and robust network for institutional activity. ETH currently secures $76 billion in DeFi TVL and $128 billion in Stablecoin supply. On-chain signals show strength as Staking participation continues to rise, a sign of long-term confidence among holders. The futures open interest has reached a record of $51 billion. This reflects deep institutional engagement. Meanwhile, ETH supply is deflationary due to burns and staking. Finally, Vincent sees $4,000 ETH as the next resistance level and stated that May’s Pectra upgrade will improve smart accounts, staking UX, and L2 integration, which are bullish for utility and scalability.

Title: Right-Wing Leader Says Conservatives Need ‘Scalps’ of Woke Wall Street CEOs

By Lauren Windsor In late January, the CEO of the pro-business American Legislative Exchange Council told right-wing operatives and officials that they need a “scalp” from one of two supposedly woke CEOs of major Wall Street firms. Lisa Nelson, who leads ALEC, was discussing Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, the second largest bank in the country. She appeared to be speaking metaphorically, as she struggled to refer to an unknown movie. Nelson made the comments at the Consumers’ Research Summit in Sea Island, Georgia. Rolling Stone has obtained exclusive audio and documents from the event. Nelson noted she had spoken about this at breakfast. “Whether it’s Larry Fink or Brian Moynihan, we have got to take one of these guys out,” she said, presumably another metaphor. She added, “Brian Moynihan is the guy, or Larry Fink is the guy that we should have their scalp.” ALEC is a powerful “bill mill” that brings corporations, conservative advocates, and state legislators together to hash out right-wing, pro-business legislation that is then introduced nationwide, with a focus on red states. A spokesperson for ALEC declined to comment for this story. “Over the past three years, the assets BlackRock manages on behalf of our clients have grown by $4 trillion to $12.5 trillion,” says a BlackRock spokesperson. “We are focused on delivering for each and every client in every market we operate in around the world, including helping millions of Americans in states across the country retire with dignity.” Bank of America declined to comment, though a person familiar with the matter says that the bank’s representatives attended ALEC’s annual meeting last week. Fink and his firm BlackRock have become primary targets in conservatives’ crusade against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing and initiatives promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The firm has trillions in assets under management, and manages billions of dollars for public pension funds. Because of its extensive holdings, BlackRock exerts enormous influence across the stock market through shareholder votes. In his widely-read annual letters to CEOs, Fink has written that “climate risk is investment risk.” Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Moynihan, for his part, has defended the idea of inclusion in the workplace, characterizing it as a positive business opportunity. Consumers’ Research targeted Bank of America in 2023 for engaging in “anti-consumer” behaviors: namely, having internal DEI training and offering tips for how clients can calculate their greenhouse gas emissions. Amid Republican attacks on ESG and DEI, including from President Donald Trump, BlackRock and Bank of America both dropped out of Net Zero alliances, which require a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Additionally, both companies have eliminated their DEI goals, while maintaining a general commitment to inclusion. Consumers’ Research, which hosted the event, is at the center of a network of nonprofits tied to the right-wing power broker Leonard Leo that is waging a “War on Woke” against corporations and financiers who embrace ESG investment criteria — or the idea that asset managers should consider the threat of planetary devastation when deploying money. Leo’s network helps fund ALEC, which has pushed model legislation in the states to ban asset managers for state retirement funds from promoting ESG. The anti-ESG coalition has notched some wins in terms of BlackRock and Bank of America’s public posturing, but these conservatives argue the fight is far from over. “We have our good examples. We’re sharing them every day when they get out of something,” Nelson noted, but “it’s words right now.” Related Content Jimmy Fallon Responds to Colbert Cancellation: ‘I Don’t Like What’s Going On’ Stephen Colbert Addresses Cancellation by Telling Trump to ‘Go F-ck Yourself’ Jon Stewart to CBS After Colbert's 'Late Show' Cancellation: 'Go F-ck Yourself' Trump's Wildly Fascistic Posting Spree Isn't Just a Distraction From Epstein That’s why conservatives need their scalps, Nelson explained. “And, you know, and that’s — it’s like the scalps. I don’t know what the movie is,” she said, adding it was about “taking the scalps.” “Brian Moynihan would be the perfect person,” Nelson continued. “We were talking about it at lunch, or breakfast. I think he is ideologically all-in on everything he’s doing.” Comparing him to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, the ALEC chief said she doesn’t believe that Dimon is “all-in” ideologically. “I think he is just seeing where the winds are blowing and trying to have his cake and eat it, too — and ‘I’m gonna play footsie with everybody,’ and all is going to be OK for JPMorgan in his mind,” Nelson asserted. Nelson spoke with a JPMorgan executive on a panel at ALEC’s annual meeting last week. A JPMorgan representative declined to comment but confirmed the firm is an ALEC member. ALEC does not disclose its donors or a full list of its members. The organization receives some corporate funding, including from Chevron, and donations from lobbying groups for Big Pharma, fossil fuel interests, the telecom industry, and electric utilities. ALEC’s Private Enterprise Advisory Council includes Mike Thompson, a top lieutenant at Leo’s consulting firm CRC Advisors, which helped manage the summit; as well as execs at Consumers’ Research; the American Bankers Association (ABA); oil billionaire Charles Koch’s business empire; and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington’s top business lobby. Bank of America previously cut ties with ALEC in 2012. Nelson, who previously ran global government relations at credit card giant Visa, made her comments about the CEOs during a larger conversation about the necessity of political neutrality in public investments. Fiduciaries, like BlackRock, are legally bound to act in the best financial interests of their clients. Conservative politicians and groups, ALEC included, have demanded that companies eschew ESG and DEI as part of their investment criteria, arguing the only thing that should matter is maximizing shareholder profit. During Nelson’s panel, an operative asked the panelists if they had any examples where Republican-led states had “in their efforts to kind of correct, [and] go from liberal ESG investing, instead of going back to neutral, they over-corrected,” to a place where they’re putting public money into conservative investments. “If we want neutral, we should want neutral,” the operative said. Debate ensued, with most participants concluding that long-suffering conservatives needed to beat back Big Banks, who are in cahoots with the Left — neutrality be damned. “That’s a very good kind of point to bring up,” Nelson said. “But I think you know, we should plant our flag as far as we possibly can.” Thompson, the CRC exec who moderated the panel, agreed, but was more explicit, comparing the Left and Big Banks to Hitler: “If the Allies said, ‘Hey, Hitler, will you go neutral? You’ve taken over France. You’ve got Northern Africa. You’ve got all this stuff. We’ll stop if you stop.’ OK, he’ll stop for a little while and then he’ll keep coming.” He complained about an initiative attempting to get companies to reduce their climate impact, because it was rating corporations and docking them for giving money to nonprofits that do not align with their climate goals. “Which means ALEC,” Thompson said, adding it “means Consumers’ Research should get no money from the other side.” “We need to stop their momentum and then push back,” Thompson continued. “We don’t need them to go, ‘Oh, we’re neutral now. We’ve run over 90 percent of your world. We’ve burned down 90 percent of your house, and now we’ll stop’ … Sometimes that means not neutral. It means get us back to where we can be neutral. It’s not enough to say, ‘We’re no longer gonna push the DEI agenda, but we’re still going to have trans bathrooms, you can go to any bathroom you want, do whatever you want. No, no, no. You have to rip out all those policies.’” Tom Jones — the right-wing opposition researcher notorious for publishing a DEI Watch List of mostly Black federal officials he decided should be fired by Trump — argued that conservatives should not “get wedded” to neutrality. “Publicly held funds should reflect the values of Americans, and if that means we’re not going to invest in companies that support boycott, divestment, and sanctions, [against Israel] or we’re not going to invest in companies that use slave labor in China, or we’re not going to invest in companies that invest in Iran because it’s a threat to American national security, we should 100 percent have those policies,” said Jones. “I don’t know what neutral means — but legal and principled,” said perennial anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, who seemed irritated with his compatriots’ hypocrisy. “I think you can’t go to a court and say, ‘We want to make decisions that aren’t fiduciary, but we shouldn’t be ruled to be stealing people’s money, but they do.’ I have no idea how you don’t get laughed out of court with any argument…. This is a real slippery slope, and I don’t know how you make that argument without laughing at yourself.” Described by NPR in 2001 as a “conservative revolutionary,” Norquist famously told the outlet: “I don’t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.” A spokesperson for Consumers’ Research tells Rolling Stone, ​“For years, megalomaniacs at the helm of powerful corporations like BlackRock and Bank of America exploited their positions to impose a political agenda and bully others into compliance. The American people have had enough and they are demanding a return to business, not activism. Neutrality means moving away from the far left and back to focusing on consumers. There is still a long way to go and damage to make amends for before these companies and others like them can earn the public’s trust again.” GOP attorneys general — long financed by Leo through their Republican Attorneys General Association — are currently suing BlackRock on alleged antitrust violations regarding its coal investments. The effort is being led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose top deputy bragged during a different panel that he threatened another big bank, Wells Fargo, into leaving the Net Zero Banking Alliance. (Texas had similarly threatened Bank of America’s bond business, until it dropped out of the climate coalition.) Even former Congressman Ken Buck, who was the ranking Republican on the Antitrust Subcommittee, thinks Paxton’s case against BlackRock is politically motivated “lawfare.”In May, Democrats in the Senate and House announced probes into the exodus of banks from major climate change initiatives. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, tells Rolling Stone: “We have apparent open admissions — straight from the mouths of fossil-fuel-funded Republican operatives and lawmakers — of their phony anti-ESG scheme and their calls for the ‘scalps’ of the banking executives who’ve warned about the systemic risks from climate change.”Facing increasingly costly legal backlash from Republican state officials in the Leo network, BlackRock has tried to mend fences with conservatives. In January 2024, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick detailed Fink’s moves to get back into his good graces, by lining up investors for new natural gas plants in the state’s power grid. That didn’t dissuade Paxton from launching the antitrust lawsuit against BlackRock last November.

Title: The risks and rewards of tokenization as crypto heavyweights push for it
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/07/21/crypto-tokenization/
Time Published: 2025-07-21T16:31:29Z
Full Content:
By ALAN SUDERMAN, Associated Press As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens. “Tokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,” said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France. Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors. But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century’s worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood’s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world’s most popular startups. The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time. The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast. She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television. “You used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,” Haun said. “You tune in at a specific time, you don’t get to choose your program, you couldn’t be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.” Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies. Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030. The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that’s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs — more than $123,000 on Monday — while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what’s been called the “golden age” for digital assets. Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said the biggest winners in the push for tokenization could be a small handful of exchanges like Robinhood that see their trading volumes and influence spike. “Which is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,” Reiners said. Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday. “Tokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace,” said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins. Securities law can be complex and even defining what is a security can be a hotly debated question, particularly in crypto. The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings of tokenized securities in 2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations of that country’s securities law. Under Trump, the SEC has taken a much less expansive view than the previous administration and dropped or paused litigation against crypto companies that the agency had previously accused of violating securities law. Hilary Allen, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law, said crypto companies have been emboldened by Trump’s victory to be more aggressive in pushing what they can offer. “The most pressing risk is (tokenization) being used as a regulatory arbitrage play as a way of getting around the rules,” she said. However, the SEC has struck a cautionary tone when it comes to tokens. Shortly after Robinhood’s announcement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has been an outspoken crypto supporter, issued a statement saying companies issuing tokenized stock should consider “their disclosure obligations” under federal law. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” Peirce said. One of the most closely watched areas of tokenization involves private companies, which aren’t subject to strict financial reporting requirements like publicly traded ones. Many hot startups are not going public as often as they used to and instead are increasingly relying on wealthy and institutional investors to raise large sums of money and stay private. That’s unfair to the little guy, say advocates of tokenization. “These are massive wealth generators for a very small group of rich, well-connected insiders who get access to these deals early,” said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. “Crypto has the power to solve this inequality.” But Robinhood’s giveaway of tokens meant to represent an investment in OpenAI immediately drew pushback from the company itself, which said it was not involved in Robinhood’s plan and did not endorse it. “Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer,” OpenAI said on social media. “Please be careful.” Public companies have strict public reporting requirements about their financial health that private companies don’t have to produce. Such reporting requirements have helped protect investors and give a legitimacy to the U.S. financial system, said Allen, who said the push for tokenized sales of shares in private companies is “eerily familiar” to how things played out before the creation of the SEC nearly a century ago. “Where we’re headed is where we were in the 1920s,” she said. “Door-to-door salesmen offering stocks and bonds, half of it had nothing behind it, people losing their life savings betting on stuff they didn’t understand.”

A new CoinShares report says "Ethereum stole the show," with institutional demand for the world's second cryptocurrency rising after solid price gains. Total inflows into ETH products stood at about $2.12 billion in the week to July 19, a huge influx considering the year-to-date total stands at about $6.2 billion. It's also close to double the previous record of $1.2 billion. The global figures also show that Bitcoin and Ethereum inflows were practically neck and neck as investors chase healthier returns. Bitcoin flows for the week hit nearly $2.2 billion. While BTC did hit a fresh all-time high of $123,000 last Monday, it's been relatively flat as altcoins enjoy a resurgence. ETH's price has jumped by 25% over the past week, and remains about $1,000 away from a record of $4,891 set in November 2021. According to CoinShares, digital asset investment products have now seen inflows for 14 weeks running, with total assets under management reaching $220 billion. The surge in popularity for ETH funds follows a pretty sluggish debut last summer. At the time, a report from crypto trading firm Wintermute warned "the absence of a staking mechanism" may diminish the appeal of ETFs launched by the likes of BlackRock. Recently, the BlackRock asked the SEC to reconsider allowing it to stake a portion of the ETH it holds in its iShares Ethereum Trust. This latest data also underlines how important institutional inflows have become to Bitcoin's value continuing to rise, with the biggest digital asset by market capitalization currently trading at $118,244 and down 2.8% on the week. Recent research from the London-based custody firm Copper shows BTC's price increases by an average of 1.8% for every 10,000 coins added to ETF holdings. While analysts noted that BTC ETFs have accumulated 165,000 coins since market lows back in April, they warned slower trading in the summer months may affect momentum.

Title: Hold On For Dear Life: This Bullish Bitcoin Metric Just Touched A 15-Year High

The percentage of Bitcoin’s long-term holders’ supply has reached a 15-year high, providing a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. Asset manager Ark Invest highlighted this development in a recent report and explained what this could mean for BTC going forward. According to the Ark Invest report, the long-term holders’ supply has reached 74% of Bitcoin’s total supply, marking a 15-year high for this metric. The asset manager noted that this trend indicates growing market conviction in BTC’s role as a store of value or “digital gold.” These long-term holders refer to addresses that have held for 155 days or longer. This development comes at a time when Bitcoin is witnessing massive demand from institutional investors through the ETFs and treasury companies. These investors are considered better ‘diamond-hands’ than retail investors, which means that this metric could keep rising, with long-term holders gaining more control of BTC’s total supply. This institutional buying has also driven the Bitcoin price to several all-time highs (ATHs) this year, with BTC reaching as high as $123,000 last week. The flagship crypto appears to still be in price discovery, as ETFs led by BlackRock and treasury companies, led by Saylor’s Strategy, continue to accumulate at an unprecedented pace. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest is ultra bullish on the Bitcoin price, predicting that it could reach $1.5 million by 2030. They expect BTC to reach this target due to the rising institutional investment and global recognition of Bitcoin’s ability to serve as a store of value. In a CNBC interview, Cathie Wood also doubled down on this prediction. She explained that they expect BTC to take a significant share from gold or grow the store of value market. Wood added that institutions are still just testing the waters despite the massive accumulation so far. As such, she still expects a rise in adoption for these companies. Meanwhile, only about 1 million unmined Bitcoins are remaining. The Ark Invest report also revealed that global liquidity per bitcoin reached a 12-year high. This metric reached this high with $5.7 million in global M2 supply per BTC in circulation. The asset manager remarked that this ratio could continue to rise given Bitcoin’s diminishing future supply growth and the continued expansion of global liquidity. Meanwhile, in June, Bitcoin managed to hold above the support between $96,000 and $99,000 and is now well above these levels. $98,888, $96,278, and $71,393 are BTC’s short-term holder cost basis, 200-day moving average, and on-chain mean, respectively, which is why this development is bullish for the flagship crypto. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $19,100, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: 'Please be careful.' There are risks and rewards as crypto heavyweights push tokenization
URL: https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/careful-risks-rewards-crypto-heavyweights-push-tokenization-123921661

The financial world is buzzing about tokenization, a process using blockchain to turn real-world assets like stocks or real estate into digital tokens As cryptocurrencies become more intertwined with the traditional financial system, industry heavyweights are racing for a long-sought goal of turning real-world assets into digital tokens. “Tokenization is going to open the door to a massive trading revolution,” said Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading platform Robinhood at a recent James Bond-themed tokenization launch event in the south of France. Advocates say tokenization is the next leap forward in crypto and can help break down walls that have advantaged the wealthy and make trading cheaper, more transparent and more accessible for everyday investors. But critics say tokenization threatens to undermine a century’s worth of securities law and investor protections that have made the U.S. financial system the envy of the world. And Robinhood’s push into tokenizing shares of private companies quickly faced pushback from one of the world’s most popular startups. The basic idea behind tokenization: Use blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to create digital tokens as stand-ins for things like bonds, real estate or even fractional ownership of a piece of art and that can be traded like crypto by virtually anyone, anywhere at any time. The massive growth of stablecoins, which are a type of cryptocurrency typically bought and sold for $1, has helped fuel the appetite to tokenize other financial assets, crypto venture capitalist Katie Haun said on a recent podcast. She said tokenization will upend investing in ways similar to how streamers radically changed how people watch television. “You used to have to sit there on a Thursday night and watch Seinfeld,” Haun said. “You tune in at a specific time, you don’t get to choose your program, you couldn’t be watching a program like Squid Games from Korea. Netflix was market-expanding. In the same way, I think the tokenization of real-world assets will be market expanding.” Robinhood began offering tokenized stock trading of major U.S. public companies for its European customers earlier this month and gave away tokens to some customers meant to represent shares in OpenAI and SpaceX, two highly valued private companies. Several other firms are diving in. Crypto exchange Kraken also allows customers outside the U.S. to trade tokenized stocks while Coinbase has petitioned regulators to open the market to its U.S. customers. Wall Street giants BlackRock and Franklin Templeton currently offer tokenized money market funds. McKinsey projects that tokenized assets could reach $2 trillion by 2030. The push for tokenization comes at a heady time in crypto, an industry that’s seen enormous growth from the creation and early development of bitcoin more than 15 years ago by libertarian-leaning computer enthusiasts to a growing acceptance in mainstream finance. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency is now regularly setting all-time highs — more than $123,000 on Monday — while other forms of crypto like stablecoins are exploding in use and the Trump administration has pledged to usher in what’s been called the “golden age” for digital assets. Lee Reiners, a lecturing fellow at Duke University, said the biggest winners in the push for tokenization could be a small handful of exchanges like Robinhood that see their trading volumes and influence spike. “Which is kind of ironic given the origins of crypto, which was to bypass intermediaries,” Reiners said. Interest in tokenization has also gotten a boost thanks to the election of President Donald Trump, who has made enacting more crypto-friendly regulations a top priority of his administration and signed a new law regulating stablecoins on Friday. “Tokenization is an innovation and we at the SEC should be focused on how do we advance innovation at the marketplace,” said Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins. Securities law can be complex and even defining what is a security can be a hotly debated question, particularly in crypto. The crypto exchange Binance pulled back offerings of tokenized securities in 2021 after German regulators raised questions about potential violations of that country’s securities law. Under Trump, the SEC has taken a much less expansive view than the previous administration and dropped or paused litigation against crypto companies that the agency had previously accused of violating securities law. Hilary Allen, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law, said crypto companies have been emboldened by Trump's victory to be more aggressive in pushing what they can offer. “The most pressing risk is (tokenization) being used as a regulatory arbitrage play as a way of getting around the rules,” she said. However, the SEC has struck a cautionary tone when it comes to tokens. Shortly after Robinhood’s announcement, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has been an outspoken crypto supporter, issued a statement saying companies issuing tokenized stock should consider “their disclosure obligations” under federal law. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” Peirce said. One of the most closely watched areas of tokenization involves private companies, which aren’t subject to strict financial reporting requirements like publicly traded ones. Many hot startups are not going public as often as they used to and instead are increasingly relying on wealthy and institutional investors to raise large sums of money and stay private. That’s unfair to the little guy, say advocates of tokenization. “These are massive wealth generators for a very small group of rich, well-connected insiders who get access to these deals early,” said Robinhood executive Johann Kerbrat. “Crypto has the power to solve this inequality.” But Robinhood’s giveaway of tokens meant to represent an investment in OpenAI immediately drew pushback from the company itself, which said it was not involved in Robinhood’s plan and did not endorse it. “Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer,” OpenAI said on social media. “Please be careful.” Public companies have strict public reporting requirements about their financial health that private companies don’t have to produce. Such reporting requirements have helped protect investors and give a legitimacy to the U.S. financial system, said Allen, who said the push for tokenized sales of shares in private companies is “eerily familiar” to how things played out before the creation of the SEC nearly a century ago. “Where we’re headed is where we were in the 1920s,” she said. “Door-to-door salesmen offering stocks and bonds, half of it had nothing behind it, people losing their life savings betting on stuff they didn’t understand.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Pantera-backed The Ether Machine set for Nasdaq debut, targets $1.6B raise
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/ether-machine-nasdaq-raise/
Time Published: 2025-07-21T12:28:38Z

Share this article The Ether Machine, a newly established firm backed by a group of top-tier institutional, crypto-native, and strategic investors, announced Monday its plans to go public on Nasdaq, targeting over $1.6 billion in gross proceeds to build “the largest public Ether generation company.” The Ether Machine is set to trade under the ticker “ETHM” via a business combination with Dynamix Corporation. At launch, the company expects to hold more than 400,000 ETH on its balance sheet. The deal includes a $645 million anchor investment from co-founder and chairman Andrew Keys, representing 169,984 ETH, along with over $800 million in committed capital from backers including Pantera Capital, Kraken, and Blockchain.com “The Ether Machine provides secure, liquid access to Ether – the digital oil that is powering the next era of the digital economy,” said Keys in a statement. “We have assembled a team of ‘Ethereum Avengers’ to actively manage and unlock yields to levels we believe will be market-leading for investors.” The company’s leadership team includes CEO David Merin, former head of corporate development at Consensys, and CTO Tim Lowe, a pioneer in Ethereum staking and institutional blockchain infrastructure. The Ether Machine emphasizes that it isn’t a passive ETH holder like an ETF or treasury, but an actively managed vehicle for institutions to access Ethereum, earn ETH-denominated yield, and participate directly in the ecosystem. The company plans to generate returns through staking, restaking, and decentralized finance strategies. “ETH is the backbone of the digital economy,” explained the team. “It settles $14T+ per year, anchors over $130B in stablecoins, and secures the majority of DeFi activity across the ecosystem. It’s not just a token, it’s collateral, fuel, and native yield.” “ETH generates real yield through staking. It’s burned with usage, making it deflationary.

How wise is it to blast out threats of nuclear war almost non-stop? The financial investment advisory guru, Martin Armstrong, has just issued another such warning to the world: 100% Chance of Nuclear War – Martin Armstrong | Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog, by Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com. Six weeks ago, legendary financial and geopolitical cycle analyst Martin Armstrong was signaling a big turn toward war. Now, Armstrong says, “The chances of war with a nuclear exchange is at 100%. . .. Plan on it, this is coming.” The continuous yelling “Wolf” is obnoxious in many ways, because it has the intention to bring fear to the people, to make them morally weak, as they are afraid. The long-term effect is that people do not believe the warning anymore, even if and when it could become true. Which it will not. In the case of Armstrong, who introduces his reputation by pretending having predicted every major (financial) crisis in the past, it may have to do with attracting investors into the war industry or any associated high-yielding investments. In any case, I dare say, scaring people without any solid evidence, i.e., “The chances of war with a nuclear exchange is at 100%. . .. Plan on it, this is coming,” is outright criminal. Fear achieves making people submissive, obedient, as they are afraid of authorities, of the unknown their beloved authorities may bring and so they give in against their own interests. In the case of yelling “nuclear war is coming,” people suddenly turn to NATO for fake security, as they believe war will bring them Peace. Armstrong is part of the “controlled opposition”, though not much opposition is seen, just aberrant warnings. He may get his instructions from the Deep State – or some military industrial monster. Who knows, maybe NATO. See this for Armstrong’s full article and “100% nuclear warning.” NATO is the world’s largest and most dangerous war and killing machine. Wars and conflicts initiated or participated in by NATO have caused at least 30 to 35 million deaths since its creation in 1949. People are so scared that they lose reason and act not only against their own interests, but against the interests of the world at large. This phenomenon of senselessness and mindlessness has been well-studied and softly propagated by Tavistock, the world’s foremost social and mind engineering institute based in the UK, and illustrated in George Orwell’s book “1984”, where logic was turned upside down, literally into War is Peace and Peace is War. When recently President Trump bombed Iran, he said something to the effect, he hopes his bombing of Iran will lead to lasting Peace. And surely, more than a handful people believed him. Worse, NATO, sort of abandoned by the US, is becoming a European “force de frappe” where every country is investing their resources, stretching to huge debt, into armament, into the war industry and mostly the US weapons manufacturers because they are not (yet) very important in Europe. The head of NATO, who has been put in his position by Washington and the World Economic Forum (WEF), will make sure that the US, inventor and creator of NATO (in April 1949, in Washington DC), also benefits from the European fear and war machine. All means are good to create fear and submissiveness. It is one of the first steps towards full enslavement and tyranny. Armstrong and his ilk are just one “civilian” branch. More important are all those European heads of government, implanted, literally with fake elections, all trained by the WEF’s Academy for Young Global Leaders (YGL), and the chief backers of the WEF. They include US and international financial institutions, such as BlackRock, Vanguard and StateStreet – and others, lesser-known financial interests – all eventually leading to the City of London, an independent enclave within London, where most if not all, of the financial and economic manipulations originate. And guess who controls the City of London? Yes, you are right. Those people who are not to be mentioned, lest you are ready to be prosecuted for discriminatory remarks. The current Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, former Dutch Prime Minister, is one of them, a WEF YGL. He makes sure that the 30 European NATO members (the other two are the US and Canada) – most of them also European Union members, follow the trend of War is Peace and Peace is War – as a doctrine that after one or two generations can hardly be erased from the minds of the populace at large. The US has a 1.3 trillion dollar budget foreseen just to renew and build up their nuclear arsenal by 2035. The EU wants a trillion euros military budget by 2030, literally to go to war with Russia. This is openly said by Madame Ursula Von der Leyen, unelected President of the European Commission (EC). All this is made public to scare you. Or does anyone really believe that European leaders are so stupid to plan a nuclear war that may wipe them out as well? As Fidel Castro already said (see this) and many before and after him, including President Putin, a nuclear war is unpredictable and has no winners. What leader in his most submissive mode wants really to wipe out himself, his children, grandchildren, and his loved ones? This sounds like a camouflaged suicide pact. And frankly the world is not quite there yet. So, People and Humanity of this world, stay away from this war propaganda. Think for yourself. Think in the first place Peace, always Peace and Harmony. War has no place in such a scenario, in a world of peaceful cohabitation. You may be amazed to know about the hidden, invisible power of your mind, how it can shape the future, a future that we, The People, choose on our own and step away from what an unnamed elite pretends to choose for the good of Us. Our spirituality is the most powerful means towards harmonious cohabitation we have. Use it. Open your eyes and ears and act for your and humanity’s interests of Peace and harmonious and prosperous togetherness. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: The Impact of the Collapse of Neoliberalism on Global Geopolitics and Türkiye. “The U.S. is No longer a Super Power”. Admiral Cem Gürdeniz
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/impact-collapse-neoliberalism-global-geopolitics-turkiye/5895577
Time Published: 2025-07-21T12:15:12Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump‘s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which includes $5 trillion in public spending submitted to Congress, was approved by a 51–50 vote in the Senate on July 1, 2025, thanks to a vote by Vice President J.D. Vance, and became law on July 4. This law is directly related to the collapse of neoliberalism. Neoliberalism, which is the carrier of the system in the post-Cold War period, has worked through tools such as globalization, deregulation, and financialization. However, the pandemic, energy wars, supply chain issues and geopolitical tensions have ushered in a period in which the state is back on the scene. Contrary to the “small state” mentality at the core of neoliberalism, Trump is increasing public investment and borrowing with $5 trillion in spending, and he is promoting “statist” policies with subsidies for defense, infrastructure and industry. This development shows that market discipline has given way to voter satisfaction. Neoliberalism, especially after 1980, led to a disproportionate power of finance capital. In 2024, the world economy is $110 trillion, while financial derivatives total $730 trillion. That is seven times the real economy. For example, for 100 million barrels of oil consumption, six billion barrels of virtual trade are returning. These financial assets are mostly controlled by U.S. banks, BlackRock, the Soros Foundation, Rothschild & Co, Palantir and the City of London etc. financial giants. This structure wants neoliberalism to continue. However, the U.S. administration aims to return to industry, promote production and reduce dependency like the Chinese model. The new law emphasizes the visible power of the state and becomes a symbol of the post-neoliberal era. Instead of shrinking the state and growing the economy, strategic economy and strong state are preferred. Major crises have always enlarged the state rather than the market. Today, in the West, too, the state has returned not only as a regulator, but also as an investor, a directive and, when necessary, an aggressive actor. After the OPEC crisis in the 1970s, the effectiveness of Keynesian policies declined. These crises accelerated the shift towards neoliberal policies in the United States and the United Kingdom. Neoliberalism, which rose under the leadership of Thatcher and Reagan in the 1980s, reached its strongest form until the 1990s with the free market, privatization, deregulation, financialization and globalization. In the aftermath of the Cold War, neoliberalism set the economic and political groundwork for three generations with the promise of globalization and democratization. Although initially offering temporary successes such as economic growth, neoliberal policies have in the long run deepened inequality, weakened social safety nets, and set the stage for the 2008 global crisis. Neoliberal policies have eroded the middle class, led to an unprecedented concentration of wealth at the top, and an unprecedented injustice in income distribution. In 2024, 45-50% of the world’s wealth was in the hands of the richest 1%. The five richest people had more wealth than 3.5 billion people combined. After the pandemic, the wealth of the rich 1% increased by more than $34 trillion. Neoliberalism has been deliberately promoted by big business and financial elites. Free trade agreements have weakened workers’ rights and strengthened multinational corporations. Low taxes and limited social spending worked in favor of capital. The deregulation of financial centers led to crises such as 2008. This process undermined the claim that the market would be self-regulating; State interventions have become inevitable. After 2008, while the big banks were bailed out, people lost their jobs and homes, which created anger and insecurity. In the process combined with COVID-19, supply chain shocks and the Russia-Ukraine war, the neoliberal model has become questionable not only economically, but also politically and geopolitically. Inequalities, polarization and security threats constituted the fundamental ruptures that led to the end of neoliberalism. At the height of neoliberalism in the 1990s and early 2000s, it was believed that every problem would be solved by the invisible hand of the market, that states would remain in the background, and that technocrats would find rational solutions to everything. However, after 2008, the opposite transformation took place. Countries that were supposed to develop with IMF prescriptions were left in debt, and the Western middle class, which believed that everything would become cheaper with free trade, became poorer. As the market collapsed, a political climate emerged that sanctified the state, prioritized the national interest, and said “my property, my security, my data.” Image: Friedrich Hayek (CC BY-SA 3.0) While populism and protectionism were the counterpart of globalization in the West, China and Russia in the East came to the fore with geopolitical moves that declared the legitimacy of the statist model. The golden age of globalization has begun to fade in the shadow of nation-states. Companies have shortened their supply chains governments have made self-sufficiency a priority in strategic areas. Major economies have declared economic security as part of national security. While there was a crisis in every field from masks to chips during the pandemic period, the West abandoned its globalist identity overnight and turned to nationalism. Even the IMF has started to support public investment and social spending after the pandemic. Policies that used to be criticized as “protectionism” were brought to the fore. Hayek and Friedman, the fathers of neoliberalism, may not have aimed at these outcomes directly, their vision was based on the ideal of individual freedom. However, this ideal turned into an order that opened up unlimited space for the owners of capital. This, in turn, increased social and political instability, paving the way for the rise of populism and authoritarian tendencies. Neoliberalism appears to have collapsed ideologically, but it still retains its political influence. But state ownership is getting stronger. Expropriation in areas such as water, energy and transportation is on the agenda again. While the role of the state is gaining importance again with inflation and crises, discussions on the transition to the public model are spreading, even if democratic-socialist alternatives do not reach the hegemonic level. Leaders like Trump are abandoning the free market and turning to pro-capitalist nationalist policies. This indicates that neoliberal norms are being replaced by authoritarian and protectionist models. Social democrats are also discussing more egalitarian, publicist economic models. China’s model of state capitalism and non-Western development paths are gaining legitimacy. Western-centered finance capitalism is being replaced by a hybrid structure in which state capitalism, digital surveillance, and technological control are intertwined. While this process continues, the US and the EU, backed by the power of finance capital, still claim global leadership, but China is getting closer to its goal of becoming the new center in technology and the financial system. Countries such as Russia, India, Brazil and South Africa put their cards on the table. The increasing resistance to the US in the Global South and the alternative systems developed by China with digital payment systems are shaking the hegemony of the dollar. Although Trump has tried to put pressure on BRICS countries with tariffs between 10% and 40%, it is a remarkable result that only three agreements have emerged from the negotiations with 90 countries. Although Trump attacked it with great contempt, BRICS, which represents a population of 3.5 billion, reached 11 full members with the latest enlargement. At the same time, 69% of the trade between the 11 countries is carried out outside the US dollar. On the other hand, global supply chains are polarized with new options. Energy markets are fragmenting. For example, new energy-mining cartels are forming between Russia, China, the Middle East and Africa. The fragmentation of globalization is turning transportation and energy lines into an area of competition and conflict. Transportation projects such as the Belt and Road, the Middle Corridor, the North-South and IMEC are turning into military and ideological fields rather than economic. Rare metals are becoming the dominant commodity in the geopolitical struggle with the role played by oil at the beginning of the 20th century. On the other hand, institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO, the bastions of neoliberalism, are being dragged into a crisis of legitimacy. Regional currencies, bilateral trade, and alternative financial systems are on the rise. As the ideal of the “global citizen” recedes, nationalism and sovereignty return to the center of politics. Divisions within the EU are creating a post-Brexit domino effect. The free-market discourse is being rewritten, this time with government funding, subsidies and digital supervision. However, what remains unchanged in essence is the continued capacity of capital, which has a foam of 730 trillion dollars, to concentrate power and produce inequality. In the new era, global standards and institutions are weakening, and local rules and bilateral agreements are coming to the fore. Many countries trade in their own currencies. For example, even Egypt, which is under pressure from Israel and the United States, can switch to China’s CIPS system instead of the US-controlled international money transfer system SWIFT. Neoliberalism was imposed not only as an economic model, but as a kind of geopolitical ideology. Because the promise of this ideology was: “The world will become a single market, countries will produce prosperity from competition, borders will lose their importance.” In a world where the United States and the collective west are hegemons, this economic ideology has been added to the American geopolitics of the belt and the sea. After the 1980s, neoliberalism achieved global dominance through globalization under the protection of the US dollar, American military power, alliance system, and military bases. The end of the Cold War with the victory of the United States and the collapse of the communist bloc led the representatives of the US neocons and finance capital to the establishment of the New American Century, including the security geopolitics of Israel. The expansion of neoliberalism was aimed with imperialist initiatives such as post-modern colonies, access to unlimited resources, the formation of new markets, and the Greater Middle East and North Africa Project. As Yugoslavia disintegrated, the United States encouraged the prolongation of the civil war to intervene in Europe and prove that American military power was indispensable for Europe. Thus, with the end of the Cold War, the disintegration of Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia and then Yugoslavia was achieved in the first decade. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the EU’s independent military identity has been weakened, while NATO’s expansion has been ensured in line with the process of containment and disintegration of Russia. NATO was promoted from 16 to 32 members. NATO was used in Afghanistan even though it had no area of authority and responsibility. The post-September 11, 2001, Global War on Terror paradigm and the civil wars and occupations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen not only brought death and destruction, but also initiated unprecedented mass refugee flows to many countries, especially in Europe. In short, the geopolitics of neoliberalism combined with American and Israeli geopolitics brought chaos, instability and death to the whole world. In this process, wars such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria were not won but were continued uncessantly. The interventions were created not for victory, but to feed the defense industry and lobbies. The endless wars of the United States today are still determined not by national interests, but by the interests of finance capital and the military-industrial complex. Neoliberalism was the global order of exploitation shaped by the finance capital world, intertwined with the US and the EU, in the triangle of the IMF, the World Bank and NATO. This order is collapsing, and the hegemony’s response to this collapse is taking place with a great reckoning in the geopolitical arena. This process is taking place with provoked proxy wars and hybrid wars. While economic wars are waged with embargoes, sudden tax/tariff increases, seizures of competitors’ assets in banks, sanctions, exclusion operations from financial systems such as SWIFT, cyber-attacks, data theft, blocking access to rare metals and the technological war continues with the technology embargo. On the other hand, psychological warfare through media manipulation, spreading fake news, and creating perceptions with reverse flag operations continues to be an important front of the hybrid war. While proxy wars and crises continue in Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, Yemen, Libya, Iran and Israel, the risk of conflict in Moldova, Kaliningrad, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Serbia and Kosovo is rising. The strategy of the Trump era, which stood against neoliberalism and globalization but could not resist Israel and the Zionist structure, was to bring Russia closer to the West and cut it off from China. This strategy was opposed by Britain, an island state. In the struggle between Trump’s MAGA group and the globalists, British influence prevailed, using the Zionist lobby, and Trump backed down. Therefore, Trump’s strategy of rapprochement with Russia has failed, on the contrary, the Sino-Russian alliance has strengthened. From the beginning, China saw Russia’s defeat as a threat to its own existence. Because if Russia is defeated and disintegrated, Eurasia will be torn apart. On the other hand, after 2001, the U.S. turned into a proxy for finance capital and Zionism rather than a protector of its own interests. The aggressive foreign policy of the United States has led to the emergence of a global counter-alliance led by Iran, China and Russia. The U.S., Israel, and the collective West initially thought that states such as Iran, China, and Russia would give up easily. Washington’s geopolitical mistakes have led to a permanent change in the global order. The situation made by Russia, US and EU strategists before 2022 proved the opposite. It has now become clear that Russia, which sees NATO’s expansion to the east as an existential threat, will oppose the scenarios that the collective West will provoke not only with Ukraine but also with other scenarios unless its own geopolitical guarantees are met in the new period. Russia, whose hand has become stronger in Ukraine, will not stop until Ukraine surrenders unconditionally. China, on the other hand, will not allow Taiwan to turn into an American base 60 miles away, like NATO’s expansion. Taiwan is to China what Cuba is to the United States. The decline of the USA in every field, especially its drift into a position of succumbing to Israel’s blackmail, has eliminated its characteristics of being the center of attraction and determining the rules. To this day, all empires have collapsed when they expanded beyond their capabilities and retreated for wars they could not sustain. Today, the United States faces three major and important competitors at the same time. It is in an active struggle against Russia in Ukraine, Iran in the Middle East, and China in the Pacific. These three fronts are pushing the United States, which is already polarized at home and has come to a civil war environment, beyond its capacity. Another reason for this situation has to do with military power. In particular, the decline in military logistics integration based on production power, the inadequacy of shipbuilding capacity is challenging the USA. The stocks for long-range attack and critical air defense missiles stocks are diminishing to the levels of not in months, to the weeks and days. The two most important examples of this vulnerability can be given with Trump’s withdrawal in the face of the Yemeni Houthis and the offer of a ceasefire to Iran with the mediation of the United States after Israel’s failure to stop Iranian attacks during the 12-day Iran-Israel war. On the other hand, NATO is not only weakened in terms of conventional power but also faces serious constraints and challenges in its decision-making process. It is almost impossible for 32 members to reach full unanimous agreement on any issue. China and Russia have much more sustainable combat readiness, decision-making and combat capabilities. This situation increases the transformation of protracted wars such as the Ukraine crisis into a war of attrition and the risk of the use of nuclear weapons. On the other hand, today’s ongoing wars and economic arm wrestling are radically changing the geopolitical distribution of power. Rather than classical polarization, the new system has become a multi-faceted but fragile, semi-complex (chaotic) structure in which centers compete. In addition to traditional global power centers such as the USA, the EU, China and Russia, regional powers such as India, Iran, Türkiye, Brazil and Saudi Arabia are now also involved in the game as actors. It can be said that we are at a historical turning point for the world in this emerging picture. Today, U.S. foreign policy is shaped by “neocon” ideology and powerful interest lobbies (especially the Israel lobby). The geopolitical picture that will emerge in the new multipolar world model will depend on the decision of the aggressive neocon and Zionist camp of the USA. By turning to internal reforms, Washington can abandon the era of constant wars and provocations and choose the path of compromise and choose a path that respects the balance of power and does not encourage war, like the cold war era. Or it can persist on the current path and risk a major war between the great powers, which would increase the risk of the use of nuclear weapons. Israel occupies a special place in this equation. With its narrow geography, its small population but its ability to operate with secret services, military and special forces far beyond its power, and most importantly, its unruly destruction power even if it commits crimes amounting to genocide, it maintains the feature of being the mafia state of the USA and the EU, or rather the financial capital world. However, the country is in a state of serious polarization and economic crisis. Netanyahu’s strategy of perpetual war to stay in power is in fact darkening Israel’s future. While a state of perpetual war is profitable for both the defense industry and finance capital, it has devastating implications for the long-term security and prosperity of the United States too. In this context, Netanyahu’s geopolitical faits accompli to the United States cause the new world order to be established in an uncontrolled mess instead of a controllable one. In this context, the difficulties faced by Israel and the United States, especially in the last four days of the 12-day war with Iran, did not go unnoticed by the whole world. Israel’s planned strategy of “one-shot destruction” has failed. The U.S.-Israeli attacks have increased Iran’s resilience. This situation strengthened the front of resistance against the US-led hegemony. In short, the new period can be called a period of multipolar chaos in which no bloc can fully dominate and revolves around the “fragile alliances” established by regional powers with short-term interests. In this environment, markets struggle to find confidence; Investments are limited by regional stability. Economic growth slows down, financial crises become more frequent and unpredictable. In this respect, in the new period we have entered, blocs based on temporary cooperation, fragile alliances, friendships and in short, chaos are now the new normal. In this environment, transport and energy corridors, financial systems and digital infrastructures have become strategic fronts. Under these conditions, we can talk about four different geopolitical fronts. While the Western Bloc consists of the USA, the EU, the UK, Israel and Japan; China, Russia, Iran, Belarus and North Korea are blocs in Eurasia. While India, Brazil and South Africa are emerging in the Global South, Türkiye (although act in accordance with the US, Britain and Israel), Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Mexico are also emerging as independent regional powers. In addition to these developments, the geopolitical advantage of the United States decreases as the blocs become stronger, and the Washington Consensus loses its meaning. BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the EU’s quest for strategic autonomy, and the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries’ own visions are now taking their place against the USA. In this period of turmoil, we can say that China and Russia have long-term, patient and deep strategies. To break this resistance, the Collective West continues its psychological warfare and various conspiracies and provocations, but it is failing day by day. . Members, Partners and Outreach invitees on the sidelines of 17th BRICS Summit at Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil on July 07, 2025. (GODL India) . The fact that the U.S. is losing power and standing by Israel, which has committed war crimes amounting to genocide, encourages these organizations and states to act in their own interests. On the other hand, Trump’s ego-driven tariff war is destroying the credibility of the United States. The collapse of the global free market is creating new power vacuums, especially in Africa, Central Asia and South America. These gaps trigger proxy wars and regional rivalries. In this environment of real uncertainty and confusion, the era of military alliances and bilateral military cooperation agreements on which traditional military blocs, especially US hegemony, are based, is entering a new phase. Many countries, especially NATO members, which have felt themselves under the assurance of the USA until today, are redefining their national security and defense industries and focusing on national production. The fact that England and France on July 10 and Germany and Britain on July 17, 2025 signed the nuclear cooperation and defense agreements are clear proofs that NATO provides a security guarantee on paper. In short, even in the collective west, the policy of self-sufficiency in security comes to the fore. Today, the new state-controlled nationalism and protectionism in technology, defense and digital infrastructure are becoming the new normal. The wars of the new era are not only military, but also have technological, intelligence and psychological dimensions. Strategic autonomy, national defense and geopolitical awareness come to the fore in state administration. As in the cases of Syria and Iran, the collapse of countries’ air defense systems becomes a necessary condition for regime change, occupation and psychological warfare. Electronic warfare and intelligence-backed sabotage, unorthodox tactics that create an asymmetrical effect replace the classic military intervention. Especially after what happened in the Ukraine, Russia and Israel-Iran conflict, Russia-China-Iran cooperation against the collective West and Israel has become an existential necessity on the axis of air defense and cyber security. The United States is no longer a superpower. The U.S. doesn’t produce, it lives on debt, but the post-1991 power psychology persists, while it is weak and polarized. In this context, social resistance and resilience are very low. Young people, in particular, are questioning the US administration’s unconditional support for Israel. The prohibition of defending Palestine through fascistic measures pushes the young population to oppose Israel. 50% of the population opposes military aid to Israel. In short, its military, economic and strategic capacity has been weakened. They are still weak in the face of the continental powers with the old doctrines focused on sea-air power. Even in the field of maritime power, where it is the strongest, US is in a serious decline against China. While the new world order is evolving into a multipolar form, the old hegemon is trying to start wars and redesign borders in the last stage to gain an advantageous position in the new order. Even if it cannot afford this, it is at least striving to wear down and encircle Russia and China with the chaos and provocations it creates, and at the same time to achieve Israel’s geopolitical goals. In this context, the world is rapidly moving towards a major catastrophe, including the risk of nuclear war. The Ukraine War is no longer just a regional conflict. It has turned into an existential struggle between the West (US-NATO) and the China-Russia axis. The problem is that there are no wise and virtuous leaders who can avert this catastrophe. Today, the most fundamental problem of the NATO states and the countries in the US club is that although they were elected, these leaders came to power with the facilitation of the establishment under the guidance of the Zionist lobby, strong intelligence and secret services, especially in the USA. Today, many of them are personalities raised by the global financial capital system. Decision-making in Washington is dominated by populism, ignorance and vested interests. Leaders like Trump make decisions based on marketing and image management, not strategic knowledge. These weaknesses are dragging the U.S. into both economic collapse at home and uncontrolled conflicts abroad. None of those in charge in the US and the EU have strategic depth. Leaders only know how to win elections. Foreign policy, on the other hand, is guided by lobbies and consultants. Today, in Europe, which prides itself on being the cradle of democracy, the leaders that the people want and tend to are neutralized either by conspiracies or by legal coups (e.g., France, Germany, Romania). Elected leaders turn their countries into a tool or even extras used at the disposal of finance capital, especially the USA, and make decisions against the will of the people. The peoples of the EU countries are being dragged into the continuation of the Ukraine-Russia war for the EU administration under the command of US geopolitics and finance capital, because of which they face expensive energy, deindustrialization and refugee flows, in the final analysis, they become impoverished and ready for a social explosion. Those who come to power with the will of the people are also faced with the punishment of finance capital in a short time and their countries are forced to go bankrupt. (Example, Syriza Party and Greece) Another problem is that the secret services act against the will of the government. In particular, the operations carried out by the CIA, MI6 and Mossad in the field are often out of control, indicating that democratic control mechanisms are weakening. This carries the risk of unpredictable crises because of reverse flag operations, and small events turning into big wars. Most importantly, there is a risk that the United States will resort to war to get out of the economic crisis, as it has done in history. The same option was applied by Britain in 1914 at the beginning of the First World War. The most fundamental factor that prevents this risk, that is, a global world war, is that we are in the era of nuclear power. In short, as the American century comes to an end, the world is moving towards either a controlled division of spheres of influence or a period of chaos that will continue with instability and endless wars. In both scenarios, there are serious pitfalls as well as historical opportunities for many countries. It is very important to be on the right side here. Being indecisive is the most dangerous. Either the US hegemony, which desires the continuation of the old exploitation order in the new period, or the decision to take part in the resistance front that resists it is getting closer day by day. The multi-front crisis spiral that the U.S. has fallen into means both a threat and an opportunity for Türkiye at the same time. In this new conjuncture, rapidly moving away from the unipolar security approach. It is now inevitable to develop multifaceted diplomacy, alternative alliances and independent defense capacity. In this new era, while the traditional superpowers are weakening, old alliances are disintegrating, and new blocs are emerging. In such a situation, a realistic, flexible and national interest-oriented strategy for Türkiye is no longer a choice, but a necessity. Although Türkiye’s NATO membership continues to offer an advantage on paper, excessive dependence on this alliance leads to strategic blindness, and the development of alternative security mechanisms becomes an irrevocable necessity. Today we are in a transitional period in which neoliberalism is beginning to unravel, the major ideological and economic theses have collapsed, but the rules of the new order have not yet been written. In this interim period, countries such as Türkiye will either remain a passive figure in the order established by others, or they will rise to the role of playmaker by building their own strategic architecture. The path to this choice is clear: institutionalized state mind, science-technology and human resources investments based on merit and virtue, social consensus and building resilient structures in the secular, democratic nation-state model. While the global legitimacy of neoliberal ideology has collapsed, the struggles for power and wealth have not ended. And it won’t. The scene has changed, the actors have diversified, and the rules are still waiting to be written. Who will be the rule-maker in this uncertain game will shape the future. As the unipolar world comes to an end, the necessity for Türkiye to recover its domestic front, to form an independent strategic mind, to develop multifaceted cooperation and its own defense capability is more pressing than ever. However, Türkiye’s current orientation cannot respond to this need with both the government and the opposition. The current foreign policy line, guided by the US, the UK, the EU and NATO, contradicts our historical principles of independence. In the case of Syria, the approach of being a tool for proxy wars should be abandoned and regional strategies should be created that focus directly on Türkiye’s security. Today, Türkiye is experiencing a new version of the Tanzimatist orientation that began in 1946 with the abandonment of Ataturk’s independent, non-aligned foreign policy line. At that time, the identity of the United States as a war winner and its economic power were the center of attraction. Not today. However, Türkiye is still pursuing this collapsing order and trying to implement the prescriptions written in western capitals. Moreover, this process has dangerous consequences in domestic politics. The vision of Neo-Ottomanism guided by the American Ambassador, weakens the unifying power of Turkish identity with the separation of ummah and nation, and threatens the secular, nation-state structure with new constitution discussions. The PKK’s political legitimacy by ignoring its terror past causes great wounds in the conscience of the people. While the 5% contribution of water and agriculturally rich Southeastern Anatolia to the Turkish economy shows the strategic importance of this region in the future, it is a vital necessity that every constitutional amendment to be made is shaped by the support of the people. Otherwise, this process may turn into a “honey trap” and destabilize Türkiye. Similar weaknesses are observed in foreign policy. Due to the scandalous wrong policies pursued in Syria, we have now become de facto border neighbor with Israel. Drilling and seismic surveys have been suspended in the Blue Homeland since November 2020. Such geopolitical adventures could put our homeland, such as Southeastern Anatolia, at risk. The Republic of Türkiye was founded after a great war of independence. Thousands of martyrs were lost for the sake of these lands and borders. Now, we are expected to be extras in the scenario of a “puppet Kurdish state with access to the sea” drawn by the US and Israel. This is unacceptable. Türkiye, as a medium-sized power, should strengthen its strategic position based on flexible diplomacy, regional leadership and institutional effectiveness. The biggest threat today is being open to foreign interventions due to internal political polarization, lack of strategic vision, and institutional weakness. Instead of blindly trusting the U.S., it is essential for Türkiye to develop independent reflexes. In military policy, it should focus on its own security priorities rather than being a tool of the United States’ interest-oriented wars. Diplomatically, the opportunities offered by alternative structures such as BRICS should be evaluated. Israel should be reacted to not only with words, but also with deeds (such as the closure of the Kürecik base and the cessation of the flow of oil in the BTC Line). Economically, resilient structures should be built that will not be affected by US-centered crises. The strategic mind, on the other hand, should not be rote but realistic, cool-headed and agile. Türkiye’s tactical and strategic air defense should be completed in a short time with national resources. Based on military cooperation with Russia and China, long-range hypersonic ballistic missile technology should be developed as soon as possible. The Kaan Fighter Jet project should be prioritized and our air power should be renewed. Emphasis should be placed on strengthening our submarine fleet, which is Türkiye’s greatest deterrent force, with the MILDEN project, the resources allocated to surface power should be transferred to the strengthening of our submarine fleet, and Türkiye’s full control of the underwater in the Eastern Mediterranean should be guaranteed as a basis. In this context, all kinds of measures should be taken to start mass production of AKYA, the heavy torpedo for our submarines. It should be considered that our electronic warfare and cyber defense infrastructure is established, and that the software, communication and GPS infrastructure, which we are dependent on the West and Israel, are backed up with Chinese and Russian systems while nationalizing. Türkiye is entering a very difficult period with a fragmented domestic front. The geopolitical blindness of the opposition and the government in the Blue Homeland, the TRNC and our Southeast make new geopolitical suicides inevitable. Military hospitals are closed, military high schools are closed, military academies are not affiliated with the Forces. The material and moral dimensions of the damage to our armed forces caused by FETÖ, or rather by the CIA, MI6, BND and Mossad, with the internal collaborators are indescribable. In such a conjuncture, Türkiye is trying to move away from the nation-state, unitary structure and secularism step by step under the guidance of the USA and Britain. While most of the people are overwhelmingly loyal to Atatürk, the republic and its basic principles, it is not possible to understand the minority’s desire for geopolitical and regime changes in good faith. Despite declining American hegemony and collapsing neoliberalism, acting in accordance with the religious and ethnic dividing policies they love so much, is tantamount to heading the iceberg on the Titanic bridge when you know she will sink. Neither the power of the Turkish nation nor its glorious history will agree to this course. There is no other course of salvation than the Kemalist prescription written by Atatürk 100 years ago. I hope that it will be possible for our state and nation to see this fact before it hits the bottom. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Bitcoin price to hit $917,000 by next cycle from combined institutional predictions

Looking at all institutional Bitcoin predictions being made right now. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Following a new all-time high in dollars, Bitcoin price predictions are flooding in alongside diverging institutional theses, ranging from macro-driven valuations to long-tail adoption models. A wave of bold projections from six to nine figures with disparate assumptions underpinning each outlook. With predictions varying across time frames from this year to 2030, the table below shows a breakdown of the average Bitcoin price targets currently being forecast. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently reiterated her thesis that Bitcoin could reach $2.4 million by the decade’s end. Wood cited growing institutional demand and BTC’s monetary properties as foundational to ARK’s model. While the $2.4 million target represents the upper band, ARK has previously outlined a range starting in the low six figures, with a $1.5 million milestone for 2027. Wood’s forecasts are based partly on modeling Bitcoin as a reserve asset replacing allocations to gold and specific sovereign debt instruments, contingent on accelerating institutional flows. Financial advisor Ric Edelman, whose firm DACFP advocates for crypto education among fiduciaries, offered a comparatively moderate $500,000 target by 2030. Edelman framed the target within a 10-40% portfolio allocation to digital assets, positioning Bitcoin as a long-duration asset in a world of declining fiat confidence. While his range is narrower than Wood’s, it is similarly predicated on rising institutional allocation and constrained supply mechanics. MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, a persistent advocate for institutional Bitcoin exposure, reaffirmed his long-held belief that passive capital reallocations alone could drive Bitcoin past $1 million. This month, Saylor emphasized the scale of allocators entering ETF channels, which he characterized as irreversible demand flows. This view treats Bitcoin as an apex monetary asset attracting capital in flight from inflation-hedging instruments. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink provided a looser band, offering a projected price window between $500,000 and $700,000 without anchoring to a specific timeframe. Fink’s comments align with BlackRock’s positioning in the ETF market and reflect confidence in regulatory clarity and institutional integration. Fink’s range assumes gradual accumulation of Bitcoin as a treasury or reserve asset, enabled by frictionless financial products. Bank-led projections have trended toward shorter-term outlooks. Standard Chartered’s head of FX and digital assets, Geoff Kendrick, issued a target of $200,000 by the end of 2025. The thesis is grounded in ETF flow momentum, halving forces, and macro hedge demand. Similarly, Bernstein analysts raised their 2025 target to $200,000, citing robust ETF inflows. Both forecasts anchor to post-ETF regime trends and treat 2024’s halving as a catalyst rather than a lagging event. On the more extreme end, Fidelity last year projected a $1 billion valuation per coin by 2038. This extreme target is grounded in network adoption curve analogies, positioning Bitcoin as a potential base-layer financial system and framing the projection as a function of exponential adoption and monetary network effects. The $1 billion thesis reflects a far-end macro transformation scenario rather than a cyclical valuation. Despite stark differences in scale and timing, the shared denominator across all forecasts is the institutional reframing of Bitcoin’s role in diversified portfolios. Whether as a long-term hedge, macro reserve, or internet-native monetary base, the narrative shaping forward price targets continues to be dominated by capital flow models and network entrenchment rather than retail speculation or hype cycles. Each projection reflects a different hypothesis on monetary reconfiguration, and none are immune to regime shifts in regulation, macro policy, or technology. Still, the volume and intensity of public institutional forecasts reflect an increasingly codified role for Bitcoin within long-term capital frameworks. * Does not include $1 billion Hyperbitcoinization target from Fidelity.

Title: CoinEx Research Releases Landmark Report on the RWA Tokenization Revolution
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/21/3118490/0/en/CoinEx-Research-Releases-Landmark-Report-on-the-RWA-Tokenization-Revolution.html
Time Published: 2025-07-21T08:40:00Z
Full Content:
July 21, 2025 04:40 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, July 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research, the research division of global crypto exchange CoinEx, has officially released its latest in-depth two-part report: “Unlocking the On-Chain Asset Era: A Deep Dive into the Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Revolution (Part I & II).” The report systematically examines the RWA landscape—from foundational infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to the practical deployment of tokenized asset classes—and signals the arrival of RWAs as a core pillar of the next wave of financial innovation. Key Insight I: The On-Chain Asset Era Is Accelerating The report highlights that RWA tokenization is fast becoming the critical bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). As of June 2025, RWA-related protocols have locked $12.7 billion in total value, up 69% year-to-date. Yield-bearing assets such as tokenized U.S. Treasuries and private credit are growing rapidly under clearer regulatory regimes, led by institutional giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Notably, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund alone commands 44% of the tokenized Treasuries market with $2.5 billion in TVL. CoinEx Research believes RWAs are transitioning from early experimentation to institutional-scale adoption, marking a clear inflection point in the on-chain asset revolution. Key Insight II: Five Core Asset Classes Define the Tokenized Financial Landscape In Part II of the report, CoinEx Research analyzes five of the most impactful RWA asset types, detailing how each class is evolving in design, adoption, and regulatory complexity: CoinEx Research emphasizes that as compliance, yield, and liquidity converge, these asset classes will serve as foundational components of an on-chain financial system. Key Insight III: Regulatory Clarity & Infrastructure Enable Institutional Entry The report outlines two critical enablers for mainstream RWA adoption: Over 59% of non-stablecoin RWA value is currently hosted on Ethereum, underlining its institutional composability and regulatory alignment. CoinEx Research’s Outlook: RWAs as the Foundation of On-Chain Capital Markets CoinEx Research concludes that RWAs are not just symbolic tools—they are the building blocks of real on-chain capital markets. With scalable legal, custodial, and compliance systems in place, RWAs are now enabling institutions to enter Web3 with safety, efficiency, and clarity. More than just the ability to “tokenize assets,” the real competitive edge will lie in delivering stable, composable, and transparent real-world financial instruments on-chain. Read the Full Report Both Part I and Part II of “Unlocking the On-Chain Asset Era: A Deep Dive into the RWA Tokenization Revolution” are now available on the official CoinEx Research portal. Industry professionals, institutional investors, developers, and policymakers are encouraged to explore the full insights.

Mukesh Ambani’s Jio Financial Services Ltd. agreed to form a reinsurance venture with Allianz SE in India, advancing the billionaire’s quest to broaden his reach in the sector. The 50-50 venture combines Jio’s local digital footprint with Allianz’s global underwriting and reinsurance capabilities, the companies said in a statement late Friday. Jio and Allianz also signed a non-binding agreement to set up equally owned general and life insurance businesses in India. Bloomberg News previously reported the companies’ joint-venture plan, which expands Ambani’s footprint in the insurance sector. His Jio Financial already offers digital banking and has struck a deal with BlackRock Inc. for investment-fund services. The agreement with Jio comes after the German insurer sold its holdings in ventures with Bajaj Finserv Ltd. in India. The new reinsurance project will start operating after the companies have received statutory and regulatory approval. India’s insurance penetration — the ratio of premiums to gross domestic product — is about 3.7%, well below other Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and Thailand, according to data from the local insurance regulator.

Stablecoin Strategy: Trumpâs team and BlackRock aim to globalize dollar-pegged stablecoins to sustain U.S. financial dominance, channeling capital into Treasuries and delaying a dollar collapse. Digital Currency Takeover: Like past dollarization in Iraq, stablecoins replace local currencies, enforce Treasury demand, and extend dollar supremacy for 10â15 years via tech-driven financial control. Surveillance Risks: Critics warn stablecoins could enable CBDC-like social credit tracking, merging finance with national security while exposing corruption (e.g., Brazil tariff schemes). Broader Financial Looting: Links to Pentagon fund gaps, healthcare plunder (e.g., mRNA shots suppressing life expectancy), and Epstein cover-ups reveal systemic elite exploitation. Resistance Tactics: Ditch propaganda, hoard precious metals, and use unincorporated nonprofits (UNAs) to legally shield assets against centralized financial coup.

Resistance Tactics: Ditch propaganda, hoard precious metals, and use unincorporated nonprofits (UNAs) to legally shield assets against centralized financial coup. President Donald Trumpâs administration is aggressively pushing stablecoinsâdollar-pegged digital currenciesâas part of a strategy to preserve U.S. financial dominance despite soaring national debt, warns financial analyst Catherine Austin Fitts, founder of The Solari Report. In an exclusive interview on Decentralized TV, Fitts revealed that the Trump administrationâalongside figures like BlackRock chairman Larry Finkâaims to internationalize dollar-backed stablecoins, funneling global capital into U.S. Treasuries and delaying an inevitable dollar collapse. "The New Iraqi Pallets of Cash" Fitts compared the plan to past U.S. financial maneuvers, such as flooding post-invasion Iraq with physical dollars to cement dollar reliance. Now, she argues, stablecoins serve as "digital palettes of cash"âcool, tech-savvy vehicles to: Replace local currencies worldwide with dollar-pegged digital money. Force capital into Treasuries, propping up demand for U.S. debt as interest rates spike. Extend dollar supremacy for 10â15 years, avoiding a fiscal reckoning. "This is a hostile takeover of global currencies through tech," Fitts said, referencing legislative efforts like the (GENIES Act) to formalize crypto markets under U.S. control. Critics Fear CBDC Backdoor Despite claims of resisting Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), Fitts warned that dollarized stablecoins could impose social credit surveillance: Example: Brazil tariff front-runningâwhere insiders profited before policy shiftsâshows corruption risks. Real-world control: Palantir- and DoD-backed systems may enforce compliance, merging finance with national security. "Financial Coup DâEtat" Fitts, who documented $21 trillion in missing Pentagon funds (1998â2015), linked the scheme to broader looting: Healthcare plunder: mRNA shots for sick children may artificially suppress life expectancy ("balancing budgets by killing people"). Epstein files erased: Governments buried evidence while VC-backed crypto elites lobbied Washington. How to Resist? Fitts urged pragmatic defiance: Ditch TVsâpropaganda clouds judgment. Stack precious metalsâhedge against currency collapse. Non-corporate entities: Unincorporated nonprofits (UNAs) can shield assets legally. Bottom Line Trumpâs stablecoin gambit may salvage the dollar temporarilyâbut accelerates a centralized financial coup. As Fitts bluntly put it: "If you ignore the great poisoning, you wonât survive."

Title: Why Public Pension Funds Should Still Put Beneficiaries First: A Response to Fisch and Schwartz
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2025/07/21/why-public-pension-funds-should-still-put-beneficiaries-first-a-response-to-fisch-and-schwartz/
Time Published: 2025-07-21T04:05:48Z
Full Content:
In a recent article, professors Jill Fisch and Jeff Schwartz argue that the beneficiary primacy model – requiring pension fund trustees to maximize economic value solely for beneficiaries – fundamentally misunderstands the nature of public pension funds. They contend that public pension funds differ critically from private funds because beneficiaries receive defined benefits that do not vary with fund performance. Unlike mutual fund investors who are residual claimants, public pension beneficiaries have contractual claims to fixed payments. As the two professors note, if a public pension fund outperforms, beneficiaries have no claim to the surplus; it belongs to the government. Their solution is as innovative as it is radical: Treat public pension funds as principals rather than intermediaries. Under their model, fund managers would owe fiduciary duties to the fund itself, not to beneficiaries. This would free managers to balance the sometimes-competing interests of multiple stakeholders – employees, taxpayers, local communities, and beneficiaries – guided by state constitutions, legislation, and investment policies. As they argue, “the political nature of public pensions is a feature, not a bug. I will provide the English law perspective, but the UK principles also apply to some extent to Fisch and Schwartz’s U.S. law analysis. I will examine the roles and duties of pension fund trustees, because as Fisch and Schwartz recognize, public pension funds in the U.S. are typically organized as trusts. It has been argued that under U.S. law, the beneficiary primacy principle is a problem because, among other reasons, fund managers or pension fund trustees are not permitted to take into account ESG factors but must maximize the economic value of the fund. Fisch and Schwartz go further, arguing that this principle creates litigation risk and “delegitimizes values-based fund management decisions,” forcing fund managers to make disingenuous claims that all ESG decisions maximize returns. But while the beneficiary primacy principle is recognized under English law, it is more nuanced. For pension fund trustees to address ESG issues, it is unnecessary and undesirable to reframe a pension fund as a principal to which trustees solely owe duties. This reframing subverts well-established tenets of trusts law and fiduciary law. In my view, under English law, pension fund trustees are already legally permitted, and under certain circumstances may even be legally required, to consider ESG factors, if one of two conditions exist. First, the trustee’s mandate, as stated in the trust deed or legislation allows or requires them to consider these factors. Or second, these factors materially affect the long-term risk-adjusted returns for the beneficiaries.[1]For example, trust-based pension funds are statutorily required to take into account climate-related risks.[2] To begin with, under English law, the fiduciary duties of pension fund trustees primarily consist of promoting the purpose for which the trust was created. This has been interpreted to require the trustees to balance returns against risks[3]; this is different from the maximization of risk-adjusted returns as stated by Fisch and Schwartz. English law generally permits fiduciary duties to be shaped or qualified by the terms of the trust deed, applicable contract or applicable legislation, such that the scope of fiduciary duties has to be interpreted to permit, and may even require, the pension fund trustees to address ESG factors.[4] Fisch and Schwartz argue that courts “contort themselves” to uphold values-based investment decisions while nominally applying the beneficiary primacy principle. They discuss cases like State of West Virginia v. Investment Management Board[5] (upholding mandatory investment in jail bonds) and Board of Trustees v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City[6] (upholding required divestment from South Africa) as examples where courts strain to find economic justifications for politically motivated decisions. However, under English law, if the trust deed or legislation permits or requires the trustees to consider or even prioritize environmental, social, political, or other kinds of factors, or to make certain investments, the beneficiary primacy principle, which is part of fiduciary duties, is no obstacle at all. This is because the fiduciary duty has been molded or qualified by the trust deed or legislation. Thus, should the facts of State of West Virginia v. Investment Management Board be decided by a UK court, the decision in that case is justifiable because the legislation has given the mandate to the state pension board to invest in jail bonds. Likewise, the decision in the Board of Trustees v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore City is similarly justifiable because the state law requires the public pension funds to divest from companies doing business in South Africa during the apartheid era. This is because the duties of the pension fund trustees had been qualified by, or had to be interpreted in light of, state law. A real difficulty arises when there is no clear mandate, that is, when the trust deed or legislation is silent as to whether pension fund trustees can take into account ESG factors. Fisch and Schwartz argue this creates an “irresolvable and disingenuous” debate where fund managers must artificially claim that all decisions maximize returns. Their solution is to abandon the beneficiary primacy principle entirely. One answer provided by the beneficiary primacy principle, as described by Fisch and Schwartz, is that pension fund trustees are not allowed to do so because their sole and overriding duty is to maximize the returns of their beneficiaries. But under English law, while pension funds trustees must act in the exclusive interests of beneficiaries, this does not mean they have to maximize returns. Rather, the beneficiary primacy principle requires trustees to balance returns against risks. As the 2024 UK Financial Markets Law Committee (FMLC) makes clear in its important paper, “Pension Fund Trustees and Fiduciary Duties: Decision-making in the Context of Sustainability and the Subject of Climate Change”, pension fund trustees can balance returns against risks at three levels:[7] the specific investment level, the portfolio level, and the level of whole economies material to the pension fund. This framework elegantly addresses many of Fisch and Schwartz’s concerns about economically targeted investments (ETIs). They explain how public pension funds have invested in local infrastructure, affordable housing, and small businesses – investments critics condemn as creating politically motivated conflicts of interest. But under the FMLC approach, these can be justified at the third level of analysis. Thus, trustees are allowed to consider ESG or political factors to the extent they constitute material financial risks or opportunities that can affect the returns of the beneficiaries. Should a UK court decide the case of Withers v. Teachers Retirement System of New York City[8], the court is likely to affirm the decision of the fund manager because, had the pension funds not bought the state bonds, the state, which is a major contributor to and guarantor of the funds’ assets, would have become bankrupt. And this would materially affect the returns of the beneficiaries. I do not find the court’s interpretation to be particularly strained. The ETIs, which are designed to benefit low-income earners, can be justified on this basis, because the creation of affordable housing and employment can spur economic growth, which will in turn improve the returns for the beneficiaries. This reasoning may seem tenuous. But recall that under the UK approach, as pension fund trustees can balance returns against risks at the whole economies level that are material to the fund, the ETIs can be justified on this basis. It is within the discretionary judgment of pension fund trustees to conclude that a badly performing economy, caused by unemployment, can affect the long-term risk-adjusted returns for the beneficiaries. Fisch and Schwartz document extensive public pension fund activism on social issues – from New York City Employees’ Retirement System’s 1992 proposal on sexual orientation discrimination at Cracker Barrel to recent fossil fuel divestments. They argue that putting beneficiaries first forces funds to make disingenuous economic arguments for these values-based decisions. In my opinion, even if the pension fund trustees are motivated by their moral or ideological views when they make ETIs or when they consider ESG factors, they may not breach their fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries. This is because under English law, taking into account non-financial factors is permissible, if two tests are met: first, trustees should have good reason to think that the beneficiaries would share the concern; and second, the decision should not involve a risk of significant financial detriment to the fund.[9] What if the first test is met but not the second? Can the fiduciary still take into account and give effect to these non-financial considerations such as advancing the net-zero agenda or implementing the Paris Agreement? There may be support for an affirmative answer in a 2022 English High Court decision. In Butler-Sloss v. Charity Commission for England and Wales[10], the trustees of two charitable organizations sought a declaration from the court that they were not in breach of their fiduciary duties by aligning their proposed investment policy with the Paris Agreement and therefore with the wishes of their respective charities, even if doing so would lead to lower returns for their beneficiaries. The goals and objectives of the investment policy were to “protect and enhance the trust’s financial returns and support its charitable objectives” and in doing so, “align its investments with the Paris Climate Agreement.” To implement the policy, the trustees decided on an investment that had the highest percentage of green funds but there would be financial detriment in the short term, the precise amount of which the trustees could not determine. The Attorney General and Charity Commissioner took the view that the potential financial detriment would conflict with the trust’s purposes. But the court disagreed, holding that the trustees had discharged their duties and struck the right balance between giving effect to the goals and objectives of the investment policy, which included aligning investments with the Paris Agreement, and the financial detriment that would ensue. In my view, this case suggests that English courts may defer to a fiduciary’s balance between risk-adjusted returns and non-financial considerations – even if it causes short-term financial detriment – provided that the trust’s purpose permits such investments and specifically includes these non-financial objectives. Where the trust lacks such provisions, the fiduciary must ascertain the beneficiaries’ preferences, which may be challenging. Where regulations or guidelines require or expect asset managers, asset owners, and pension fund trustees to make climate-related disclosures, the fiduciary duties of these entities – here the beneficiary primacy principle – have to be interpreted in that light. For example, the UK Financial Conduct Authority has issued similar disclosure rules or guidelines.[11] This means that asset managers must consider climate-related risks as part of their duty to their beneficiaries to balance returns against risks. This is an example of how the common law fiduciary duties have been molded or qualified by regulation. In my view, under English law, it is unnecessary to overturn the longstanding principle that trustees owe duties only to beneficiaries. Nor is it desirable to assert the controversial claim that public pension fund trustees owes duties only to the public pension fund understood as a principal. It is difficult to defend the claim that the public pension fund is a principal when, unlike a company, it is not conferred a separate legal personality by the law. Fisch and Schwartz’s reconceptualization, while intellectually bold, would require fundamental changes to well-established trust law principles. More concerningly, completely severing the link between fund managers and beneficiaries could reduce accountability and potentially enable the political manipulation they elsewhere acknowledge – such as when Louisiana’s State Treasurer stopped investing with BlackRock to protect the fossil fuel industry. The English law approach achieves most of their legitimate objectives – enabling ESG consideration, supporting local investments, and reflecting public values – while maintaining crucial protections against self-dealing and mismanagement. It recognizes that pension fund trustees operate within a framework shaped by legislation, regulation, and trust documents, but preserves the fundamental principle that they must act in their beneficiaries’ best interests, properly understood.

Mikey Stafford RTÉ Online Sport Editor History is written by the victors and, as is customary, the All-Ireland champions make up almost half of The Sunday Game Team of the Year. Tipperary's second half blitzkrieg led them to an All-Ireland title that looked as unlikely at half-time of the All-Ireland final as it did at full-time of their Munster SHC defeat to Cork. But Liam Cahill's men were victorious, thanks to a rabid defence and a lethal attack, which sees seven men from the Premier County represented in the selection. There is room for four Corkmen, two from Kilkenny and one each from Dublin and Galway. Tipperary's Jake Morris is considered the cream of the crop, the half-forward voted Player of the Year by the RTÉ GAA pundits. Rhys Shelly (Tipperary) Despite becoming the first goalkeeper to score from play in an All-Ireland hurling final with his huge 69th-minute effort, the Moycarkey Borris man has made the grade on the strength of his restarts and his defensive solidity. Conceded eight goals in his first three Championship matches after taking the number one jersey from Barry Hogan, but after that conceded just four in Tipp's remaining four Championship matches (thanks to a penalty save late in the final). Not only were his puckouts long and accurate, he was also adept at getting them away very quickly. Robert Doyle (Tipperary) A wonderful debut inter-county season is made all the more remarkable by the fact the Clonoulty-Rossmore man plays corner-forward for his club. That might explain his attacking tendencies, notching a point and a free from right corner-back in an All-Ireland final. His place on this selection was earned thanks to some remarkable man-marking gigs during the year. Dessie Hutchinson, Eoin Cody and Tony Kelly had already been guarded by Doyle before he picked up Alan Connolly earlier today and held the towering Blackrock man to a single point. Huw Lawlor (Kilkenny) The gold standard in terms of inter-county full-backs for a few years now. Following in the proud tradition of no nonsense number threes in stripey jerseys, Brian Cody, Noel Hickey and JJ Delaney would be proud of the O'Loughlin Gaels man's commitment to keeping the game as simple as possible. Low or high, win your ball, secure possession and give it to someone in a better position. Not opposed to the odd jaunt up the field and has been known to raise a white flag or two in his time. Sean O'Donoghue (Cork) Jason Forde's 0-02 tally was by a distance the lowest of Tipp's rampant inside line today and that was thanks to the efforts of the ultra-aggressive O'Donoghue. The former captain from Inniscarra is as honest as they come and holding Aaron Gillane to two points in a Munster final is some going. Eoghan Connolly (Tipperary) Notched his obligatory point from a different timezone against Cork. The Cashel King Cormacs 'full-back' has been a revelation from long distance, both from placed balls and open play, this year, scoring 0-14 in total. Tougher than normal outing from a defensive point of view in the first half as his man Diarmuid Healy scored 0-03 but Connolly, like most of his team-mates, got on top in the second half and Healy made way for Damien Cahalane after the sending off of Eoin Downey. Ronan Maher (Tipperary) What can be said about the towering Thurles Sarsfields man? Goes one better than his revered older brother Pádraic by captaining Tipperary to an All-Ireland title. His peerless ability in the air saw him given the task of shackling Cork's talisman Brian Hayes and he carried out his duty with his usual energy and physicality. With Liam Cahill blooding plenty of young players this year, the experienced Maher was one of the foundation stones around which this Tipp team were built. Ciarán Joyce (Cork) One of Pat Ryan's former Under-20 charges, the Castlemartyr man has now played in and lost two All-Ireland finals at the age of 23. No shame in his performance today however, keeping Tipperary's main man Jake Morris to two points. One-third of Cork's massively influential half-back line, you feel his best is yet to come. Darragh Fitzgibbon (Cork) The modern midfielder that all modern midfielders will be modelled on. Athletic, blessed with boundless energy and ludicrously fast, the Charleville man is too good to have been on successive losing All-Ireland final teams. A massive target for Cork puck-outs and a pest on opposition restarts. Cathal Mannion (Galway) This was a better year for Galway hurling than 2024 (that wouldn't be hard) but where would Micheal Donoghue's team be without Mannion? His 0-17 against Wexford in the Leinster SHC was the display of a hurler in the form of his life. He notched 0-11 of Galway's 1-20 as another Leinster final against Kilkenny came and went. Jake Morris (Tipperary) The Nenagh Éire Óg man has been the leader of Tipperary's lethal attack all year. Like his long-time underage team-mate Ormonde, he is fast and loves to elude opponents with his movement. Economical in possession, will be irked by fact his wides (three) outnumbered his points (two) against Cork... only joking, I'm sure he couldn't give a damn. Andrew Ormond (Tipperary) Pacey, hard-working and blessed with sublime wrists, the JK Brackens man has been one of the finds of the season (despite being around for a few years since winning an Under-20 All-Ireland in 2019). His two points in as many minutes at the start of the second half were vital in Tipp's bewilderment of Cork. One of several Tipp forwards who revels in turning over possession. Cian O’Sullivan (Dublin) In a bright year for Dublin hurling, no one shone brighter than the St Brigid's man. On the inter-county scene since 2018 he looks invigorated by the Niall Ó Ceallacháin project and the talented sharpshooter adds a touch of flair around the middle for a physical Dublin side. He was off the charts in the shock win over Limerick. Martin Keoghan (Kilkenny) 'Mossy' has become the totem around which Kilkenny's talented posse of forwards circulate. The Tullaroan man, after a few years of being part of the support cast, has started to rack up the numbers of a true Cats matinee idol. Managed six points in defeat as Kilkenny's season was ended by All-Ireland champions Tipperary at the penultimate stage. John McGrath (Tipperary) John McGrath scores a third goal for Tipperary. We may never have seen the likes of this.... 📺 https://t.co/ZfZ9mA9XTY 📱 https://t.co/1S2tbTA3PH 📻 https://t.co/2SRRKdgjzu pic.twitter.com/kNFBkiv2yT Noel's fourth All-Ireland medal owes much to the goalscoring prowess of his little brother who has been a man reborn this season. His two goals today bringing him to seven in the Championship in 2025. A wily, smart and skilled hurler. A joy to watch. Brian Hayes (Cork) A shoo-in for Hurler of the Year had the Rebels got the job done today, but still a season to remember for the towering St Finbarrs forward. Against Tipperary he managed a single point from play, bringing him to 5-09 in seven championship matches, but he is more than just a scorer - a playmaker, a free-winner and a bringer of chaos. The Cork attack will be built around him for years to come. ALL-IRELAND HURLING FINAL MAN OF THE MATCH Ronan Maher (Tipperary) The captain played a captain's role. Tipperary's 3-14 in the second half may grab the headlines, but what about the 0-02 recorded at the other end? The Tipperary defence, in that second half, were playing on a different level. And the tone for that ravenous, relentless performance was set by full-back Maher, who completely shut down Cork's main man Brian Hayes. Superb in the air, a hard-hitting tackler and pragmatic when he needs to be, the Thurles man makes defending an art form. SUNDAY GAME HURLER OF THE YEAR Jake Morris (Tipperary) "It was a sobering winter for us all [after] being knocked out of the championship early again. Lads had to go away and have a hard, long look in the mirror, really. It's a hard thing to do but it had to be done. "Pride was swallowed and really it was about coming back in and giving this one hell of a rattle. "We worked extremely hard as a group to give ourselves a chance of being in an All-Ireland final and it shows what you can do with a bit of hard work and determination." Jake Morris bore the brickbats of the Tipp hurling public in 2024 when things did not go well for the Premier County, so how sweet will it feel to be a two-time All-Ireland winner and be credited with being the key man for Liam Cahill's team's unlikely triumph? The Tipperary attack can be an irresistible force at its best and Morris is the man who makes it tick. His tactical awareness, his movement, his pace, his skills, his eye for a pass and his shooting ability from range, are all the qualities that make him Tipperary's main man.

Title: Cork player ratings: Shane Barrett starts strong but too many fail to reach final crescendo

Time Published: 2025-07-20T17:37:16Z
Full Content:
At fault for Tipperary’s crucial first goal when mis-controlling a shot that was going over the crossbar. Should have been more decisive under a long ball for Tipp’s second goal. Rating: 4 On a lot of ball in the first half when Cork were mostly comfortable at the back. Scored and made a point on his forays into attack. Ultimately couldn’t handle Darragh McCarthy. Rating: 5 Coped reasonably well under the dropping ball in the first half but was losing his battle with John McGrath when he picked up a second yellow for conceding a penalty. Rating: 4 Tipp were happy for O’Donoghue to be the first receiver on short puck-outs and his distribution was patchy. His least impressive game of an otherwise excellent season. Rating: 5 Fought hard as usual and kept going to the end. Held Jake Morris to a couple of points from play without negating his influence. Morris must now be favourite for Hurler of the Year. Rating: 5 Absolutely commanding in the first half, dominating in the air and on the ground, but the centre didn’t hold in the second half when Tipp started playing the ball in front of him. Rating: 6 Made a blistering start, sweeping up around the Cork half-back line and starting attacks, but couldn’t maintain that influence and faded as the game wore on. Rating: 6 After a terrific season this was his least effective performance. Made an early assist and had a couple of score involvements late in the first half but otherwise offered little in attack. Rating: 4 Was the most influential of the four centre fielders in the first half, but Cork lost a grip in the middle third in the second half. Fought hard against the tide. Finished with three points from play. Rating: 6 For a young player starting just his third championship match he had a brilliant first half, scoring three points and assisting two. Couldn’t get going after half-time and was eventually replaced. Rating: 6 Superb in the opening half, rifling three points from play, including what seemed at the time like a vital goal in first-half stoppage time. Finished with 1-4 but couldn’t influence the second half. Rating: 7 Just like last year, he followed a terrific semi-final with an ineffective performance in the final. Landed a trademark long free in the first half, but faded badly before being replaced. Rating: 4 The most effective of Cork’s inside forwards in the first half, scoring one from play and making another. Missed a free just after half-time and was replaced before the hour mark. Rating: 5 Got his only point shortly before half-time but had struggled to get his hands on the ball before that. Ironically, fluffed the only goal chance he created by making a poor handpass instead of shooting. Rating: 4 Was smothered in the air by Ronan Maher. One of his flicks from a long puck-out resulted in a first half score, and was fouled for two frees, but was essentially neutralised by Tipp. Rating: 5 Seamus Harnedy was lively as always, hitting the crossbar with a rasping shot for goal and scoring a late point. Damien Cahalane coped well as an emergency full back, apart from one ridiculous foul for charging. Rating: 5 Cork coped well with Tipp’s extra defender in the first half but when the momentum of the game shifted violently after the break they didn’t have any solutions. Too many players failed.

Title: Sea of blue and gold floods Talbot Street as Tipperary fans honour Seán Treacy ahead of All-Ireland final

There were smiles, laughter and fists held high among the Tipperary supporters following the county’s All-Ireland hurling final in Dublin’s Croke Park on Sunday. Anthony Nagle, from Clonmel but now living in Dublin, said he had “not a single complaint left” following the definitive win by the Tipperary team. “Cork didn’t expect it. They are known to be a little bit arrogant. But their game didn’t turn up today,” he said. John O’Dwyer, a brother of Ryan O’Dwyer the former player for Tipperary and Dublin, said he was delighted. “Lots of heart” was his explanation for the Tipperary win. “The team had lots of heart.” Joe Bourke, enjoying a celebratory post-match drink in the noted Tipperary people’s pub Chaplin’s on Hawkins Street, said he put the Tipperary team’s performance down to the number of young people in the squad who had “energised the whole team”. However, the Cork supporters were not so cheerful, as might be expected. “Gutted” was the response from Togher man Gavin Barrett when The Irish Times stopped him on the street. He said he felt the initially successful performance by the Cork team had little substance to it. “I felt it was nothing. Then the second half – complete collapse.” Taylor Keating, who was with him, said she too felt the Cork performance was lacking. [ Cork v Tipperary live updates: Tipperary win All-Ireland after amazing second half performanceOpens in new window ] Dermot Crowley from Douglas said of course he was “disappointed”. He said he had not bought into the pre-match “talk” that Cork would win fairly easily. “I felt everyone was a little frightened of Tipp in the background.” Earlier, Dublin’s Talbot Street had been a sea of blue and gold on Sunday morning as Tipp fans gathered for the annual commemoration of War of Independence veteran Seán Treacy in advance of the final. Hundreds gathered at the memorial for the Soloheadbeg republican who was killed in a shoot-out with Crown forces in October 1920. [ Tipperary are better than they get credit for, but Cork go into All-Ireland final as the finished articleOpens in new window ] The sea of Tipp colours was not matched elsewhere, however, as from midday, the rest of the city teemed with one colour: red. John and Mark Swann from Doneraile were with a large group of Cork supporters outside Mulligan’s pub on Poolbeg Street, and said it was clear the Rebels had come to town. They travelled to Dublin on Saturday and were not going home until Monday. The father and son team and the wider group had no doubt whatsoever that Cork would prevail in the final. “Ten points. Cork will win by 10 points,” said Mark. Also relaxed about the supremacy of the Cork team were Donal Murphy, Freddie Sweeney, Ian O’Brien, Conor Curran, Jack Hannon, Steven Davern and Gary Sweeney, as they posed for photographs and enjoyed a prematch drink before walking to Croke Park. Some 50 yards away outside Chaplin’s bar, a group of supporters were equally happy, if not as confident. Jack Keating noted the county was on the “back foot” when it came to winning the All-Ireland. “We are so far back I don’t even know what is forward any more,” he joked. Around the corner on D’Olier Street and up O’Connell Street, the scale of the number of Cork fans became apparent as a tide of red swept along. By rough estimate, the crowds of Cork supporters outnumbered the Tipperary supporters by at least 20 to one. Tourists wheeling bags looked on as fans waited, five and six deep, at traffic lights. Street vendors selling “flags, hats and ponchos” mingled with those holding signs aloft calling for “tickets needed”. Music blared from Cassidy’s and the Belvedere hotels as the sea of red – with occasional dots of blue and gold – swept by to the beat of a bodhrán and chants of “Re-bels, Re-bels”. On the corner of North Circular Road, Shay and Chloe Butler were dressed in the blue and gold Tipperary colours but were downbeat about the county’s chances. Shay, originally from Gortnahoe and now living in Dublin, said Tipperary fans seemed to accept that their team faced a difficult task in beating Cork. “It is more exciting when Dublin are playing,” said Chloe, who added that she was “always a Dub”. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trump and the energy industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ AI is “not my thing,” President Donald Trump admitted during a speech in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. “You need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,” Trump said, recalling a conversation with “David”—most likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. “I said, what, are you kidding? That’s double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.” At the high-profile summit on Tuesday—where, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat, and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods—companies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building “titan clusters” of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania’s fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country’s second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice—who dubs himself the “people’s champion of natural gas”—moderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech.

Here's How All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world’s top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach “multi-decade highs” over the next few years. A jolt of new demand—like the demand represented by massive data centers—could revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are “why the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,” says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast—responding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration’s priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration’s anti-renewables positions, aren’t necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How This demand isn’t necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate—many tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened—but rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. “The waiting list for a new turbine is five years,” Williams-Derry says. “If you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‘I want more solar.’” Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an “energy crazy train,” scoffing at those administrations’ support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant’s carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We’re going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive “40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,” while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists’ projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It’s easy to find any variety of headlines or reports—often based on projections produced by private companies—projecting massive growth numbers for AI. “I view all of these projections with great skepticism,” says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. “I don’t think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there’s “a bunch of self-interested actors,” Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels, and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications, and experts testifying in front of Congress began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (“Dig More Coal—The PCs Are Coming” was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet’s energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. “People just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,” he says. There’s some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. “It can both be true that there’s growth in electricity use and there’s a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what it’s likely to happen,” Koomey says.

Daily Tech News 20 July 2025 Top Story If you gaze long into an LLM, the LLM also gazes into you: Geoff Lewis is managing partner and co-founder of Bedrock Capital (no, you're thinking of Blackrock) and guided his firm to be an early investor in OpenAI. He used ChatGPT to help him in his work on a daily basis. He went stark raving mad. (Futurism) There is a website called the SCP Foundation that documents the work of a secretive organisation that finds, catalogues, and if possible imprisons various kinds of cosmic horror and more innocuous but equally strange entities. It's a work of collaborative fiction organised as a wiki, and has been running for more than 15 years. It's all online where tools like ChatGPT can scan it and incorporate it into their hallucinations, which is exactly what it fed to Geoff Lewis, providing the perfect reinforcement loop to drive him into psychosis. Which in a strange form of recursion, layering reality upon fiction, makes ChatGPT into precisely the kind of psychic terror that the SCP Foundation pretends to investigate. (Hat tip to commenter Blonde Morticia.) Tech News Are you looking to spend $900 on a replica of the Data General Dasher terminal keyboard from 1977, used as the basis for prop design in the Apple TV sci-fi series Severance? (Tom's Hardware) Nope, me neither. Are you looking to spend $1299 on a 32" 6K (6016x3384) monitor covering 98% of the DCI-P3 colour space? (Hot Hardware) If you are, the Asus ProArt PA32QCV is exactly that and costs exactly that much, or will do when it launches next month. It has two Thunderbolt 4 ports with 96W power delivery, DisplayPort, HDMI, two 2W speakers with a headphone jack, and a built-in USB hub with KVM support. It only offers a 60Hz refresh rate, so definitely more suitable to professional artists than competitive gamers. I want one. But since I run a triple-monitor setup, that could get kind of expensive. Speaking of expensive, TSMC has leased land in Central Taiwan Science Park to construct four new 1.4nm fabs. (Taipei Times) No numbers attached, but expect it to cost more than three 6K monitors. The company also plans to build eleven wafer manufacturing plants (creating silicon wafers to turn into chips) and four packaging facilities (where the bare slivers of silicon are packaged into the products that other companies package into the boards that still other companies package into consumer products). Intel is laying off 5500 employees in Oregon, California, and Arizona. (WCCFTech) Assuming these are new layoffs, this brings the total job losses at the company to over 20,000 in the past year. OEM laptop maker Sixunited has announced a burger with the lot. (Notebook Check) The company's new XN77-160M-CS - forgive them, this is not a retail brand - uses AMD's Strix Halo CPU, which has integrated graphics on par with Nvidia's laptop 4070 model, paired with up to 128GB of RAM. The RAM is soldered due to timing constraints of the 256-bit bus - Framework tried modular RAM on this processor but couldn't make it work reliably at the required speeds - but it does have two M.2 slots. Plus a 2560x1600 165Hz display covering 100% of sRGB, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, two regular USB ports, wired Ethernet (though only gigabit), HDMI, what looks like a full-size SD card slot, a headphone jack, a barrel jack power connector, and the Four Essential Keys all in their rightful place. No pricing specified since this will be sold to other companies who will then market it to the public. Musical Interlude Disclaimer: Ask the children. The children have many dollars.

Get those skeeters both in the water and on the fly. And they don't bother humans. Posted by: RickZ at July 20, 2025 *** We used to have those in the patio of our French Quarter apartment when I was a kid, along with not a few mosquitoes. Mom called the dragonflies "mosquito hawks." People don't believe me when I say we used to have fireflies too. My brother and I would trap them in a Tang jar of an evening with holes poked in the lid, and watch them flick their lights on and off. Then we'd open the jar and let them go. Posted by: Wolfus Aurelius, Dreaming of Elsewhere at July 20, 2025 06:27 AM (omVj0) 47 So family and I went to a lovely art museum in New Castle, Delaware - called "Delaware Art Museum"" not overwhelmingly large and with a terrific collection of of beautiful Pre- Raphaelite painting. There was some modern arts and prints but I didn't see those, and some great illustrations by Howard Pyle. Unfortunately, there was the usual left wing bias in some of the commentary. There was a picture by Howard Pyle with a strong tall, man challenging a robber or criminal who was trying to assault or rob a woman. Because it's from the early 1900's we need to be told that the white man is seen as courageous and strong and the woman is in a subservient position. Oh, gee, because white men shouldn't be courageous and she should have whipped Led out her karate moves and defeated the robber. They got me on tape I'm sure saying that and rolling my eyes But I enjoyed it anyway and I liked that one of the pre-Raphaelites was a very devout Christian who had wanted to illustrate all of the scenes in the Bible. New Castle DEi has an old section Which dates from the late 1600s with lovely homes from the 1700's and 1800's with some cobblestone streets.

If the cam position sensor gets wet, it kills the vehicle until it is replaced. It is on the underside of the engine compartment and the enclosure that is supposed to keep it dry is very easy for a mechanic to get wrong. I was twice stranded on a rainy. One of these times was on an offramp from the 210 Freeway in Pasadena just in time for rush hour. I later did a search and found many forum entries discussing the problem, with several posters saying they always kept a spare as part of an emergency kit in the Explorer.

Posted by: "Perfessor" Squirrel at July 20, 2025 08:44 AM (IBQGV) 135 The Coldplay couple are a little old to be carrying on like 15 year olds and then going to a crappy rock concert. You'd think they would have better things to do with their limited time. I don't even know who Coldplay is. Now it's time for the Divorce Lawyers to eat.

It used to be possible to criss the county line, and you were home free. Then came Radio. Now? Retinal scans. Fingerprints. DNA. License plate readers. VIN readers. Cell phone tracking. Facial recognition tech, and on and on.

Title: Mike Rowe warns of massive trade-job vacancies: 'AI is coming for the coders'

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/19/2025 10:19:32 AM PDT by Twotone Blue-collar hero and former host of "Dirty Jobs" Mike Rowe says claims of a massive deficit of trades workers in the United States are not hyperbole. Rowe spoke at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, where he sounded the alarm on a serious lack of young people going into the trades. Providing stories from employers, politicians, and even the military, Rowe stressed the need to move away from computer programming and coding in favor of tougher, more traditional career paths. "We've been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code," Rowe told an audience at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He then delivered a stark warning to those who may have followed Joe Biden's infamous "learn to code" advice in 2019. "Well, AI is coming for the coders," Rowe remarked. From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC. They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

The people who stayed home using their computers got paid more, but the people who were out there whether they were working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars, were the ones who were essential. Many of those sitting at home will be replaced by AI next time. That's a very simplistic and flawed view. The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

Free Republic Browse · Search News/Activism Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Providing stories from employers, politicians, and even the military, Rowe stressed the need to move away from computer programming and coding in favor of tougher, more traditional career paths. "We've been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code," Rowe told an audience at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He then delivered a stark warning to those who may have followed Joe Biden's infamous "learn to code" advice in 2019. "Well, AI is coming for the coders," Rowe remarked. From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC. They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

From there, the 63-year-old dropped some industry knowledge, detailing that the demand for tradespeople was not going away any time soon: "[AI is] not coming for the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipe fitters, the HVAC. They're not coming for the electricians." Adopting a more serious tone, Rowe leaned in to the audience to deliver the jaw-dropping numbers of exactly how many trade jobs remain vacant in the United States. Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

Recalling his time at the Aspen Ideas Festival in late June, Rowe said billionaire investor and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told him the U.S. needs "500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole." "This is me being the alarmist again," Rowe continued, now tapping into America's military industrial needs. "The BlueForge Alliance, who oversees our maritime industrial base — that's 15,000 individual companies who are collectively charged with building and delivering three nuclear-powered subs to the Navy every year for 10 years." Rowe explained that the head of the alliance called him and said, "We're having a hell of a time finding tradespeople. Can you help?" Rowe replied, "I don't know, man, it's pretty skinny out there. How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

How many do you need?" The man indicated to Rowe that the industry needed 140,000 people over the next seven years. "They need 80 to 90 thousand right now," Rowe emphasized. "These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

It's not about "dirty jobs", it's about jobs that have little value outside of a narrow field. Mike can go interview all those fathers and grandfathers who used to do those jobs and got laid off in the 1970s and 1980s, and ask them why they told their sons and daughters to go in different industries. You can go to yard sales and flea markets all over the country and buy tools that haven't been used in decades. There are a lot of people who aren't going to learn all those skills that don't translate into anything once they get downsized - and they will get downsized.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 18 | View Replies] To: Freee-dame During the first year of Covid, we all learned who had the actually necessary jobs. The people who stayed home using their computers got paid more, but the people who were out there whether they were working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars, were the ones who were essential. Many of those sitting at home will be replaced by AI next time. That's a very simplistic and flawed view. The people who stayed at home using their computers: - planned and forecasted what goods to buy, where to source them, negotiated contracts, etc. -determined what goods to deliver as well as when and where to deliver them - funded, updated, and tracked vehicle production and servicing schedules -determined electricity demands based on new construction as well as infrastructure changes -etc. etc. The people working in stores, delivering goods, repairing power lines, or repairing cars benefited from all that. The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

"These are for our submarines, folks. [If] things go hypersonic — a little sideways with China, Taiwan — our aircraft carriers are no longer the point of the spear. They're vulnerable." Rowe added, "Our submarines matter, and these guys have a pinch point because they can't find welders and electricians to get them built." The Trump administration drastically increased naval production in April 2025 through an executive order that placed at least $40 billion per year into shipbuilding efforts for the next 30 years. With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

The cost savings to companies discontinuing leases of offices, as well as being able to hire talent from farther away, aided all stakeholders. Remote work is nothing new. For example, Chrysler opened the Chrysler building in 1930 in Manhattan, New York but never built automobiles in New York City. 20 posted on 07/19/2025 11:15:35 AM PDT by T.B.

With fewer than 300 battle force ships in the U.S. Navy currently, according to the Military Times, the president set a goal for a 381-ship fleet. To that end, the Discovery Channel host said he is consistently getting calls from tradespeople, companies, and even governors, who ask him a simple question. "Where are they?" they ask Rowe, referring to tradespeople. "They've said, 'We've looked everywhere.'" Rowe revealed his response to industry leaders: "I know where they are. They're in the eighth grade." The trades advocate stressed that a "clear and present freakout" was happening under the surface in America in the automotive and energy industries, suggesting that children need to be encouraged to go into these fields. "The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

I guess that makes him an early millennial. I told him that so long as he was willing to work he would probably never have to worry about having a job for the rest of his life. So far I have been right. There was no way the sparse generations since X would ever replace the Boomers. I had an X helper here on the farm but had to fire him and wish it had not been so but I could not tolerate the risk of his having returned to old bad habits. I have not looked very hard to find a replacement but when I do I find the field is all but vacant for candidates. My only viable responses to the loss of help are to: do less, work smarter, mechanize or quit. I have not quit yet. Covid was the straw that broke the camel’s back all at once instead of over a period of a few more years when it came to the “great replacement”. We mid to late Boomers will be taken care of by third world recruits or robots or not at all. The time for that is at hand and the next 10 years for us look bleak if we can’t manage on our own.

They don't need no man. They can smash the "patriarchy". Mike went to school for a white-collar Communications degree and works in television. It's not about "dirty jobs", it's about jobs that have little value outside of a narrow field. Mike can go interview all those fathers and grandfathers who used to do those jobs and got laid off in the 1970s and 1980s, and ask them why they told their sons and daughters to go in different industries. You can go to yard sales and flea markets all over the country and buy tools that haven't been used in decades. There are a lot of people who aren't going to learn all those skills that don't translate into anything once they get downsized - and they will get downsized.

It's not about "dirty jobs", it's about jobs that have little value outside of a narrow field. Mike can go interview all those fathers and grandfathers who used to do those jobs and got laid off in the 1970s and 1980s, and ask them why they told their sons and daughters to go in different industries. You can go to yard sales and flea markets all over the country and buy tools that haven't been used in decades. There are a lot of people who aren't going to learn all those skills that don't translate into anything once they get downsized - and they will get downsized.

"The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000."

"The automotive industry needs 80,000 collision repair and technicians," he explained. "Energy, I don't even know what the number is — I hear 300,000; I hear 500,000." The latter is likely to do with not only nuclear-powered subs but also small modular reactors that are popping up across the United States to supply the growing power demand from data centers, new and old. Several large companies like Amazon and Microsoft are building new, massive data centers and campuses to house data and AI machine-learning systems. These new locations require so much power that they have put stress on existing power grids, necessitating their own energy sources.

Title: These 5 S&P 500 Stocks Show New Highs On Declining Relative Strength

ByJohn Navin ByJohn Navin, Contributor. S&P 500, Blackrock The S&P 500 on Friday hit another new high – it was brief as sellers showed up and the index closed lower by .01%. July has been a month of new highs. It’s also been a month of a declining relative strength indicator. This negative divergence between price and a key indicator might be a problem. The RSI, as it’s known to price chart analysts, is a momentum oscillator. Developed by technical analyst J. Welles Wilder, Junior in the 70s, his work on the subject was first published in the book “New Concepts In Technical Trading Systems.” Forbes in 1980 called him “the premier technical trader publishing his work today.” The issue is not just with the S&P 500. Big, well-known names within the index are also showing weakening relative strength per Wilder’s oscillator. S&P 500: S&P 500 daily price chart, 7 19 25. The red-dotted lines show the negative divergence between the direction of price and the direction of the RSI momentum oscillator. Blackrock: Blackrock daily price chart, 7 19 25. The big asset management firm hit a new high Friday and the relative strength indicator failed to confirm the move by coming in lower than it’s earlier July reading. The stock retreated from the higher price high during the session and closed lower by .16%. Blackrock is market capitalized at $170.97 billion. Genius Sports Limited: Genius Sports Limited daily price chart, 7 19 25. The price just hit a new high. The relative strength indicator peaked in November 2024 and did not accompany the stock on to a higher high on Friday. You can see how the 50-day moving average no longer trends upward. Genius Sports Limited has a market cap of $2.89 billion and it’s a member of the Russell 2000 small caps ETF. MMM: MMM daily price chart, 7 19 25. The relative strength indicator peaked in January and is now lower even as the stock’s price is hitting a new high. Friday’s volume is extraordinary. The candlestick is a bearish engulfing: the high is higher than the previous session and the low is lower than the previous session. MMM has a market cap of $82.47 billion. Raytheon Technologies: Raytheon Technologies daily price chart, 7 19 25. The aerospace and defense company with a market cap of $202 billion has a negative divergence on its daily price chart. The stock just hit a new high and, at the same time, the relative strength indicator could not make it above its mid-June reading. Note that July volume levels are subdued compared to earlier months. Charles Schwab: Charles Schwab daily price chart, 7 19 25. The RSI peak came in mid-May and the measure is now lower as the stock itself makes a new high on decent buying volume. Schwab remains in an uptrend as indicated by the direction of the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages. Market cap for the capital markets firm is $174 billion. The RSI is only one indicator of momentum and should be seen in the context of other price indicators. Stats courtesy of FinViz.com. Charts courtesy of Stockcharts.com.

Title: For-Profit Hospital Chain Reportedly Left Patient Lying in Pool of His Own Blood
URL: https://futurism.com/neoscope/for-profit-hospital-negligence
Time Published: 2025-07-19T14:30:41Z
Full Content:
For-profit rehabilitation hospitals are booming in the United States, but their rapid growth is leaving patient safety far behind. The US post-acute care industry, which deals with rehab and long-term care facilities, was worth an estimated $483 billion in 2024, and is expected to grow to over $785 billion by 2034. On paper, it's easy to assume all that business potential would translate to quality care. Unfortunately, for thousands of patients across the country, that couldn’t be further from the truth, as Encompass Health Corporation — the McDonald's of post-acute care, basically — makes clear. Bombshell reporting by the New York Times this week uncovered a horrifying track record by Encompass and other for-profit rehab outfits. Though negligence in rehab facilities might not seem as overtly dangerous as it is in generic hospital settings, it often leads to injuries, unplanned readmissions to general hospitals, and even death. At the Encompass facility in Jackson, Tennessee, for example, a 68-year-old patient was found lying in a pool of his own blood. Per the NYT, a pressure- and motion-triggered alarm meant to alert nurses if he left his bed had been turned off prior to the gruesome discovery. A patient in Morgantown, West Virginia, died a similarly preventable death, after a fall off the bed gave her a "huge gash" on her forehead. There, too, the hospital chain's alarms failed to notify staff in time. "We are having a lot of problems with the bed alarms," a nurse technician told police inspectors after the woman's death, according to an inspection report obtained by the NYT. Another incident in South Dakota led to the death of a 73-year-old man when a nurse administered the wrong drug. That was just one of 26 adverse drug events the Encompass site was responsible for over the span of just six months. Per the NYT, Encompass owns 168 hospitals, and was responsible for nearly 250,000 patients in 2024. In 2023, Encompass helped flip the rehabilitation sector from a mostly non-profit space to a predominantly profit-seeking one. Though non-profit rehab is its own kind of nightmare, particularly for low-income or "charity care" patients, this pivot to for-profit models has come with a notable increase in unplanned readmissions to general hospitals. Unlike nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), these types of errors in post-acute care aren't explicitly disclosed to Medicare recipients, elderly and disabled patients who are at heightened risk for medical neglect. Nor are ownership details, such as the involvement of private equity firms or real estate investment trusts — profit-seeking groups whose participation in the medical field leads to worse outcomes in patient care. That's not to say Medicare doesn't keep tabs on rehab facilities, however. As the NYT notes, out of the 41 inpatient rehab sites Medicare judged to have "statistically significantly worse rates of potentially preventable readmissions," 34 were owned and operated by Encompass. Though Encompass has toyed around with private equity spinoffs in the past, its main overlords are institutional investors — professional investment fund managers — such as Vanguard Group, whose fund Vanguard Health was ordered to pay $18 million in claims related to "grossly substandard nursing home services," and Blackrock, whose healthcare dealings have been mired in controversy. Speaking to the NYT, executive vice president and general counsel for Encompass, Patrick Darby, called Medicare's readmission ratings a "crude scoring measure." He added that health inspection violations are "rare occurrences" that "do not support an inference of widespread quality concerns." Whether this is empirically true or not remains to be seen, as the rapidly changing corporate rehab landscape demands further study. Still, it's hard to imagine the families of patients who died under Encompass's care share the executive's attitude.

Further, amid tariff wars while there is broad uncertainty including for India, on a relative basis India is being looked upon favourably, as global corporations look for alternative supply chains. One important source to distil their India plans is from their quarterly earnings calls. With the June quarter earnings season just about gathering momentum, we will bring to you what CXOs of global corporations are saying about India and their perspectives and plans during this earnings season in this column.

Title: Bitcoin Is Lost In Washington, and Nobody Is Looking for It

Bitcoin may be the most famous cryptocurrency on the planet, but in Washington, itâs suddenly the ghost at the party. This week, lawmakers passed the GENIUS Act, the first-ever U.S. law focused entirely on cryptocurrency. It sets clear federal rules for stablecoins, the digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar and used for instant payments. For the first time, crypto has a legal foundation in America. But hereâs the twist: the bill doesnât mention Bitcoin. And that silence speaks volumes. From Spotlight to Sideline For more than a decade, Bitcoin dominated every conversation about crypto. It was the revolution, the protest, the gold 2.0. Politicians warned about it, billionaires backed it, and banks feared it. Now? The U.S. government just passed the most important crypto law in history, and it didnât include Bitcoin at all. Why? Because Bitcoin doesnât fit the Washington agenda anymore. Stablecoins are the hot new thing in the halls of Congress. Theyâre pegged to the dollar, designed for payments, and (at least now) tightly regulated. Theyâre the kind of crypto lawmakers can get behind: useful, tame, and trackable. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is messy. Itâs volatile, anonymous, and built to operate outside the financial system. It doesnât want approval. It doesnât ask for permission. And that makes it a problem for lawmakers trying to modernize finance without surrendering control. Even as Wall Street piles into Bitcoin ETFs and companies like BlackRock embrace it as a long-term asset, D.C. remains silent. Bitcoin is being treated like a relic of cryptoâs rebellious past, not part of its regulated future. A Shift in Crypto Power The passage of the GENIUS Act is a political pivot. Stablecoins now have rules, protections, and the federal governmentâs blessing. Theyâre being embraced by banks, fintech firms, and maybe soon by everyday consumers sending money across borders or paying rent digitally. Bitcoin, meanwhile, is on the outside looking in. Still popular. Still powerful. But politically orphaned. If this trend continues, cryptoâs future may belong to the regulated, dollar-linked digital tokens, and not the decentralized dream that Bitcoin represents. The big question: can Bitcoin stay relevant in a post-GENIUS world? For now, Bitcoin remains king on Wall Street. But in Washington, itâs rapidly becoming an afterthought. In a town where the rules are now being written, thatâs a dangerous place to be. Bitcoincongressregulation Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A combination of Wall Street capital, corporate adoption, and a deepening supply crisis is quietly forging a new future for the worldâs most important blockchain. The GENIUS Act gives stablecoins real legal backing, paving the way for instant payments, lower fees, and a safer digital dollar you can actually trust. The GENIUS Act brings crypto out of the shadows and into the American financial system. Car buyers could lose up to $7,500 in federal incentives after September 30âbut the rules are murky, and the government hasnât said exactly what happens next. Entities linked to the president can now sell up to nearly $1 billion worth of $TRUMP. The question is: will they? The worldâs largest cryptocurrency is on a historic run fueled by new money and government spending, but some analysts warn this is not a normal rally.
