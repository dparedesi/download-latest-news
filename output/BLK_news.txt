Title: Ethereum TVL Set For Explosive Growth: Sharplink CEO Foresees Tenfold Surge In 2026

Joseph Chalom, the CEO of Sharplink, has outlined an optimistic forecast for Ethereum’s (ETH) future, emphasizing a significant increase in the total value locked (TVL) within the network in the coming year. According to a report from CoinMarketCap, Chalom anticipates that the stablecoin market will soar to $500 billion by December 2026. Currently, the total market capitalization for stablecoins stands at approximately $308.46 billion, suggesting a 62% growth from current figures. Given that Ethereum is responsible for processing over half of all stablecoin transactions across various blockchain networks, the projected expansion in stablecoin issuance and transaction volume is set to significantly elevate the network’s TVL. Chalom further predicts that the market for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) will also witness substantial growth, potentially reaching a total value of $300 billion next year. This is expected to move beyond tokenizing individual securities and funds to encompass complete fund complexes, thereby increasing Ethereum’s relevance in the financial ecosystem. Key to this expected growth is the increasing involvement of major financial institutions from traditional finance such as BlackRock, which has shown heightened interest in blockchain technologies over the past year. Chalom predicts that it could serve as a catalyst for moving significant assets onto Ethereum’s infrastructure. The rise in total value locked usually indicates increased network utilization, which can bolster market sentiment and may influence Ethereum price dynamics. Currently, data shows ETH’s TVL at approximately $68.20 billion. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen recently expressed skepticism about Ethereum reaching new price highs in 2026, particularly in light of Bitcoin’s (BTC) market conditions. However, Chalom anticipates that sovereign wealth fund holdings and tokenization efforts on Ethereum could grow five- to tenfold in the coming year. This potential increase is attributed to competitive pressures that may encourage institutional investors, who have previously been hesitant about cryptocurrency exposure, to reconsider their strategies as peer adoption accelerates. Moreover, Chalom believes that the integration of on-chain artificial intelligence (AI) agents and prediction markets will gain mainstream traction in 2026, further driving activity and adding value to the Ethereum ecosystem. Ultimately, Sharplink’s CEO stressed that the convergence of institutional interest from traditional finance firms, expanded applications, and the involvement of sovereign funds could significantly position Ethereum for impressive TVL growth in the near future. Currently, Ethereum is trading at around $2,930, marking a 13% year-to-date decline for the leading altcoin. Compared to its all-time high of $4,964 reached earlier this year, the cryptocurrency is currently trading 40% below this level.

Title: The Enshittifinancial Crisis

You’re gonna love it. If you have any issues signing up for premium, please email me at ez@betteroffline.com. One time, a good friend of mine told me that the more I learned about finance, the more pissed off I’d get. He was right. There is an echoing melancholy to this era, as we watch the end of Silicon Valley’s hypergrowth era, the horrifying result of 15+ years of steering the tech industry away from solving actual problems in pursuit of eternal growth. Everything is more expensive, and every tech product has gotten worse, all so that every company can “do AI,” whatever the fuck that means. We are watching one of the greatest wastes of money in history, all as people are told that there “just isn’t the money” to build things like housing, or provide Americans with universal healthcare, or better schools, or create the means for the average person to accumulate wealth. The money does exist, it just exists for those who want to gamble — private equity firms, “business development companies” that exist to give money to other companies, venture capitalists, and banks that are getting desperate and need an overnight shot of capital from the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Repurchase Facility or Discount Window, two worrying indicators of bank stress I’ll get into later. No, the money does not exist for you or me or a person. Money is for entities that could potentially funnel more money into the economy, even if the ways that these entities use the money are reckless and foolhardy, because the system’s intent on keeping entities alive incentivizes it. We are in an era where the average person is told to pull up their bootstraps, to work harder, to struggle more, because, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, it’s socialism for the rich and rugged free market capitalism for the poor. The “free market” is a fucking con. When you or I run out of money, our things are taken from us, we receive increasingly-panicked letters, we get phone calls and texts and emails and demands, we are told that all will be lost if we don’t “work it out,” because the financial system is not about an exchange of value but whether or not you can enter into the currently agreed-upon con. By letting neoliberalism and the scourge of the free markets rule, modern society created the conditions for what I call The Enshittifinancial Crisis — the place at which my friend Cory Doctorow’s Enshittification Theory meets my own Rot Economy Thesis in a fourth stage of Enshittification. Per The New Yorker: I’ll walk you through it. Facebook was a huge, free platform, much like Instagram, that offered fast and easy access to everybody you knew. It acquired Instagram in 2012 to kill off a likely competitor, and over time would start making both products worse — clickbait notifications, a mandatory algorithmic feed that deliberately emotionally manipulated people and stoked political division, eventually becoming full of AI slop and videos, all so that Meta could continue to sell billions of dollars of ads a quarter. Per Kyle Chayka of the New Yorker, “Facebook’s feed, now choked with A.I.-generated garbage and short-form videos, is well into the third act of enshittification.” The third stage is critical, in that it’s when the company also turns on its business customers. A Marketing Brew story from September of last year told the tale of multiple advertisers who found their campaigns switching to different audiences, wasting their money and getting questionable results. A New York Times story from 2021 described companies losing upwards of 70% of their revenue during a Facebook ads outage, another from 2018 described how Meta (then Facebook) deliberately hid issues with its measurement of engagement on videos from advertisers for over a year, and more recently, Meta’s ads tools started switching out top-performing ads with AI-generated ones, in one case targeting men aged 30 to 45 with an AI-generated grandma, all without warning the advertiser. Meta doesn’t give a shit, because investors and analysts don’t give a shit. I could say “sell-side analysts” here — the ones that are trying to get you to buy a stock — but based on every analyst report I’ve read from a major bank or hedge fund, I truly think everybody is complicit. In November 2025, Reuters revealed that Meta projected in late 2024 that 10% of its annual revenue ($16 billion) would come from advertisements for scams or banned goods, mere weeks after Meta announced a ridiculous $27 billion data center debt package, one that used deep accountancy magic to keep it off of its balance sheet despite Meta guaranteeing the entirety of the loan. One would think this would horrify investors for two reasons: One would be wrong. Morgan Stanley said a few weeks ago that it is “one of the handful of companies that can leverage its leading data, distribution and investments in AI,” and raised its target to $750, with a $1000-a-share bull case. Wedbush raised Meta’s price to $920, and Bank of America staunchly held firm at…$810. I can find no analyst commentary on Meta making sixteen billion dollars on fraud, because it doesn’t matter to them, because this is the Rot Economy, and all that matters is number go up. Reality — such as whether there’s any revenue in AI, or whether it’s a good idea that Meta is spending over $70 billion this year on capital expenditures on a product that has generated no revenue (and please, fucking spare me the bullshit around “Meta’s AI ads play,” that whole story is nonsense) — doesn’t matter to analysts, because stocks are thoroughly, inextricably enshittified, and analysts don’t even realize it’s happening. The stages of enshittification usually involve some sort of devil’s deal. We have now entered Enshittification Stage 4, where businesses turn on shareholders. Analysts and investors have become trapped in the same kind of loathsome platform play as consumers and businesses, and face exactly the same kinds of punishment through the devaluation of the stock itself. Where platforms have prioritized profits over the health and happiness of users or business customers, they are now prioritizing stock value over literally anything, and have — through the remarkable growth of tech stocks in particular — created a placated and thoroughly whipped investor and analyst sect that never asks questions and always celebrates whatever the next big thing is meant to be. The value of a “stock” is not based on whether the business is healthy, or its future certain, but on its potential price to grow, and analysts have, thanks to an incredible bull run of tech stocks going on over a decade, been able to say “I bet software will be big” for most of the time, going on CNBC or Bloomberg and blandly repeating whatever it is that a tech CEO just said, all without any worries about “responsibility” or “the truth.” This is because big tech stocks — and many other big stocks, if I’m honest — have made their lives easy as long as they don’t ask questions. Number always seems to be going up for software companies, and all you need to do is provide a vociferous defense of the “next big thing,” and come up with a smart-sounding model that justifies eternal growth. This is entirely disconnected from the products themselves, which don’t matter as long as Number Go Up. If net income is high and the company estimates it will continue to grow, then the company can do whatever the fuck it want with the product it sells or the things that it buys. Software Has Eaten The World in the sense that Andreesen got his wish, with investors now caring more about the “intrinsic value” of software companies rather than the businesses or products themselves. And because that’s happening, investors aren’t bothering to think too hard about the tech itself, or the deteriorating products underlying tech companies, because “these guys have always worked it out” and “these companies have always managed to keep growing.” As a result, nobody really looks too deep. Minute changes to accounting in earnings filings are ignored, egregious amounts of debt are waved off, and hundreds of billions of dollars of capital expenditures are seen as “the new AI revolution” versus “a huge waste of money.” By incentivizing the Rot Economy — making stocks disconnected from the value of the company beyond net income and future earnings guidance — companies have found ways to enshittify their own stocks, and shareholders will be the ones who suffer, all thanks to the very downstream pressure that they’ve chosen to ignore for decades. You see, while one might (correctly) see that the deterioration of products like Facebook and Google Search was a sign of desperation, it’s important to also see it as the companies themselves orienting around what they believe analysts and investors want to see. You can also interpret this as weakness, but I see it another way: stock manipulation, and a deliberate attempt to reshape what “value” means in the eyes of customers and investors. If the true value of a stock is meant to be based on the value of its business, cash flow, earnings and future growth, a company deliberately changing its products is an intentional interference with value itself, as are any and all deceptive accounting practices used to boost valuations. But the real problem is that analysts do not…well…analyze, not, at least, if it goes against the market consensus. That’s why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Futurum and Gartner and Forrester and McKinsey and Morgan Stanley all said that the metaverse was inevitable — because they do not actually care about the underlying business itself, just its ability to grow on paper. Need proof that none of these people give a fuck about actual value? Mark Zuckerberg burned $77 billion on the metaverse, creating little revenue or shareholder value and also burning all that money without any real explanation as to where it went. The street didn’t give a shit because meta’s existent ads business continued to grow, same as it didn’t give a shit that Mark Zuckerberg burned $70 billion on capex, even though we also really don’t know where that went either. In fact, we really have no idea where all this AI spending is going. These companies don’t tell us anything. They don’t tell us how many GPUs they have, or where those GPUs are, or how many of them are installed, or what their capacity is, or how much money they cost to run, or how much money they make. Why would we? Analysts don’t even look at earnings beyond making sure they beat on estimates. They’ve been trained for 20 years to take a puddle-deep look at the numbers to make sure things look okay, look around their peers and make sure nobody else is saying something bad, and go on and collect fees. The same goes for hedge funds and banks propping up these stocks rather than asking meaningful questions or demanding meaningful answers. In the last two years, every major hyperscaler has extended the “useful life” of its servers from 3 years to either 5.5 or 6 years — and in simple terms, this allowed them to incur a smaller depreciation expense each quarter as a result, boosting net income. Those who are meant to be critical — analysts and investors sinking money into these stocks — had effectively no reaction, despite the fact that Meta used (per the Wall Street Journal) this adjustment to reduce its expenses by $2.3 billion in the first three quarters of this year. This is quite literally disconnected from reality, and done based on internal accounting that we are not party to. Every single tech firm buying GPUs did this and benefited to the tune of billions of dollars in decreased revenues, and analysts thought it was fine and dandy because number went up. Shareholders are now subordinate to the shares themselves, reacting in the way that the shares demand they do, being happy for what the companies behind the shares give them, and analysts, investors and even the media spend far more energy fighting the doubters than they do showing these companies scrutiny. Much like a user of an enshittified platform, investors and analysts are frogs in a pot, the experience of owning a stock deteriorating since Jack Welch and GE taught corporations that the markets are run with the kind of simplistic mindset built for grifter exploitation. And much like those platforms, corporations have found as many ways as possible to abuse shareholders, seeing what they can get away with, seeing how far they can push things as long as the numbers look right, because analysts are no longer looking for sensible ideas. Let me give you an example I’ve used before. Back in November 1998, Winstar Communications signed a “$2 billion equipment and finance agreement with Lucent Technologies” where Winstar would borrow money from Lucent to buy stuff from Lucent, all to create $100 million in revenue over 5 years. In December 1999, Barron’s wrote a piece called “In 1999 Tech Ruled”: Airnet? Bankrupt. WinStar? Horribly bankrupt. While Ciena survived, it had spent over a billion dollars to acquire other companies (all stock, of course), only to see its revenue dwindle basically overnight from $1.6bn to $300 million as the optical cable industry collapsed. One would have been able to work out that Winstar was a dog, or that all of these companies were dogs, if you were to look at the numbers, such as “how much they made versus how much they were spending.” Instead, analysts, the media and banks chose to pump up these stocks because the numbers kept getting bigger, and when the collapse happened, rationalizations were immediately created — there were a few bad apples (Enron, Winstar, WorldCom), “the fiber was useful” and thus laying it was worthwhile, and otherwise everything was fine. The problem, in everybody else’s mind, was that everybody had got a bit distracted and some companies that weren’t good would die. All of that lost money was only a problem because it didn’t pay off. This was a misplaced gamble, and it taught tech executives one powerful lesson: earnings must be good, without fail, by any means necessary, and otherwise nothing else matters to Wall Street. It’s all about incentives. A sell-side analyst that tells you not to buy something is a problem. A journalist that is skeptical or critical of an industry in the midst of a growth or hype cycle is considered a “hater” — don’t I fucking know it. Analysts that do not sing the same tune as everybody else are marginalized, mocked and aggressively policed. And I don’t fucking care. Stop being fucking cowards. By not being skeptical or critical you are going to lead regular people into the jaws of another collapse. The dot com bubble was actually a great time to start reevaluating how and why we value stocks — to say “hey, wait, that $2 billion deal will only make $100 million in revenue?” or “this company spends $5 for every $1 it makes!” — but nobody, it appears, remained particularly suspicious of the tech industry, or a stock market that was increasingly orienting itself around conning shareholders. And because shareholders, analysts and the media alike refused to retain a single shred of suspicion leaving the dot com era, the mania never actually subsided. Financial publications still found themselves dedicated to explaining why the latest hype cycle was real. Journalists still found themselves told by editors that they had to cover the latest fad, even if it was nonsensical or clearly rotten. Analysts still grabbed their swords and rushed to protect the very companies that have spent decades misleading them. Much like we spent years saying that Facebook was a “good deal” because it was free, analysts and investors say tech stocks are “great to hold” because they kept growing, even if the reason they “kept growing” was a series of interlocking monopolies, difficult-to-leave platforms and impossible-to-fight traction and pricing, all of which have an eventual sell-by date. I realize I’m pearl-clutching over the amoral status of capitalism and the stock market, but hear me out: what if we’re actually in a 15-to-20-year-long knife-catching competition? What if all anybody has done is look at cashflow, net income, future growth guidance, and called it a day? A lack of scrutiny has allowed these companies to do effectively anything they want, bereft of worrisome questions like "will this ever make a profit?" What if we basically don’t know what the fuck is going on? What if all of this was utterly senseless? As I wrote last year, the tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, facing something I call “the Rot Com bubble.” In simple terms, they’re only “doing AI” because there do not appear to be any other viable ideas to continue the Rot Economy’s eternal growth-at-all-costs dance. Yet because growth hasn’t slowed yet, analysts, the media and other investors are quick to claim that AI is “paying off,” even if nobody has ever said how much AI revenue is being generated or, in the case of Salesforce, they can say “nearly $1.4 billion ARR,” which sounds really big until you realize a company with $10.9 billion in revenue is boasting about making less than $116 million in revenue in a month. Nevertheless, because Salesforce set a new revenue target of $60 billion by 2030, the stock jumped 4%. It doesn’t matter that most Agentforce customers don’t pay for the service, or that AI isn’t really making much money, or really anything, other than Number Go Up. The era we live in is one of abject desperation, to the point that analysts and investors — and shareholders by extension — will take any abuse from management. They will allow companies to spend as much money as they want in whatever ways they want, as long as it continues the charade of “number go up.” Let me spell it out a little more, using the latest earnings of various hyperscalers as an example. We have no idea, because analysts and investors are in an abusive relationship with tech stocks. It is fundamentally insane that Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have spent $776 billion in capital expenditures in the space of three years, and even more so that analysts and investors, when faced with such egregious numbers, simply sit back and say “they’re building the infrastructure of the future, baby!” Analysts and traders and investors and reporters do not think too hard about the underlying numbers, because doing so immediately makes you run head-first into a number of worrying questions such as “where did all that money go?” and “will any of this pay off?” and “how many GPUs do they actually own?” Analysts have, on some level, become the fractional marketing team for the stocks they’re investing in. When Oracle announced its $300 billion deal with OpenAI in September — one that Oracle does not have the capacity to fill and OpenAI does not have the money to pay for – analysts heaved and stammered like horny teenagers seeing their first boob: These are the same people that retail and institutional investors rely upon for advice on what stocks to buy, all acting with the disregard for the truth that comes from years of never facing a consequence. Three months later, and Oracle has lost basically all of the stock bump it saw from the OpenAI deal, meaning that any retail investor that YOLO’d into the trade because, say, analysts from major institutions said it was a good idea and news outlets acted like this deal was real, already got their ass kicked. And please, spare me the “oh they shouldn’t trade off of analysts” bullshit. That’s the kind of victim-blaming that allows these revered fuckwits to continue farting out these meaningless calls. In reality, we’re in an era of naked, blatant, shameless stock manipulation, both privately and publicly, because a “stock” no longer refers to a unit of ownership in a company so much as it is a chip at a casino where the house constantly changes the rules. Perhaps you’re able to occasionally catch the house showing its hand, and perhaps the house meant for you to see it. Either way, you are always behind, because the people responsible for buying and selling stocks at scale under the auspices of “knowing what’s going on” don’t seem to know what they’re talking about, or don’t care to find out. Let’s walk through the latest surge of blatant stock manipulation, and how the media and analysts helped it happen. Oracle announces its unfillable, unpayable $300 billion deal with OpenAI, leading to 30%+ bump in stock price. Analysts, who should ostensibly be able to count, call it “momentous” and say they’re “in shock.” On September 22 2025, CEO Safra Catz steps down, and nobody seems to think that’s weird or suspicious. Two months later, Oracle’s stock is down 40%, with investors worried about Oracle’s growing capex, which is surprising I suppose if you didn’t think about how Oracle would build the fucking data centers. Basically anyone who traded into this got burned. NVIDIA announced a “strategic partnership” to invest “up to $100 billion” and build 10GW of data centers with OpenAI, with the first gigawatt to be deployed in the second half of 2026. Where would the data centers go? How would OpenAI afford to build them? How would OpenAI build a gigawatt in less than a year? Don’t ask questions, pig! NVIDIA’s stock bumped from from $175.30 to $181 in the space of a day. The media wrote about the story as if the deal was done, with CNBC claiming that “the initial $10 billion tranche [was] expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized.” I read at least ten stories that said that “NVIDIA had invested $100 billion.” Analysts would say that NVIDIA was “locking in OpenAI” to “remain the backbone of the next-gen AI infrastructure,” that “demand for NVIDIA GPUs is effectively baked into the development of frontier AI models,” that the deal “[strengthened] the partnership between the two companies…[and] validates NVIDIA’s long-term growth numbers with so much volume and compute capacity.” Others would say that NVIDIA was “enabling OpenAI to meet surging demand.” Three analysts — Rasgon at Bernstein, Luria at D.A. Davidson and Wagner at Aptus Capital — all raised circular deal concerns, but they were the minority, and those concerns were still often buried under buoyant optimism about the prospects of the company. One eensy weensy problem though, everyone! This was a “letter of intent” — it said so in the announcement! — and on NVIDIA’s November earnings, it said that it “entered into a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest in OpenAI.” It turns out the deal didn’t exist and everybody fell for it! NVIDIA hasn’t sent a dime and likely won’t. A letter of intent is a “concept of a plan.” Back in October, Reuters reported that Samsung and SK Hynix had "signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers," with South Korea's presidential office saying that said chip demand was expected to reach "900,000 wafers a month," with "much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix," which was quickly extrapolated to mean around 40% of global DRAM output. Stocks in both companies, to quote Reuters, “soared,” with Samsung climbing 4% and SK Hynix more than 12% to an all-time high. Analyst Jeff Kim of KB Securities said that “there have been worries about high bandwidth memory prices falling next year on intensifying competition, but such worries will be easily resolved by the strategic partnership,” adding that “Since Stargate is a key project led by President Trump, there also is a possibility the partnership will have a positive impact on South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S.” Donald Trump is not “leading Stargate.” Stargate is a name used to refer to data centers built by OpenAI. KB Securities has around $43 billion of assets under management. This is the level of analysis you get from these analysts! This is how much they know! On SK Hynix's October 29 2025 earnings call, weeks after the announcement, its CEO, Kim Woo-Hyun, was asked a question about High Bandwidth Memory growth by SK Kim from Daiwa Securities: This is the only mention of OpenAI. Otherwise, SK Hynix has not added any guidance that would suggest that its DRAM sales will spike beyond overall growth, other than mentioning it had "completed year 2026 supply discussions with key customers." There is no mention of OpenAI in any earnings presentation. On Samsung's October 30 2025 earnings call, Samsung mentioned the term "DRAM" 18 times, and neither mentioned OpenAI nor any letters of intent. In its Q3 2025 earnings presentation, Samsung mentions it will "prioritize the expansion of the HBM4 [high bandwidth memory 4] business with differentiated performance to address increasing AI demand." Analysts do not appear to have noticed a lack of revenue from an apparent deal for 40% of the world’s RAM! Oh well! Pobody’s nerfect! Both Samsung and SK Hynix’s stocks have continued to rise since, and you’d be forgiven for thinking this deal was something to do with it, even though it wasn’t. AMD announced that it had entered a “multi-year, multi-generation agreement” with OpenAI to build 6 GW of data centers, with “the first 1GW deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026,” calling the agreement “definitive” with terms that allowed OpenAI to buy up to 10% of AMD’s stock, vesting over “specific milestones” that started with the first gigawatt of data center development. Said data centers would also use AMD’s yet-to-be-released MI450 GPUs. The deal would, per Reuters, bring in “tens of billions of dollars of revenue.” Where would those data centers go? How would OpenAI pay for them? Would the chips be ready in time? Silence, worm! How dare you ask questions? How dare you? Why are you asking questions? NUMBER GO UP! AMD’s shares surged by 34%, with analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush saying that this was a “major valuation moment” for AMD. As an aside, Ives said that NVIDIA would benefit from the metaverse in 2021, and told CBS News in November 22 2021 that “the metaverse [was] real and Wall Street [was] looking for winners.” One would think that AMD’s November earnings — a month after the announcement — might be a barn-burner full of remaining performance obligations from OpenAI. In fact, CEO Lisa Su said that “[AMD expected] this partnership will significantly accelerate [its] data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100 billion in revenue over the next few years.” Here’s how AMD’s 10-Q filing referred to it: …so, no revenue from OpenAI at all, I guess? AMD raised guidance by 35% over the next five years AMD's trailing 12-month revenue is $32 billion. "Tens of billions of dollars" would surely lead to more than a 35% boost (an increase of $11.2 billion or so) in the next five years? Guess all of that was for nothing. No follow-up from the media, no questions from analysts, just a shrug and we all move on. Anyway, AMD’s stock is now down from a high of $259 at the end of October to around $214 as of writing this sentence. Everybody who traded in based on analyst and media comments got fucked. So, back on September 5, Broadcom said on its earnings call that it had a $10 billion order from a mystery customer, which analysts quickly assumed was OpenAI, leading to the stock popping 9%, and gradually increasing to a high of $369 or so on September 10, before declining a little until October 13, when Broadcom announced its ridiculous 10 gigawatt deal with OpenAI, claiming that it would deploy 10GW of OpenAI-designed chips, with the first racks to deploy the second half of 2026 and the entire deployment completed by end of 2029. The same day, its president of semiconductor solutions Charlie Kawwas added that said mystery customer was actually somebody else: Nevertheless, Broadcom's stock popped by 9% on the news about the 10GW deal, with CNBC adding that "the companies have been working together for 18 months." Because it's OpenAI, nobody sat and thought about whether somebody at Broadcom saying "well, OpenAI has yet to order these chips yet" was a problem. In fact, the answer to “how does OpenAI afford this?” appeared to be “they’d afford it” when it came to analysts: Not to worry, OpenAI’s solution was far simpler: it didn’t order any chips. During Broadcom's November earnings call, where Broadcom revealed that the $10 billion order was actually from Anthropic, another LLM startup that burns billions of dollars, which was buying Google's TPUs, and also booked another $11 billion in orders. Analysts somehow believed that Anthropic is “positioned to spend heavily” despite being another venture-backed welfare recipient in the same flavor as OpenAI. Oh, right, that 10GW OpenAI deal. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that he did “not expect much in 2026” from the deal, and guidance did not change to reflect it. Broadcom climbed to a high of $412 leading up to its earnings, and I imagine it did so based on people trading on the belief that OpenAI and Broadcom were doing a deal together, which does not appear to be happening. While there’s an alleged $73 billion backlog, every dollar from Anthropic is questionable. Actually, yes we can. Whenever a company says “letter of intent” — as NVIDIA and SK Hynix/Samsung did — it’s important to immediately stop taking the deal seriously until you get the word “contract” involved. Not “agreement” or “deal” or “announcement,” but “contract,” because contracts are the only thing that actually matters. Similarly, it’s time for everybody — analysts, the media, members of congress, the fucking pope, I don’t care — to start treating these companies with suspicion, and to start demanding timelines. NVIDIA and Microsoft announced their $15 billion investment in Anthropic over a month ago. Where’s the money? Why does the agreement say “up to $10 billion” for NVIDIA and “up to $5 billion” from Microsoft? These subtle details suggest that the deal is not going to be for $15 billion, and the lack of activity suggests it might not happen at all. These deals are announced with the intention of suggesting there is more revenue and money in generative AI than actually exists. Furthermore, it is irresponsible and actively harmful for analysts and the media to continually act as if these deals will actually get paid when you consider the financial conditions of these companies. As part of its alleged funding announcement with NVIDIA and Microsoft, Anthropic agreed to purchase $30 billion of Azure compute. It also agreed to spend "tens of billions of dollars" with Google Cloud. It ordered $10 billion in chips from Broadcom earlier in the year, and apparently placed another $11 billion order in its latest fiscal quarter. How does it pay for those? It allegedly will burn $2.8 billion this year (I believe it burned much, much more) and raised $16.5 billion in funding (before Microsoft and NVIDIA’s involvement, which we cannot confirm has actually happened). How are investors tolerating Broadcom not directly stating “the future financial condition of this company is questionable”? Has Broadcom created a reserve for this deal? If not, why not? Anthropic will make no more than $5 billion this year, and has raised $17.5bn (with a further $2.5bn coming in the form of debt). How can it foreseeably afford to pay $10 billion, or $11 billion, or $21 billion, considering its already massive losses and all those other obligations mentioned? Will Jensen Huang hand over $10 billion so that Anthropic can hand it to Broadcom? I realize the counter-argument is that companies aren’t responsible for their counterparties’ financial health, but my argument is that it’s the responsibility of any public company to give a realistic view of its financial health, which includes noting if a chunk of its revenue is from a startup that can’t afford to pay for its orders. There is no counter to that! Anthropic cannot afford to pay Broadcom $10 billion right now! Nevertheless, the problem is that in any bubble, being really stupid and ignorant works right up until it doesn’t, and however harsh the dot com bubble might have been, it wasn’t harsh enough and those who were responsible were left unpunished and unashamed, guaranteeing that this cycle would happen again. I want to be really, abundantly clear about what’s happening: every single stock you see “growing because of AI” outside of those selling RAM and GPUs is actually growing because of something else. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta all have other products that are making them money. AI is not doing it, and because analysts and investors do not think about things for two seconds, they have allowed themselves to be beaten down and turned into supplicants for public stocks. Investors have allowed themselves to be played, and the results will be worse than the dot com bubble bursting by several echelons. I’m gonna be really simplistic for a second. I am skeptical of AI because everybody loses money. I believe every AI company is unprofitable with margins that are getting increasingly worse as they scale, and as a result that none of them will be able to either get acquired or go public. This means that venture capitalists that have sunk money into AI stocks are going to be sitting on a bunch of assets under management (AUM) — the same assets they collect fees on — that will eventually crater or go to zero, because there will be no way for any liquidity event to occur. This is at a time of historically-low liquidity for venture capitalists, with Pitchbook estimating there will only be $100.8 billion in venture capital funds available at the end of 2025. Venture capitalists raise money from limited partners, who invest in venture capital with the hope of returns that outpace investing in the public markets. Venture capital vastly overinvested during 2021 and 2022, This was also a problem in private equity. In simple terms, this means these funds are sitting on tons of stock that they cannot shift, and the longer it takes for a company to either go public or acquired, the more likely it is the VC or PE firm will have to mark down its value. This is so bad that according to Carta, as of August 2024, less than 10% of VC funds raised in 2021 have made any distributions to their investors. In a piece from September, Carta revealed that “about 15% of funds” from 2023 have generated any disbursements as of Q2 2025, and the median net internal rate of return was a median 0.1%, meaning that, at best, most investors got their money back and absolutely nothing else. In fact, investing in venture capital has kinda fucking sucked. According to Carta, “As of the end of Q2, most VC funds across all recent vintages had a TVPI somewhere between 0.8x and 2x. But there are some areas where standout TVPIs are surfacing.” TVPI means Total Value To Paid-in Capital, or the amount of money you made for each dollar invested. This chart may seem confusing, it tells you that for the most part, VCs have struggled to provide even money returns since 2017. A “decent” TVPI is 2.5x, and as you’ll see, things have effectively collapsed since 2021. Companies are not going public or being acquired at the same rate, meaning that investor capital is increasingly locked up, meaning that limited partners are still waiting for a payoff from the last bubble, let alone this one. Carta would update the piece in December 2025, and things would somehow get worse. TVPI soured further, suggesting a further lack of exits across the board. The only slight improvement was the median IRR rose to 0.5% for funds from 2021 and 0.1% for funds from 2022. In simple terms, we are looking at years of locked-up capital leaving venture capital cash-starved and a little desperate. The worst part? All of this is happening during a generational increase in the amounts that startups need to raise thanks to the ruinous costs of generative AI, and the negative margins of AI-powered services. To quote myself: None of these companies are profitable, nor do they have any path to an acquisition or IPO. Why? Because even the most advanced AI software company is ultimately prompting Anthropic or OpenAI’s models, meaning that their only real intellectual property is those prompts and their staff, and whatever they can build around the models they don’t control, which has been obvious from the meager “acquisitions” we’ve seen so far. Windsurf, which was allegedly being sold to OpenAI, ended up selling its assets to Cognition in July, with Google paying $2.4 billion for its co-founders and a “licensing agreement,” similar to its acquisition of Character.Ai, where it paid $2.7 billion to rehire Noam Shazeer, license its tech, and pay off the stock of its remaining staff. This is also exactly what Microsoft did with Inflection AI and its co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. OpenAI’s acquisitions of Statsig ($1.1bn), Io Products ($6.5bn) and Neptune ($400m) were all-stock. Every other acquisition — Wiz, Confluent, Informatica, and so on (CRN has a great list here) — is either somebody trying to pretend that (for example) Wiz is related to AI, or trying to say that a data streaming platform is AI-related because AI needs that, which may be true, but doesn’t mean that any AI startups are actually selling. And they’re not, which is a problem, as 41% of US venture dollars in 2025 have gone into AI as of August, and according to Axios, the global number was around 51%. A crisis is brewing. Nerdlawyer, back in October, wrote about the explosive growth of secondary markets: In simpler terms, there are now Hot Potato Funds, where either another limited partner buys another one’s allocation, the companies themselves buy back their stock, or the stock is resold to other private investors. While this piece frames this as a positive, the reality is far grimmer. Venture capitalists are sitting on piles of immovable equity in companies worth far less than they invested at, and the answer, it appears, is to find somebody else to buy the dead weight. According to Newcomer, only 1117 venture funds closed in 2025 (down from 2100 in 2024), and 43% of dollars raised went to the largest venture funds, per The New York Times and PitchBook, suggesting limited partners are becoming less-interested in pumping cash into the system at a time when AI startups are demanding more capital than has ever been raised. How long can the venture capital industry keep handing out $100 million to $500 million to multiple startups a year? Because all signs suggest that the current pace of funding must continue in perpetuity, as nobody appears to have worked out that generative AI is inherently unprofitable, and thus every single company is on the Silicon Valley Welfare System until everybody gives up, or the system itself cannot sustain the pressure. I’ve read too many people make off-handed comments about this “being like the dot com boom” and saying that “lots of startups might die but what’s left over will be good,” and I hate them for both their flippancy and ignorance. None of the current stack of AI companies can survive on their own, meaning that the venture capital industry is holding them up. If even one of these companies falters and dies, the entire narrative will die. If that happens, it will be harder for AI companies to raise, and even harder to sell an AI company to someone else. This is a punishment for a decade-plus of hubris, where companies were invested in without ever considering a path to profitability. Venture capital has made the same mistake again and again, believing that because Uber, or Facebook, or Airbnb, or any number of companies founded nearly twenty years ago were unprofitable (with paths to profitability in all three cases, mind), it was totally okay to keep pumping up companies that had no path to profitability, which eventually became “had no apparent business model” (see: the metaverse, web3), which eventually became “have negative margins so severe and valuations so high that we will need an IPO at a market cap higher than Netflix.” This is Silicon Valley’s Rot Economy — the desperate, growth-at-all-costs attachment to startups where you “really like the founder,” where “the market could be huge” (who knows if it is!), where you just don’t need to worry about profitability because IPOs and exits were easy. Venture capital also used to be easy, because we were still in the era of hypergrowth. You could be a stupid asshole that doesn’t know anything, but there were so many good deals, and the more well-known you were, the more likely you’d be brought them first, guaranteeing a bigger payout, guaranteeing more LP capital, guaranteeing more opportunities that were of a higher quality because you were a big name. It was easier to make a valuable company, easier to get funded, and easier to sell, because the goal was always “get funded, grow as large an audience as possible, or go public/get acquired.” As a result, venture capital encouraged growth-at-all-costs thinking. In 2010, Ben Horwitz said that “the only thing worse for an entrepreneur than start-up hell (bankruptcy) is start-up purgatory”: This poisonous theory paid off, in that startups got used to building high-growth, low-margin companies that would easily sell to other companies or the markets themselves. Until it didn’t, of course. Per Nerdlawyer, IPOs have collapsed as an exit route, along with easy-to-raise capital. Per PitchBook, since 2022, 70% of VC-backed exits were valued at less than the capital put in, with more than a third of them being startups buying other startups in 2024. The money is drying up as the value of VCs’ assets is decreasing, at a time when VCs need more money than ever, because everybody is heavily leveraged in the single-most-expensive funding climate in history. And as we hit this historic liquidity crisis, the two largest companies — OpenAI and Anthropic — are becoming drains on the system that, in a very real sense, are participating in a massive redistribution of capital reserved for startups to one of a few public companies. No, really! OpenAI is trying to raise as much as $100 billion in funding so it can continue to pass money to one of a few public companies — $38 billion to Amazon Web Services over seven years, $22.4 billion to CoreWeave over five years, and $250 billion over an indeterminate period on Microsoft Azure. If successful, OpenAI’s venture telethon will raise more money than has ever been raised in a single round, draining funds that actual startups need. Anthropic has agreed to $70 billion in compute and chip deals across Google, Amazon and Broadcom, and that’s not including the Hut8 compute deal that Google is backing. This money will come from what remains of venture capital, private equity and hyperscaler generosity. Yet elsewhere, even the money that goes to regular startups is ultimately being sent to hyperscalers. That AI startup that needs to keep raising $100 million in a single round isn’t sending that cash to other startups — it’s mostly going to OpenAI (Microsoft, Amazon, CoreWeave, Google), Anthropic (Google, Microsoft, Amazon), or one of the large hyperscalers for Azure, AWS or Google Cloud. Silicon Valley didn’t birth the next big tech firm. It incubated yet another hyperscaler-level parasite, except instead of just spending money on hyperscaler services (and raising money to do so), both Anthropic and OpenAI actively drain the venture capital system as well, as they both burn billions of dollars. By creating something that’s incredibly expensive to run, they naturally create startups more-dependent on the venture capital system, and the venture capital system has no idea what to do other than say “just grow, baby!” Both OpenAI and Anthropic’s models might be getting cheaper on a per-million-token basis, but use more tokens, increasing the cost of inference, which in turn increases the costs of startups doing business, which in turn means OpenAI, Anthropic, and all connected startups lose more money, which increases the burn on venture capital. This is a doom-spiral, one that can only be reversed through the most magical and aggressive turnaround we will have seen in history, and it will have to happen next year, without fail. It won’t. So why did venture do this? Folks, we haven’t seen values this big in a long time. These are the biggest numbers we’ve ever seen. They’re simply tremendous. OpenAI is maybe worth $830 billion dollars, can you believe that? They lose so much money but folks we don’t worry about that, because they’re growing so fast. We love that Clammy Sam Altman — they call him “Clamuel” — tells everybody he’s giving them one billion dollars. Data centers are going to have the biggest deals we’ve ever seen, even [tchhh sound through teeth] if we have to work with Dario. You see, right now AI startups are big, exciting news for the limited partners funding LLM firms. Things feel exciting because the value of the assets under management (AUM) are going up, which is nothing dodgy, but just how VCs value things and if they are valuing AI stocks, that is how their fees are paid. Investing early in OpenAI allows a VC — or even an asset manager like Blackstone, which invested in 2024 — to say it has a big holding and a big increase in its AUM. We are currently in the sowing stage. Nevertheless, AI stocks make VCs who bet on them two years ago look like geniuses on paper. You got in early on OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Cognition, Perplexity or any other company that loves to burn several dollars per dollar of revenue, you have a big, beautiful number, the biggest you’ve ever seen, and your limited partners need to pay you a fee just to manage it. Venture capital hasn’t seen valuations like this in a long time, and on paper, it feels like a lot of VCs got in on companies worth billions of dollars. On paper, Cognition is worth $10.2 billion, Perplexity $18 billion, Cursor $29.3 billion, Lovable $6.6 billion, Cohere $6.8 billion, Replit $3 billion, and Glean $7.2 billion — massive valuations for companies that all basically do products that OpenAI or Anthropic or Amazon or Google or any number of Chinese companies are already working to clone. They are all losing tons of money and have no path to profitability. But right now the numbers are simply tremendous. I’ve heard venture capitalists tell me that there are times when they have to agree to invest with little to no information or know that they’ll lose the opportunity to another sucker investor. I’ve heard venture capitalists say they don’t have any insight into finances. Venture capitalists would, of course, claim I’m insane, saying that the “growth is obviously there” while pointing to whatever startup has made $100 million ARR ($8.3 million in a month), all while not discussing the underlying operating expenses. The idea, I believe, is that the current spate of AI spending is only set to increase next year, and that will…somehow lead to fixing margins? Venture capitalists staunchly refuse to learn anything other than “invest in growth and then profit from growth,” even if “profiting from growth” doesn’t seem to be happening anymore. In reality, venture capital shouldn’t have touched LLMs with a fifteen foot pole, because the margins were obviously, blatantly bad from the very beginning. We knew OpenAI would lose $5 billion in the middle of 2024. A sane venture capital climate would have fucking panicked, but instead chose to double, triple and quadruple down. I believe that massive valuation drawdowns are a certainty. There are losses coming. Venture capitalists, I have to ask you: what happens if OpenAI dies? Do you think that this will make investors interested in funding or acquiring other AI startups? How much longer are we going to do this? When will venture capital realize it’s setting itself up for disaster? And what, exactly, is the plan? OpenAI and Anthropic will suck the lakes dry like an NVIDIA GPU named after Nancy Reagan. How is this meant to continue, and what will be left when it does? The answer is simple: there won’t be money for venture capital for a while. Those AI holdings are going to be worth, at best, 50%, if they retain any value at all. Once one of these startups die, a panic will ensue, sending venture capitalists scrambling to get their holdings acquired, until there’s little or no investor interest left. Why would LPs ever trust venture capital after this? Why would anybody? Because based on the past four years, it doesn’t appear that venture capital is actually good at investing money — it just got lucky, year after year, until there were few ideas that could sell for hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Venture capital believed it knew better as it turned its back on basic business fundamentals, starting with Clubhouse, crypto, the metaverse, and now generative AI. Yet they’re far from the only fuckwits on the dickhead express. Per Bloomberg, there were at least $178.5 billion in data-center credit deals in the US in 2025, rivaling the $215.4 billion invested in US venture capital in 2024 and the $197.2 billion invested in US VC through August 7 2025, and over $100 billion more than the $60.69 billion of data center credit deals done in 2024. I’m very worried, and I’m going to tell you why, using a company called CoreWeave that I’ve been actively warning people about since March. CoreWeave is something called a “neocloud.” It’s a company that sells AI compute, and does so by renting out NVIDIA GPUs, and as I explained a few months ago, it does so by building data centers backed by endless debt: CoreWeave is one of the largest providers of AI compute in the world, and its business model is indicative of how most data center companies make money, and to explain my concerns, I’m going to explain why using this chart from CoreWeave’s Q2 2025 earnings presentation. First, CoreWeave signs contracts — such as its $14 billion deal with Meta and $22.4 billion deal with OpenAI — before it has the physical infrastructure to service them. It then raises debt using this contract as collateral, orders the GPUs from NVIDIA, which arrive after three months, and then take another three months to install, at which point monthly client payments begin. To really simplify this: data center developers are raising money months up to a year before they ever expect to make a penny. In fact, I can find no consistent answer to “how long a data center takes to build,” and the answer here is pretty important, because that’s how the money is gonna get made from these things. You may notice that “monthly payments” begin at 6 to 30 months, a curious and broad blob of time. You see, data centers are extremely difficult to build, and the concept of an “AI data center” is barely a few years old, with the concept of hundreds of megawatts in one data center campus entirely made up of AI GPUs barely two years old, which means basically everybody building one is doing so for the first time, and even experienced developers are running into problems. For example, Core Scientific, CoreWeave’s weird partner organization it tried and failed to buy, has been trying to convert its Denton Texas cryptocurrency mining data center into an AI data center since November 2024, specifically so that CoreWeave can rent it to Microsoft for OpenAI. This hasn’t gone well, with the Wall Street Journal reporting a few weeks ago that Denton has been wracked with “several months” of delays thanks to rainstorms preventing contractors from pouring concrete. The cluster is apparently going to have 260MW of capacity. What this means for CoreWeave is that it can’t start getting paid by OpenAI, because, per its contract, customers don’t have to start paying until the compute is actually available. This is a very important detail to know for literally any data center development you’ve ever seen. As of its latest Q3 2025 earnings filing, CoreWeave is sitting on $1.1 billion in deferred revenue (income for services not yet rendered), up from $951 million in Q2 2025 and $436 million in Q1 2025. This means deposits have been made, but the contract has yet to be serviced. Now, I’m a curious little critter, so I went and found the 921-page $2.6 billion DDTL 3.0 loan agreement between CoreWeave and banks including Morgan Stanley, MUFG Bank and Goldman Sachs, and in doing so learned the following: I apologize, that suggests that CoreWeave isn’t already in trouble. Buried inside NVIDIA’s latest earnings (page 17) there was a little clue: Credit where credit is due — eagle-eyed analyst JustDario caught this in November — but in CoreWeave’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, there sits a $477.5 million line-item under “restricted cash and cash equivalents, non-current.” Though this might not be the NVIDIA escrow — this number shifted from $617m in Q1 to $340m in Q2 — it lines up all-too-precisely…and who else would NVIDIA be guaranteeing? In any case, CoreWeave is likely getting the best deals in data center debt outside of Oracle. It has top-tier financiers (who I will get to shortly), the full backing of NVIDIA (which is both an investor, customer and apparent financial backstop), and the ability to raise debt quickly. CoreWeave’s deals are likely indicative of how data center financing takes place, and those top-tier financiers? It’s been in basically every deal. In fact… So, I went and dug through a pile of 26 prominent data center loan deals, including the proposed $38 billion debt package that Oracle and Vantage Data Center Partners are raising for Stargate Shackelford and Wisconsin, Stargate Abilene, New Mexico, SoftBank’s $15 billion bridge loan (which I included for a reason that will become obvious shortly) and multiple CoreWeave loans, and found a few commonalities: I realize there are far more data center deals than these, but I wanted to show you exactly how centralized these deals are. The largest deals — the $38 billion Stargate TX/WI deal and $18 billion Stargate New Mexico deal — both involved Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, SMBC and MUFG, and all four of those companies have, at some point, funded CoreWeave. In fact, everybody appears to have funded CoreWeave at some point — CitiBank, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Wells Fargo, Carlyle, Blackstone, BlackRock, Barclays, Magentar, and Jefferies to name a few. Of the 40 banks and financial institutions I researched, 24 have, at some point, loaned to or organized debt for CoreWeave. Of those institutions, Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, MUFG and Wells Fargo have done so multiple times. CoreWeave is a deeply unprofitable company saddled with incredible debt and deteriorating margins, with one of its largest clients paying net 360, and, as I’ve said, is arguably the best-financed data center company in the world. What I’m getting at is that most data center deals are likely much worse than the terms that CoreWeave faces, and are likely financed in a similar way, where a client is signed for data center capacity that doesn’t exist, such as when Nebius raised $4.3 billion through a share sale and convertible notes (read: loans) to handle its $17.4 billion data center contract with Microsoft, and guess what? Goldman Sachs acted as lead underwriter on the deal, with assistance from Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Morgan Stanley, all three of which have invested in CoreWeave. AI data centers are expensive, require debt due to the massive cost of construction and GPUs, and all take at least a year, if not two to start generating revenue, at which point they also begin losing money because it seems that renting out AI GPUs is really unprofitable. Every single major bank and financial institution has piled hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars into building data centers that take forever to even start generating money, at which point they only seem to lose it. Worse still, NVIDIA sells GPUs on a one-year upgrade cycle, meaning that all of those data centers being built right now are being filled with Blackwell chips, and by the time they turn on, NVIDIA will be selling its next-generation Vera Rubin chips. Now, you’ve probably heard that Vera Rubin will use the same racks (Oberon) as Blackwell, which is true to an extent, but won’t be true for long, as NVIDIA intends to shift to Kyber racks in 2027, hoping to build 1MW IT racks (which will involve entire racks-full of power supplies!), meaning that all of those data centers you see today — whenever they get built! — will be full of racks incompatible with the next generation of GPUs. This will also decrease the value of the assets inside the data centers, which will in turn decrease the value of the assets held by the firms investing. Stargate Abilene? The one invested in by JP Morgan, Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure and Societe Generale? The one that’s heavily delayed and won’t be ready until the end of 2026 at earliest? Full to the brim with two-year-old GB200 racks! By the beginning of 2027, Stargate Abilene will be obsolete, as will any and all data centers filled with Blackwell GPUs, as will any and all data centers being built today. Every single one takes 1-3 years and hundreds of millions (or billions) in debt, every single one faces the same kinds of construction delays, and better yet, almost all of them will turn on in roughly the same time frame. Now, I ain’t no economist, but I do know that “supply and demand” has an effect on pricing. What do you believe happens to the price of renting a Blackwell GPU when all of these data centers come on? Do you think it becomes more valuable? Or less? And while we’re on the subject, what do you think happens if there isn’t sufficient demand? Right now, OpenAI makes up a large chunk of the global sale of compute — at least $8.67 billion of Azure revenue through September 2025, $22.4 billion of CoreWeave’s backlog, $38 billion of Amazon’s backlog, and so on and so forth — and made, based on my reporting, just over $4.5 billion in that period. It cannot afford to pay anybody, and nowhere is that more obvious than when it negotiated year-long payment terms for CoreWeave. Otherwise, when you remove the contracts signed by hyperscalers and OpenAI (which I do not believe has paid anybody other than Microsoft yet), based on my analysis, there was less than a billion dollars of AI compute revenue in 2025, or 0.5831% of the money spent on data centers. Hyperscaler revenue is also immediately questionable, with Microsoft’s deal with Nebius (per its 6k filing) set to default in the event that Nebius cannot provide the capacity it sold out of its unfinished Vineland, New Jersey data center, which is being built by DataOne, a company which has never built an AI data center with a CEO that has his LinkedIn location set to “United Arab Emirates” with funding from a concrete firm that is also a vendor on the construction project. I also believe Microsoft is setting Nebius up to fail. Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of plans for the Vineland, New Jersey data center, Nebius has agreed to timelines that involve having 18,000 NVIDIA B200 and B300 GPUs by the end of January for a total of 50MW, with another 18,000 B300s due by the end of May. On speaking with experts in the field about how viable these plans are, two laughed, and one told me to fuck off. If Nebius fails to build the capacity, Microsoft can walk away, much like OpenAI can walk away from Stargate in the event that Oracle fails to build it on time (as reported by The Information in April), and I believe that this is the case for literally any data center provider that’s building a data center for any signed-up tenant. This is another layer of risk to data center development that nobody bothers to discuss, because everybody loves seeing these big, beautiful numbers. Except the numbers might have become a little too beautiful for some. A few weeks ago, the Financial Times reported that Blue Owl Capital had pulled out of the $10 billion Michigan Stargate Data Center project, citing “concerns about its rising debt and artificial intelligence spending.” To quote the FT, “Blue Owl had been in discussions with lenders and Oracle about investing in the planned 1 gigawatt data centre being built to serve OpenAI in Saline Township, Michigan.” What debt, you ask? Well, Blue Owl — formerly the loosest legs in data center financing — was in CoreWeave’s $600 million and $750 million debt deals for its planned Virginia data center with Chirisa Technology Parks, as well as a $4 billion CoreWeave data center project in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Stargate Abilene and Stargate Mexico, Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center, and a $1.3 billion data center deal in Australia through Stack Infrastructure, a company it owns through its acquisition of IPI Partners. To be clear, Blue Owl “pulling out” is not the same as a regular deal. It’s a BDC — Business Development Corporation — that invests both its own money and rallies together various banks, in this case SMBC, BNP Paribas, MUFG and Goldman Sachs (all part of Stargate New Mexico). Blue Owl is incredibly well-connected and experienced in putting together these kinds of deals, and very likely went to the many banks it’s worked with over the years, who apparently had “concerns about its rising debt,” much of it issued by them! While rumours suggest that Blackstone may “step in,” the banks that will actually back a $10 billion deal are fairly narrow, and “stepping in” would require billions of dollars and legal logistics. So, why are things looking shaky? Well, remember that thing about how this data center would be leased to Oracle? Well, it had a free cash flow of negative thirteen billion on revenues of $16 billion, with its most-recent earnings only "beat" on estimates only thanks to the sale of its $2.68 billion stake in Ampere. Its debt is exploding (with over a billion dollars in interest payments in its last quarter), its GPU gross margins are 14% (which does not mean profitable), its latest NVIDIA GB200 GPUs have a negative 100% gross margin, and it has $248 billion in upcoming data center leases yet to begin. All, for the most part, to handle compute for one customer: OpenAI, which needs to raise $100 billion, I guess. We’ve already got some signs of concern within the banking world around data center exposure. In November, the FT reported that Deutsche Bank — which backed CoreWeave multiple times and several data centers — was “exploring ways to hedge its exposure to data centers after extending billions of dollars in debt,” including shorting a “basket of AI-related stocks” or buying default protection on some of its debt using synthetic risk transfers, which are when a bank sells the full or partial credit risk of a loan (or loans) to another bank while keeping the loans on their book, paying a monthly fee to investors (this is a simplification). In December, Fortune reported that Morgan Stanley (CoreWeave three times, IPI Partners, Hyperion, SoftBank Bridge Loan) was also considering synthetic risk transfers on “loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure.” Back in April, SMBC sold synthetic risk transfers tied to “private debt BDCs” — and while this predates the large data center deals done by Blue Owl, SMBC has overseen multiple Blue Owl deals in the past. In December, SMBC closed another SRT, selling off risk from “Australian and Asian project finance loans,” though I can’t confirm if any of them were data center related. In December, Goldman Sachs paused a planned mortgage-bond sale for data center operator CyrusOne, with the intent to revive it in the first quarter of 2026. Oracle’s credit risk reached a 16-year high in the middle of December, with credit default swaps (basically, betting that Oracle will default on its debts, an unlikely yet no-longer-impossible event) climbing to their highest price since the great financial crisis. While Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank’s SRTs are yet to close, it’s still notable that two of the largest players in data center financing feel the need to hedge their bets. So, what exactly are they hedging against? Simple! That tenants won’t arrive and debts won’t get paid. I also believe they’re going to need bigger hedges, because I don’t think there is enough actual demand for AI to meet the data centers being built, and I think most data center loans end up being underwater within the next two years. I realize we’ve taken a great deal of words to get here, but every single part was necessary to explain what I think happens next. Let’s start by quoting my premium newsletter from a few weeks ago: You see, every little link in the chain of pain is necessary to understand things. In really simple terms, I believe that almost every investment in a data center or AI startup may go to zero. Let me explain. If we assume that 50% of $171.5 (so $85.75) billion in data center debt is in GPUs, that’s around 3.2GW of data center capacity, based on my model of NVIDIA’s approximate split of sales between different AI GPUs from my premium piece last week. The likelihood of the majority of these projects being A) completed within the next year and B) completed on budget is very, very small. Every delay increases the likelihood of default, as each of these projects is heavily debt-based. The customers of these projects are either hyperscalers (who are only “doing AI” because they have no other hypergrowth ideas and because Wall Street currently approves) or AI startups, all of whom are unprofitable. While there are potentially hedge funds or other companies looking for “private AI” integrations, I think this is a very, very small market. On top of that, AI compute itself may not be profitable, and because, by my estimate, everybody has spent about $85 billion on filling data centers with the same GPUs, the aggregate price of renting out GPUs will decline. Already the average price of Blackwell GPUs has declined to an average of $4.41 an hour according to Silicon Data, and that’s before the majority of Blackwell-powered GPUs come online. Yet the customer base shrinks from there, because the majority of AI startups aren’t actually renting GPUs — they build products on top of models built by OpenAI or Anthropic, who have made it clear they’re buying capacity from either hyperscalers or, in OpenAI’s case, getting Oracle or CoreWeave to build it for them. Why? Because building your own model is incredibly capital-intensive, and it’s hard to tell if the results will be worth it. Now, let’s assume — I don’t actually believe it will, but let’s try anyway — that all of that 3.2GW of capacity comes online. How much compute does an AI company use? OpenAI claims it has 2GW of capacity as of the end of 2025, and is allegedly approaching 900 million weekly active users. I don’t think there are any AI companies with even 10% of that userbase, but even if there were, OpenAI spent $8.67 billion on inference through the end of September. Who can afford to pay even 10% of that a year? Or 5%? Yet in reality, OpenAI is likely more indicative of the overall compute spend of the entire AI industry. As I’ve said, most companies are powered not by their own GPU-driven models, but by renting them from other providers. OpenAI and Anthropic spent a combined $11.33 billion in compute on Azure and AWS respectively through the first 9 months of this year, and as the two largest consumers of AI compute, which suggests two things: In fact, it would take sinking every single dollar of venture capital — over $200 billion — every single year and then some funneled into AI compute just to provide the revenue to justify these deals. In the space of a year, Microsoft Azure made $75 billion, Google Cloud $43 billion and Amazon Web Services $100 billion. Need more proof? Still don’t believe me? Then skip to page 18 of NVIDIA’s most-recent earnings: If there’s such incredible, surging demand, why exactly is NVIDIA spending six fucking billion dollars a year in 2026 and 2027 on cloud compute? NVIDIA doesn’t need the compute — it just shut down its AWS rival DGX Cloud! It looks far more like NVIDIA is propping up an industry with non-existent demand. I’m afraid there is no secret AWS-sized spend waiting in the wings for the right moment to pounce. There is no secret demand wave, nor is there any capacity crunch that is holding back incredible swaths of revenue. Oracle’s $523 billion in remaining performance obligations are made up of OpenAI, Meta, and fucking NVIDIA. For AI data centers to make sense, most startups would have to start becoming direct users of AI compute, while also spending more on cloud compute services than they’ve ever spent. The largest consumers of AI compute are both unprofitable, unsustainable monstrosities. Eventually, reality will dawn on one or more of these banks. Projects will get delayed thanks to weather, or budgetary issues, or when customers walk away (as just happened to data center REIT Fermi). Loan payments will start going unpaid. Elsewhere, AI startups will keep asking for money, again and again, and for a while they’ll keep raising, until the valuations get too high, or VC coffers get too low. You’re probably gonna say at this point that Anthropic or OpenAI might go public, which will infuse capital into the system, and I want to give you a preview of what to look forward to, courtesy of AI labs MiniMax and Zhipu (as reported by The Information), which just filed to go public in Hong Kong. Anyway, I’m sure these numbers are great-oh my GOD! In the first half of this year, Zhipu had a net loss of $334 million on $27 million in revenue, and guess what, 85% of that revenue came from enterprise customers. Meanwhile, MiniMax made $53.4 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, and burned $211 million to earn it. It is time to wake up. These are the real-life costs of running an AI company. OpenAI and Anthropic are going to be even worse. This is why nobody wants to take AI companies public. This is why nobody wants to talk about the actual costs of AI. This is why nobody wants you to know the hourly cost of running a GPU, and this is why OpenAI and Anthropic both burn billions of dollars — the margins fucking stink, every product is unprofitable, and none of these companies can afford their bills based on their actual cashflow. Generative AI is not a functional industry, and once the money works that out, everything burns. Though many AI data centers boast of having tenancy agreements, remember that these agreements are either with AI startups that will run out of money or hyperscalers with legal teams numbering in the thousands. Every single deal that Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google or NVIDIA signs is riddled with outs specifically hedging against this scenario, and there won’t be a damn thing that anybody can do if hyperscalers decide to walk away. Before then, NVIDIA’s bubble is likely to burst. As I discussed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA claims to have shipped six million Blackwell GPUs, and while it may be employing very dodgy maths (claiming each Blackwell GPU is actually two GPUs because each one has two chips), my modeling of its last three quarters suggests that NVIDIA shipped around 5.33GW’s worth of GPUs — and based on reading about every single data center I can find, it doesn’t appear that many have been built and powered on. Worse still, NVIDIA’s diversified revenue is collapsing. In Q1FY26, two customers represented 16% and 14% of revenue, in Q2FY26 two customers represented 23% and 16% of revenue, and in Q3FY26 four customers represented 22%, 15%, 13% and 11% of total revenue, with all that money going toward either GPUs or networking gear. I go into detail here, but I put it in a chart to show you why this is bad: In simpler terms, NVIDIA’s revenue is no longer coming from a diverse swath of customers. In Q1FY26, NVIDIA had $30.84 billion of diversified revenue, Q2 $28.51 billion, and Q3 $22.23 billion. NVIDIA GPUs are astronomically expensive — $4.5 million for a GB300 rack of 72 B300 GPUs, for example — and filling data centers full of them requires debt unless you’re a hyperscaler. While I can’t say for sure, I believe NVIDIA’s diversified revenue collapse is a sign that smaller data center projects are starting to have issues getting funded, and/or hyperscalers are pulling back on their GPU purchases. To look through the eyes of an AI booster — all I’m seeing is blue and yellow, as usual! — one might say that these big customers are covering the loss of revenue, but the reality is that these big projects are run on debt issued by banks that are becoming increasingly-worried about nobody paying them back. The mistake that every investor, commentator, analyst and member of the media makes about NVIDIA is believing that its sales are an expression of demand for AI compute, when it’s really more of a statement about the availability of debt from banks and private credit. Similarly, the continued existence of AI startups is an expression of the desperation of venture capital, and the continuing flow of massive funding rounds is a sign that they see no other avenues for growth. Eventually, data centers are going to go unbuilt, and data center debt packages will begin to fall apart. Remember, Oracle’s $38 billion data center deal is actually yet to close, much like Stargate New Mexico is yet to close. These deals, while seeming like they’re trending positively, are both incredibly important to the future of the AI bubble, and any failure will spook an already-nervous market. Only one link in the chain needs to break. Every part of the AI bubble — this fucking charade — is unprofitable, save for NVIDIA and the construction firms erecting future laser tag arenas full of negative-margin GPUs. What happens if the debt stops flowing to data centers? How will NVIDIA sell those 20 million Blackwell and Vera Rubin GPUs? What happens if venture capitalists start running low on funds, and can’t keep feeding hundreds of millions of dollars to AI startups so that they can feed them to Anthropic or OpenAI? What happens to OpenAI and Anthropic if their already negative-margin businesses when their customers run out of money? What happens to Oracle or CoreWeave’s work-in-progress data centers if OpenAI can’t pay its bills? What happens to Anthropic’s $21 billion of Broadcom orders, or tens of billions of Google Cloud spend? In the last year, I estimate I’ve been asked the question “what if you’re wrong?” over 25 times. Every single time the question comes with an undercurrent of venom — the suggestion that I’m being an asshole for daring to question the wondrous AI bubble. Every single person who has asked this has been poorly-read — both in terms of my work and the surrounding economics and technological possibilities of Large Language Models — and believes they’re defending technology, when in reality they’re defending growth, and the Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mindset. In many cases they are not excited about technology, but the prospects of being first in line to lick an already-sparkling boot. This has never been about progress or productivity. If it was, we’d actually see progress, or productivity boosts, or anything other than the frothiest debt and venture markets of all time. Large Language Models do not create novel concepts, they are inconsistent and unreliable, and even the “good” things they do vary wildly thanks to the dramatic variance of a giant probability machine. LLMs are not good enough for people to pay regular software prices at any scale, and the consequences of this will be that every single dollar spent on GPUs has been for exactly one point: manipulating the value of their stocks. AI does not have the business returns and may have negative gross margins. It is inconsistent, ugly, unreliable, expensive and environmentally ruinous, pissing off a large chunk of consumers and underwhelming most of the rest, other than those convinced they’re smart for using it or those who have resigned to giving up at the sight of a confidence game sold by a tech industry that stopped making products primarily focused on solving the problems of consumers or businesses some time ago. You may say that I’m wrong because Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon continue to have healthy net revenues and revenue growth, and as I previously said, these companies are not sharing AI revenues and their existing businesses are still growing due to the massive monopolies they’ve built. And I want to plea to AI boosters and bullish analysts alike: you are being had. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Safra Catz, Elon Musk, Clay Magouyrk, Mark Sicilia, Michael Truell, Aravind Srivinas — all of them are laughing at you behind your back, because they know that you are never going to ask the obvious questions that would defeat my arguments, and know that you will never, ever push back on them. The enshittification of the shareholder has the downstream effect of an enshittification of the media and Wall Street analysts writ large. These companies own you. They treat you with disdain and condescension, because they know you’ll let them. They know that no sell-side analyst will ever ask them “when will you be profitable?” or “how much are you spending?” or if you do ask, they know you will experience temporary amnesia and forget whatever answer they give, because these are the incentives of an enshittified stock market, where stocks are not extrapolations of shareholder value but chips in a fucking casino where the house always wins and changes the rules every three months. They have changed the meaning of “stock” to mean “what the market will reward,” and when you allow companies to start dictating the terms of what will be rewarded — as neoliberalism, Friedman, Reagan, Nixon, NAFTA, Thatcher, and every other policy has, orienting everything exclusively around growth — companies eventually cut off any powers that may curtail any reevaluation of the fundamental terms of capitalism, and the incentives within. Focusing on growth-at-all-costs thinking naturally encourages, enables, and empowers grifters, because all they ever have to promise is “more” — more users, more debt, more venture, more features, more everything. The very institutions that are meant to hold companies accountable — analysts and the media — are far more desperate to trade scoops for interviews, to pull punches, to find ways to explain why a company is right rather than understand what the company is doing, and this is something pushed not by writers, but by editors that want to make sure they stay on the right side of the largest companies. And if I’m right, OpenAI’s death will kill off most if not all other AI startups, Anthropic included. Every investor that invested in AI will take massive losses. Every startup that builds on the back of their models will see their company fold, if it hasn’t already due to the massive costs and upcoming price increases. The majority of GPU-based data centers — which really have no other revenue stream — will be left inert, likely powered down, waiting for the day that somebody works it all out, which they won’t, because literally everybody has these things now and I truly believe they’ve tried everything. I don’t “hate on AI” because I am a hater, I hate on it because it fucking sucks and what I’m worried about happening seems to be happening. The tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, and in its desperation hitched itself to the least-profitable hardware and software in history, then spent three straight years lying about what was possible to the media, analysts and shareholders. And they were allowed to lie, because everybody lapped it the fuck up. They didn’t need to worry about convincing anybody. Financiers, editors, analysts and investors were already drafting reasons why they were excited about something they didn’t really understand or believe in, other than the fact it promised more. This is what happens when you make everything about growth: everybody becomes stupid, ready to be conned, ready to hear what the next big growth thing is because asking nasty questions gets you fucking fired. And what’s left is a tech industry that doesn’t build technology, but growth-focused startups. Look at Silicon Valley. Do you see these fucking people ever building a new kind of computer? Do you believe these men fit to even imagine a future? These men care about the status quo, they want to always have more software to sell or ways to increase advertising revenue so that the stock number goes up so they receive more money in the form of stock compensation. They are concerned with neither actual business value, honest exchange of value, or societal value. Their existence is only in shareholder value, which is how they are incentivized by their board of directors. And really, if you’re still defending AI -- does it matter to any of you that this software fucking sucks, does it? If you think it’s good you don’t know much about software! It does not respond precisely at any point to a user or programmer’s intent. That’s bad software. I don’t care that you have heard developers really like it, because that doesn’t fix the underlying economic and social poison in AI. I don’t care that it sort of replaced search for you. I don’t care if you “know a team of engineers that use it.” Every single AI app is subsidized, its price is fake, you are being lied to, and none of this is real. When the collapse happens, do not let a single person that waved off the economics have a moment’s peace. Do not let anybody who sat in front of Dario Amodei or Sam Altman and squealed with delight at whatever vacuous talking points they burped out forget that they didn’t push them, they didn’t ask hard questions, they didn’t worry or wonder or feel any concern for investors or the general public. Do not let a single analyst that called AI skeptics “luddites” or equated them to flat Earthers hear the end of it. Do not let anybody who claimed that we “lost control of AI” or “blackmailed developers” go without their complementary “Fell For It Again” badge. When it happens, I promise I won’t be too insufferable, but I will be calling for accountability for anybody who boosted AI 2027, who sat in front of Sam Altman or Dario Amodei and refused to ask real questions, and for anyone who collected anything resembling “detailed notes” about me or any other AI skeptic. If you think I’m talking about you, I probably am, and I have a question: why didn’t you approach the AI companies with as much skepticism as you did the skeptics? I also promise you, if I’m wrong, I’ll happily explain how and why, and I’ll do so at length, too. I will have links and citations, I’ll do podcast episodes. I will make a good faith effort to explain every single failing, because my concern is the truth, and I would love everybody else to follow suit. Do you think any booster will have the same courtesy? Do you think they care about the truth? Or do they just want to get a fish biscuit from Sam Altman or Jensen Huang? Pathetic. It’s times like this where it’s necessary to make the point that there is absolutely “enough money” to end hunger or build enough affordable housing or have universal healthcare, but they would be “too expensive” or “not profitable enough,” despite having a blatant and obvious economic benefit in that more people would have happier, better lives and — if you must see the world in purely reptilian senses — enable many more people to have disposable income and the means of entering the economy on even terms. By contrast, investments in AI do not appear to be driving much economic growth at all, other than in the revenue driven to NVIDIA from selling these GPUs, and the construction of data centers themselves. Had Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon sunk $776 billion into building housing and renting it out, the world would be uneven, we would have horrible new landlords, and it would still be a great deal better than one where nearly a trillion dollars is being wasted propping up a broken, doomed industry, all because the people in charge are fucking idiots obsessed with growth. The future, I believe, spells chaos, and I am trying to rise to the occasion. My work has transformed from being critical of the tech industry to a larger critique of the global financial system. I’ve had to learn accountancy, the mechanics of venture and private equity, and all sorts of annoying debt-related language, all so that I sufficiently explain what’s going on. I see several worrying signs I have yet to fully understand. The Discount Window — where banks go when they need quick liquidity as a last resort — has seen a steady increase of loans on its books since September 2024, suggesting that financial institutions are facing liquidity issues, and the last few times that this has happened, financial crises followed. There is also a brewing bullshit crisis in Private Equity, which is heavily invested in data centers. In September, Auto parts maker First Brands collapsed in a puff of fraud with billions of dollars “vanishing” after it double-pledged the same collateral to multiple loans, off-balance sheet liabilities, falsified invoices, and even leased some of the parts it sold. This wasn’t a case where smaller lenders were swindled, either — global investment banks UBS and Jefferies both lost hundreds of millions of dollars, along with asset manager BlackRock through associated funds. Subprime auto lender Tricolor collapsed in similar circumstances, burning JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Zions Bancorporation, who also loaned money to First Brands. A similar situation is currently brewing with Solar company PosiGen, which recently filed for bankruptcy after, you guessed it, double-pledging collateral for loans. One of its equity financing backers is Magnetar Capital, who invested in CoreWeave. What appears to be happening is simple: large financial institutions are issuing debt without doing the necessary due diligence or considering the future financial health of the companies involved. Private Equity firms are also heavily-leveraged, sidling acquisitions with debt, and playing silly games where they “volatility launder” — deliberately choosing not to regularly revalue assets held to make returns (or the value of assets) look better to their investors. I don’t really know what this means right now, but I am worried that these data center loans have been entered into under similarly-questionable circumstances. Every single data center deal is based on the phony logic that AI will somehow become profitable one day, and if there’s even one First Brands situation, the entire thing collapses. I realize this is the longest thing I’ve ever written (or should I say written so far?), and I want to end it on a positive note, because hundreds of thousands of people now read and listen to my work, and it’s important to note how much support I’ve received and how awesome it is seeing people pick up my work and run with. I want to be clear that there is very little that separates you from the people running these companies, or many analysts. I have taught myself everything I know from scratch, and I believe you can too, and I hope I have been able to and will be able to teach you everything I know, which is why everything I write is so long. Well, that and I’m working out what I’m going to say as I write it. The AI bubble is an inflation of capital and egos, of people emboldened and outright horny over the prospect of millions of people’s livelihoods being automated away. It is a global event where we’ve realized how the global elite are just as stupid and ignorant as anybody you’d meet on the street — Business Idiots that couldn’t think their way out of a paper bag, empowered by other Business Idiots that desperately need to believe that everything will grow forever. I have had a tremendous amount of help in the last year — from my editor Matt Hughes, Robert and Sophie at Cool Zone Media, Better Offline producer Matt Osowski, Kakashii and JustDario (two pseudonymous analysts that know more about LLMs and finance than most people I read), Kasey Kagawa, Ed Ongweso Jr., Rob Smith, Bryce Elder and Tabby Kinder of the Financial Times, all of whom have been generous with their time, energy and support. A special shoutout to Caleb Wilson (Kill The Computer) and Arif Hasan (Wide Left), my cohosts on our NFL podcast 60 Minute Drill. And I’ve heard from thousands of you about how frustrated you are, and how none of this makes sense, and how crazy you feel seeing AI get shoved into every product, how insane it marks you feel when somebody tells you that LLMs are amazing when their actual outputs fucking suck. We are all being lied to, we all feel gaslit and manipulated and punished for not pledging ourselves to Sam Altman’s graveyard smash, but I believe we are right. In the last year, my work has gone from being relatively popular to being cited by multiple major international news organizations, hedge funds, and internal investor analyses. I was profiled by the Financial Times, went on the BBC twice, and watched as my Subreddit, r/BetterOffline, grew to around 80,000 visitors a week and became one of the 20th largest podcast Subreddits, which is a bigger deal than it sounds. I believe there are millions of people that are tired of the state of the tech industry, and disgusted at what these people have done to the computer. I believe that they outnumber the boosters, the analysts and the hype-fiends that have propped up this era. I believe that a better world is possible by creating a meaningful consensus around making the powerful prove themselves to us rather than proving it for them.

Title: Silver’s Sharp Plunge: Bitcoin-Style Flash Crash or Healthy Pullback Before $100?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Basius77 / Shutterstock.com In 2025, silver surged to record highs, topping $80 per ounce and briefly reaching $84 before retreating. Starting the year around $29 per ounce, the metal has delivered gains of over 160%, outperforming gold, stocks, and most asset classes. This rally has drawn parallels to Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), which earlier surged past $126,000 amid predictions of $200,000 or more, fueling a buying frenzy. However, Bitcoin suffered a flash crash on Oct. 10, triggered by leverage deleveraging and broader market stress, leading to over $19 billion in liquidations and a more than 30% drop from highs. Silver followed a similar path, with traders eyeing momentum to carry it past $100 per ounce. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSEARCA:SLV), the largest silver ETF, closed at a high of $71.12 per share on Dec 26 while silver peaked at $83.62 — just before profit-taking and margin hikes sent it down over 11% to around $73 per ounce this morning. Investors now question if silver will mirror Bitcoin’s plunge. Bitcoin’s flash crash stemmed from high leverage in a thin market, amplified by political shocks like tariff threats that created a risk-off environment. Over $19 billion in positions were liquidated in hours, driven by overleveraged traders and whale panic-selling near highs. Unlike prior cycles with retail dominance, 2025 saw institutional participation, yet its correlation with equities strengthened, exposing crypto to broader risk-off moves. Bitcoin could face further downside if macroeconomic pressures persist, such as delayed rate cuts or trade tensions rising again. Its value relies heavily on sentiment and adoption expectations, lacking the tangible utility backing other assets and even other cryptocurrencies. While long-term potential exists from institutional and potential government interest, short-term volatility remains high without any physical demand to anchor it. Silver’s recent 11% drop echoes Bitcoin’s volatility, raising fears of a deeper correction. Profit-taking after record highs, margin hikes on the Comex Metals Exchange (CME), and year-end positioning contributed to the pullback. However, silver’s fundamentals differ markedly from Bitcoin’s speculative base. Silver’s primary driver is industrial use, which accounts for over half of demand. Applications in solar panels, electric vehicles, electronics, and AI infrastructure continue growing. Solar alone consumes a significant share, with global installations pushing consumption higher despite efficiency improvements. U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 enhanced silver’s appeal, as they made buying less risky in a rate-easing environment. That offered support for the rally alongside ETF inflows and central bank buying. Most critical is silver’s structural deficit. The market has faced consecutive annual shortfalls, with 2025 estimates around 115 million to 120 million ounces unmet by mine production. Supply remains inelastic — silver is largely a byproduct of other mining — and recycling covers only a portion. Inventories in major vaults have shrunk, tightening physical availability. Unlike Bitcoin, whose supply is algorithmic and based on perceptions of its value, silver has intrinsic industrial utility. This physical backing provides support that is absent in crypto, limiting downside risk even during dips. Further pullbacks are possible — even likely — en route to higher levels, as volatility persists and the speculative froth surrounding the white metal unwinds. Yet the supply-demand imbalance favors sustained upside beyond current records. The iShares Silver Trust offers investors the most efficient way to gain silver exposure. Backed by physical bullion held in vaults, it avoids the storage, insurance, and assay costs of owning coins or bars. As the largest silver ETF managed by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), it provides liquidity and direct price tracking. Surface parallels to Bitcoin’s crash may spark caution, but silver’s structural support — rooted in irreplaceable industrial demand and ongoing deficits — sets it apart. The 2025 run-up included more than a dash of irrational exuberance, yet silver’s underlying fundamentals point to further gains and higher highs ahead.

Title: BlackRock's BUIDL hits $100M in payouts, showing tokenized finance at scale

BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund has distributed $100 million from Treasury yields, offering a real-world test of blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Cointelegraph in your social feed BlackRock’s first tokenized money market fund has paid out $100 million in cumulative dividends since its launch, highlighting the growing real-world use of tokenized securities amid rising institutional adoption. The milestone for the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) was announced Monday by Securitize, which serves as the fund’s issuer and tokenization partner, overseeing onchain issuance and investor onboarding. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL was initially issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The fund invests in short-term, US dollar–denominated assets, including US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and cash equivalents, offering institutional investors a blockchain-based vehicle to earn yield while maintaining liquidity. Investors purchase BUIDL tokens pegged to the US dollar and receive dividend distributions directly onchain, reflecting income generated from the underlying assets. Since its debut on Ethereum, BUIDL has expanded to additional blockchains, including Solana, Aptos, Avalanche and Optimism. The $100 million milestone is notable because it represents lifetime payouts derived from actual Treasury yields distributed to holders of onchain fund tokens. It demonstrates that tokenized securities can operate at scale while mirroring the core functions of traditional financial products. The development also underscores the operational efficiencies enabled by blockchain technology, including faster settlement, transparent ownership records and programmable distributions, features that are increasingly drawing interest from large asset managers and institutional investors exploring tokenized real-world assets. BUIDL, in particular, has seen strong adoption, with the value of the tokenized fund surpassing $2 billion earlier this year. Related: Fragmentation drains up to $1.3B a year from tokenized assets: Report Tokenized money market funds have quickly emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of the onchain RWA market, and for good reason. Their appeal lies in their ability to deliver money market–style returns with greater operational efficiency, a dynamic that has begun to draw attention from traditional financial institutions. Some market participants view these products as a potential counterweight to the anticipated growth of stablecoins. In July, JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho said tokenized money market funds preserve the longstanding appeal of “cash as an asset,” even as regulatory developments such as the approval of the GENIUS Act were expected to accelerate stablecoin adoption and potentially erode the role of cash-like instruments. Despite their rapid growth, tokenized money market funds have also attracted industry scrutiny. The Bank for International Settlements recently warned that such products could introduce operational and liquidity risks, particularly as they become an increasingly important source of collateral within the digital asset ecosystem.

Title: The dollar has been the weakest major currency in 2025. Here's what that means for everyday Americans.

Every time Jennifer publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It's been a weak run for the buck. The US dollar has declined against all of its main global peers in 2025, and the Dollar Index — which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies — is down 10% this year. There have been multiple catalysts for the decrease, none more prevalent than the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates multiple times. Generally speaking, when a central bank lowers rates, holding a currency becomes less attractive. There's also the matter of President Trump's proposed tariff policies, which particularly roiled markets in the first half of 2025. Investors viewed his potential levies as negative for growth and a source of uncertainty, both of which were dollar-negative. But let's not get too doom-and-gloom about a weak dollar. There are positives too. Detailed below are the two pros and two cons of a depreciating currency: A weaker US currency offers other countries more purchasing power, which can boost exports and economic growth. It can also support US industries that depend heavily on exports, like manufacturing and agriculture. The US exported $125 billion more goods and services in the nine months leading up to September than it did the same period last year, the Census Bureau said this month, an increase of 5%. President Donald Trump pointed out the benefits of a weaker dollar when speaking to the press in July, suggesting that the US could "make a hell of a lot more money" when the greenback was weak. "When we have a strong dollar, one thing happens: It sounds good. But you don't do any tourism. You can't sell tractors, you can't sell trucks, you can't sell anything," he said at the White House. "Pushing down the dollar's value has been a policy priority for the administration as it sought in part to make exports more attractive," Joseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM, wrote in a note on Monday. There are also positive implications for the labor market. If export-heavy industries like manufacturing and agriculture are thriving, that can create more jobs. A boost to international sales is inherently good news for US firms that sell goods abroad. That applies to most of the S&P 500, where foreign sales are significant for at least half of the index's companies, Hogan said. "I would say the pros and cons for corporate America are more tailwinds than headwinds," he added. After the US dollar recorded its worst first half of the year in nearly half a century, Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, said the bank believed a weaker greenback was an underappreciated "tailwind" from an earnings perspective. "There's no doubt that a weaker dollar is part of the story for why revision factors have continued to move — even faster recovery than we had expected," he said, speaking to CNBC earlier in the year. A cheaper dollar could also be a boon for unhedged international equities, or shares of international stocks in local currencies, BlackRock said in a recent client note. That's partly because foreign firms are gaining purchasing power as their local currencies strengthen against the greenback. On the other hand, a weaker currency in the US can translate to higher prices for US consumers of imported goods, or goods with imported parts. That adds to inflationary pressures that already hang in the background with Trump's tariffs. Consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year in November — below what economists expected, but still above the Fed's long-run 2% inflation target. "For everyday Americans, the story is a bit opposite," Hogan said. "The buying power of your dollar goes down as the value of the dollar goes down against the basket of other currencies. So it does make it harder to keep up with higher cost of goods." Americans on vacation could also facing higher costs, as a weaker dollar has less purchasing power abroad, Hogan added. On the flip side, it also makes the US more attractive as a tourist destination for foreigners, who have gained purchasing power. "There's puts and takes," he said. "If you're planning that European vacation, it's going to cost you a bit more in that currency translation." Jump to

Title: Mirae Asset announces plans to acquire Korean crypto exchange Korbit
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/12/29/mirae-asset-announces-plans-acquire-korean-crypto-exchange-korbit/
Time Published: 2025-12-29T16:05:14Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 11:05 EST / DECEMBER 29 2025 by Kyt Dotson Seoul-based financial firm Mirae Asset Financial Group is considering buying Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit Inc., the Korea Times reported today. The Korean cryptocurrency market is dominated by Upbit and Bithumb, which represent over 95% of the exchange volume in the country. As the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange, Korbit serves as an entry point for Mirae into the cryptocurrency industry, which has traditionally focused on traditional finance since its founding in the late 1990s. Founded in 2013, Korbit, also known as 코빗 (Ko-bit) in Korean, began as Korea’s first cryptocurrency exchange, pioneering bitcoin trading in Korean won. Although it opened the market to the local population and paved the way for early trading infrastructure, it was quickly surpassed by the larger exchanges. Today, it still remains a key player in the market. Officials at Mirae said the company is in talks to acquire a 60.5% stake in Kobit from its parent company, NXC Corp., the exchange’s largest shareholder, and a 31.5% from SK Planet. NXC is the family holding group that owns a controlling stake in major South Korea-based global video game giant Nexon Co. Ltd., a developer and publisher known for games like MapleStory and Dungeon Fighter Online. The deal is estimated at up to 140 billion won, around $97.5 million total. The purchase would be led by Mirae Asset Consulting, the group’s real estate and consulting affiliate controlled by founder Park Hyeon-joo and his wife. Mirae offers asset management, wealth management, investment banking and insurance. Since its founding, it established itself as a prominent leader in traditional finance. An unnamed industry official quoted by the Korea Times noted that Park, now global strategy officer, previously emphasized exploring business opportunities that interconnect traditional finance to digital assets. “Korbit has historically had a limited presence, but Mirae Asset Financial Group’s decades of expertise could allow it to pursue a differentiated strategy,” he added. The purchase could shift the current nature of Korea’s cryptocurrency and digital asset landscape. Kobit maintains a large number of regulatory licenses in the country. The acquisition news follows increasing outreach throughout the global market by major financial firms, including MasterCard Inc., multinational investment management firm BlackRock Inc. and the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc.

Title: Crypto Predictions for 2026: Top Analysts’ View

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Top crypto firms reveal their 2026 forecasts: BTC ATHs, stablecoin dominance, and tokenized assets take center stage as speculation gives way to real-world infrastructure. 2025 has been a wild ride for everyone who expected BTC $88 167 24h volatility: 1.1% Market cap: $1.76 T Vol. 24h: $39.81 B and major altcoins to hit new highs. We’re 3 days away from the New Year, volatility is still insane, the Fear and Greed index has been extreme for dozens of days, and most significant cryptocurrencies are trading well below their ATHs. However, prominent crypto moguls are slightly optimistic about 2026. We gathered the most significant predictions in one post, and yes, we want to come back here next December and find out if this time they were true. BlackRock’s 2026 outlook frames digital assets, especially stablecoins, as financial infrastructure for payments, settlement, and liquidity, rather than a pure speculative trade. The firm highlights the maturing role of dollar-pegged tokens in cross-border transfers and treasury flows. It argues that crypto’s most durable growth now sits beneath the surface in rails that interoperate with traditional finance. “Stablecoins are no longer niche — they’re becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity,” says Samara Cohen, Global Head of Market Development at BlackRock. Grayscale’s annual outlook calls for Bitcoin to set a new all-time high in the first half of 2026. A DCG-owned investment group believes the Bitcoin price will be driven by clearer U.S. policy, rising institutional demand, and the fading dominance of the simple four-year halving cycle as macro liquidity and regulation take the wheel. The firm expects “rising valuations in 2026,” with institutions increasingly treating BTC as an allocatable portfolio asset. Grayscale’s 2026 Digital Asset Outlook is here with 10 themes marking the "Dawn of the Institutional Era." Our last 3 themes dive into what’s shaping crypto’s next phase in 2026. From Grayscale — the world’s largest digital asset-focused investment platform¹. Click below ⬇️ — Grayscale (@Grayscale) December 22, 2025 In its report, Coinbase Institutional says market structure, not narratives, will define 2026. The major crypto exchange expects the activity to concentrate on: Perpetual futures will anchor price discovery and command most trading volume. Leverage reset in late-2025 is seen as structural, not a retreat. Prediction markets will become a credible venue for information and risk transfer. It is worth noting that Coinbase plans its own push into the category. Stablecoins and payments will become crypto’s most persistent real-world use case. Coinbase models the stablecoin market cap at approximately $1.2 trillion by 2028. In its paper titled “26 Crypto, Bitcoin, DeFi, and AI Predictions for 2026“, Galaxy, same as BlackRock, focused on the real-world use cases. Stablecoins are forecast to process more volume than U.S. ACH and become core payment plumbing. Tokenized assets are expected to enter mainstream collateral and capital markets. Public chains will rethink value capture, with at least one L1 likely enshrining a revenue-generating app to feed its native token. In the meantime, the company thinks it’s too hard to predict the Bitcoin price, but it still sticks to its $250,000 forecast by the end of 2027. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest maintains a multi-year, institution-led BTC adoption thesis. They’ve maintained their 2030 scenario up to $2.4 million in the bull case and stepped up buying of crypto-exposed equities into year-end 2025. In a recent video for investors, Wood even says 2026 will be a Goldilocks year due to 0% inflation. Cathie Wood predicts 0% inflation by 2026 She says 2026 could be a Goldilocks year. After tariffs, shutdown risk, and hawkish Fed rhetoric, the market may be underestimating how close inflation could get to zero if oil and rents keep falling. pic.twitter.com/YeNlrsrlIr — Ark Invest Tracker (@ArkkDaily) December 21, 2025 Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: Could Bitcoin Replay Silver’s Rally… Backward? CEO Issues Warning

Peter Schiff has warned that Bitcoin could suffer the opposite fate of silver after the metal posted a sudden, sharp rise. Based on reports, traders and analysts are debating whether the move in silver marks a broad shift back to real assets or a brief, crowded trade that may unwind quickly. According to trading data, silver jumped more than 10% in a single session and rose from about $78 to $79 in roughly ninety minutes. Spot silver climbed 18% last week to close at a record $79.31 on thin post-Christmas volume and its new status as a strategic metal. Reports have disclosed that this rally is being driven by a supply deficit and Washington’s decision to classify silver as a critical mineral, not by geopolitics or hopes for US rate cuts. A TradingView chart showed a near-vertical breakout, and a monthly RSI reading reached its highest level in 45 years, a sign of extreme momentum. What is happening with silver may soon be happening with Bitcoin, only in reverse. But since markets tend to melt down faster than they melt up, the time frame for the move should be condensed. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 27, 2025 Tokenized versions of metal assets have also gained ground. Based on reports, these crypto-linked commodity tokens are approaching a $4 billion overall valuation, reflecting growing investor curiosity. CompaniesMarketCap data showed silver’s market value closing the gap with NVIDIA, a comparison that highlights heavy institutional demand for metal exposure. Still, tokenized assets remain small compared with spot markets and big ETFs, which means the shift is visible but not yet broad-based. Bitcoin traded near $87,000 with little movement over the same period, according to CoinMarketCap snapshots, and some market charts show Bitcoin losing relative ground to silver since 2017. A silver-to-Bitcoin valuation model places Bitcoin’s trend value near $394,000, a figure that prompts debate among traders about where each market could go next. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s strong inflows in 2025 point to steady institutional accumulation in crypto, while other indicators suggest Bitcoin’s gains can stall without fresh catalysts. Spot silver’s strong weekly gain has left technicians and strategists split. Some say the move reflects a true supply-demand mismatch reinforced by the US critical mineral designation, which has encouraged long-term buying. Others point to the thin volume after the holidays as a factor that magnified price moves. A closing price reversal top pattern at record highs has been flagged by chart watchers, signaling that a correction could follow after such rapid ascent. These signs, combined with extreme RSI readings, raise questions about the sustainability of the current breakout. Market veterans emphasize that fast rallies can reverse quickly when liquidity dries up. Peter Schiff argued that declines often accelerate under pressure, and that idea matters because crowded positions can be unwound in a short span. At the same time, long-term flows into Bitcoin-related ETFs and institutional products should not be ignored; they can support higher prices over time. What traders watch next will be trade volumes, whether silver holds above current levels, and whether Bitcoin regains momentum in the face of metal strength.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: XRP ETFs blow past $1bn in inflows. Where will token price go in 2026?

About us Copy link XRP exchange-traded funds are charging head-on into 2026. ETFs backed by the fifth largest crypto have attracted over $1 billion in investment since launching in November, according to SoSoValue data. There has not been a single day of net outflow since their debut. That far outpaces comparable Solana ETFs, which have pulled in $387 million over the same period. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have seen $3.6 billion in selloffs in the same timeframe. Ethereum ETFs have also bled $1.2 billion, DefiLlama data shows. But the flood of capital into ETFs backed by XRP has not helped the token’s price after the crypto market’s October downturn that wiped out $1 trillion in value. XRP is trading at $1.88 at time of reporting, 49% below its all-time high of $3.65 set in July. “We expect the price pattern to broadly resemble what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum, though on a much smaller scale,” Jonathan Yark, quantitative trader at Acheron Trading, told DL News. “XRP has specific use cases around payments and treasury flows,” Yark said. “We’re in a genuine adoption phase for crypto ETFs, which means periods of rapid inflows followed by consolidation.” The relentless capital inflow into XRP ETFs comes as more and more institutions embrace crypto. Vanguard, the $11 trillion asset management heavyweight long associated with institutional restraint, reversed course and launched spot crypto ETF trading earlier in December. “Vanguard’s distribution reach is enormous, and opening access signals a shift from opposition to adoption. That alone will help pull more traditional investors into the asset class,” Yark said. Wall Street stalwarts including BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, all have rolled out crypto ETF offerings over the past two years. “Institutions, like Bank of America and Vanguard, are steadily opening access and that shift supports a sustained, long-term market rather than a short-lived boom,” Yark said. Other firms expected to launch their own XRP ETFs include 21Shares, ProShares, and CoinShares, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s website shows. “Flows will remain highly dependent on settlement, but the broader trajectory is clearly positive.” Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

Title: Ethereum’s record staking queue looks bullish, but one corporate giant is secretly distorting the real signal

Ethereum’s staking congestion signals institutional interest amidst regulatory progress, led by BitMine’s bold move. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. A single corporate treasury has effectively hijacked Ethereum’s validator mechanics, executing a billion-dollar maneuver that has flipped the network’s flow data from a steady exodus to a sudden traffic jam. For the first time in six months, the queue to stake ETH, locking up tokens to secure the blockchain in exchange for yield, significantly outstrips the line to exit. Data compiled by the Ethereum Validator Queue tracker shows approximately 734,299 ETH waiting for entry, implying a mandatory delay of nearly two weeks before these coins can begin earning rewards. By comparison, the exit queue holds roughly 343,179 ETH, with a delay of six days. On the surface, the data suggests a broad resurgence in investor sentiment, a bullish signal for a proof-of-stake network where participation is often read as a proxy for long-term confidence. However, a closer examination of the on-chain flows reveals a more concentrated reality. Nearly half of the entire entry backlog, 342,560 ETH, originates from a single entity: BitMine, the largest public ETH holding firm. The digital asset treasury firm’s aggressive entry over the past 48 hours has distorted the signal, masking what remains a cautious market environment. While the validator line is indeed moving up, the “crowd” is arguably a single whale creating a wake that retail and smaller institutional players are merely drafting behind. For traders and analysts, distinguishing between broad organic demand and idiosyncratic corporate treasury management has become the primary challenge of the holiday trading session. While BitMine dominates the immediate flows, its move is not occurring in a vacuum. It coincides with a pivotal shift in the regulatory environment that has fundamentally reduced the risk of staking for US institutions. In a landmark clarification earlier this year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated that liquid staking activities, specifically the receipt of tokens representing staked assets, do not constitute securities transactions, provided the provider exerts no managerial effort. This was followed in November by the IRS and Treasury Department issuing Revenue Procedure 2025-31. This guidance created a “safe harbor” for exchange-traded products (ETPs) and trusts, allowing them to stake digital assets without jeopardizing their tax status as grantor trusts. Asset manager Grayscale stated that these two policy changes have effectively greenlit a new era of product structure. In a recent note to clients, the firm's analysts argued that crypto ETPs' ability to stake will likely make them the default structure for holding investment positions in proof-of-stake tokens. Due to this, the firm predicts a bifurcated market in which custodial staking via ETPs captures the passive bid, exerting pressure on reward rates. In contrast, on-chain liquid staking retains the advantages of composability within DeFi. This regulatory clarity explains why capital is moving now. The “institutional pipeline” is no longer blocked by compliance ambiguity. As a result, the market has seen BlackRock advance its iShares Ethereum Staking Trust (ticker: ETHB), and Grayscale has already enabled staking for its Ethereum Trust (ETHE). These regulated vehicles are now routing portions of their massive established holdings into the validator set, transforming static assets into productive ones. Meanwhile, this shift has forced a maturity upgrade across the crypto infrastructure stack. Staking represents a new form of yield on otherwise idle digital assets, but for institutions, the implications go far beyond simple returns. The primary driver is capital efficiency: the ability to convert static holdings into productive assets while maintaining on-chain exposure. However, this efficiency introduces new layers of operational complexity. Validator management, slashing risk, and reporting obligations demand a professional infrastructure that retail wallets cannot support. Furthermore, strict regulatory classification and audit requirements mean that staking must now align with fiduciary duties and jurisdictional standards. So, institutions that treat staking as a robust operational process, factoring in segregation, reporting, and compliance, are positioned to capture sustainable yield and strategic advantage. However, those that fail to professionalize risk falling behind in an increasingly competitive, yield-aware digital asset market. Nezhda Aliyeva, Head of Product at Platform, said, “Institutional staking is moving from experiment to expectation. Our clients want yield, but they want it delivered with the same rigour as any other financial operation – segregated, secure, and compliant.” Meanwhile, the current congestion is not solely due to new money; it is also a story of returning capital. The validator set is currently refilling after a period of intense technical and market-driven churn. First, the “Pectra” network upgrade was implemented. Among other changes, Pectra raised the maximum effective balance for validators from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. This improvement in staking user experience allowed large operators to consolidate thousands of small validators into fewer, larger ones. Ethereum's Pectra upgrade raises validator stake limits, yet security and standardization concerns surface. The upgrade made restaking easier for large balances, prompting a wave of operational shuffling that is only now stabilizing. Second, a security scare involving staking provider Kiln caused a mass exodus. Following an API exploit prevention protocol, Kiln initiated a precautionary unstaking of Ethereum validators to safeguard client funds. Kiln takes responsible steps to safeguard funds amid SwissBorg-related exploit, impacting Ethereum staking times. While no funds were lost on Ethereum, the move forced a significant percentage of the network’s stake to exit and wait out the safety period. Those coins are now rotating back in, contributing to the entry jam. Simultaneously, the DeFi sector underwent a painful deleveraging. According to DeFi analyst Ignas, a spike in borrow rates on Aave forced traders utilizing “looping” strategies, leveraging staked Ethereum (stETH) to borrow more ETH, to unwind their positions. This trend, which Ignas notes was kick-started by maneuvering from heavyweights like Justin Sun, flushed leverage out of the system. The result is visible in the broader data. Dune Analytics figures indicate that the total amount of ETH deposited by investors into protocols and contracts has remained relatively stable at around 36 million. The queue drama, therefore, is less about a massive injection of fresh cash and more about the network's “plumbing” resetting itself. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. The planned jump in capacity relies on a fragile shift to ZK-proof verification that could buckle under network stress. Exchange balances hit record lows and institutions control 11% of supply, but NFT sales cratered 87% and retail sits out. Is ETH becoming infrastructure without the culture?

Title: Real-world assets top DEXs to become 5th-largest category in DeFi by TVL

RWA protocols have overtaken decentralized exchanges by total value locked, as tokenized Treasurys, private credit and commodities become core onchain building blocks. Cointelegraph in your social feed Real-world asset (RWA) protocols are one of decentralized finance’s (DeFi’s) winners in 2025, overtaking decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to become the fifth-largest category by total value locked (TVL), according to DefiLlama. RWAs now account for about $17 billion in TVL, up from $12 billion in Q4 2024, highlighting how quickly tokenized Treasurys, private credit and other real-world claims have moved from niche experiments to core DeFi plumbing. As DefiLlama noted, “At the start of this year, they weren’t even in the top 10 categories.” Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, told Cointelegraph that RWA growth is being driven by “balance-sheet incentives rather than experimentation,” with higher-for-longer rates making tokenized Treasurys and private credit attractive as onchain, yield-bearing assets, amid improving regulatory clarity that is lowering friction for institutional allocators. Earlier this year, RWAs excluding stablecoins had grown to about $24 billion, with private credit and tokenized Treasurys identified as the main growth engines and Ethereum as the dominant public settlement layer for onchain debt and fund structures. Related: Emerging market economies to drive RWA tokenization in 2026: Crypto exec Through 2025, that market has remained concentrated around a small group of large issuers and vehicles on Ethereum, while RWA.xyz data shows a second tier of networks, including BNB Chain, Avalanche, Solana, Polygon and Arbitrum, each capturing low‑to-mid single‑digit percentage shares of public‑chain RWA value. In parallel, permissioned infrastructure like Canton Network has become a major institutional hub, with over 90% of the total market share, hosting large RWA programs in a privacy‑preserving, regulated environment that can plug into DeFi data and liquidity rails. Related: Canton token rallies 27% after DTCC outlines tokenized Treasury plans Tokenized US Treasurys remain the gateway product, with platforms like the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Circle’s USYC, Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, Ondo’s OUSG, and similar funds pushing the combined tokenized Treasury segment above the multi‑billion‑dollar mark by December. Liu said that “the constraint is no longer tokenization itself, but liquidity, and integration into TradFi,” adding that attention in 2026, “attention should shift from headline TVL to control and usage, who owns issuance, where RWAs are deployed as collateral, and which venues capture secondary market flow.” Rallies in gold and silver are adding a fresh leg to the RWA trade, pulling more capital into tokenized commodities. Recent data put tokenized commodities’ market cap near $4 billion, led by gold products such as Tether Gold and Paxos Gold, which have expanded alongside spot metals, pushing toward new highs. Liu said these moves are “elevating [tokenized commodities] from niche RWAs to macro-relevant assets with real demand for on-chain access and settlement in a 24/7 market,” helped by clearer pricing and custody standards that make them easier to plug into DeFi and institutional systems. Into 2026, he pointed to “behavioral validation” as gold and silver break highs, arguing that price strength attracts issuance, which attracts liquidity and reinforces adoption beyond pure yield narratives. He also highlighted interoperability as another key signal, and said that “real acceleration” will come when “tokenized commodities can move seamlessly across venues and chains, functioning as neutral collateral rather than isolated products.” FOLLOW US © Cointelegraph 2013 - 2025 COINTELEGRAPH NEWSLETTER MOBILE APPS Cointelegraph covers fintech, blockchain and Bitcoin bringing you the latest crypto news and analyses on the future of money.

ST PHOTO: SHINTARO TAY Krist Boo Summary AI generated Published Dec 29, 2025, 04:00 PM Updated Dec 29, 2025, 06:27 PM SINGAPORE – Investors could see more familiar Chinese names on the local bourse in 2026 as the Singapore Exchange (SGX) makes a renewed push to draw Chinese companies for listings. Fresh from grant injections by the Government and recent regulatory nods from both sides, the exchange is gunning for tried-and-proven businesses like advanced manufacturing, as well as those in digital infrastructure, consumer technology, healthcare and sustainable energy. This time, compared with the 2000s, targets will be on businesses deemed to have long wicks rather than stars that light up the scene, just to fizzle out shortly after. The first pitch is to familiar brands here to put their primary, or first, listings here, said Ms Chia Caihan, SGX Group’s head of capital markets for Greater China. Speaking to The Straits Times at SGX Centre on Dec 17, she said at the top of this list are Chinese businesses that have moved their headquarters here and are eyeing growth in this region. With fund raising slowing in China, SGX’s second pitch is to companies already listed in China to come for a secondary listing. It will help raise their brand profile among investors here if they are eyeing expansion in South-east Asia, she said. A secondary listing also allows them to issue their Singapore employees shares, which cannot be done with their Chinese counters, known as A-shares – owing to foreign ownership restrictions and currency controls. Singapore offers these companies access to US and European investors, as well as regional investors who increasingly recognise Chinese brands and are willing to invest in them, Ms Chia said. “China’s governance disclosures are now almost at developed market standards. You look at the kind of disclosures that they require, it is almost compatible with developed jurisdictions.” The criteria for prospects are a clear strategic mindset for listing, with local presence and shareholder communication, she said. In the 2000s, a number of Chinese-listed companies – known as S-chips on SGX – were facing accusations over fraud, accounting irregularities and debt issues, and delistings and share suspensions followed. Ms Chia, who started in SGX in 2004 and took on her current portfolio in 2024, said that this time, it will be different. The companies that listed on the exchange then were narrow in their scope of businesses, she said. Some of those companies did well when they were approved for listing, but did not have the scope to pivot when the economic cycle changed. “Some of them took the extreme route of doing illegal stuff, falsifying accounts and all that. That sent a very bad message to the market, and it affected the confidence. We don’t want that to happen again,” she said. SGX’s push is bolstered by the $5 billion Equity Market Development Programme, launched by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in 2025. $5 billion Equity Market Development Programme The kitty channels funds via managers including BlackRock and Eastspring to provide cornerstone capital, or funds committed for a chunk of shares in new listings that helps shore up their credibility; market-making support; and research grants as part of its goal to revive tepid investor and listing activity on SGX in recent years. Regulatory support also came in December following a meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong, who is also Minister for Trade and Industry, and Chinese Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang, which resulted in bilateral support for Chinese companies to mount secondary listings on SGX. The exchange listed 614 companies on its mainboard and Catalist as at Dec 18, including about 100 of Chinese origin. Recent listings include shoe rubber adhesive maker Infinity Development on the Catalist and Yangzijiang Maritime Development, a spin-off of Yangzijiang Financial, which was itself carved out from Yangzijiang Shipbuilding, which listed in 2007. The first time Yangzijiang Shipbuilding spun off its financial arm, the original company more than doubled its value from $6 billion, said Ms Chia, illustrating the potential of the market. Against its competitor, the Hong Kong stock exchange, SGX touts Singapore’s edge in its Government’s support – even post-listing – with research and growth funding, Ms Chia said. Low liquidity, a frequent complaint about SGX, does not worry Chinese investors, with early help from the exchange on netting secondary investors after their listing, and market-making research. Companies valued under $5 billion would find the support especially helpful. “I think they are pretty comfortable with what we can offer because they don’t get this kind of support when they go to other markets. They are just too small,” she said. The Republic also has a diverse investor base: Asean players, family offices, European pension and hedge funds, Middle Eastern funds, as well as regional vehicles of US-based funds, which are mostly avoiding Chinese investments given geopolitical tensions. Asked about “Singapore-washing” concerns, where listings might superficially rebrand China-centric operations, Ms Chia said: “A listing does not make you a Singapore company overnight. “You need to work together with our SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises). You need to see how to make use of our talent and resources.” Compared with the Chinese entrepreneurs who arrived two decades ago, and who sometimes imported entire supply chains without integration, today’s cohort is more aware of the need to reciprocate. “They recognise the benefits that Singapore is giving them, and a lot of them are giving it back to Singapore. It is just that, given their status – they may still be Chinese citizens – they cannot do it that openly. “But I would say that they have been doing more than what we expect because they really hope to blend into Singapore.” For local investors, participating in these companies’ corporate meetings and asking questions will keep the companies on their toes and help them communicate more. On why getting the listings matters, Ms Chia said: “Chinese companies are important because in the overall corporate world, they have become a very important piece.” The move also helps Singapore retain and grow its wealth, she said. “That is why I would think that everybody has a role to play in it.” Krist Boo is senior business correspondent at The Straits Times.

(Photo: AFP/Daniel de Carteret) PANAMA CITY: Near the entrance to the Panama Canal, a monument to China's contributions to the interoceanic waterway was torn down Saturday night (Dec 27) by order of local authorities. The move comes as US President Donald Trump has made threats in recent months to retake control of the canal, claiming Beijing has too much influence in its operations. In a surprising move that has been criticised by leaders in Panama and China, the mayor's office of the locality of Arraijan ordered the demolition of the monument built in 2004 to symbolise friendship between the countries. The mayor's office said in a statement that the monument, which overlooked the waterway spanning Bridge of the Americas, had structural damage that posed a "risk".

Title: Bitcoin drops 32% as ETF money exits – Yet THIS group isn’t backing off

Bitcoin ETFs record sell-off but hold firm on institutional support. Bitcoin has faced intense selling pressure, with the asset down 32% from its high of $126,000 on the 6th of October. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) remain a key channel for gauging Bitcoin market sentiment. This time, however, the behavior of investors behind these ETFs suggests deeper dynamics at play. U.S. Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have remained on the bearish side of the market, recording significant outflows even as Bitcoin’s price attempts to stabilize. Bitcoin [BTC] Spot ETFs are facing renewed pressure as traditional investors pull back capital while still maintaining exposure to the asset. According to CryptoQuant, Cumulative Outflows from Bitcoin ETFs have reached $5.5 billion from their all-time high. As a result, total Assets Under Management (AUM) have dropped to $116.58 billion, down from a peak of $163.27 billion. Source: CoinGlass This trend confirms that traditional investors, operating through institutional ETFs, have scaled back capital inflows into the market. Such outflows are expected during periods of weak market sentiment, especially as Bitcoin continues to range between $85,000 and $90,000. Despite broader ETF outflows, traditional investors with exposure to BlackRock’s U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF continue to dominate market activity. Over the past twelve days, these investors have purchased more BTC than any other institutional group in the market. Data showed that within this period, the group recorded six separate BTC ETF inflows, with total net inflows amounting to 1.32 million Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1.16 billion. This trend remains a key indicator, particularly as BlackRock controls the largest share of BTC among institutional investors. Source: CryptoQuant As of press time, this group held $67.56 billion worth of Bitcoin, reinforcing a bullish undercurrent that continues to influence other ETF participants in the market. Notably, retail investors trading Bitcoin directly through centralized exchanges are also showing signs of renewed confidence. Since the start of December, this group has consistently accumulated BTC week after week. Last week alone, purchases totaled approximately $891.61 billion, according to Glassnode. While this reflects broader global retail investor behavior, it confirms sustained confidence in the asset class, marked by four consecutive weeks of consistent supply absorption. BlackRock may still expand its involvement with Bitcoin, as CEO Larry Fink has publicly shifted his stance on the cryptocurrency. Fink, who previously described Bitcoin as an “index for money laundering” and a tool for “thieves,” had a change in perspective during a recent interview at the DealBook Summit 2025. He noted that BTC now presents a “huge future use case,” signaling growing institutional openness. While the scope of these use cases remains unclear, the shift highlights a potential long-term opportunity for current investors.

Although asset managers had previously fought tooth and nail to offer products tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum’s spot price, many foresaw opportunities in 2025, as the regulatory environment started to shift with President Donald Trump’s return to power in January. As of Dec. 15, spot Bitcoin ETFs had generated $57.7 billion in net inflows since their historic debut in January 2024, according to Farside Investors. That represented a 59% increase compared to $36.2 billion at the start of this year. But inflows weren’t consistent. Investors poured $1.2 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs on Oct. 6, for example, as the asset approached an all-time high above $126,000, according to CoinGlass. As Bitcoin’s price slipped below the $90,000 mark on Nov. 11, a few weeks later, investors yanked $900 million from the funds. Still, that was only the second worst day for spot Bitcoin ETFs on record: As Bitcoin plunged in February on fears related to trade and inflation, the products posted $1 billion in outflows. Since their debut last July, spot Ethereum ETFs had generated $12.6 billion in net inflows, as of Dec. 15, according to CoinGlass. As the cryptocurrency surged toward an all-time high of nearly $4,950 in August, the products generated $1 billion in inflows on a single day. With signs of growing adoption among financial institutions, those products largely operated in the background, as onlookers focused on the prospect of more ETFs that could potentially boost digital asset prices, or expand access to new investors. Yet some are relatively focused on ETFs tracking multiple cryptocurrencies at once, as products ideal for institutions. When the SEC approved generic listing standards for commodity-based trusts in September, the regulator moved to address anticipation that had been building for months. The stack of applications for ETFs covering a wide range of digital assets had grown thick on its desk, with approvals hinging on an answer that the SEC’s previous leadership had danced around for years: When should a digital asset be treated a commodity? Instead of being forced to make case-by-case decisions about the eligibility of various cryptocurrencies, from Dogecoin to the president’s meme coin, the SEC instead outlined criteria for exchanges that made digital assets fit for commodity-based trusts. Among the most important factors, the standards require digital assets underlying ETFs to trade on surveilled markets, have a six-month history of futures trading, or already back an exchange-traded fund with significant exposure. That meant that at least a dozen cryptocurrencies were instantly “good to go,” Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt in September. From his perspective, he described the move as expected. The approval of generic listing standards is set to greatly expand the number of products that investors have access to, but asset managers are still waiting for answers on at least 126 ETFs, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Research Analyst James Seyffart recently said on X. Those applications focus on tokens from up-and-coming decentralized finance projects like the Hyperliquid, as well as relatively novel meme coins, including Mog. First there was Bitcoin, then there was Ethereum. Now, investors in the U.S. have access to ETFs tracking the spot price of XRP and Solana, among a handful of others. As the fifth- and seventh-largest digital assets by market capitalization, respectively, XRP and Solana both faced regulatory headwinds under the Biden administration, which dissipated on the road to becoming underlying assets for a number of products. Last year’s debut of spot Bitcoin ETFs unleashed a wave of demand that buoyed the asset’s price to new highs. While the same can’t be said for the smaller cryptocurrencies yet, products dedicated purely to XRP and Solana still generated notable activity. “I don’t think they’ve had the effect on the price that maybe people hoped for, but I do think, idiosyncratically, they have been huge successes and a validation of investor appetite beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum,” Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. Leon said the debut of ETFs for Solana and XRP came in November at a “disadvantageous time,” with macroeconomic conditions driving digital-asset prices lower in recent months. Still, spot Solana ETFs have generated $92 million in net inflows since launch, as of Dec. 15, according to CoinGlass. Spot XRP ETFs, which debuted the same month, have generated roughly $883 million in net inflows since they began trading. The debut of Solana ETFs was notable for another reason: They were among the first ETFs to share a portion of their rewards from staking with investors, a development bolstered by new guidance last month from the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was among financial giants that have thus far passed up the opportunity to expand their set of crypto-focused products to additional assets, but Leon noted that XRP and Solana’s communities may not need them. “What we’ve seen with the ETF so far shows that these communities are much more engaged and stronger and larger than maybe many people thought,” he said. “And I think that bodes well for both ecosystems going into 2026.” Net inflows for spot Dogecoin ETFs stood at $2 million as of Dec. 15, according to SoSoValue. In 2025, individual investors and hedge funds were among the most likely groups to hold spot crypto ETFs, but that dynamic may start shifting materially soon, according to Gerry O’Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management. He told Decrypt that many advisors and professional investors are still in the process of due diligence for ETFs that track cryptocurrencies, but he has a sense that they could start thinking seriously about allocations to the asset class soon. Then again, Vanguard signaled earlier this month that it would let its 50 million customers trade some spot crypto ETFs on its brokerage platform. Bank of America, meanwhile, put its stamp of approval on modest crypto allocations for private wealth clients starting next year. “A year ago or so, there was a lot of regulatory uncertainty, and they weren't really ready to dip their toes into the space” he said. “And now the questions aren’t really whether or not they should get exposure. It's how they should get exposure.” In that sense, O’Shea believes ETFs that track an index of digital assets will become a bigger part of the conversation next year. Many professional investors appreciate how those funds’ holdings shift over time, giving them relative peace of mind, he said. “They can make an allocation to an index ETF and get broad exposure to the growth potential of the market without having to have all that sort of detailed knowledge,” O’Shea explained. “They don't need to know everything about every one of these individual assets.” In February, Hashdex was behind the first spot ETF tracking multiple digital assets in the U.S., with the debut of the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF. Modeled on the Nasdaq Crypto Index, it holds Cardano, Chainlink, and Stellar, as well as larger cryptocurrencies. Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, and CoinShares have debuted similar products, although some seek exposure to digital assets through derivatives. In total, the group of index ETFs offer exposure to 19 digital assets, per ETF Trends. Although some pension funds in the U.S. have purchased spot Bitcoin ETFs, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board liquidated $300 million in holdings around February. The move was revealed via 13F filings that large institutional investors release quarterly. Al Warda Investments disclosed a $500 million position in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF in November. The investment firm is tied to the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, a subsidiary of Mubadala Investment, which acts as a sovereign wealth fund in Abu Dhabi. Mubadala itself disclosed a position in BlackRock’s product in February, which was worth $567 million, as of its latest 13F filing. Around the same time, it was revealed that Harvard’s endowment held shares in the ETF worth $433 million. Brown University and Emory University also disclosed positions in spot Bitcoin ETFs this year, emerging as early adopters of the asset on an institutional level. Broadly, analysts have said the shift in investors could lead to less volatility for Bitcoin and shallower drawdowns. “It hasn't been dramatic, but it has been notable,” O’Shea said, in reference to a broadening investment base. “This shift from retail to institutional is very good for the long-term sustainability of the asset class, because you do have these folks with much longer-term time horizons.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Worried About Retirement? You're Not Alone: Nearly 50% of Americans in Peak Earning Years Worry About It Every Day

For many Americans, retirement is a constant worry. According to BlackRock, 47% of Americans between the ages of 45 to 54 worry about their retirement savings at least once a day. These financial moves will help to assuage some of those worries. "It’s common for Gen Xers to feel squeezed between saving for retirement and living a meaningful life now. The good news is that they are achieving peak incomes," said Preston Cherry, CFP and founder of Concurrent Wealth. Here's how Gen Xers can move into greater retirement savings and less worry. When it comes to retirement savings, young investors have an advantage because the money they invest has the advantage of growing with compound interest over several decades. Assuming average stock market returns of 6% to 7%, every dollar you invest now can triple or quadruple by the time you retire. People in their 40s and 50s have shorter time horizons, but investing 10 to 20 years out from retirement can still make a difference in their retirement savings. If you aren't already doing so, automate your retirement savings strategy. Put aside money with each paycheck or each month, even if it's only a small amount. These steady payments can help your retirement savings grow, and they can also help to calm some of the panic you may be feeling about retirement. You should also establish an emergency fund. Put three to six months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account, and only reach for it in times of an emergency. This will reduce the temptation to tap your retirement funds for surprise expenses, which can potentially incur hefty penalties. A 401(k) or similar tax-advantaged plan is a great way to build up your retirement savings, especially if it comes with a matching contribution from your employer. As a rule of thumb, investing 10% to 15% of each paycheck is a good goal. In 2025, you can contribute as much as $23,500 in a 401(k). This amount goes up to $70,000 when your contributions are combined with your employer's contributions. If you are in your 50s, you may invest in a catch-up contribution of $7,500 into your 401(k). Individual retirement accounts—like a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA—are other great ways to save for retirement. Both have contribution limits of $7,000 for 2025. Those age 50 older can make a catch-up contribution of $1,000. Cherry encourages Gen Xers to align their financial plans with their values, lifestyle needs, and long-term goals. "This is what I call lifestyle-aligned wealth planning. It’s not just about how much you save, but how intentionally you save," Cherry advises. "When you know your retirement rate—which is how much you need to fund [your retirement] annually—your retirement date, when you want to be work-optional, you’re no longer guessing. You’re designing your life with clarity and confidence." To get started, you'll need to be honest with yourself about the state of your retirement savings and where you would like to be headed. "The keys are being honest, giving yourself grace for where you are, being confident, and committing to where you want to go," Cherry said. For most people, the years between ages 45 and 54 are peak years for income, but many still worry about being able to afford retirement. The best way to beat these worries is through action. Start saving regularly, and contribute as much as you can to tax-advantaged retirement plans, like 401(k)s and IRA accounts. Taking charge of your investments and savings is the best way to ease your concerns about retirement.

“My remit was always to lend. During the difficult period, it was like shooting fish in a barrel because not everybody was lending at the time and there was a really great opportunity. There were still really good businesses that needed to borrow.” Avant Money chief executive Niall Corbett as he pressed ahead with plans to turn the nonbank lender into a full Irish bank branch of its Spanish parent Bankinter. “Fashion made statements then. Now, it is just dictated by a couple of brands mostly in Italy and France and we follow on their coat tails, so it is an uneven field – to get recognised you either have to be 18 or a millionaire. Being a boring middle-class father of seven is not the most exciting prospect, which I am happy with, but maybe pride drives me on.” The late Irish fashion designer Paul Costelloe, in an interview with The Irish Times in January, recalls Katherine Hamnett’s famous anti-nuclear T-shirt worn to 10 Downing Street to meet Margaret Thatcher. “We worked out that there could be between five and seven different agencies involved in a data centre. You get over one hurdle, you have to deal with another. You get over this hurdle, you have to go to the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency]. You go to EPA, you can’t get a gas connection. That makes it difficult when you have other advanced jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, which has a department of digital infrastructure, or the UK, who are going to treat data as critical infrastructure.” In February, Garry Connolly of industry lobby group Digital Infrastructure Ireland said negativity here around data centres has resulted in multinationals bypassing the State for investment. “When you’re young you’ve nothing to lose. Ignorance is a great thing.” Padraic Rhatigan, who opened the Radisson Red hotel on the outskirts of Galway as one part of a major residential and commercial development, reflected in February on taking over the family business while still in his teens. “Thanks, guys.” Tesla chief executive Elon Musk to shareholders after they voted to approve his $1 trillion (€856 billion) compensation plan in November, awarding the world’s richest person what would be the largest corporate payout in history if he meets the goals necessary to receive it. “Two hundred and twenty eight homes were blocked in Killarney because they would interrupt the commute of a roost of horseshoe bats. Who signed up for this?” In October, Stripe cofounder John Collison looked at how the State can get out of the government-by-agency corner into which it has painted itself. “Within 15 to 25 years, I think it will be mandated that there will be autonomous vehicles. People will not be allowed to drive anything. Public transport systems in the future will become much more efficient. Buses will know what and where the demand is and will organise themselves accordingly.” Also in October, businessman Dermot Desmond called on the Government to scrap the long-awaited MetroLink project and instead plan for wide-scale autonomously-driven bus services. “Looking back, juggling these jobs and being a single parent with teenage kids, I genuinely don’t know how I did it. But I wanted to do it – to be a role model to my girls. Equally, having left school with only a few O-levels, I wanted to add something else to my CV.” BMW Ireland boss Helen Westby in February on working her way through various roles in BMW, looking after her daughters, and completing an MBA. “It’s almost becoming a sort of a two-tier [health service] where you hear clinicians and oncologists certainly talking about it, that they can prescribe a certain medicine to these patients, but the other patients can’t have it.” In an interview with The Irish Times, Samantha Humphreys, who leads pharma group MSD’s Irish business, spoke on how private health insurers have taken to approving payment for certain drugs that have been approved by the European Medicines Agency but are still working their way through the Irish system. “They’re going to hire some pudding whose particular talent will be not upsetting Fingal County Council or the morons in the Department of Transport.” Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary last month expressed faux confidence in airport operator DAA’s recruitment processes after a rift emerged between the board of the State company and its chief executive Kenny Jacobs. At the time of O’Leary’s quote, the two sides had agreed a settlement that would have seen Jacobs leave the business. “I guess a potential Fed chair is here too. I don’t know. Are we allowed to say that? Potential? He’s a respected person – that I can tell you. Thank you, Kevin.” US president Donald Trump keeps nobody guessing as to who he intends to appoint chairman of the Federal Reserve early next year as he introduces top White House economic official Kevin Hassett at an event. “It would be wrong not to confront the fact that we absolutely need gas for this transition. The overseas investors on which our economy depends will move in two or three years without reassurance that energy supplies here are secure.” Bord Gáis Energy chief executive Dave Kirwan last month made the argument that gas remains vital to the State, arguing that it will play a central role in aiding us to end fossil-fuel dependence. “We all know it’s only going one way, the demographics are going to double for over-65s in the next 10 years, over-85s as well. So, there’s a huge demand presently not to think about the future.” [ Bord Gáis Energy’s Dave Kirwan on Irish energy prices and the case for nuclear powerOpens in new window ] In April, Shane Jennings, the former rugby player and now chief executive of Dovida, Ireland’s largest homecare group, gave his take on the State’s preparations for dealing with an ageing population. “He was a nice fellah. He would go to the local pub for a pint in the evening and play some pool with the lads. I got to play a game with him in Fitzgerald’s of Avoca. He was good.” In October, Tesco Ireland boss Geoff Byrne recounted losing a game of pool to actor Colin Farrell while he was shooting the Ballykissangel drama series in Co Wicklow. “I had lunch with 14 European CEOs [at Davos] and the pessimism, you could cut it with a knife. It was so palpable – and it just was so obvious to me that the pessimism was overdone. But the pessimism was loud enough that I think finally the Europeans were waking up and saying, ‘we got to change’.” In April, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said European leaders should lighten up about the outlook for the continent despite a decade and a half of low growth and a perception that business is being over-regulated. [ King of Wall Street says European leaders ‘starting to focus on a growth agenda, not a control agenda’Opens in new window ] “It was hugely special. It couldn’t get any more special than under the lights in Croke Park. It was the first round of the league against the Dubs. To beat them and get front page of many newspapers ... it couldn’t have started any better. It was downhill after that. We didn’t do a whole lot of winning.” Ciaran Marron of Monaghan-based Activ8 Solar Energies spoke in May about the rough and tumble of business after the Monaghan senior football team walked out on to the pitch at Croke Park to play All Ireland champions Dublin wearing jerseys emblazoned with the Activ8 logo. “It’s the most popular Bill ever signed in the history of the country. What we’ve done is put everything into one Bill. We’ve never had anything like that before.” US president Donald Trump in July speaking to the media as his “big, beautiful Bill”, a sweeping spending package, is signed into law during a picnic at the White House. “I was in the wrong place at the wrong time in the family. The older kids were at university and the younger ones were behind me in school. I spent years dealing with the bank trying to pay down debt and get rid of things.” In the summer, serial dealmaker Cathal Friel, the seventh of 10 children, spoke about having to leave school at 16 to run indebted businesses when his father became ill. It left him with a lifelong aversion to debt and property investment. “The importance and benefit of international co-operation has been a key theme of my public life. I will soon be taking up the role of managing director and chief knowledge officer of the World Bank Group, based in Washington DC. I am therefore departing from public life in Ireland.” Then minister for finance Paschal Donohoe resigned his Dáil seat and left ministerial office to take up a role at the World Bank. “They stopped pretending. The mask is off. You’re getting fired if you speak out. Back in the day, [tech employees] used to be even asking questions [of their employer] in the comments on company chat boards.” In June, William Fitzgerald, the Waterford-born founder of The Worker Agency, spoke about the slavishness of tech barons to the Trump administration despite Silicon Valley’s previous outwardly liberal gloss. “I grew up on checkouts from a young age and it’s in my DNA. I grew up in that environment and it teaches you so much about efficiencies, waste and getting value for the customer. I was on the checkout from nine or 10 years of age right up to leaving university.” In September, Robert Ryan, the chief executive of Lidl’s Irish business, explained how he got a taste from retail from an early age while working in the family shop. The median price paid for a home in Dublin 6 in the third quarter, making it the most expensive Eircode in the State, according to property firm Geowox. The district, which includes Rathmines, Ranelagh and Rathgar, recorded the highest median sales price in the State, up 23 per cent year-on-year. The State’s jobless rate in July, hitting that mark for the first time since January 2022, according to revised figures from the Central Statistics Office. The amount paid by Scandinavian property companies Pandox and Eiendomsspar as they agreed to buy Ireland’s largest hotel group Dalata. Dalata, which operates 56 hotels under the four-star Maldron and Clayton brands, mainly in Ireland and Britain, had rejected an initial bid from Pandox and Eiendomsspar in early June that had valued the hotel operator at €1.3 billion. The proposed severance deal for airport operator DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs that was taken off the table after Minister for Transport Darragh O’Brien blocked the payment, raising yet more questions about the months-long standoff at the top of the airports group. [ Severance deal of near €1m for DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs off the tableOpens in new window ] O’Brien in November refused to approve the €960,000 payment to Mr Jacobs, which was agreed in September after mediation between the chief executive and the DAA board in talks chaired by industrial relations troubleshooter Kieran Mulvey. The cap on any future tariffs on pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports imposed by the United States on the European Union. The deal struck by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen with Trump saw European countries head off the US president’s threats of cripplingly high import taxes on products sold across the Atlantic. The number of weeks a bitter High Court civil trial involving three shareholders of tech conference giant Web Summit had been scheduled to last before it was struck out. The case was resolved after talks between the parties concluded with founder Paddy Cosgrave saying he was “delighted” two of his former friends would leave the company. Majority shareholder Cosgrave was suing David Kelly, who owned 12 per cent of the business, for alleged breaches of his fiduciary duties as a director of the company. Mr Cosgrave was, in turn, being sued by Kelly and another shareholder, Daire Hickey, who holds 7 per cent of the shares in Web Summit, for both alleged shareholder oppression and alleged breaches of a profit-sharing agreement. The salary advertised by the Government for its new housing tsar who will be charged with managing the crisis and increasing supply. The role was plunged into controversy when the expected appointee, Brendan McDonagh, the chief executive of the National Asset Management Agency, withdrew from consideration. That came after it emerged Fine Gael had not been consulted on the plan to hire McDonagh, who was expected to keep his existing €430,000 salary. The “colossal” bill the State could soon be facing for missing EU-agreed climate targets, equivalent to a full year of corporate tax receipts or the annual health budget. A report by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and Climate Change Advisory Council provided one of the starkest warnings yet of the potential costs involved in failing to adapt to the climate reality. It found that the Republic – on a per capita basis – had the highest emissions target gap of EU member states, meaning it was the least likely to meet its 2030 target of reducing emissions by 51 per cent on the basis of its current trajectory. The drop in the State’s corporate tax receipts in May compared to a year earlier as the exchequer collected €2.5 billion, which was €1.1 billion less that May 2024. Downplaying the decline, the Department of Finance attributed it to “once-off factors” which, it said, boosted receipts last year and distorted the year-on-year comparison. No panic though as €10 billion in corporation tax was received in November, a record for a single month. The top percentile of richest households in the Republic holding almost half the wealth, according to Central Bank of Ireland data. The total net wealth of households here rose to a record €1.25 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, up €6.3 billion on the previous quarter. The figures showed that the wealthiest 10 per cent of households held €645 billion or 48.6 per cent of the total. This was five times the wealth held by the bottom 50 per cent of households, which stood at €117.8 billion or 8.9 per cent of the national total. [ One in 10 Irish households have net wealth of more than €1mOpens in new window ] The insurance industry’s final bill for Storm Éowyn, which struck Ireland in January, making it the most expensive insurance event in Irish history. The storm was one of the most damaging Ireland has ever faced, bringing gusts of 184km/h, breaking a record that had stood since 1945. Some 815,000 properties on the island lost power, with 768,000 of these in the Republic. Many were without power for weeks, while hundreds of energy technicians were drafted in from abroad to help ESB Networks with repairs. A breakdown of the final toll from the event released to The Irish Times shows a total of 33,768 claims were lodged. The estimated worth of a payment halted by State-owned energy company Bord na Móna for its chief executive after officials said continuing the “unsanctioned” earnings risked undermining public pay policy. The payment, which covered benefit-in-kind taxes on Tom Donnellan’s health insurance and company car, has been dropped from a new contract signed by the chief executive in April, the company confirmed. The value of PTSB after it put itself up for sale. The 57 per cent State-owned bank surprised the stock market by the move, which sent its market value up 23.4 per cent in Dublin. [ Paschal Donohoe must use PTSB sale to find owner with vision – not just a red penOpens in new window ] A deal would mark the return of all three domestic banks that survived the 2008 financial crisis to private ownership – and complete the recovery of the €29.4 billion in total that was injected into them. PTSB, by far the smallest of the three, has been dogged by low profit returns since the crash. This is largely due to its small scale – even after increasing its balance sheet by about 50 per cent between 2022 and 2023 after acquiring €6.8 billion of Ulster Bank loans. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Should we ban social media for under-16s? Irish teens share their thoughts

Earlier this month Australia became the first country in the world to ban social media for children under the age of 16. It’s a move that’s being watched closely around the globe, not least by those aged under 16, wondering if this could become their reality too. Here, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said “there needs to be more debate on whether blanket bans are the way to go”, while Tánaiste Simon Harris said he is “very supportive of the idea of social media being restricted to people above a certain age”. But what do those likely to be affected if a similar ban was to happen in Ireland think? Sarah Davitt (15), from Blackrock, Co Dublin, recently returned from a trip to Brussels with the Webwise Youth Panel, which is focused on raising awareness of online safety. “I personally would be against it [the ban] being brought in to Ireland,” she says. “By banning something outright, less education is going to be put forward. If we’re trying to educate our youth on social media, we cannot do that unless we have the use of social media.” She says “restrictions and safety by design” are more appropriate. If a ban was to happen, however, she feels it should be geared towards 12- and 13-year-olds. She believes a ban will make social media “more attractive”. “Strict parents create sneaky children ... If you bring in the ban you’ll really see that being played out. “I don’t think people realise how easy it is to work a VPN,” Sarah says, referring to a virtual private network. “Changing the country’s location is so phenomenally easy ... I’ve seen my friends do it when their parents are really strict on social media ... Most people my age, even if they’re allowed or not allowed social media by their parents, have accounts.” She says there needs to be more education and “digital media literacy”. Strict parents create sneaky children ... If you bring in the ban you’ll really see that being played out “If we bring in this ban we’re just going to presume kids aren’t on social media, because they shouldn’t be there, which then just creates a worse social media space ... Without having social media companies held accountable for keeping online safe for kids, it’s not going to be created safe for anyone else.” She points also to the opportunities social media creates for people who are part of minority groups to connect. “Most people have seen harmful videos on the internet. I think most of my friends and I saw the video of when Charlie Kirk was shot ... Obviously the trad wife trend, that has been very prevalent on social media recently. I understand that the Government is trying to help us and trying to protect us. And I do agree that something has to be done, and done soon ... banning it at 16 is just not the solution.” Zach Moore (14), from Greenhills, Dublin, uses WhatsApp, Snapchat and YouTube mostly. Social media is important to him. He too is part of the Webwise Youth Panel. That Andrew Tate fella. I remember getting a load of his videos at one point for a while, and then they just stopped “If I’m bored, I’d probably go on social media. If I needed to know something, I’d look it up. And I talk to my friends as well,” Zach says. If he comes across misogynistic, racist or other unacceptable content he says he ignores it or reports it. “That Andrew Tate fella. I remember getting a load of his videos at one point for a while, and then they just stopped. He seems like a bit of an extremist,” Zach says. He can see how this material can target boys. “I can definitely why they’d want to ban it, but to be honest I don’t think a complete ban would solve anything ... I think they would have been better to have mandatory parental controls. Leave it up to the parents.” Zach worries he spends too much time on social media sometimes. But he thinks if a ban was introduced in Ireland young people might spend more time trying to get around the ban rather than doing other things. He thinks some adults understand how important social media is to young people. “But some think that it’s all bad,” he says. “I don’t think that it’s all bad, but there definitely are certain areas that are malicious, or there’s no good intent.” [ Could Ireland follow Australia and ban under-16s from social media?Opens in new window ] He’d like to see “stricter moderation on platforms” and more education and support provided to teenagers on how to navigate problematic content that they might come across. He thinks the youth voice is important. “It’s definitely good to hear from people who are going to be directly affected, or people who are at risk of coming under the ban.” He expects adults and younger people may hold polar opposite views. Zach doesn’t think adults necessarily know best on this. “Especially with social media because it’s only really gained this much traction over the past 15 years.” Eve Cullen, from Tipperary, is 15. She uses TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat. I go online and I’m able to find thousands of other people who also enjoy that hobby and I can talk to them about it She feels “in theory it’s a good idea to stop letting kids use social media” but argues that a cut-off age of 16 is too high. “Eleven or 12 would be perfect.” At 15, she says, “a lot of our lives revolve around social media and it’s important to have”. She believes people will easily find a way around any ban. “I feel like a lot of the people who brought in this ban might not have kids themselves. Parents might know more about how kids are going to get around it.” Many young people find their “community” online, Eve says. She uses Snapchat to call and text people she already knows. “It’s great to meet new people on TikTok.” Eve says most young people have their wits about them when it comes to the danger of being contacted by strangers who may not be who they claim to be. “I don’t think it’s as big a problem as a lot of people make it out to be.” Eve has seen some upsetting content online. “I figure a way to go around it and ignore it. It’s not a huge thing online for me.” She insists she’s not hugely influenced by political, health or wellness content she sees online, saying she’s more likely to try out a recipe. She believes there are lots of positives to social media. “I love doing knitting and crochet and stuff like that. And there’s not many people in Thurles, where I live, that would be into that as well. I go online and I’m able to find thousands of other people who also enjoy that hobby and I can talk to them about it. But if social media was banned then I’d be very lonely in that hobby.” At school, Eve uses Instagram for her transition year (TY) mini-company. “Everyone in TY in our school [uses Instagram] to promote and advertise our products,” she explains. Her social media “used to be controlled when I was younger. There was an app on my phone that would block screen time,” Eve explains. But she feels at this age she is able to “self-police”. She worries that if teenagers weren’t granted access to social media until the age of 16, they wouldn’t know what things they “should look out for. They might get scammed, even, because they’ve never been exposed to it,” she says. Holly Heneghan (16) lives in Westmeath. She says she would hate a ban. “With Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok, the main three for me, it’s entertainment. Snapchat is for communicating with my friends ... I call and text on Snapchat.” She has seen things on social media that she doesn’t feel are appropriate for 12- and 13-year-olds to see, but feels things have improved. “There is still a lot of body positive stuff on social media now. [More] than there was when I was 12.” She has come across problematic material but “not necessarily in the apps that have been banned”. Inappropriate material can show up in advertisements that crop up in games, she explains. “There are times I’ve spent too much time on social media,” Holly admits, “but I go on social media because it shows me things I’m interested in. It gives me a break from the world because it shows sides that I like.” She doesn’t believe teens will accept the ban. “I think they’ll try and figure out a way to keep their social media.” Holly thinks a ban would make those under 16 more secretive about their social media use. She feels adults don’t necessarily understand the huge support social media can offer, including academically. “On TikTok there is a Stem site. It can teach you maths, science and engineering.” She believes the positives of social media outweigh the negatives. [Social media] gives me a break from the world because it shows sides that I like Hannah Goff (16) from Dublin, thinks a social media ban “is a really good idea” for younger people, but feels 14 or 15 may be a more appropriate cut-off age. “I don’t think people under 16 actually need phones to function.” She thinks younger teens could organise meet-ups through parents. “I think it might be easier as well for parents to understand where their child is and what their child might be doing.” She feels not having a phone could lead to under-16s meeting up with their friends in person more frequently. “However, I do think in Ireland there’s a lack of things to do for people under 16.” Hannah has learned a lot about content awareness in school. “If you know how to use social media, you’re better off with it, but I think people a lot of the time were just handing their kids phones ... and then they’re not really prepared for what they come across. [ A grand social media experiment begins in Australia. Will it work?Opens in new window ] “During the elections in the US I did see a lot of propaganda for Trump and Kamala. But I would just scroll past that. I don’t think I’ve seen anything that has been particularly disturbing or upsetting. But also I’ve been very careful to avoid that.” “You do see a lot of people online who are very different to how they normally look. They’re edited.” She feels younger people could be vulnerable to this. “I’ve seen a lot of eight- to 10-year-olds now who are using all the internet make-up”. Hannah believes the under-16s “will definitely” try to get around any ban “considering when the Yondr pouch was brought in. Everyone’s gotten around it at this point. “Teenagers, you tell them something to do and they will do the opposite. You give them a barrier and they’re going to go under it, over it, through it,” she says. Dr Colman Noctor, child and adolescent psychotherapist, says delaying access until a young person is mature enough “is the right thing to do”. But, he adds, “the how you do that is more complex”. He feels the Australian strategy, “while well intended, may not work”. “Imposing bans will always meet resistance and so some form of alliance with young people is far more likely to be successful. However, the difficulty is that young people think adults don’t have a clue about social media, and adults don’t think young people have a clue about real life. And both are probably true, but meeting a consensus will take time. “While I’m not sure the ban is the answer, waiting around for another 15 years to gain consensus is not a workable solution either,” Noctor says. “The damage of social media is happening now. “For me the only way this will be resolved is if the social media companies take the lead and invest in meaningfully protecting children, but that does not fit with their financial models so we have to do what we can in the meantime.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ukrainian negotiations drag on, by Thierry Meyssan

Peace negotiations in Ukraine are hampered by the Zelensky administration’s resistance. The administration is attempting to buy time, first through legal means, then through military means, and finally through political means. However, the contacts made suggest what this peace will look like. This article follows: 1 - “Straussians take control of the United Nations and NATO,” October 7, 2025. 2 - “Anti-Russian propaganda and preparations for war against Russia,” October 28, 2025. 3 - “The moment of truth: The West faces Russian military advances,” November 4, 2025. 4 - “The fall of the Zelensky regime and its allies,” November 25, 2025. 5 - “What lies behind the peace negotiations for Ukraine?” December 2, 2025. Peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are dragging on. Clearly, the Russian side, confident of victory, intends to liberate what remains of the Donbas as soon as possible, while the Ukrainian side refuses to concede anything. The Europeans of the EU and the UK are holding numerous meetings, almost one a day, with the sole obsession of continuing the war, with or without the United States. Two new events have changed the situation: Washington is considering leaving NATO, and the Ukrainians are accepting the idea of selling their country. On December 1st, a secret videoconference was held with the participation of: the French (Emmanuel Macron) and Finnish (Alexander Stubb) presidents, the German Chancellor (Friedrich Merz), the Polish (Donald Tusk), Italian (Giorgia Meloni), Danish (Mette Frederiksen), and Norwegian (Jonas Gahr Støre) prime ministers, the NATO Secretary General (Mark Rutte), the President of the European Commission (Ursula von der Leyen), and the President of the European Council (António Costa). According to Der Spiegel, which obtained a copy of the meeting’s minutes, the NATO Secretary General stated that he agreed with the Finnish president and that Europeans should be wary of the peace talks in Ukraine being negotiated by President Donald Trump’s special envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. [1] This is the first time a sitting NATO Secretary General has dared to openly criticize a sitting US President. The National Security Strategy, published on December 4 by the White House, mentions NATO five times. However, it is no longer a crucial alliance for the United States, given that President Trump has declared the end of the "American Empire." Washington is too preoccupied with its $33 trillion debt to dedicate itself to the defense of Western Europe. The document therefore merely notes that the member states of the Atlantic Alliance will have to ensure their own security by allocating 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP), a far cry from their current spending. It also notes that the alliance is not expected to expand further [2]. On December 9, five days later, a Republican representative, Thomas Massie (Kentucky), introduced a bill (HR 6508) aimed at withdrawing the United States from NATO. This bill was referred to the Foreign Affairs Committee on December 12 [3]. This is the first time this subject will be addressed in Congress. It is too early to draw any conclusions, but we must already acknowledge that there is a current within the Trump administration opposed to the Atlantic alliance, and that European states are aware that they will not be able to simultaneously ensure their own national defense and attack the Russian Federation. Privately, President Trump’s associates maintain that he will withdraw from the alliance by mid-2027; a deadline that could be brought forward. The leaders of the European Union are well aware of this. The President of the European Council, António Costa, declared on December 8th before the Jacques Delors Institute: “If we want to protect ourselves, not only against our adversaries, but also against allies who challenge us, we must strengthen Europe. We need to work together to build a Europe that understands that the relationships between allies and the alliances formed after the Second World War have changed.” Certainly, but EU members simply don’t have the resources of the United States. They cannot ensure their own defense alone. Moreover, if they wished to, they would have to organize themselves around one of the three nuclear powers in their region: France, the United Kingdom, or… Russia. A month ago, on November 11, Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, gave the signal for “Operation Midas.” The main allies of the unelected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, fell, one by one. It is inconceivable that he is not one of the main beneficiaries of the embezzlement of funds from Ukraine and the extortion of Ukrainian businesses. Yet no one dares to arrest him. Clearly, he is trying to cling to power to secure his gains or transfer them abroad. He first rallied Ukraine’s supporters, holding numerous meetings in Athens, Paris, London, Brussels, Rome, and Berlin, while his special representative and the secretary general of his Defense Council, Rustem Umerov, was already in hiding. Power in Ukraine is therefore now a shadowy affair: the unelected president could fall at any moment, and his chief negotiator can no longer return to his homeland. In an interview with Politico on December 9 [4], President Trump made the following statement: — Dasha Burns: Is it time for Ukraine to hold an election, do you think? — Donald Trump: Yes. I think so. It’s been a long time. It’s, uh... it hasn’t gone particularly well. Yes, I believe it’s time. I think it’s an important moment to hold elections. They’re using the war not to hold an election, but, uh, I think the Ukrainian people should... should have that choice. And maybe Zelenskyy would win. I don’t know who would win. But they haven’t had an election in a long time. You know, they talk about a democracy, but it’s getting to the point where it’s no longer a democracy. The unelected president immediately replied: "I am ready for elections. I am now asking, I am stating this openly, the United States to help me, possibly with European colleagues, to ensure security for holding elections." It is important to know that the Ukrainian Constitution prohibits elections during periods of martial law. Martial law was first imposed in 2018 by President Petro Poroshenko during the presidential election campaign [5]. Then, a second time, in 2022, by President Volodymyr Zelensky during the Russian special military operation. Martial law institutes nine measures: • Restrictions on the constitutional rights and freedoms of civilians; • Introduction of a "work obligation," applicable to everyone, whether employed or not, and which may include service in the military; • Seizure of state-owned property, or "forcibly disposing of" communal and private property "for the needs of the state"; • Introduction of a curfew; • Introduction of military checkpoints and restrictions on "the freedom of movement of citizens, foreigners, and stateless persons, as well as the movement of vehicles"; • Verification of individuals’ documents and inspection of their locations; • Prohibition of peaceful demonstrations, gatherings, and mass events; • Prohibition or restrictions on the media; • Prohibition or restrictions on the transfer of information on social media. In both cases, the aim was clearly to establish an authoritarian regime. While Poroshenko only implemented it for thirty days, Zelensky has renewed it every three months since February 2022. According to the sixteenth presidential decree on the matter that he promulgated, it is extended until next February. According to the Constitution, Volodymyr Zelensky’s term expired in May 2025. Since then, the Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada, Ruslan Stefanchuk, should have been serving as interim president. Not only did he not request this position, but he accompanied the outgoing president on his initial trips to assert his legitimacy. If elections were held today, the electoral lists would be falsified, as hundreds of thousands of soldiers killed in action are still listed. Under these circumstances, it would be child’s play for the regime to rig the ballot boxes. The Russian side has repeatedly emphasized that it cannot sign a peace agreement with an illegitimate figure. It recalls that President Poroshenko declared the Minsk agreements, signed by his special envoy and predecessor, Leonid Kuchma, null and void overnight because this high-ranking official had not been validated by him or by the Verkhovna Rada. The announcement by the now unelected Ukrainian president that he would agree to hold elections is therefore likely just a way to buy time and further postpone peace. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) estimated the value of Ukraine’s rare earth elements at between $10 trillion and $12 trillion during a June 9, 2024 interview on "Face the Nation" (CBS News). President Trump had mentioned the possibility of transferring them to the United States a few months earlier to repay what the war cost them. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent traveled to Kyiv on February 12 to discuss the matter with President Zelensky. So, on December 10, the unelected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, convened a videoconference with Scott Bessent, Jared Kushner (not as a negotiator in Moscow, but as head of the Affinity Partners fund), and Larry Fink (head of the BlackRock fund and already owner of a large portion of the farmland) [6]. The purpose was clearly to assess what could be purchased in exchange for the rare earths. What was unthinkable ten months ago had suddenly become possible. A second meeting was held the following day, December 11. Zelensky brought together the main US negotiators and invited the NATO Secretary General. The aim was to review security guarantees, given that NATO is no longer a permanent entity.

Title: Just 1–2% – Here’s how retirement funds can change crypto forever
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/just-1-2-heres-how-retirement-funds-can-change-crypto-forever/
Time Published: 2025-12-27T20:00:05Z

Even tiny allocations force exchanges and funds to adopt stronger practices. Retirement funds are built to be boring. That isn’t a flaw, it’s the point. They move as slowly as their beneficiaries, avoid surprises, and make the future feel manageable. On the other hand, crypto was built for the exact opposite. Because of this, it is often seen as too immature for pension money. This framing assumes that stability comes before participation. But, what if it works the other way around? Pension funds manage calendars, rather than money in the abstract. Salaries stop, pensions don’t. Assets that can drop in the double-digits as fast as you can say “crypto!” are difficult to square with that responsibility. Bitcoin, for all its growing legitimacy, still moves too much. In 2025 alone, it slid from near $120k to around $80k. This is a decline large enough to be called a “cycle” in crypto terms. However, this is a big problem in pension math. Crypto maxis know that this isn’t an outlier. Similar drops have been seen in the past too. Source: TradingView Price, though, is only part of the discomfort. Regulation remains uneven and often political, changing with court rulings and administrations. Custody has improved, but the industry hasn’t yet forgotten its own history. Exchange failures, frozen withdrawals, and creative accounting are still fresh in the mind, and even the rulebook is still being written. And then, there’s fiduciary duty. Pension managers are paid to avoid permanent loss, rather than explain it. By that measure, crypto still fails various tests. History has a way of taming assets that begin as inconvenient, volatile, and deeply unserious. This usually happens once large pools of patient capital decide it’s time to stop watching. Equities were the first. In the early 1900s, stock markets were thin, chaotic, and lightly regulated. Then, supervision changed everything. Pensions, insurers, and mutual funds arrived with scale, long time horizons, and a no-nonsense attitude. Disclosure standards followed. Audits became normal. The markets, eventually, behaved. When asked about the possibilities for crypto, Neil Staunton, CEO and co-founder of Superset told AMBCrypto, “Stablecoins, MMFs, RWAs, and the general tokenization of assets will bring institutional risk management into crypto markets.” However, he noted that it is not without its kinks. “The real risk is the absence of institutional standards. BlackRock was among the first to fully understand that risk.” Staunton noted that once BlackRock could change the risk profile, it had “the confidence to create an institutional product.” With this, the institution helped exchanges stop manipulation, making the asset reflect the true market. “Having mitigated those risks, they sold a product that became the fastest-growing ETF in history. Institutional best practices, once adopted, mature the market.” The CFA Institute has since put numbers to the pattern. Higher institutional ownership tends to bring better governance and greater stability over time. As it turns out, order in finance is… well, contagious. Property had its own makeover. Before institutional capital, real estate investing was local, illiquid, and occasionally opaque. Then came REITs (now a roughly $2 trillion global market) designed to translate bricks and rent into something we could actually live with. Municipal bonds followed a similar path as well. The capital arrived before the credibility. Crypto, for better or worse, may just be earlier in that same cycle. There is a particular kind of money that has no interest in being right quickly. Pension money arrives with time, and time has a way of changing rooms. Money that isn’t rushed makes markets quieter. Leverage looks less clever. What’s left is the work. The liquidity changes as well. Pension balance sheets aren’t dependent on cheap funding that vanishes under stress. They move slowly, if at all. With crypto, the instability will always remain but the extremes become less sharp. Even when pensions participate, they would do so carefully. Even a 1-2% crypto allocation would be diversified across assets, strategies, and risk buckets. That spreads exposure and reduces the maddening effects of the violent inflow-outflow cycles. And then, there are expectations. Audits. Custody. Risk frameworks. Habits carried over from more mature markets. Over time, those habits become standards, and the standards rearrange incentives. …and crypto is starting to see that now. Through infrastructure and scale. Source: downing.house.gov In the United States, this becomes clear if you look at ETFs and retirement frameworks. Since President Trump’s re-election, Washington has moved towards a more permissive stance on digital assets. This includes an executive order aimed at better access to crypto and other alternatives inside retirement plans. Source: SoSoValue The result has been a surge in regulated exposure. Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum ETFs have pulled in roughly $30 billion in net inflows YTD at the time of writing, led by products like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Source: SoSoValue Remember, none of these are fringe instruments. This matters because ETFs drag regulation with them. Court rulings, SEC approvals, custody rules, disclosure standards… none of these arrived because crypto asked nicely. Industry groups have been explicit too. Demand is strong, and the regulatory environment is adapting to meet it. Once pension systems, sovereign funds, and retirement plans engage (even cautiously), crypto becomes too systemically relevant to remain vague. For many pension systems, especially underfunded ones, instability is an existential concern. In the U.S, large public pension plans are 86.3% funded as of November 2025, per data from Milliman. This is a sign of sustained improvement; stronger balance sheets, but not unlimited risk tolerance. Source: Milliman Funds in that position simply do not have the luxury of absorbing big losses, no matter how compelling the long-term story is. Political risk hasn’t vanished either. Crypto regulations remain uneven across jurisdictions and borders, vulnerable to election cycles, court challenges, and sudden policy reversals. Even within the same country, there could be conflict. A more crypto-friendly posture at the higher level doesn’t automatically translate into support at the state or municipal level. Case in point – Key stakeholders continue to oppose New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani over his skepticism of crypto. His non-acceptance comes even with U.S policy growing more supportive after President Trump’s re-election. Then, there are the unresolved weaknesses. Fraud has not disappeared. Governance failures still surface. Custody infrastructure, while improving, is not foolproof. Even regulators acknowledge that oversight standards across exchanges and intermediaries remain inconsistent. So, no. This is not an argument that crypto is suddenly prudent. It is still risky. The difference is that it is no longer uniquely risky. Global pensions and retirement assets now run into the tens of trillions of dollars, spread across public funds, private plans, and sovereign systems. Against that backdrop, a 1-2% allocation to crypto is a rounding decision. And yet, even that small slice would matter, because that would change who the market is built for. Long-term retirement capital needs structure and rules that last. When it shows up, markets adjust. So, the real question is not whether pensions should take the leap with crypto. It is whether crypto ever truly grows up without them. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Russia Launches Drone Barrage on Kyiv Ahead of Zelenskyy-Trump Meeting

Rescue workers extinguish a fire in a high-rise residential building in the Dniprovskyi district damaged by a Russian drone strike on December 27, 2025 in Kyiv, Ukraine. The attacks came as Trump and Zelenskyy are expected to discuss critical questions in a Ukraine-Russia peace deal, including its territorial sovereignty, NATO protections, and control over its natural resources. As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made his way to Florida for a pivotal set of talks this weekend with US President Donald Trump, Russia launched a barrage of drone and missile attacks on Kyiv early Saturday morning. At least two people were killed in the Ukrainian capital during the 10-hour attack, with 44 more—including two children—injured. Hundreds of thousands of residents are left to brave near-freezing temperatures without heat following the attack, which cut off power supplies. The attack came as Zelenskyy prepared to stop in Canada before meeting with Trump on Sunday to discuss a 20-point plan to end the nearly four-year war with Russia that has been the subject of weeks of negotiation between US and Ukrainian emissaries. Zelenskyy is seeking to maintain Ukraine's territorial sovereignty without having to surrender territory—namely, the eastern Donbass region that is largely occupied by Russian forces. He also hopes that any agreement to end the war will come with a long-term security guarantee reminiscent of NATO. On Friday, Zelenskyy told reporters that the peace deal was 90% complete. But Trump retorted that Zelenskyy "doesn't have anything until I approve it." Trump has expressed hostility toward Zelenskyy throughout his presidency. In February, before berating him in a now-infamous Oval Office meeting, Trump insisted falsely that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for starting the war in 2022. Zelenskyy's latest peace proposal was issued in response to Trump's proposal last month, which was heavily weighted in Russia's favor. It called for Ukraine to recognize Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and cede the entirety of the Donbass, about 2,500 square miles of territory, to Russia, including territory not yet captured. Trump's plan puts a cap of 600,000 personnel on Ukraine's military and calls for Ukraine to add a measure in its constitution banning it from ever joining NATO. Earlier this year, Trump demanded that Ukraine give up $500 billion worth of its mineral wealth in what he said was "repayment" for US military support during the war (even though that support has only totalled about $175 billion). In his latest proposal, Trump has pared down his demands to the creation of a "Ukraine Development Fund" that would include the "extraction of minerals and natural resources" as part of a joint US-Ukraine reconstruction effort. While those terms appear less exploitative, the reconstruction program is expected to be financed by US loans from firms like BlackRock, which have been heavily involved in the diplomatic process. "The infrastructure rebuilt with these loans—ports, rail lines, power grid—won’t be Ukrainian in any meaningful sense. It’ll be owned by international consortiums, operated for profit, with revenues flowing out to service the debt," wrote the Irish geopolitical commentator Deaglan O'Mulrooney on Tuesday. "In other words, Ukraine will be gutted." Despite the criticism, Zelenskyy has signaled support in principle for the US reconstruction proposal as an alternative to direct expropriation. The "red lines" for Zelenskyy heading into his talk with Trump are related to Ukraine's territorial integrity. He has said he will not recognize Russian control of the Donbass, or the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe, which Russia currently controls. He has also demanded that all terms of a peace agreement come up for a referendum among the Ukrainian people, which is strongly against territorial concessions. At the same time, however, he insisted Saturday that "Ukraine is willing to do whatever it takes to stop this war." As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made his way to Florida for a pivotal set of talks this weekend with US President Donald Trump, Russia launched a barrage of drone and missile attacks on Kyiv early Saturday morning.

Title: Big Bet On Ethereum: CEO Sees 10X TVL Growth In 2026

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to Sharplink co-CEO Joseph Chalom, Ethereum could see a major jump in total value locked (TVL) next year if certain onchain trends pick up. Chalom put a bold number on it: 10X TVL in 2026. That claim ties together rising stablecoin use, bigger tokenization of real-world assets, and increased interest from big financial groups. Based on reports, the total stablecoin market stands at about $308 billion now and could grow to $500 billion by the end of next year, a rise of roughly 62%. Over half of all stablecoin activity — about 54% — happens on Ethereum. That math matters: more stablecoin flows on Ethereum tends to lift the protocol’s TVL because many of those dollars sit in smart contracts for swaps, lending, and liquidity pools. Sharplink Gaming holds 797,704 Ether, worth roughly $2.30 billion at the time of publication, a signal that some public treasuries are already staking big bets on the network. Chalom also expects tokenized real-world assets to expand rapidly, forecasting a $300 billion market for RWAs in 2026 and saying tokenized assets will 10X in AUM next year as funds, stocks, and bonds get wrapped onchain. In 2026, I believe Ethereum’s Total Value Locked (TVL) will increase 10X. Why and how? 🧵 Views ≠ investment advice. — Joseph Chalom (@joechalom) December 26, 2025 He points to rising interest from mainstream firms like JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock. Reports note that sovereign wealth funds may increase their Ethereum exposure by five- to tenfold, which could bring large, patient capital into tokenization projects and protocol deposits. Ethereum was trading near $2,921 on December 25, 2025, giving the network a market value of about $352 billion, while 24-hour trading volume came in at roughly $11.47 billion. Over the course of 2025, ETH moved through a full market swing. It opened the year around $3,298, climbed to about $4,390 in August, and stayed below its record high of $4,942, before sliding back to the $2,921 area by year-end. Price swings were heavy, with annual volatility close to 140%. Technical readings show mixed momentum. The weekly RSI sits at 41.7, placing Ethereum in a neutral-to-bearish zone, while the daily MACD histogram remains negative at -0.15. Price action has also been boxed into a narrow band between $2,774 and $3,038. Futures data adds to the cautious tone. Total open interest stands near $37 billion, down 0.62% over the past 24 hours, pointing to reduced exposure from traders. Liquidation data shows more than $100 million in potential long liquidations clustered between $2,880 and $2,910, an area now seen as a key pressure point. Not everyone agrees that token flows will translate into quick price gains. According to crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen, Ether is unlikely to hit new highs next year given current Bitcoin conditions. That caution lines up with technicals that point to range-bound trading and with the fact that open interest has eased slightly. The liquidation cluster near $2,880–$2,910 shows where leveraged positions could be forced out, and that kind of stress can push price moves faster than fundamentals.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Asset management giant BlackRock says one powerhouse sector of the market is going strong heading into 2026. In a new report, BlackRock says the next year will be defined by artificial intelligence (AI), which the firm says is growing at an unprecedented rate and will help push the US stock market to heights it has never seen before. “We’ve long argued we’re in a world of structural transformation shaped by a few mega forces, including geopolitical fragmentation, the future of finance and the energy transition. But the most obvious now is AI, with a buildout of a potentially unprecedented speed and scale. This shift to capital-intensive growth from capital-light is profoundly changing the investment environment and pushing limits on multiple fronts – physical, financial and socio-political. A few big macro drivers implies a few big market drivers. Today’s market concentration reflects underlying economic concentration. That means investors can’t avoid making big calls, in our view. AI is the dominant mega force right now, helping propel U.S. stocks to all-time highs this year… We stay overweight U.S. stocks and the AI theme, supported by robust earnings expectations. The capex (capital expenditure) may pay off overall even if not for individual companies. The next phase may be more about energy and resolving bottlenecks.” However, BlackRock notes that AI does face challenges, such as its extremely high rate of energy consumption. “AI data centers could use 15-20% of current U.S. electricity demand by 2030 – a scale sure to test the limits of power grid, fossil and materials industries… Some estimates even suggest data centers could use a quarter of current electricity demand. Rising power demand collides with a backlog of projects waiting to connect with the electric grid and generally slow permitting in the West. Capex plans could be walked back if such limits bite, crimping ambition around the AI buildout.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Farrell and McCracken: colossal impact of Irish football legends still felt today
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/2025/12/27/farrell-and-mccracken-colossal-impact-of-irish-football-legends-still-felt-today/
Time Published: 2025-12-27T06:00:01Z
Full Content:
Early on in The Emerald Evertonian, a new book about the life and times of Peter Farrell, comes a remarkable detail revealing something of the status of soccer in 1930s Ireland. The young Farrell had just joined Cabinteely United, then run by an enthusiast called Christy Devlin. “The team’s ‘pavilion’,” writes author Rob Sawyer, “was a huge tree . . .” The tree was behind one goalmouth and under its branches, the players changed and deposited any valuables a 13 year-old from south Dublin might possess. Farrell saw the difference when he played Gaelic football “on much better grounds than our soccer one at Cabinteely”. He added: “We also had a well-equipped pavilion with showers at our school sports ground at Dún Laoghaire.” But Farrell was inspired, not dismayed. Even though Devlin earned little as a gravedigger, he and his wife would feed “several” boys before matches. Farrell took it all in. Early on in The Offside King, a new book about the life and times of Bill McCracken, comes his verdict on arriving at Newcastle train station at 3am, having just been transferred from Distillery. He was be met by three Newcastle United directors in “old-fashioned frock coats... I c...uldn’t help saying to myself ‘Begarra – they look more like undertakers’.” McCracken was dismayed, not inspired. But he endured his first unhappy months at St James’ Park and went on to become “a true legend of the game“, in the words of author Paul Joannou. Irish football, gravediggers and undertakers, there’s a joke in there. Farrell, from Dublin, and McCracken, from Belfast, were serious men, though. They were rich with connections great and small and these two books help build out our knowledge of who and what Irish football was and how we are where we are. This is social history as well as the charting of two fascinating football lives. Peter Farrell, for example, married Mabel Carney, whose aunt Winnie was the Winifred Carney alongside James Connolly at the GPO in 1916. The scent of independence may also have been in Farrell’s nostrils when he played in the first Ireland (FAI) international after the second World War. It was June, 1946, in Lisbon against Portugal and Farrell was made captain, even though it was his debut. That must have been some moment. Afterwards, back in Dublin at a ceremony at the Gresham hotel, he was presented with this first cap. Rather than hold on to it, maybe frame it, Farrell instead gave it to his guest at the Gresham – Christy Devlin. The big tree at Cabinteely had not been forgotten. Untold numbers of Irish soccer volunteers – and those who benefited – will recognise this reciprocal commitment and affection. In the 1910 FA Cup final replay, held at Goodison Park, McCracken was part of a Newcastle United side winning the trophy for the first time. McCracken was the penalty-taker and at 1-0 up, Newcastle were awarded one. But McCracken knew centre forward Albert Shepherd had been the subject of bribery gossip before the semi-final and was not selected. Shepherd was reinstated for the final and scored the opening goal. As McCracken passed him for the penalty, he said to Shepherd: “Fancy it? Go on, take it.” McCracken’s motivation was “to get him re-established”. Shepherd scored and entered the history books as the first player ever to score a penalty in an FA Cup final. Really, it should be McCracken. Thirty-nine years later there was another penalty in a 2-0 win at Goodison. It was England v Ireland (FAI) and Con Martin scored the spot-kick. Farrell scored the second as Ireland became the first “foreign” nation to beat England on English soil. Farrell was an Everton player by then, winning the 10th of 28 caps. He had passed through Shamrock Rovers, under the supervision of Jimmy Dunne, and won a tennis tournament in Blackrock. A dual international, he made the last of his seven Ireland (IFA) appearances six months earlier. McCracken played for Ireland (IFA), but only 16 times due to a row over pay. The blazers in Belfast barred him from selection for 11 years. Bureaucrats and Irish football. This was when McCracken was at his peak, but in asking for equal pay with English and Scottish internationals, he was deemed a troublemaker. The IFA ban extended to Irish League clubs and given there was no Border then, McCracken was effectively banned from setting foot on an a pitch anywhere in Ireland. Simultaneously, he was becoming the most talked-about footballer in England. Working in a Tyneside munitions factory during the first World War, McCracken was known for his prominent role in fundraising friendlies. It was a bit different from his reputation as a defender – ‘The Most Hated Man in Football’ was one headline. That attitude stemmed from his offside capabilities. McCracken was so efficient at offside that ‘McCrackenism’ became a term. In 1925, Law 6 of the game was changed from having three players between an attacker and goal to be onside, to two. The man from Nansen Street off the Falls Road changed the geometry of football forever. McCracken played 432 times for Newcastle United – Shay Given is one of only four players to have more appearances. Farrell played 452 times for Everton – only four men have made more league appearances for the club. Both went into management after playing, McCracken with Hull City, Gateshead, Millwall and Aldershot, Farrell with Tranmere Rovers, where his great friend and Evertonian Tommy Eglington played. Success, and failure, for both men is seen in context – neither were managing clubs with big budgets. McCracken returned to the Irish League as a Newcastle scout to sign George Eastham from Ards, then as a Watford scout to sign Pat Jennings from Newry Town. Farrell went briefly to the League of Ireland, playing three games for Sligo Rovers. It means he, Dixie Dean and Séamus Coleman, who writes the book’s foreword, are three men to have played for Everton and Sligo. Farrell went back to Britain – to Holyhead Town in Wales – then returned to Ireland for good. He managed Drogheda United briefly, then St Pat’s and TEK United. There he came to know another Devlin – Pat. Like all who came into contact with Farrell, Pat Devlin says he felt honoured to know the man. Lest anyone think this esteem is exaggerated, walk down Farrell Close in Kirkby in Liverpool, the street named after him. McCracken has less formal recognition, although his central role in changing a key law of the game will be reasserted by The Offside King, just as The Emerald Evertonian illustrates the significance of Peter Farrell. Two compelling men. Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Groq continues innovation after raisingÂ $750M (September 2025) at a $9B valuation. Nvidia solidifies dominance amid competition fromÂ Cerebras SystemsÂ andÂ Google TPUs. In a move that further solidifies its dominance in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, Nvidia has secured a non-exclusive licensing agreement with AI chip startup Groq, bringing aboard its founder, CEO Jonathan Ross, and key executives to bolster its inference technology capabilities. The deal, announced by Groq on Wednesday, Dec. 24, allows Nvidia to license Groq's proprietary AI inference technology while hiring Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other senior engineers. Groq will continue operating independently under new CEO Simon Edwards, with its cloud platform, GroqCloud, remaining unaffected. Groq, founded in 2016 by former Google engineers, specializes in AI inferenceâthe process of running trained AI models to generate predictions or responses, such as those seen in ChatGPT or image recognition systems. The company developed its customÂ Language Processing Unit (LPU), designed for high-speed, low-cost AI inference. "AI inference, in the context of artificial intelligence, refers to the process by which AI models draw conclusions or make predictions based on input data. This process is a fundamental aspect of AI, enabling machines to learn, reason and make decisions," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. AI inference can be categorized into two primary types: inductive and deductive inference. A third one, probabilistic inference, involves making decisions or drawing conclusions based on probabilities and statistical models. This type of inference is commonly used in Bayesian AI networks and Deep Learning models. Nvidia, already the leader in AI training chips, is now doubling down on inferenceâa critical next phase as AI shifts from development to real-world deployment. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, emphasized the strategic importance of the deal in an internal email obtained by CNBC: "We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A new trend: Talent-focused deals The agreement follows a growing Silicon Valley trend where tech giants acquire key talent rather than entire companiesâa strategy that avoids regulatory hurdles while securing top-tier expertise. Recent examples include: Microsoft'sÂ deal withÂ Inflection AI, bringing co-founder Mustafa Suleyman onboard. Google'sÂ $2.5 billion licensing agreement withÂ Character.AI, hiring only select employees. Meta'sÂ $14 billion investment inÂ Scale AI, absorbing its CEO to lead AI initiatives. Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive (a major Groq investor), confirmed to CNBC that Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assetsânot the entire companyâfor an estimatedÂ $20 billion, marking Nvidia's largest deal ever. Geopolitical implications: U.S. AI leadership The deal aligns with President Donald Trump'sÂ July executive orderÂ promoting the export of U.S. AI technology to maintain global dominance. Groq has been a key player in this initiative, powering AI infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies and overÂ 2 million developers worldwide. "Inference is defining this era of AI, and we're building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost," Ross stated in September. While Nvidia strengthens its AI ecosystem, Groq will continue innovating under new leadership. The startup had previously raisedÂ $750 million in September at a $6.9 billion valuation, with investors includingÂ BlackRock, Samsung and Donald Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital. As AI transitions from lab development to global deployment, Nvidia's latest move ensures it remains at the forefrontâboth in trainingÂ andÂ inference. With competitors likeÂ Cerebras SystemsÂ andÂ Google's TPUsÂ vying for market share, the AI chip wars are far from over.

Watch the video below about President Donald Trump praising Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang for U.S. AI chip push. This video is from theÂ NewsClips channel on Brighteon.com. Sources include: TheEpochTimes.com BusinessInsider.com CNBC.com ChannelNewsAsia.com BrightU.ai Brighteon.com Groq, founded in 2016 by former Google engineers, specializes in AI inferenceâthe process of running trained AI models to generate predictions or responses, such as those seen in ChatGPT or image recognition systems. The company developed its customÂ Language Processing Unit (LPU), designed for high-speed, low-cost AI inference. "AI inference, in the context of artificial intelligence, refers to the process by which AI models draw conclusions or make predictions based on input data. This process is a fundamental aspect of AI, enabling machines to learn, reason and make decisions," said BrightU.AI's Enoch. AI inference can be categorized into two primary types: inductive and deductive inference. A third one, probabilistic inference, involves making decisions or drawing conclusions based on probabilities and statistical models. This type of inference is commonly used in Bayesian AI networks and Deep Learning models. Nvidia, already the leader in AI training chips, is now doubling down on inferenceâa critical next phase as AI shifts from development to real-world deployment. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, emphasized the strategic importance of the deal in an internal email obtained by CNBC: "We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A new trend: Talent-focused deals The agreement follows a growing Silicon Valley trend where tech giants acquire key talent rather than entire companiesâa strategy that avoids regulatory hurdles while securing top-tier expertise. Recent examples include: Microsoft'sÂ deal withÂ Inflection AI, bringing co-founder Mustafa Suleyman onboard. Google'sÂ $2.5 billion licensing agreement withÂ Character.AI, hiring only select employees. Meta'sÂ $14 billion investment inÂ Scale AI, absorbing its CEO to lead AI initiatives. Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive (a major Groq investor), confirmed to CNBC that Nvidia is acquiring Groq's assetsânot the entire companyâfor an estimatedÂ $20 billion, marking Nvidia's largest deal ever. Geopolitical implications: U.S. AI leadership The deal aligns with President Donald Trump'sÂ July executive orderÂ promoting the export of U.S. AI technology to maintain global dominance. Groq has been a key player in this initiative, powering AI infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies and overÂ 2 million developers worldwide. "Inference is defining this era of AI, and we're building the American infrastructure that delivers it with high speed and low cost," Ross stated in September. While Nvidia strengthens its AI ecosystem, Groq will continue innovating under new leadership. The startup had previously raisedÂ $750 million in September at a $6.9 billion valuation, with investors includingÂ BlackRock, Samsung and Donald Trump Jr.'s 1789 Capital. As AI transitions from lab development to global deployment, Nvidia's latest move ensures it remains at the forefrontâboth in trainingÂ andÂ inference.

Title: Ethereum's TVL could skyrocket '10X' in 2026: Sharplink CEO

Time Published: 2025-12-26T23:46:28Z

A surge in stablecoins, tokenized RWAs and growing sovereign wealth fund interest could drive a major increase in Ethereum’s TVL in 2026, Sharplink’s co-CEO said. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) may surge ten-fold in 2026 as adoption expands across multiple use cases and institutional investors, according to Sharplink’s co-CEO Joseph Chalom. Sharplink Gaming is the second-largest public Ethereum treasury company, holding 797,704 ETH (ETH), worth roughly $2.33 billion at the time of publication, according to Ethereum Treasuries data. “The stablecoin market will hit $500B by the end of next year,” Chalom predicted in an X post on Friday, as the total stablecoin market capitalization currently sits at around $308.46 billion. A move to $500 billion would represent an increase of about 62%. With over half of the total stablecoin activity (54%) taking place on Ethereum, such a rise could potentially contribute to an increase in the network’s TVL. Chalom also expects tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) to see significant growth, forecasting the market will reach $300 billion in 2026. “Tokenized assets will 10X in AUM in 2026, going from tokenizing individual funds, stocks, and bonds to full fund complexes,” Chalom said. He pointed to rising interest over the past year from financial services companies including JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and BlackRock as a major catalyst. An increasing TVL is often seen as a sign of growing interest in the network, which can bolster market sentiment and potentially influence the price of the asset. At the time of publication, Ethereum’s TVL is around $68.20 billion, according to DeFiLlama. However, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen said on Tuesday that Ether is unlikely to hit new highs in the coming year, given current conditions for Bitcoin. At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $2,924, down 3.12% over the past 30 days, according to CoinMarketCap. Chalom anticipates Ethereum holdings and tokenization activity by sovereign wealth funds to grow five- to tenfold over the next year. Related: Ethereum in 2026: Glamsterdam and Hegota forks, L1 scaling and more “In 2026 this will amplify meaningfully as competitive dynamics take hold. When no one was willing to touch crypto from this pool of allocators, it was safe to stay sidelined,” Chalom said. Chalom also predicted that onchain AI agents and prediction markets will “go mainstream,” which he said will drive more activity and value to the ecosystem.

Title: Etheruem’s tokenization role takes focus as Tom Lee outlines bullish outlook

Fundstrat’s head of research said institutional tokenization supports a $7,000–$9,000 Ether price in early 2026 and a longer-term case for $20,000. Cointelegraph in your social feed Ethereum’s growing role in institutional finance took center stage on CNBC’s Power Lunch this week, when Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said Ether could climb to $7,000–$9,000 by early 2026 as Wall Street accelerates efforts to tokenize assets and move financial activity onchain. Lee said Ether’s (ETH) investment case is increasingly tied to its use as financial infrastructure, as Wall Street experiments with onchain settlement and tokenized securities. “Wall Street wants to tokenize everything,” Lee said, pointing to initiatives at Robinhood and BlackRock. The shift, he said, could bring efficiencies to traditional finance while anchoring real-world use cases on Ether. He added that Ether could eventually reach $20,000 as adoption deepens. He was also bullish on Bitcoin (BTC), calling it a “genuine store of value” and saying a move to $200,000 next year “makes a lot of sense,” framing its recent underperformance versus gold as temporary. Lee is also chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies, the leading Ether-focused treasury company that has reported holdings of 4,066,062 ETH, according to CoinGecko data. Related: 70% of Ether positions are 'long' as whale accumulation tightens ETH supply Tokenized real-world assets, traditional financial instruments and physical assets represented onchain have expanded rapidly this year, with total market value rising to about $18.9 billion, up from roughly $5.6 billion at the start of 2025. According to data from RWA.xyz, US Treasury debt is the largest tokenized asset class at around $8.5 billion, followed by commodities at about $3.4 billion. Ethereum currently accounts for the majority of tokenized RWA value across public blockchains. As of late December 2025, the network hosts more than $12 billion in tokenized assets, well ahead of alternatives such as BNB Chain, Solana and Arbitrum. Ethereum also leads stablecoin issuance, with roughly $170 billion in stablecoins issued on the network, reinforcing its role as the primary settlement layer for dollar-denominated activity onchain. Institutional interest in tokenized RWAs continued to build in December, when the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) said it plans to tokenize a portion of US Treasury securities held at its Depository Trust Company subsidiary on the Canton Network. DTCC operates post-trade infrastructure for US securities markets, with its subsidiaries processing about $3.7 quadrillion in securities transactions last year.

Title: Expert Alleges Bitcoin Under Siege Again, ETFs And BlackRock Suspected
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-under-siege-etfs-and-blackrock-suspected/
Time Published: 2025-12-26T19:52:41Z
Full Content:
The recent surge in Bitcoin (BTC) volatility has led to significant liquidations, prompting renewed suspicions of market manipulation among experts. A detailed analysis by market expert NoLimit on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) reveals that, at the time of the stock market opening, BlackRock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) IBIT transferred hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin into Coinbase Prime wallets. This timing and location indicate a pattern that institutions often follow when selling their assets. As explained, these coins are not sent to Coinbase Prime merely to remain inactive; they are typically directed there for sale or liquidity management purposes. NoLimit asserts that when a major player like BlackRock needs to liquidate assets or meet redemption demands, the price of Bitcoin reacts rapidly. He suggests that this situation reflects a combination of factors: selling related to ETFs taking place during low liquidity, inventory management in anticipation of upcoming volatility, and risk reduction in light of a significant derivatives event. Compounding these concerns, technical analyst OxNobler highlighted further developments that contributed to the recent downturn, detailing significant sell-offs by various trading platforms. In a rapid succession of transactions, Binance reportedly sold 10,155 BTC, Wintermute let go of 5,354 BTC, Coinbase disposed of 10,113 BTC, BlackRock sold 4,945 BTC, and Kraken moved 4,630 BTC. Collectively, these actions amounted to over $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin sold within a mere 30 minutes, raising suspicions of coordinated market manipulation. According to analysts from Bull Theory, the situation has taken a dire turn, with Bitcoin plummeting by $2,300 and liquidating $66 million in long positions in just 45 minutes. Against this backdrop, $60 billion has been wiped from the crypto market without any negative news triggering such a drastic shift. This scenario has led them to assert that manipulation continues to be a significant concern within the broader crypto market. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $87,340, down slightly more than 30% from its all-time highs set earlier in October.

Instead, most of the biggest headlines attached to the financial services organization were irrelevant to trading screens, most notably the conclusion to its years-long battle with the SEC, major acquisitions to propel its future growth, and the launch of a billion-dollar stablecoin product—RLUSD. Below we’ll look back at the biggest highlights for XRP and Ripple in 2025. More than four years after it began, the legal dispute between Ripple Labs Inc. and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially came to a close in August. The landmark case, which investigated whether or not sales of XRP violated securities laws, extended back to December 2020. In 2023, a partial ruling favored Ripple Labs, but appeals and counter-appeals extended the saga into 2025. However, with the election of President Donald Trump and a crypto-friendlier regulatory administration, the pair opted to find a jointly negotiated resolution in early 2025. That negotiated resolution was later denied by a U.S. district judge, and then by the courts, so eventually the pair agreed to drop their respective appeals—ending the affair for good and cementing the 2023 ruling in Ripple’s favor as a precedent for future crypto classifications. Prior to 2025, XRP had last traded above $3.00 in 2018. Seven years later, and around a month before the conclusion to Ripple Labs’ yearslong legal battle with the SEC, the Ripple-linked XRP made a new all-time high of $3.65, according to data from CoinGecko, surging beyond its previous high mark of $3.40 from 2018. That made XRP the third-largest crypto asset by market capitalization at the time, trailing just Bitcoin and Ethereum. With regulatory scrutiny waning, analysts at the time told Decrypt that investors “believed in Ripple's vision for a regulatory-compliant blockchain for institutions.” Though its rapid rise placed the token in a range it had not seen since 2018, investment firms like Standard Chartered maintained even higher end-of-year price targets for XRP during the summer—expecting a move to $5.50 by the end of year. That mark seems unlikely now though, despite the acceleration of the tokenization trend that Standard Chartered highlighted as a potential catalyst for the price of XRP. XRP, now the fourth-largest asset by market capitalization, was changing hands at $1.90 as of December 15, around 48% off its July all-time high. After the approval and ensuing success of ETFs for crypto majors Bitcoin and Ethereum, both investors and fund issuers were eager to get altcoin ETFs—like those for XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin—to market. As a result, applications for altcoin ETFs flooded the SEC, and by June, expert opinions predicted the likelihood of their approvals as a “near lock” for 2025. Those opinions were further validated in September when the SEC cleared a path to approval for new ETFs by signing off on new generic listing standards. Around that time, Rex Shares and Osprey Funds got their joint XRP ETF to market—an Act 40 ETF that follows different listing standards than other crypto ETFs. Demand for the product was shown immediately, grabbing $38 million in day one volume, good enough to mark the year’s biggest debut up until that point. Shortly thereafter, though, more traditional spot ETF products from Canary Capital, Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton hit the market. In December, leveraged products hit the market as well, allowing investors to double their exposure to XRP’s gains. Since their launch, the spot ETFs have generated nearly $1 billion in net inflows without a single day of outflows, according to data from CoinGlass, as of December 15. XRP eclipsed a major milestone in 2025, but so did Ripple Labs’ stablecoin, RLUSD. First launched in December 2024, the dollar-backed stablecoin frontran the growing trend of stablecoin products from other financial giants like Western Union and JP Morgan, and the passing of the GENIUS Act, which provided regulatory clarity on the issuance and trading of the fiat-backed tokens. In the year since its launch, functionality for RLUSD has expanded. In September it was added to Securitize’s tokenization platform, a BlackRock-backed platform that now allows users to exchange shares of tokenized money market funds for RLUSD. In December the firm earned approval to broaden payment services, including RLUSD, in Singapore as well. It's being used for credit card settlements too, thanks to a partnership with Mastercard and WebBank, the issuer of crypto exchange Gemini’s credit card products. While RLUSD is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, Ripple applied for a National Bank Charter in July, following the lead of USDC issuer Circle, as it aims to become the “benchmark for trust” in the stablecoin market. And it received conditional approval in December, alongside other stablecoin issuers. At the time of writing, the stablecoin has reached a $1.3 billion market cap, making it the 11th largest stablecoin in less than a year since its launch, according to data from DefiLlama. Though closely linked to XRP, Ripple is much larger and more expansive than a single crypto token, and its footprint grew considerably throughout 2025 thanks to major acquisitions. In April, the firm forked over $1.25 billion to acquire primer brokerage Hidden Road as it aimed to better serve institutional clients on a larger scale. It then spent another $1 billion to acquire treasury asset management firm GTreasury in October, in a play that will reduce friction and costs associated with legacy financial systems, according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse. It surrounded that acquisition with two others, paying $200 million to add Toronto-based stablecoin platform Rail, and an undisclosed amount on wallet-as-a-service provider Palisade. All told, Ripple's acquisitions in 2025 maintain a similar theme, improving payment efficiencies while expanding its financial services offerings. Those moves helped the firm notch a $500 million investment in November, valuing it at $40 billion and cementing its place among the current and future leaders of the crypto industry. "This investment isn’t just validation of Ripple’s growth strategy and business built on the foundation of XRP, but also a clear bet on what the future of crypto will look like," Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse wrote on X. "I’m very proud of what we’ve built, and all that’s to come."

Nvidia invests $20 billion to license Groq's AI technology and hire its leadership. The deal is a strategic move to counter Google's growing influence in AI inference hardware. Structuring it as a licensing agreement aims to avoid intense antitrust scrutiny. Nvidia gains key talent from Google's TPU project to bolster its own chip development. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. The deal is a strategic move to counter Google's growing influence in AI inference hardware.

Nvidia gains key talent from Google's TPU project to bolster its own chip development. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. The transaction highlights the critical and costly race for control over foundational AI hardware. In a move that reshapes the battlefield of artificial intelligence hardware, chip giant Nvidia has strategically deployed a massive $20 billion to secure the technology and brains behind a key startup, Groq. This deal, structured as a licensing agreement and talent acquisition, represents Nvidia's largest such transaction ever and is a direct response to rising competition, particularly from Google's custom tensor processing units (TPUs). For those watching the high-stakes race for AI inference supremacy, this is a clear signal that the arms race is accelerating, with Nvidia pulling out its checkbook to maintain its edge. The agreement, announced just before the Christmas holiday, sees Nvidia licensing Groq's AI inference technology and hiring away its founder and CEO, Jonathan Ross, along with President Sunny Madra and other senior leaders. Ross is a pivotal figure, having previously helped launch Google's TPU project. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang outlined the rationale in an internal email, stating, "We plan to integrate Groqâs low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads." A deal structured for scrutiny While publicly framed as a "non-exclusive licensing agreement," multiple reports confirm the total value approaches $20 billion in cash for Groq's assets. This complex structure is widely seen as a tactic to navigate intense antitrust scrutiny. Groq will continue to operate independently, at least in name, with its finance chief Simon Edwards becoming the new CEO. Its cloud service, GroqCloud, will also continue operating. As Huang noted, "While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groqâs IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company." This "acqui-hire plus licensing" model has become a common playbook for Big Tech. Similar deals have been executed by Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia itself earlier this year. The approach allows giants to rapidly absorb innovative technology and top-tier talent without triggering the same level of regulatory review as a traditional acquisition. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon observed, "Antitrust would seem to be be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive." The Google factor and inference wars The strategic impetus for this massive expenditure is clear. Nvidia, while dominant in chips for training AI models, faces a growing challenge in the inference market, where trained models deliver answers to user queries. Google's custom TPUs have gained significant momentum here, offering an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs). Groq's specialty is its "language processing unit" chips, designed specifically for fast, efficient inference. By bringing Groq's technology and TPU-savvy leadership in-house, Nvidia is buying a shortcut to compete more directly with Google's in-house advances. This is a defensive and offensive move, ensuring its hardware remains the go-to choice as the AI industry's focus increasingly shifts from training models to deploying them at scale. The deal came together rapidly, reportedly just months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation in September. It is crucial to distinguish Groq from "Grok," the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's xAI. The similar names are a coincidence, but this deal is purely about the underlying silicon that powers such AI applications. For investors who backed Groq's recent funding round, including firms like BlackRock and a fund where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner, the payoff is staggering: a tripling of their investment in roughly three months. This highlights the immense financial firepower Nvidia has accumulated, with more than $60 billion in cash on hand, and its willingness to spend it to consolidate power. The conclusion is unmistakable. In the relentless march of AI progress, control over the foundational hardware is paramount. Nvidia's historic $20 billion deal is not just a purchase of technology; it is an investment in maintaining sovereignty over the future of computation itself. As custom chips from tech giants and well-funded startups emerge, this move proves that even the market leader cannot afford to simply innovate; it must also strategically assimilate.

Sources for this article include: ZeroHedge.com WSJ.com Reuters.com CNBC.com By bringing Groq's technology and TPU-savvy leadership in-house, Nvidia is buying a shortcut to compete more directly with Google's in-house advances. This is a defensive and offensive move, ensuring its hardware remains the go-to choice as the AI industry's focus increasingly shifts from training models to deploying them at scale. The deal came together rapidly, reportedly just months after Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation in September. It is crucial to distinguish Groq from "Grok," the AI chatbot developed by Elon Musk's xAI. The similar names are a coincidence, but this deal is purely about the underlying silicon that powers such AI applications. For investors who backed Groq's recent funding round, including firms like BlackRock and a fund where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner, the payoff is staggering: a tripling of their investment in roughly three months. This highlights the immense financial firepower Nvidia has accumulated, with more than $60 billion in cash on hand, and its willingness to spend it to consolidate power. The conclusion is unmistakable. In the relentless march of AI progress, control over the foundational hardware is paramount.
