Title: What Would Be Worse Than Death To TikTok? Elon Musk Buying It!

Anybody else sad about a potential TikTok ban? Just me? Love the platform, it brings back memories of having cable television and flipping channels for hours. I downloaded it to make sure the children were not showing too much front or back cleavage on there while they recorded themselves doing the floss-dance, and now I use it more than they do. I’ve discovered artists I never would have (Doechii!), learned to fix food I never would otherwise (cucumber salads!) and there’s good news content on there too (Under The Desk!) Anyway, the TikTok ban from app stores is set to take effect Sunday, and UGH, Bloomberg has reported that no grosser of an oligarch than Elon Musk is wanting to buy it, which would be the only thing worse than it disappearing from app stores on Sunday. Just what the world needs, another platform forcing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and racist Pepes in front of your eyeballs! Bloomberg’s report, based on “people familiar with the matter” seems kind of sus from the jump, though, starting with the first line, “Chinese officials are evaluating a potential option that involves Elon Musk acquiring the US operations of TikTok.” 订阅！(Subscribe!) First of all, the Chinese government doesn’t own TikTok, though a Chinese guy founded it, and was never incorporated there. It’s owned by ByteDance Ltd., which is headquartered in the Cayman Islands, and TikTok Inc. is headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore, with servers (where the algorithm happens) in Virginia. Sixty percent of ByteDance is owned by non-Chinese global institutional investors including Susquehanna International Group (majority shareholder Jeff Yass), the Carlyle Group, General Atlantic, KKR, BlackRock, and Tiger Global Management; 20 percent of the firm is owned by Beijing-based founder Zhang Yiming, and 20 percent is owned by employees. Three of the company's five board members are Americans, and the other two are based in Hong Kong and Singapore. Content moderation happens in Ireland. User data is not stored in China. Founder Zhang Yiming is not a Chinese official, and even if he were, how would Chinese officials be able to do shit about shit or sell anything that they do not own? Bloomberg, you are sloppy. TikTok has denied any talks of a sale to Musk. Furthermore, its US operations are worth about $50 billion, so would Elon even have that kind of liquidity to put up 12 percent of his net worth in cash, especially after reportedly promising to use his cash to primary any Republicans who vote against Pete Hegseth’s confirmation? Even for him, that’s kind of a lot. And would board members ever approve such a sale, considering the guy anti-Rumplestiltskinned his $44 billion investment in Twitter to a value of $15 billion because advertisers and users have fled it like a hot turd? Sounds most likely that “people familiar with the matter” was Elon, after smoking a bone in his owl hoodie. (ICYMI) This whole very unprecedented ban is such entire bullshit, nothing more than Trump getting his way, which he openly admits. About 40 percent of people between 18-29 say they get their news from TikTok, and he fucking hated that so many people were talking shit about him on an app with 170 million users that he could not control. So Mike Johnson crammed the ban into the Republicans’ $95 billion foreign aid package. But then Jeff Yass invested in Trump’s shitty media platform, and flew down to Florida to kiss Trump’s ass, and the algorithm started being nice to Trump, and helped him win young voters, so then he liked it again. As you know, I used TikTok very successfully in my campaign. I have a man named TikTok Jack. He was very effective, obviously, because I won youth by 30 percent. All Republicans lose youth. I don't know why. Maybe it's changing. And last time we were down 30 percent with youth. This time we're up 35 percent with youth. And I used TikTok, so I can't really, you know — I can't totally hate it. It was very effective. PREVIOUSLY! The ban was ALL about him opposing the expression of opinions and words, which is as un-First Amendment-y as it gets. Also notable, the end of TikTok will mean the end of income for millions of content creators and revenue for about 7 million small businesses on there, some of whom do quite well. TikTok drove $15 billion in revenue to small businesses in 2023 and contributed $24.2 billion to the US GDP. The Bill was called “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,” and singles out TikTok in particular, even though it is not controlled by a foreign adversary. It is not an app without sin, it must be said; the company has been investigated over its (American) employees tracking multiple journalists covering it, and in 2022 the company fired the chief internal auditor who led the team responsible for them. But there’s no evidence that the Chinese government ever wanted or got the spoils of that snoopery. Also TikTok detractors claim that the algorithm is a “black box,” but so is every social media platform’s feed. And TikTok’s seems more obvious than most: Linger on something longer, you see more of it, skip it and you see less. This is how I wound up with a feed that is mostly men styling their hair into pompadours, and rare Duran Duran performances. Anyway, Trump ran to the Supreme Court and filed a law-free brief about how he alone can save TikTok, and the Supremes are still mulling it over. Also Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey has introduced a bill, “Extend the TikTok Deadline Act,” which would give ByteDance another 270 days to sell the app, and now even Rand Paul is against its shutdown. The ban doesn’t need to be slowed down, it needs to be stopped, because banning shit is not who we are, and all of this sits on a throne of fibs! Meanwhile, the number one download in the Apple Store is Xiaohongshu (Red Note), which is literally the Chinese TikTok. The icon looks like this. And after about 12 hours of trying, I got my number verified on there! And it is delightful, in its own kind way. It’s sort of like being in actual China, but without having to sit on a plane for 12 hours or risk getting giardia from an ice cube. Much of it’s in Chinese, but there’s just enough English so you can get by. The Hongshu-ers seem puzzled by the influx, but friendly, reaching out to TikTok refugees with greetings and content everybody enjoys, such as cat pictures, stir-fry recipes, and Luigi Mangione rendered in cappuccino foam. What a turn of events, a ban meant to drive Americans and Chinese people apart bringing them closer together than ever. Will SCOTUS decide to halt the ban? Will Chinese TikTok take off? We shall see! If the ban passes the app will still exist on your phone, there just won’t be any software updates, and at some point it will break or become obsolete. Until then, get in those cucumber recipes and floss dances and pompadour tips while you still can. [Bloomberg archive link/ CNN/ Forbes archive link/ Oxford Economics ] Follow me on Bluesky! Share Donate one time! I know they're calling it Red Note, but 小红书 is literally "Little Red Book." Mao's last joke from the grave? "with servers (where the algorithm happens) in Virginia" that's AWS us-east-1. They have servers there, sure. You cannot fucking tell me they're not multi region though. TikTok is AWS-based. "User data is not stored in China." Bull fucking shit. https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/about-aws/china/ I will bet you a gentleperson's bet of $1 to wonkette that they are replicating to the AWS China regions, at least one of them.

Title: Jim Cramer on Tapestry, Inc. (TPR) ‘Clearly Didn’t Get Sidetracked’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discussed These 21 Stocks As Bond Yields Soared. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. In a recent episode of CNBC's Squawk On The Street, Jim Cramer started out by commenting on quantum computing stocks. These stocks rose to new highs after the announcement of the Willow quantum computing chip by one of the biggest technology companies in the world. He mentioned a quote by AI CEO Jensen Huang about quantum computing. According to Cramer, "The quote previous to that was really enlightening too. I mean just as this. And this [quantum computing] only works for small form factor. And it's used microwave. The large form factor, which by the way is, automatic driving and robots, it doesn't work. So not only is it later, but it's not useful. And, he also said that we work with a CPU, not GPU. That would be like that Intel engine and it's much too slow." Cramer continued to blast quantum computing stocks. According to him, the "QTUM ETF that has almost no quantum computing, it's been bid up. I mean they really are David, I mean, I'm not saying they are necessarily fraudulent. Because Willow, which is a project of Google, is pretty good. And Amazon was working on a program to help quantum developers." Likening the quantum computing stocks to an illusory phenomenon, he commented "But frankly, I'm going to use the word chimerical, in the sense that these companies, none of these companies, have much in terms of revenue. . . .But they're all losing a lot of money, and it was the type of thing you see at the beginning of the year, we're also seeing it in nuclear, another area that's chimerical. And I think that it has to be watched out before we can go higher." As a result, Cramer shared "I think that people should sell those stocks and lock in their gains." Quantum computing isn't the only sector on his radar though. Another sector in Cramer's crosshairs was nuclear power. He believes that firms can't build nuclear power plants "fast enough, and they're very expensive and the overruns are ridiculous. So we have to clear out the nuke and we have to clear out this ridiculous stuff when it comes to quantum." Since treasury yields were rising during the start of the day, they didn't miss Cramer's attention either. He shared the trend of the rising yields and started with the futures. The futures were up during Frank Holland's show. Which is the five o'clock show," he stated. Cramer added "Okay so, then we had the rates right where they are. And then somehow, between four thirty and six, the rates skyrocketed! And then after the ADP they went lower." He believes that excessive attention on the yields is equivalent to being "worse than the analysts that are telling you to sell" the world's leading GPU designer. Another player that has shaped the market for two years now is the Federal Reserve. The Fed caused quite a bit of turmoil in mid-December after its paring back of expected 2025 interest rate cuts to two from four hit stocks hard. Now, with the labor market being as strong as ever, investors are wary of getting even one rate cut in the first half of 2025. Cramer commented on the Fed's Christopher Waller and shared that "He ought to take a vacation. Why do these guys have to talk every minute? I mean what good are they doing to the chairman? The chairman ought to say, hey guys, go speak at the Rotary Club and address what I think is the biggest problem of youth." The CNBC host also mentioned the ongoing and devastating wildfires in California. Cramer stressed that these are not ordinary wildfires. Recalling his days as a news reporter he shared: "When I covered homicides and fires when I was a reporter in LA, I was living in my car so I was kind of uniquely able to cover any fire very quickly. And I was on one side of the interstate five where it's just north of I-10. And it was five lanes, five lanes at the time and I was on the side that was away from Beverly Hills. And the chief at the time said to me, don't worry we're safe here. Because it's never jumped I-5. And then I saw like Santa Anna winds, it jumped I-5, ten lanes at the time, just jumped it. And I looked at him, and I said what do we do? And he said, it's every man for himself. And we tore. . . .I mean it really, it's so frightening. Because it can leap. People think it's static. And when it comes, it explodes, where it's crackling. It does not light up and burn. It explodes! So that's what we're dealing with." He added "I just want people to know that this is not a fire where there's coming down. This is a fire where you don't know where it's gonna go. And it can go a hundred yards." As for the bond yields, Cramer hinted that they might drop in the future. According to him "A lot of the people that I deal with in the bond market are kind of salivating over the idea that maybe we do get a 5% on a ten year. It's interesting to hear the perspective of people who cash but who don't own anything. There is money out there waiting for that level. So if people think that it's just, there's just going to be an overshoot be aware that there will be some real demand." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired last Wednesday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of diverse group of people wearing the company's small leather goods. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 38 Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) is a luxury apparel company that has managed to hedge against the storm that's hit its peers. The firm's stock endured in 2024 and ended the year with more than 79% in gains. Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) has endured because the firm's customer base of wealthy individuals is insulated against the broader dip in spending power that has harmed consumers in the US and abroad. Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) beat analyst estimates for its fiscal fourth quarter results, and Cramer commented on Barclays upgrading the stock to Overweight: "And by the way, Tapestry clearly didn't get sidetracked. Well, doing quite well. I don't know. Some of these consumer names are making a little bit of a comeback. Overall TPR ranks 16th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of TPR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TPR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) is an important player in the SaaS-based payroll processing services provider market. Since its performance is dependent to a large extent on small and medium business performance, the shares perform well when investors perceive an easing of monetary policy. As a result, the fact that Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)'s shares are flat year-to-date is unsurprising. In fact, had the firm not announced a deal to expand its operations by acquiring Paycor, the stock might have suffered more. Cramer commented on Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) CEO's astute observation of the US economy: "I had John Gibson on recently. He's the CEO of Paychex. And this is the largest payroll processor for small to medium sized businesses. Here's what the Fed did wrong. They didn't, he just got, a Fed advisor, John. The small business outlook post the election was astonishing. And the amount of hiring post the election was incredible. But that was not in any of the models. What J Powell [inaudible] sit around and say, listen if Trump wins we gotta stop, stop cutting? But that was the key fulcrum. What small business, the backbone of the US economy I may add, and we got that wrong. Everyone got it wrong except for Gibson because he was looking at the Paychex stubs. And he saw the hiring explosion." Overall PAYX ranks 18th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about.

Ogunlesi is a founding partner of Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure investing firm that was acquired by BlackRock last year for $12 billion. Before helping to start GIP in 2006, Ogunlesi spent 23 years at Credit Suisse. "The rapid advancement and development of AI offers a unique opportunity to build a better future," Ogunlesi said in OpenAI's announcement Tuesday. "As part of this, thoughtful strategies and investment in infrastructure will be key to unlocking AI's full potential and delivering its benefits responsibly. I'm excited to contribute to this effort and look forward to being a part of the OpenAI Board." For OpenAI, the addition of Ogunlesi to its board marks another step in its dramatic transformation to a for-profit company. The board has been almost entirely revamped since late 2023, when CEO Sam Altman was abruptly ousted before being quickly reinstated. Former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, who was chairman at Twitter before its purchase by Elon Musk, became chair of OpenAI after the Altman ordeal in November 2023. Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, joined at the same time. Last year, the board added several new faces including Instacart CEO Fidji Simo and Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, now known as the Gates Foundation. OpenAI, which was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, said in late December that it will create a public benefit corporation to oversee commercial operations, removing some of its nonprofit restrictions and allowing it to function more like a high-growth startup. Last year, OpenAI was valued at $157 billion as it continued rolling out updated large language models and new tools after kicking off the generative artificial intelligence boom in late 2022. The company said that by transforming into a Delaware PBC "with ordinary shares of stock," it can pursue commercial operations while separately hiring a staff for its nonprofit arm and allowing that wing to take on charitable activities in health care, education and science, OpenAI said in December. Musk, one of OpenAI's co-founders is suing to try and stop OpenAI from converting into a full for-profit business. Ogunlesi's other board positions include BlackRock, Topgolf Callaway Brands, Kosmos Energy Holdings and Terminal Investment Ltd. — CNBC's Hayden Field contributed to this report.

Title: BlackRock details 3 developments that could flip them into risk-off mode
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-inflation-interest-rates-investing-strategy-bond-yields-blackrock-2025-1

BlackRock is still embracing risk, but it says there are a handful of developments that could push the firm into risk-off mode, according to a note strategists put out on Monday. "We think US equity gains could roll on. Yet an economic transformation and global policy shifts could push markets and economies into a new scenario," strategists wrote. "We look through near-term noise but outline triggers for adjusting our views, by either dialing down risk or shifting our preferences." Investors are becoming more aware of market risks as equities continue their rocky start to the year, with the S&P 500 down 1% from levels at the start of January. Talk of a stock correction is also on the rise, with some Wall Street forecasters calling for as much as a 16% drawdown in US equity prices. Here are three things BlackRock says could cause the firm to shift to a more risk-off stance: Trump's presidency was widely thought to be positive for risk-assets, with investors eyeing looser regulation and the potential for higher growth in 2025 after he secured his election win in November. But Trump also has the potential to adopt a "less market-friendly approach" to policy, BlackRock said, which would involve the president-elect following through with promises to slash taxes and levy steep tariffs on US imports. Those policies could raise inflation, deepen the US's debt balance, and influence interest rates to stay higher for longer — all potential headwinds to risk assets. "This plan would clash with Trump's calls for a weaker dollar to boost US manufacturing and his push for rate cuts. We look through noisy headlines are policy and focus on how policy changes take shape this year," strategists added. Investors feeling more dour on the outlook for stocks has the potential to weigh on the market. Traders may be keen to dial back risk due to weak corporate earnings, or high valuations in the tech sector, BlackRock said. "While earnings might surprise to the upside, any misses could renew investor concern over whether big AI capital spending will pay off and if high valuations are justified — even if we think valuations can't be viewed through a historic lens as an economic transformation unfolds," strategists added. Sentiment has already started to lean more pessimistic in recent weeks. 37% of investors said they were bearish on stocks over the next six months, according to the AAII's latest Investor Sentiment Survey, up from the historical average of 31%. Continued signs of "elevated vulnerabilities" in financial markets are another trigger that could push BlackRock away from its risk trade, strategists said. The firm pointed to the recent sell-off in US bonds, which has been fueled by concern that Trump's policies could stoke inflation, which could cause interest rates to remain higher for longer. Bond yields are likely to climb higher from current levels as investors demand more for the risk of holding onto debt securities, strategists added. "The refinancing of corporate debt at higher interest rates is another risk. It could challenge the business models of companies that assumed interest rates would remain low," the note said.

Title: Why Is Extra Space Storage Inc. (EXR) Among the Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks To Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) stands against the other real estate stocks. As the US housing market headed into 2025, it witnessed good as well as bad news. Although the supply has increased with active listings in November 12.1% higher over the year, Redfin revealed that the majority of those homes had been on the market for at least 60 days without going under a sales contract, marking the highest share for any November since the year 2019. While mortgage rates have averaged over 6% for the past 24 months, home buyers are not expecting mortgage rates to decline substantially. As the year ended, a rise in mortgage interest rates toward the end of December ended up impacting the mortgage demand. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s seasonally adjusted index, total mortgage application volume for the two weeks ended December 27 declined 21.9% as compared with the week before that period. Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, reiterated the bitter impact of the mortgage rates moving higher through the last week of 2024 as he said: “Not surprisingly, this increase in rates — at a time when housing activity typically grinds to a halt — resulted in declines in both refinance and purchase applications.” Bess Freedman, Brown Harris Stevens CEO, pointed towards a troubling trifactor encompassing rates, inventory, and prices for this year. She expects the new year to be turbulent and volatile for the real estate although the public does have certainty with the president now which is good. Bess also talked about the US demographics and how first-time home buyers are older than ever, nearing 40s which is a bad sign indicating young people not being able to afford. While the situation around Trump’s tariffs and rates potentially going up remains unclear as of yet, homeownership continues to be an American dream in her opinion. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 12 best real estate and realty stocks to buy now, we first use a stock screener to make an extended list of the relevant companies with the highest market caps. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 12 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 12 best real estate and realty stocks to buy now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An aerial view of a self-storage facility, its parking lot full with cars and RV's. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28 Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) is a fully integrated, self-administered, and self-managed real estate investment trust headquartered in Salt Lake City. The company owned and/or operated 3,862 self-storage stores in 42 states and Washington, D.C., as of September 30, 2024. Customers can select from a variety of conveniently located and secure storage units across the US including boat storage, RV storage, and business storage. Extra Space Storage Inc. (NYSE:EXR) has the privilege of being the largest operator of self-storage properties in the United States. The company focuses on storage which is a need-based, recession-resilient asset class with rising utilization, awareness, length of customer stay, and demand drivers in positive and negative economic environments. The shareholder returns potential remains strong with storage having the highest cumulative total return of any real estate sector since 1999. The REIT is well positioned in a highly fragmented sector with a solid balance sheet, strong operational efficiency, robust occupancy gains, massive scale, and disciplined growth through accretive acquisitions and strong partnerships. Jefferies analyst Jonathan Petersen recently maintained its Buy rating on the stock as the firm remains cautiously positive on the self-storage sector into 2025. While investors were advised not to rush buying EXR shares ahead of the upcoming quarter with the initial outlooks expected to be conservative, a housing market recovery in 2025 would potentially lead to increased demand for self-storage and drive upward adjustments to guidance and estimates. Overall EXR ranks 12th on our list of the best real estate and realty stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of EXR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than EXR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: JPMorgan predicts Solana, XRP ETFs could draw up to $14 billion in first 12 months if approved

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article JPMorgan forecast that Solana and XRP ETFs could generate approximately $14 billion in investments during their first 12 months, despite earlier doubts about SEC approval. The projection, shared by VanEck’s head of digital assets research Matthew Sigel, is based on market penetration rates similar to existing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which currently represent 3-6% of their respective tokens’ market capitalizations. Based on Solana’s current market cap of $90.5 billion, ETF assets could reach $5.2 billion at 6% penetration or $2.7 billion at 3% penetration, JPMorgan notes. For XRP, with a market cap of $146.5 billion, potential ETF assets could reach $8.4 billion at 6% penetration or $4.3 billion at 3% penetration. Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, managing director at JPMorgan, previously expressed skepticism about near-term approvals for ETFs that give exposure to other crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. “We don’t think the SEC would go even further by approving Solana or other token ETFs given the SEC has stronger (relative to Ethereum) opinion that tokens outside Bitcoin and Ethereum should be classified as securities,” he told The Block. Following the debut of US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC approved eight spot Ethereum ETFs from major asset managers like Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity last May. At one point, the outlook for ETFs linked to other crypto assets, such as Solana and XRP, was bleak, largely because SEC Chair Gary Gensler maintained that many altcoins qualify as securities. Gensler still holds this view, but the overall outlook has become more favorable. With Gensler set to depart next week as President-elect Donald Trump takes office, the SEC will welcome a new chairman, Paul Atkins, who is viewed as more supportive of crypto and innovation. This change in leadership, once confirmed by the Senate, could open the door to a more favorable regulatory environment. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, forecasts that 2025 will be a landmark year for crypto ETFs. The analyst predicts the launch of at least 50 new products, including those linked to Solana.

Title: Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE): Secures $1B AI Server Deal with Elon Musk’s X Social Network

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Trending AI News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) stands against the other trending AI stocks. AI continues to be a transformative force, which is driving advancements across industries through improved infrastructure, data analytics, and automation. Its adoption is reshaping almost every sector in the market, including manufacturing, cloud computing, and robotics. Even though some challenges can be in scaling applications and managing demand, the long-term potential for AI to revolutionize industries and create new growth opportunities seems undeniable. In a Bloomberg interview, Lei Qiu, CIO for Thematic Innovation Equities at AllianceBernstein, discussed her team’s approach to identifying major long-term trends that drive equity growth beyond economic cycles. The firm focuses on significant themes, such as AI, which dominated 2023 and 2024. In addition to enabling AI infrastructure, they are closely monitoring the adoption of AI applications, including advancements in data analytics, cloud migration, networking, and communication equipment, which are significant for connecting smaller, more power-efficient data centers. Qiu highlighted how automation and AI are already improving efficiency in industries like manufacturing, where companies are realizing substantial cost savings. She also mentioned the potential for related areas such as robotics, autonomous systems, and the Internet of Things to grow in 2025. On the topic of M&A, Qiu acknowledged its potential resurgence, supported by favorable regulatory environments and strong company balance sheets. However, as an investor, she mentioned the challenge of predicting specific transactions. She also stressed the importance of stock selection and noted that not all ideas succeed without the right management, product, and execution. Regarding macroeconomic influences, Qiu explained that while dramatic shifts, such as the sharp rate hikes in 2022, can impact long-duration assets, her team prioritizes fundamentals and long-term trends over short-term market timing. She concluded that secular growth themes remain central to the firm’s investment strategy. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A woman programmer in a modern office working with multiple computer servers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 64 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (NYSE:HPE) provides global data-driven solutions, including AI-powered HPC systems, intelligent edge products, cloud-based networking, and analytics services across various industries. Bloomberg reported that Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) secured a deal worth over $1 billion to supply Elon Musk's X social network with AI-optimized servers. The agreement, finalized late last year, saw competition from Dell Technologies and Super Micro. HPE's growth in AI servers has been strong, yet it lagged behind competitors. HPE’s success in landing the deal may be linked to its liquid-cooling technology. The agreement helped boost HPE’s stock, but larger deals could pressure margins, the report states. Overall HPE ranks 7th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of HPE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HPE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

This image sums up the state of the world in recent days. Of course you have to know how to read it. The remorseless cat is the global system: the multinational banks like Bank of America, multinational asset management firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, multinational corporations. and the strategy teams of a handful of billionaire families. They have their fangs in everything, even the nations that some naively think are still independent, believe still offer an alternative. The motionless mother monkey is the nation state, the unit of governance and cultural identity that we have been inculcated to take as our standard for judging everything. The nation state is still lying there as a colossal corpse and we still desperately cling to it. In fact, almost all the alternative and conspiracy news sources can only describe problems in terms of nation states. It is the unit for the United Nations, for the New York Times, and for both Iran and China as well. But these days the nation state is meant for the little people. If you are a billionaire, it means almost nothing. The clinging baby monkey is the citizen, of whatever and whichever country, who helplessly embraces the nation state who has been immobilized and completely taken over by the ruthless multinational entity. That takeover has been accomplished not through political parties—those are for show—but through the outsourcing of information and administration from government to multinational IT firms. What is striking today for me watching recent morally bankrupt broadcasts is how the fake conservatives promoted in the media consistently blame the bureaucrats and the bad apples for what is going wrong and suggest that heroic innovators like Elon Musk are an alternative. These same groups also try to reduce China to the “yellow peril,” an alien civilization that is plotting to take over the world. The fact that most Chinese are themselves the victims of the same ruthless corporations and banks that use the supercomputers of Amazon and Oracle to calculate how to outsmart, and squeeze to death all workers of the world is hidden on purpose because these conservatives battling the deep state are but puppets of the same forces. Of course there are Chinese billionaires (and Iranian and Russian billionaires) in on this project. Much as was done with the Chinese and the Jews in the 19th century, the “Jewish peril” and “yellow peril” are back again to confuse the people and lead them to the wrong enemy so that they cannot figure out that the real enemy is not hiding in a cave in Afghanistan, is not eating with chopsticks in Beijing or Pyongyang, but is right there, in plain view, under the flag of Coca Cola, Walt Disney, or Unilever. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Investor Earning $110,000 in Dividends Reveals His 9 Stocks with Over 10% Yields

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Dividend stocks are back in focus as investors brace to face new uncertainties in 2025. JPMorgan said in its investment outlook report for 2025 that the market could face new risks if tariffs, fiscal stimulus measures and immigration-related policies under the upcoming administration lead to higher inflation. Which dividend stocks can help you achieve a stable and reliable income this year? Let's take a look at a case study for ideas. A few months ago, a dividend investor shared his income report and portfolio on r/Dividends, a community of income investors on Reddit with over 650,000 members. The investor said he was making $110,000 a year on his portfolio worth about $1.2 million. About half of the portfolio was allocated to money market funds and fixed income. Don't Miss: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. Unlock the hidden potential of commercial real estate — This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today! "Plan is to move the fixed income into dividend equities as the rates go down so the income keeps up or increases," he said. When asked how long it took him to reach the $1.2 million figure, the investor said he'd been working for the last 20 years while his wife had been employed for 15 years. "We both have 401ks apart from this after-tax account which we plan to leave alone for a while." Let's take a look at some of the highest-yielding stocks in this portfolio. BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust Dividend Yield: 10.15% The BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust primarily invests in fixed-income securities. It generates interest income on debt instruments such as bonds, loans and similar debt-related investments. Its distribution rate is about 10.15%. AGNC Investment Corp Dividend Yield: 14% AGNC Investment Corp (AGNC) was one of the top stocks in the investor’s portfolio, earning $110,000 per year in dividends.

Title: Biden signs executive order to accelerate AI infrastructure build-out in the US

Time Published: 2025-01-14T14:06:56Z

President Joe Biden has signed an executive order to accelerate the scale-up of AI infrastructure in the US to meet the massive energy and supply needs of the "cutting-edge" technology. Biden said on Tuesday that the executive order will direct the departments of Defense and Energy to lease federal sites to the private sector for building "frontier AI infrastructure at speed and scale." According to the White House, private sector access to federal sites for building "gigawatt-scale AI data centers" will be determined by "competitive solicitations" for proposals. Private companies leasing the land would be required to cover the cost of building and operating the sites, including the build-out of clean energy sources for powering data centers. Biden, who is serving his final days in office, said the US cannot take its lead in AI for granted. The technology is set to have "profound implications for national security and enormous potential to improve Americans' lives if harnessed responsibly," Biden said. "That is why today, I am signing an historic Executive Order to accelerate the speed at which we build the next generation of AI infrastructure here in America, in a way that enhances economic competitiveness, national security, AI safety, and clean energy," Biden said. The move from Biden comes at a critical time for the AI sector. Industry leaders say progress for leading AI companies — which have invested billions of dollars in the technology — depends on an extraordinary build-out of infrastructure. Expensive data centers and clean energy supplies are needed to train, host, and run new models sustainably, while chip plants that supply vital computing power are being demanded closer to home after years of reliance on chipmaking facilities overseen in the East by the likes of Taiwan's TSMC. In September, OpenAI boss Sam Altman wrote in a blog that "if we don't build enough infrastructure, AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over, and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people." Biden addressed the need for the US to become self-sufficient, noting in his statement that "we will not let America be out-built when it comes to the technology that will define our future." The executive order will likely be a boost for private sector companies that have shown increasing interest in AI infrastructure development over the past few years. In September, Microsoft and BlackRock announced the creation of a $30 billion megafund designed to drive "significant infrastructure investment" and "enhance American competitiveness in AI." The fund's total investment potential is $100 billion, they said. SoftBank boss Masayoshi Son, whose company is betting big on AI, also committed in December to investing $100 billion in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years after meeting President-elect Donald Trump.

Tuesday, 14 Jan 2025 KUALA LUMPUR: Former chief executive officer of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), Arul Kanda Kandasamy told the High Court here on Tuesday (Jan 14) that he had no personal knowledge that monies from the company’s funds were used to buy jewellery worth US$1.3mil for Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor. Arul Kanda said this when 1MDB’s counsel Raphael Kok Chi Ren referred to him the United States Department of Justice (DOJ)’s complaint in June 2017 during the trial of 1MDB’s US$6.59bil lawsuit against him and former chairman of the board Tan Sri Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah. Kok: Based on the DOJ’s complaint, monies from Blackrock Commodities (Global) Limited were used to purchase jewellery for Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak’s wife Datin Seri Rosmah. Arul Kanda: That is stated in the DOJ complaint. I don't have personal knowledge. According to the DOJ’s complaint, the monies were used to purchase 27 assorted gold necklaces and bracelets worth US$1.3mil. Arul Kanda, who is the first defendant, told the court that the money was used to purchase a luxury yacht and real estate, one of which was registered under Kassem Dean, the husband of singer Alicia Keys. Asked by Kok whether the witnesses had knowledge that fugitive financier Low Taek Jho or Jho Low and his associates Eric Tan were beneficial owners of monies over US$200mil deposited in bank accounts, Arul Kanda said, "I agree as stated in the document in the DOC’s complaint". In May 2021, 1MDB filed a lawsuit against the two individuals, accusing them of breach of trust and conspiracy, which led to losses of US$1.83bil, linked to the company’s investment in 1MDB-Petrosaudi Ltd, which was subsequently converted into the Brazen Sky Limited investment, purportedly recoverable from the Bridge Global Fund. 1MDB also alleged that both defendants committed breach of trust and conspiracy by misappropriating US$3.5bil in company funds paid to Aabar Investments and US$1.265bil paid to International Petroleum Investment Company on May 9, 2017. 1MDB further alleged that Mohd Irwan conspired with Arul Kanda to extend his employment agreement, resulting in a payment of RM2,905,200 to Arul Kanda, all while disregarding the company’s interests, which ultimately led to financial losses and damages. Consequently, 1MDB is seeking US$6.59bil in damages from both defendants and an additional RM2.9mil from Mohd Irwan related to the extension of the employment agreement. The hearing before Judge Datuk Raja Ahmad Mohzanuddin Shah Raja Mohzan continues on Wednesday (Jan 15). – Bernama Related stories: 1MDB’s US$700mil could have been recovered from Jho Low, says Arul KandaTwo former board members to remain as third parties in 1MDB lawsuitRosmah freed of 17 chargesRosmah still faces multiple court cases Two former board members to remain as third parties in 1MDB lawsuitRosmah freed of 17 chargesRosmah still faces multiple court cases Rosmah freed of 17 chargesRosmah still faces multiple court cases Rosmah still faces multiple court cases Tags / Keywords: Court , Arul Kanda , 1MDB , Rosmah , jewellery Report it to us.

Title: Even in Switzerland’s Direct Democracy, There Is Little Room for Public Choice on Digital Identity
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/01/even-in-switzerland-there-is-no-public-choice-on-digital-identity.html
Time Published: 2025-01-14T11:45:55Z
Full Content:
After two-thirds of Swiss voters rejected the government’s proposed e-ID system in 2021, a slightly revamped “Digital Passport Act (E-ID Act)” is back on the political agenda. In March 2021, Switzerland was the scene of a rare exercise in popular democracy, and one that is unlikely to be repeated in other “liberal” democracies. A public referendum was held on the government’s plans to roll out a digital identity program, which would have allowed it to control and license an identity data verification system essentially run by private companies. But in January 2021, Swiss civil society groups lobbied against the proposed law and collected enough signatures to force a referendum. Almost two-thirds (64.4%) of voters rejected the proposed e-ID program, which should have been enough to put paid to the government’s plans. At the time, Swiss Info described the result as a “blow” for the government “amid fears about data protection.” A previous attempt to set up a public-private e-identity solution, known as SuisseID, had failed more than ten years earlier. But instead of accepting defeat, the Swiss government went back to the drawing board, and got creative. After the vote, Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter urged parliament and critics of the e-ID measure to rethink their approach in order to avoid a potential drag on Switzerland’s digitization efforts. “We have no choice and must work towards a new solution, even if it takes several attempts. It is key for Switzerland to catch up with other countries when it comes to digitalisation.” There are few better examples of TINA (Margaret Thatcher’s “There is No Alternative”) in operation today than digital identity, and the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to which they are inexorably tied. It seems that more or less every country on the planet, from the most advanced economies to the most impoverished, from democracies to theocracies, is either in the process of creating such a system or has already done so, often with the assistance of the World Bank and/or the UN Development Program, and their partner companies and NGOs. “A Legal Identity for All” Even if two-thirds of a country’s voters reject it in a referendum, the plan must proceed. There is an obvious reason for this: one of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG #16.9) is to provide “a legal identity for all” by 2030. And that identity will ideally be of a digital nature — not just for the hundreds of millions who currently do not have legal identity, but for everyone on the planet. The SDGs were adopted by the UN in 2015 as a “universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity” — all laudable goals that show little sign of materialising in five years’ time. In fact, for the past two years, the Doomsday clock has been set at 90 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been to midnight — a reflection of the unprecedented dangers the world faces from nuclear war, environmental disaster and other threats. One area in which governments have overdelivered in recent years is digital identity. In 2016, a little-known private-public consortium called ID2020 was established to help promote (emphasis my own) “privacy-protecting approaches to digital identity”, with seed money from Microsoft, Accenture, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Rockefeller Foundation, Cisco and Gavi, the largely Gates Foundation-funded vaccine alliance. Other participants include Barclays, BlackRock, Bloomberg, BYN Mellon, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, Facebook, Google, IBM, JP Morgan Chase, Mastercard and Infosys, the Indian company that helped design Aadhaar, the world’s largest digital ID system. At the same time, the World Bank has been driving global efforts to build an inclusive and trusted digital ID framework across the Global South through its Identification for Development (ID4D) initiative, which the NYU School of Law’s Center for Human Rights and Global Justice (CHRGJ) has warned risks “paving a digital road to hell”: Through the embrace of digital technologies, the World Bank and a broader global network of actors has been promoting a new paradigm for ID systems that prioritizes what we refer to as ‘economic identity.’ These systems focus on fueling digital transactions and transforming individuals into traceable data. They often ignore the ability of identification systems to recognize not only that an individual is unique, but that they have a legal status with associated rights. One of the main reasons why there is (seemingly) no alternative to digital identity is that there are simply too many powerful interests aligned behind it. It is the keystone of the new panopticon of digital public infrastructure (DPI) being constructed around us. For governments and national security agencies, the benefits are clear: expanded power and control at a time when economic conditions are about to get significantly worse for the vast majority of the population. For big tech companies, it will mean new opportunities to amass even more data over our lives, which they will then be able to transform into even more revenues and profits. For central banks and the TBTF banks whose interests they predominantly serve, it will mean even more financial power. A New System “Taking Shape” In November of 2023, the Swiss government unveiled plans for a new digital ID system. This time it would be the federal government, not private sector partners, who would be responsible for issuing the e-ID and offering the infrastructure necessary for its operation. By September of last year, both of Switzerland’s legislative houses had approved the legal basis for a slightly revamped system. As Netzwoche reported in December, the federal government’s latest digital ID scheme “is taking shape”, despite public opposition (machine translated): On 6 December 2024, the Federal Council adopted the principles for the technical implementation, which is to take place in two phases. The goal is to provide the e-ID by 2026 (NC: coincidentally, the same year that all EU Member States are supposed to provide digital identity platforms to all of their citizens). The e-ID is intended to enable citizens to provide digital proof of identity securely and in compliance with data protection regulations. At the same time, the federal government’s electronic wallet, in which the e-ID and other digital evidence can be stored, has been given a name: “Swiyu”. The artificial word is made up of the elements “SWI” for Switzerland, “I” for I, identity and innovation, and “YU” for you (you) and unity (unity), according to a statement from the federal government. This time, the system will be largely state-run. Supporters of the initiative claim the right lessons have been learnt from the 2021 failure. A Swiss government commission has recommended that e-ID data be kept exclusively in a government digital wallet. However, private-sector wallet makers will be able to store and present electronic IDs in the future so long as they comply with council regulations. In other words, private sector participation will still be critical, especially when it comes to building the infrastructure. It is hoped that these steps will help assuage citizens’ concerns about data security. But not everyone is convinced. Last Thursday, the Mass-Voll group, an organisation that emerged during the protests against the government’s COVID-19 measures, has already begun collecting signatures for a new referendum. The group argues that the Swiss people have already put a stop to this, having already rejected e-ID in 2021 with a 64% no vote. “In total disregard of the will of the people, Parliament still wants to introduce the e-ID. This is unacceptable,” said Mass-Voll. The group began gathering signatures last Thursday, and has until April 19 to collect the requisite 50,000 signatures to trigger a nationwide referendum. One of the group’s main arguments against the latest e-ID proposal is the danger it poses to personal data security (machine translated): The Swiss Digital Passport Act (E-ID Act) promotes the misuse of sensitive personal data: it does not provide sufficient protection against the increasing number of cyberattacks. And it exposes citizens’ data to private companies, which analyse it with the help of AI and make a profit from it. In doing so, the law undermines people’s privacy and endangers their democratic freedoms. One of the ironies of the Swiss government’s latest attempt to launch a digital ID system is that in its previous attempt it argued that the public sector does not have the necessary technical expertise to launch and maintain a functional, efficient digital ID system, which is why it proposed outsourcing the lion’s share of the project to private-sector players. But this was also one of the reasons why the original project faced so much public opposition — the fear that private corporations cannot be trusted with so much sensitive personal data. Data security, or lack thereof, is one of the most important risks posed by digital identity systems. India, which is home to the world’s largest biometric-based digital ID system, Aadhaar, has suffered huge security problems, from identity theft to innumerable data breaches, including two in which the data of roughly a billion people were compromised. “Aadhaar, one of the world’s single largest caches of data about citizenship details, leaks like a sieve,” thundered a 2023 editorial in the New Indian Express. Much of the compromised data, including, in some cases, people’s biometric identifiers (i.e. their iris and fingerprint scans), ends up for sale on the dark net. If this data is hacked, there is no way of undoing the damage. You cannot change or cancel your iris or fingerprint like you can change a password or cancel a credit card. These security issues are not unique to India. In fact, at the end of last year, InfoCert, one of the leading Italian companies providing digital identity services, suffered a cyberattack that resulted in the theft of personal data belonging to over 5 million digital identity holders. The stolen information included full names, tax codes, phone numbers and email addresses and data relating to communications with customer support, all of which is now put up for sale on the dark web. Infocert claimed the leak was the result of a systems breach of a third-party supplier, to which customers were registered, and that “illicit activity” had been committed against this supplier. The company was at pains to stress that neither its own systems nor its service access credentials or passwords had been compromised. However, if governments cannot guarantee the integrity and security of the data held on the digital identity systems they and their armies of private sector partners are building, why are they creating more and more silos of sensitive, and often inadequately protected, personal data? Lack of security is just one of the many issues thrown up by digital identity systems. Others include the threat they pose to privacy and anonymity, especially online; their inherently exclusionary nature (in India, for example, millions of people are unable to access the most basic of services, including welfare programs, either because they do not have the 12-digit UDI number or due to biometric authentication errors); their unprecedented potential as tools of government surveillance and control; and the fact that without them, central bank digit currencies would almost certainly not be possible. The campaigners that have called for a referendum on the Swiss Digital Passport Act (E-ID Act) warn that the proposed system “would promote the misuse of sensitive personal data” while failing to provide “sufficient protection against the increasing number of cyberattacks”. It would also expose citizens’ data to profiteering private companies, “which mine it with the help of AI.” Ultimately, it would “undermine people’s privacy and endanger their democratic freedoms.” It remains to be seen whether the campaigners will be able to gather enough signatures this time round (my guess is they will), and if so, whether or not the newly proposed system will also be voted down — and if that happens, what the government will do in response. But as the German financial journalist Norbert Häring notes, the Swiss government’s determination to launch digital identity in the face of overwhelming public opposition makes one thing crystal clear: “this is not about citizens’ interests.” These f’ers have to destroy the concept of representative government for people including the non-wealthy. 90% to 100% of the people could have voted down this dystopian, rentier trash policy and the cretins would still be trying to get it passed. You see this same dynamic at the local level, too. There have been a few issues in my area in recent years where voters or the city council will vote something down, only to see those who stand to gain bring it back in slightly different form, or to a new council that is unaware of what happened previously. They just keep at it until they get what they want, the public be damned. If all politics is local, then we are in very bad shape. It would be nice to be rid of the oligarchs peacefully, but other than the New Deal, I’m hard pressed to think of a time when that actually happened. I think the concept of “representative democracy” might be flawed from the very beginning, as it seems that the fear of being voted out of office is not enough of a deterrent in order to force said elected representatives to do what their constituents want. I think it is because the oligarchs also have these countries’ law enforcement and military forces at their disposal who would make short work of any degree of unrest. Sadly, on both the international as well as national level, most agreements or documents do not seem to be worth the paper that they are printed on unless the arbiter has the capability of providing the necessary degree of explicit power to force the agreeing parties to stick to their terms. Definitely – it reminds me of when Paul Allen in Seattle tried to get funding for his stadium using public money (which he eventually did accomplish even though voters were against it). I remember going into a store for something and the woman behind the counter was angry about it. The idea that citizens have much control over what happens is increasingly quaint. To clarify, the referendum was voted down, but the money was given anyway after the fact by the WA state legislature. Was in Switzerland several times for extended stays and I found the people to be very conservative and not ones for radical experimentation. In a referendum they actually turned down working less hours. This set-up was reflected in the structure of their government where the Cantons had considerable power with the remainder given to the Federal government. Referendums enabled a people’s veto on unpopular measures. Now? The people may still be conservative but the government sounds like that it has been taken over by WEF types. The Swiss were organizing a referendum to not buy the F-35 fighter so the government signed all the contracts before it could go ahead. It is just as well that the Swiss are not already in the EU as when they rejected the SuisseID, the government might have cancelled that vote on the grounds of Russian influence via Chinese Tik Tok videos. Instead they are going to make the people vote a second time like the EU did with Ireland. The Swiss people are going to be in for a helluva fight as the Swiss government wants that country to join NATO because it is so powerful, join the EU as everybody wants to join a winning organization and put the people under the thumb of a digital ID that everybody knows will be hacked sooner or later. I have not been to Switzerland for many years so do not know if the character of the people has changed but guess that time will tell. Last time I was there, they had a large Ukrainian flag on Buerkliplatz. They’ve changed…. Wonder how those structural changes happened. If change really occured. Sometimes I am not that sure anything did change. Russophobia was always deeply entrenched there, as was a certain level of radical leftism which for the same reasons as in the EU however has lost its intellectual savvyness of the 60s-80s (Zurich´s left e.g.) and was instead NGOed.. Could it have to do with the loss of Switzerland’s position as a unique spot for treasuring riches? As was described here repeatedly. I am a deep believer of the complexities of such systems where unrelated areas in fact affect each other much more than those obviously connected. So e.g.: demise of the Swiss confidentiality promise undermines local political resiliance? Wealthy move out there money, NGOs move in? “The SDGs were adopted by the UN in 2015 as a “universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity”” LOL! Definitely a laudable goal, but if the legal identities are supposed to be digital how is that helping poor people. Now they need a digital device and those consume power which now means they need to consume and pay for electricity. It just seems much more like one more part of a person that is being privatized for someone else’s economic rent seeking benefit. We must have digit IDs TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN!!! LOL! Yeah, to protect the children of those rich blood suckers at the other end who need a good flow of asset income for the family trust they just set up. We must have vaccine to protect the elderly I refuse government direct deposit because it cannot be trusted, here’s but one example: In mid November 2024 the abused Canada Post workers went on strike. In mid December 2024 all 55,000 of them were ordered back to work. My November 2024 BC government cheque did not arrive. My December 2024 BC government cheque did arrive. I have emailed the minister and his deputy minister 3 times about the missing cheque. In a couple of days I will file a formal notice of claim at the BC court registry to litigate this failure of undertaking by that ministry because I have had no response and no cheque. One of these days the cheque will not be issued because there is no way I will accept digital ID, because the control freaks cannot be trusted. Your email address will not be published.

Ireland under-20 head coach Neil Doak has named seven players with previous experience at this age-grade level in a 31-man squad for the upcoming Six Nations Championship that begins on Thursday, January 30th, with a sold-out clash with the reigning world champions England in Cork. Doak takes over from Willie Falloon – Richie Murphy coached Ireland in last year’s Six Nations before leaving to take up his current position as head coach with Ulster – who led Ireland to fourth place in last summer’s World Championship in South Africa with Andrew Browne and Seamus Toomey joining Ian Keatley as assistant coaches. Cork-born Connacht academy prospect Éanna McCarthy will captain a squad that includes prop Alex Usanov, secondrows Alan Spicer and Billy Corrigan and hookers Henry Walker and Mikey Yarr, who played in one or other tournament. Sale Sharks scrumhalf Will Wootton, younger brother of former Munster and Connacht wing Alex, was part of last year’s squad before picking up an injury. Coming off successive Grand Slams, Ireland won four and drew one match in last season’s tournament, a 32-32 thriller with the eventual Six Nations champions England saw Murphy’s charges pipped to a third title in a row by a single bonus point. The Irish 20s beat Italy and a Leinster Development XV in warm-up matches. Walker, Wootton and Daniel Green, an outhalf-cum-fullback, came through the IQ programme. Enniscorthy centre Connor Fahy, Tullamore-born flyer Páidí Farrell, who has played Sevens for Ireland at underage level, Ciarán Mangan, younger brother of Diarmuid, Usanov, Spicer, Corrigan, Boyne secondrow Mahon Ronan, number eight Aaron O’Brien, and wings Andre Ryan and Charlie Molony, all played for Leinster in the A interpros. Centres Gene O’Leary Kareem and Eoghan Smyth, outhalf Dylan Hicks and backrow Michael Foy did likewise for Munster, while former Newbridge College prop Billy Bohan, now with the Connacht academy, backrow Bobby Power and McCarthy were on the Connacht Eagles team. Scrumhalf Clark Logan, outhalf/fullback Daniel Green and hookers Henry Walker and Connor Magee played for Ulster A. Promising tighthead prop and Leinster academy member Niall Smyth, former Newbridge fullback Todd Lawlor and Shannon duo, prop Emmet Calvey and backrow forward Luke Murphy, who both played for the 20s last year, are injured, while outhalf Casper Gabriel is ineligible for the time being. Doak said of being handed the head coach role of Irish rugby’s marquee age-grade team, having fulfilled a similar role for two years with the Irish under-18 Schools team and been an assistant coach with the 20s at the World Cup last summer: “Yeah, it’s fantastic, a hugely exciting time. “One of my sons [Ulster scrumhalf, Nathan] has come through this programme as well, so I’ve been a parent, a supporter and a spectator; so now I am a coach in the middle of it. I’m really looking forward to it and hopefully we can start off a solid season with a good performance against England. “Ultimately as a coach you have to understand the players. There is no point asking players to do things that they’re not really comfortable with and so we’ll adjust as we go along. We’ll obviously look at the other teams and see where we can exploit some avenues but from my point of view, I want to play a brand of rugby that excites the players, excites spectators.” Ireland Under-20s Backs (14) Andrew Doyle (Old Wesley/Leinster), Connor Fahy (Clontarf/Leinster), Páidí Farrell (Old Wesley/Leinster), Daniel Green (QUB/Ulster), Dylan Hicks (Garryowen/Munster), Gene O’Leary Kareem (UCC/Munster), Clark Logan (QUB/Ulster), Ciaran Mangan (Blackrock College/Leinster), Derry Moloney (Blackrock College/Leinster), Charlie Molony (UCD/Leinster), Andre Ryan (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Eoghan Smyth (Cork Constitution/Munster), Sam Wisniewski (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Will Wootton (Sale Sharks/IQ Rugby).

BlackRock expands iShares Bitcoin Trust to Canada after leading US Bitcoin ETF inflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) emerged as a bright spot in an otherwise challenging period for US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw their third consecutive day of net outflows on Jan. 13. According to data from Farside, the Bitcoin ETF market recorded a total net outflow of $284.1 million. BlackRock’s IBIT stood out with a $29.5 million inflow, contrasting sharply with significant outflows from other ETFs. On the other hand, Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) led the losses with $113.6 million in outflows, while ARK’s Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) followed with $92.4 million. Grayscale’s GBTC saw outflows of $89 million, while $18.6 million exited Bitwise’s BITB. Other Bitcoin ETFs reported no activity for the day. Over the past three trading days, cumulative outflows across the sector surpassed $1 billion. This trend indicates potential shifts in institutional investment strategies or evolving market sentiment around Bitcoin. Notably, BTC’s price had declined to a two-month low of under $89,400 before recovering to $96,828 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate’s data. BlackRock is extending its reach in the Bitcoin ETF space by launching its iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) in Canada. This development follows the fund’s notable success in the United States. According to a press statement, the Canadian rollout includes two versions of the ETF. One trades under the ticker IBIT on Cboe Canada, while a US dollar-denominated version is listed as IBIT.U. These ETFs offer investors exposure to Bitcoin by tracking its performance before deducting fund-related expenses. The iShares Bitcoin ETF primarily invests in US-traded IBIT, which holds Bitcoin as long-term assets. This structure allows investors to access Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts without dealing with custody or operational challenges. Helen Hayes, who leads iShares Canada, highlighted that the Canadian expansion reflects BlackRock’s commitment to making investments more accessible. She also noted that this launch provides a convenient and cost-efficient way for Canadian investors to gain Bitcoin exposure. BlackRock’s decision to expand IBIT follows its exceptional performance in the US, where it achieved a top 1% ranking among ETFs by assets. Over the past year, IBIT has been recognized as one of the most successful ETF launches of the decade. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Gold is one of the 'least effective' inflation hedges, according to Goldman Sachs. Here are 3 investments that actually protect your portfolio.

After a stellar year of 27% returns, it may be tempting to see gold as an investing cheat code. On top of delivering market-beating price appreciation, the yellow metal has long been regarded as a tangible store of value and inflation hedge. What more could you ask for out of an investment? But Goldman Sachs' wealth-management arm says the widespread belief that gold is a useful hedge against inflation is actually wrong. "The idea that gold is a good inflation hedge is just not correct," Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, the head of the investment strategy group and chief investment officer of wealth management, said when discussing the team's 2025 outlook. This view of gold runs contrary to that of many portfolio managers and banks, but for the skeptics, Goldman Sachs points to gold's historic performance. Gold beat the S&P 500 by 2% in 2024. But if you take a step back, the returns don't look as promising. Goldman Sachs pointed out that the 2024 year-end price of gold, at $2,625 per ounce, reflected only a 3.6% average annual increase from its nominal price in 1980. Within that period, the S&P 500 returned 11.7% annualized in nominal terms. Other commodities — such as oil, other metals, and even livestock — also have a reputation as a hedge against rapidly rising prices and wages. But Goldman says this, too, is mistaken. The total returns for oil since 2010 have been negative. Additionally, the commodity market is subject to high variability among its subsectors. Areas like agriculture and energy performed poorly, dragging the overall sector down. For investors looking to beat inflation, Goldman Sachs doesn't believe it's a good idea to put your money on commodities. "Commodities and gold are the two least effective inflation hedges," Goldman Sachs said in its 2025 outlook. What about bitcoin? Some Wall Street giants like BlackRock see a case for using bitcoin to hedge against rising deficits and inflation. Mossavar-Rahmani says don't even think about it. "It's not an investable asset," she said. "It's a gambling asset." Bitcoin has no source of cash flow, and its performance isn't tied to overall economic growth like that of stocks. Not to mention the cryptocurrency's price is extremely volatile. "The history of bitcoin is limited, so we have no evidence that cryptocurrencies are a reliable inflation or deflation hedge that will store value in an inflationary or deflationary environment," the bank said in its 2025 outlook. That doesn't mean investors can't buy or trade it, but Goldman Sachs doesn't believe investors should use bitcoin to protect against inflation or hold it as a long-term asset. If gold, commodities, and bitcoin won't protect your portfolio from inflation, what will? The best answer is also one of the simplest: US equities, which investors can get exposure to through owning the S&P 500. US stocks have a perfect track record of delivering returns in excess of inflation historically. The bank says the US market has more large, high-quality companies with robust earnings growth than international markets. "We do think that the earnings advantage that the US has will continue," Mossavar-Rahmani said. Real estate is another inflation hedge, as property values tend to rise alongside inflation. Both residential and commercial real estate offer capital-appreciation opportunities. In an inflationary environment, landlords have the pricing power to raise rents. And while rising labor and materials costs create an unfavorable, supply-constrained real-estate market, investors benefit from the value of their real estate rising alongside demand, according to the asset manager Nuveen. Lastly, Goldman Sachs points to intermediate Treasurys as another asset that performs well in the face of inflation. These government bonds mature in two to 10 years. Bond yields have been creeping up since the start of 2025, fueled by a hot December jobs report and increased worries about inflation. But Goldman Sachs predicts that yields will start to come down, meaning their value will increase — to the tune of a 6.5% return, the bank said. When a bond's price rises, its yield falls. Jump to

Title: LIZ PEEK: Joe Biden crushes Democrat agenda. This is his legacy

Time Published: 2025-01-14T10:00:01Z

Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane reacts to President Biden's foreign policy address on 'The Story.' In six days, President Joe Biden will leave the Oval Office, a beaten man. Not only is he responsible for his party’s loss in November, but he has also presided over the slaughter of Democrats’ most sacred cows, the ideological I-beams supporting their progressive agenda. DEI, a destructive mandate which blew up into a multi-billion-dollar industry, is being abandoned. ESG, the woke global investment directive, is being tossed overboard. "Gender-affirming care," polite words to describe the mutilation of young bodies, is being challenged by people who actually care about children. Illegal and unlimited immigration is under attack, lax law enforcement is under fire and censorship, the Left’s ultimate weapon and sin, is on the run. Meritocracy is making a comeback, common sense prevails and we have elected a president, Donald Trump, who is on the right side of these issues. This is Joe Biden’s legacy. JASON CHAFFETZ: FIVE KEYS TO BIDEN'S FAILED PRESIDENCY Biden will go down in history as an immeasurably vain and pretentious man of middling intellect who planned on being a great president and failed to be even a mediocre one. Two months into his term, Axios reported he convened a secret gathering of presidential scholars to discuss, in effect, what made presidents consequential and how he could scale those heights. He reportedly said to Doris Kearns Goodwin: "I'm no FDR, but … " Imagine the pomposity. It wasn’t just the president who had delusions of grandeur. So did his inner circle. The West Wing reportedly embodied a "think-big, go-big mentality." The session with the historians, Axios wrote, involved a "discussion of how big is too big — and how fast is too fast — to jam through once-in-a-lifetime historic changes to America." Biden hoped "to jam through what could amount to a $5 trillion-plus overhaul of America, and vast changes to voting, immigration and inequality"; he was willing to destroy the senate filibuster to get his way. Thankfully, many of the damaging measures adopted by this reckless and unpopular president will soon be overturned. Joe Biden will go down in history as an immeasurably vain and pretentious man of middling intellect who planned on being a great president and failed to be even a mediocre one. Democrats pretend, still, that Joe Biden has been a successful president. They applaud the big spending bills he signed, not because they resulted in tangible benefits to the American people, but because they drove trillions of dollars to Democrat-friendly coffers and causes. The embarrassing failures to build out charging stations or expand broadband access showcase the incompetence of his White House; the pile-up of an incremental $8 trillion in debt, 30% of the total outstanding, is the bill he leaves behind. Democrats must reckon with the aftermath. Biden has not only taken the Left off the political grid, he leaves the grid in ruins. BIDEN KEEPS INSULTING AMERICANS WITH LAST MINUTE MOVES. REPUBLICANS CAN STOP IT Corporations are scaling back DEI programs dear to liberals that were widely adopted in the wake of the George Floyd riots in 2020. Walmart, Ford, Meta, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, Lowe’s and John Deere are among the many companies either dumbing down their DEI efforts or abandoning them altogether. Some companies are changing the terms. McDonald’s, for instance, has rightly dropped the "E" for equity, instead emphasizing inclusion and diversity. Equity promises everyone an equal outcome, anathema to those who prefer to reward talent and effort. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Corporations are responding in part to last year’s Supreme Court ruling against Harvard’s race-based admissions policies; firms are concerned that their DEI programs could also be deemed illegal. But they are also listening to their employees, and especially those who perceive in the DEI programs a reverse bias and the scuttling of meritocracy. Financial firms are simultaneously dropping ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) guidelines, which required investors to look not only at financial results but also to grade corporations by various liberal yardsticks. The fast growth of ESG investing, which aligned trillions of dollars with Leftist ambitions, was driven by the demands of woke clients and by claims that companies which took ESG goals into account would outperform those that did not. That was false; in years when oil prices and stocks went up, for instance, ESG funds underperformed. The courts have played a role here, too. Just recently, a judge in Texas said American Airlines violated federal law by making investments for its employee retirement plan based on ESG factors rather than prioritizing high returns. In 2023, the Biden administration adopted a rule allowing certain types of retirement plans to consider ESG values in making investment choices under some circumstances; Trump will overturn that regulation. Meanwhile, major investment managers, including Blackrock, run by the uber-woke Larry Fink, have quietly exited the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, while the nation’s leading banks have all terminated their commitment to Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a similar climate initiative. Elsewhere, 26 states have now banned or limited what liberals call "gender-affirming care" for teens and children, blocking treatments which can do permanent harm. These restrictions follow similar measures in Europe, where authorities are concluding that the science does not support radical treatments for young people. Unlimited immigration, another Holy Grail of the Left, is also under attack in the U.S., and in Europe. In throwing open our borders and allowing millions to enter our country illegally, Biden has angered the country -- not only at Democrats who encouraged this unwanted flood of new arrivals, but at the newcomers themselves. Illegal immigration makes a mockery of our rule of law, has overwhelmed the finances and infrastructure of numerous cities and states, allowed the devastating importation of deadly fentanyl and undermined our national security. At the top of Donald Trump’s agenda is overturning Biden’s lawless approach. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Finally, Democrats’ efforts to censor Americans (remember the Disinformation Governance Board?) are now kaput. With Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announcing his social media platforms will no longer "fact-check," a euphemism for banning non-conforming expression, the game is up. Joe Biden and others on the Left are horrified; they so want to control our discourse. A majority of the country looks forward to Donald Trump’s inauguration, an end to Joe Biden’s failed presidency and to a return to common sense. January 20 cannot come soon enough.

Title: Rebound Alert: US Bitcoin ETF Interest Picks Up Speed In 2025

Demand for US Bitcoin ETFs has significantly increased as we enter 2025, signifying a notable reversal following a lackluster start to the year. Based on recent figures from Glassnode, net inflows for the week ending January 6 amounted to 17,567 BTC, equivalent to around $1.7 billion. This increase surpasses the weekly average inflows of 15,900 BTC documented in the final quarter of 2024 and indicates a resurgence of investor enthusiasm. Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have shown an erratic pattern. These inflows showed notable fluctuations in late 2024. In September, there was a significant decline as Bitcoin prices dropped below $64,000, leading to large withdrawals. Nevertheless, things began to change by October. Inflows increased dramatically; in few weeks, they topped 24,000 BTC. With the average weekly inflow settling at around 15,900 BTC, the increase continued into November and December, demonstrating the high demand for Bitcoin investments. After a slow start to the year, demand for US spot #Bitcoin ETFs has normalized. In the week of January 6, inflows reached 17,567 #BTC ($1.7B), which is slightly higher than the weekly average of 15.9K $BTC ($1.35B) from October to December 2024: https://t.co/0Cpfm8lpak pic.twitter.com/u4FksOSLuZ — glassnode (@glassnode) January 13, 2025 As the price of Bitcoin increased, so did ETF inflows. In December 2024, the most popular digital asset in the world reached a record-breaking high of $108,135. This association suggests that as more people switched to exchange-traded funds, investors’ confidence in Bitcoin’s worth grew, leading to a positive market sentiment. The total holdings of US spot Bitcoin ETFs as of early January 2025 are approximately 1.13 million BTC. Grayscale has 204,300 BTC, Fidelity holds 205,488 BTC, and BlackRock has 559,673 BTC, making it the largest holding. In 2024, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) garnered attention by accumulating $37.25 billion in assets during its inaugural year, securing the third position on the Top 20 ETF Leaderboard for that year. This significant surge highlights the rising institutional demand for cryptocurrency-backed financial solutions. Bitcoin ETFs look like they will do well in 2025. Experts in the field think that this year there may be a lot of new, innovative offerings on the market. There will be at least 50 new bitcoin ETFs this year, according to Nate Geraci of the ETF Store. These will cover a wide range of strategies, such as covered call ETFs and Bitcoin-denominated equity ETFs. Furthermore, there is conjecture that Bitcoin spot ETFs may soon exceed physical gold ETFs in asset size. This would represent a pivotal advancement in the development of digital assets as conventional investment instruments. Such a change would highlight a rising confidence in Bitcoin as a valid store of value and investment tool, therefore challenging the long-held view of gold as the best hedge. As financial institutions such as Vanguard investigate cryptocurrency ETF alternatives, it underscores a wider trend of acceptance and incorporation of cryptocurrencies into established financial systems.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock is trying to avoid the hot seat as GOP takes power

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The world’s biggest money manager is trying to avoid some political headaches as the GOP prepares to take over all of Washington. BlackRock Inc. (BLK) late last week pulled out of a UN-supported climate group known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM), following the exodus of several Wall Street banks from an affiliated group in the weeks before Donald Trump takes over the White House again. BlackRock also was granted more time to resolve a standoff with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) over its holdings of US banks, ensuring that the dispute will now play out in the opening months of Trump 2.0. The $11 trillion financial giant has for years been a target of GOP attacks about "woke" investing, with Republicans raising concerns about whether BlackRock’s massive holdings in US corporations force companies to adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has backed away from using the politically contentious acronym. And Democrats have for years also been leery about whether the heft of BlackRock could pose risks to the financial system. BlackRock, which reports its fourth quarter earnings Wednesday, will have to navigate all these political challenges as the GOP takes over the White House and Congress — a measure of control that could create new headaches for the money management giant. A report last month from the House Judiciary Committee, led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, mentioned BlackRock along with Vanguard and State Street (STT) in arguing that it found "evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior" by the financial industry to "impose radical ESG-goals" on US companies. The report also criticized financial environmental alliances, saying they have created what it called "a climate cartel." Last Thursday, BlackRock confirmed its departure from one financial environmental alliance known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). The group had a pledge of support from its NZAM members to help achieve net-zero emissions carbon emissions by 2050 by using their influence within the financial sector — such as supporting climate initiatives in corporate boardrooms through proxy voting. "Our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials," BlackRock told clients in a letter cited by Bloomberg. The company added in the letter that its portfolio managers "continue to assess material climate-related risks." On Monday, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative said on its website that it had suspended its activities pending a review. It added in that note that "recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context." The other delicate political situation now being juggled by BlackRock is its resistance to the FDIC’s push for greater oversight. The FDIC had been asking BlackRock to sign by Jan. 10 a "passivity agreement" that would codify greater checks on the money manager’s holdings of FDIC-supervised lenders, pushing back a deadline that was previously Dec. 31 of this year. The agreement the FDIC wanted BlackRock to sign was similar to one announced with Vanguard that imposed new compliance requirements when the manager amasses more than 10% of all outstanding stock in an FDIC-supervised bank. It was designed to assure bank regulators that the giant money manager will remain a "passive" owner of an FDIC-supervised bank and won’t exert control over a bank’s board. Currently, BlackRock only has such an agreement with the Federal Reserve. BlackRock spent much of 2024 denying that it exerted undue control over companies through its investment stewardship activities. Last Friday, BlackRock's deadline to respond to information requests from the FDIC was extended to Feb. 10, punting the standoff into the start of Trump's new term as president. As a practical matter, BlackRock must either rebut any presumption it has control of more than 10% in a holding company of an FDIC-supervised bank by responding to the FDIC's most recent information requests or sign a "passivity agreement," according to one person familiar with the matter. It is not yet known how the Trump administration may decide to handle the BlackRock situation or who will run the FDIC following the Republican takeover of the White House.

Title: Elon Musk says a third patient got a Neuralink brain implant. The work is part of a booming field

Time Published: 2025-01-14T08:32:00Z
Full Content:
Tuesday, 14 Jan 2025 Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. — AP Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines. “We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X. Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year. Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones. The second recipient – who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer – was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3D objects. The first patient, also paralysed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess. But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal Of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better. Who’s working on brain-computer interface technology? More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a US database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses. Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces. Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation. What are the benefits of BCIs? Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis. Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach”, he said. “It’s a little early to know.” Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink. “We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavours. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be,” he said. How are BCIs tested and regulated? Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from US regulators to begin testing its device in people. While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices. Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study. Dr Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analysing data. She said this regulatory process prioritises safety. She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organisation forming the board. The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll,” said Dr Redberg. – AP Related stories: Could Neuralink's brain implant be used to control a robotic arm?Neuralink says second brain device implant ‘went well’Elon Musk’s Neuralink eyes more test subjects for its brain techDespite setback, Neuralink’s first brain-implant patient stays upbeatNeuralink says implant had issues after first human surgeryElon Musk says the first human has received an implant from Neuralink, but other details are scant Neuralink says second brain device implant ‘went well’Elon Musk’s Neuralink eyes more test subjects for its brain techDespite setback, Neuralink’s first brain-implant patient stays upbeatNeuralink says implant had issues after first human surgeryElon Musk says the first human has received an implant from Neuralink, but other details are scant Elon Musk’s Neuralink eyes more test subjects for its brain techDespite setback, Neuralink’s first brain-implant patient stays upbeatNeuralink says implant had issues after first human surgeryElon Musk says the first human has received an implant from Neuralink, but other details are scant Despite setback, Neuralink’s first brain-implant patient stays upbeatNeuralink says implant had issues after first human surgeryElon Musk says the first human has received an implant from Neuralink, but other details are scant Neuralink says implant had issues after first human surgeryElon Musk says the first human has received an implant from Neuralink, but other details are scant Elon Musk says the first human has received an implant from Neuralink, but other details are scant Topic: Report it to us.

Title: Reuters Exclusive: Investor Climate Group Suspends Activities After BlackRock Exit

A flagship coalition aimed at aligning the asset management industry with global climate goals said it was suspending its activities on Monday, days after BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, left amid a political backlash in the United States. The pause raised concerns that companies will lower their efforts on climate change even after the hottest year on record, but could buy organizers time to review what actions might still be acceptable for U.S. fund firms. BlackRock, which manages some $11.5 trillion in assets, left the Net-Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative on Jan. 9 citing confusion over its climate efforts and legal inquiries from public officials. The step followed months of escalating pressure from some Republican politicians over its stance on investing in fossil fuel companies, with concern that such pressure could rise further as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office. The group counted more than 325 signatories managing more than $57.5 trillion in assets as members, according to its website as of last week, before the departure of BlackRock. In a letter to its members first reported by Reuters, the partner groups which help manage the NZAM said they had decided to conduct a review of its activities. “Recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context. “As the initiative undergoes this review, it is suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting. NZAM will also remove the commitment statement and list of NZAM signatories from its website, as well as their targets and related case studies, pending the outcome of the review.” CONTAGION EFFECT NZAM was set up in 2020 as executives and investors grew enthusiastic about solving climate change, sentiments that have faded. Still, changes by the NZAM initiative could prevent the sort of flight by asset managers that diminished the influence of another investor climate group, the Climate Action 100+, last year. At the time, big fund firms cited independence concerns, not politics, as a reason for their dropping out. Since then pressure from U.S. Republican officials has increased on executives to back away from reflecting environmental, social and governance (ESG) assessments in their investment decisions. These include an inquiry from the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee and a lawsuit by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states that claimed that fund activism had cut coal production and boosted energy prices. For its part, the NZAM initiative has asked members to support the goal, agreed by countries, of capping global warming and aiming to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Kathy Mulvey, a campaign director for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Massachusetts-based advocacy organization, said groups including NZAM “have been an important avenue to keep us on track” toward meeting emissions-reduction targets. Whatever the results of NZAM’s review, she said, “clearly the financial sector’s actions to advance emissions reductions and the clean energy transition aren’t going away.” Among other members of NZAM, a representative for JPMorgan’s asset management arm JPMorgan declined to comment on Monday’s move. In a statement sent by a representative, State Street’s asset management arm said it “supports the announced NZAM review and will carefully evaluate its findings upon completion.” (Reporting by Simon Jessop in London and by Ross Kerber in Boston.

The iShares Bitcoin ETF (iShares Fund) has begun trading under the IBIT ticker in Canadian dollars and IBIT.U in U.S. dollars, targeting investors seeking Bitcoin exposure without the usual complexities of direct crypto ownership. Such an investment product "helps remove the operational and custody complexities," Helen Hayes, Head of iShares Canada for BlackRock, said in a statement on Monday. Notably, the iShares Fund invests "all or substantially all of its assets" in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in the U.S. The fund allows investors to hold Bitcoin exposure in tax-advantaged accounts through traditional brokerage platforms in a bid to address certain concerns investors have, including custody and exchange account requirements. BlackRock's entry brings institutional credibility to Canada's crypto market, with the fund joining seven other iShares listings on Cboe Canada. The exchange facilitates 15% of Canada-listed securities trading volume, per the statement. Younger investors, consistent growth Continued investment in crypto ETFs such as IBIT reflects broader demographic shifts, with younger investors showing more appetite for digital assets as concerns about inflation grow, BlackRock notes in a prospective report on how ETFs are changing Bitcoin exposure. Bitcoin has emerged as a significant digital asset class in recent years, with potential appeal as a global monetary alternative during periods of institutional uncertainty. Crypto adoption more broadly is outpacing historical technology trends, reaching 300 million users faster than both the internet and mobile phones, industry data tracked by BlackRock shows. For comparison, BlackRock's research indicates that crypto only took 12 years to be widely adopted, compared to the internet's 15 years and 21 years for mobile phones. In the U.S., BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has amassed $52.7 billion in assets under management, with net inflows reaching peaks of $1.2 billion during its strongest periods, data from CoinGlass shows. Total Bitcoin spot ETF inflows for the fund show consistent growth through late 2024 despite periodic outflows, reflecting a strong institutional appetite for regulated crypto exposure. Even still, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded significant outflows on Monday, with market leaders GBTC, FBTC, and ARKB collectively shedding over $295 million in a single day, contributing to a total market outflow of $313.6 million across the sector. On the same day, Bitcoin briefly traded below $90,000 before reclaiming the $95,000 level at press time, data from CoinGecko shows.

Title: Elon Musk says a third patient got a Neuralink brain implant. The work is part of a booming field

Time Published: 2025-01-14T05:41:01Z

Laura Ungar Associated Press Published: January 13, 2025 at 2:08 PM Laura Ungar Associated Press Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines. “We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X. Recommended Videos Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year. Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones. The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess. But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better. Who's working on brain-computer interface technology? More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses. Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces. Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation. What are the benefits of BCIs? Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis. Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know." Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink. “We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be," he said. How are BCIs tested and regulated? Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people. While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices. Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study. Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety. She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board. The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll," said Redberg. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Title: Here’s Why Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (RKLB) Is Among Monday’s Top Losers

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Drop on Bearish Statements, Disappointing Earnings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) stands against the other stocks. Ten companies—mostly under the quantum computing sector—kicked off the trading week leading declines amid not-so-optimistic statements from chief executives and disappointing earnings updates that have weighed in on investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Wall Street's main indices ended mixed, with the Dow Jones and S&P’s main index the only gainers, up 0.86 percent and 0.16 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.38 percent. To come up with Monday’s top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A launch pad atop a grassy hill, smoke filled sky from a successful voyage to space. Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) tumbled by 11.15 percent on Monday, a fourth consecutive day, to finish at $23.91 each following a statement that appears to be a jab at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), unveiling its own plan to return rock and dust samples that the latter has been collecting from Mars’ Jezero Crater since 2021. Earlier this week, NASA said that it needed more time to determine the path forward for its Mars Sample Return program, punting a decision until mid-2026. But Rocket Lab believes the best solution is right under the agency’s nose. “We can wait another year, or we can get started now,” the company wrote in a post on X. “This is not our first encounter with the Red Planet. The orbiters, rovers, landers, and helicopters of Mars all bear Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB)’s fingerprints. We can deliver MSR mission success too.” Overall RKLB ranks 6th on our list of Monday's top losers. While we acknowledge the potential of RKLB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RKLB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BTC vs ETH ETFs: Why investors are favoring Bitcoin right now

BTC and ETH ETFs reveal contrasting trends this week, with Bitcoin spot ETFs leading inflows and Ethereum ETFs facing a net outflow. Investor interest in crypto-focused ETFs has taken center stage as Bitcoin[BTC] and Ethereum[ETH] show contrasting trends in fund flows. While Bitcoin spot ETFs enjoy significant inflows, Ethereum ETFs grapple with notable outflows. This divergence reveals shifting investor sentiment and raises critical questions about the factors driving these dynamics. Bitcoin spot ETFs saw remarkable inflows of $307 million last week on the 6th of January, reflecting heightened investor confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF emerged as the standout performer, pulling in $498 million. This strong performance highlights the growing appeal of Bitcoin as a reliable store of value, particularly as macroeconomic uncertainties persist. However, not all Bitcoin ETFs shared this positive momentum. The Ark & 21 Shares ARKB ETF experienced a net outflow of $202 million, indicating that while institutional inflows drive the overall trend, some funds face challenges in retaining capital. Analysis of the chart illustrates the consistent rise in Bitcoin ETF inflows, showcasing BlackRock’s pivotal role in steering the market. Source: Sosovalue In sharp contrast to Bitcoin’s success, Ethereum ETFs recorded a net outflow of $186 million over the same period. This marks a continuation of Ethereum’s recent struggles to attract investor interest. Despite this, BlackRock’s ETHA ETF managed to buck the trend, achieving a modest net inflow of $124 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FETH ETF faced substantial outflows, totaling $276 million, further underscoring Ethereum’s challenges. ETH ETF flow chart analysis highlights this disparity, with inflows waning since late 2024. Concerns around staking risks, Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi, and competitive pressures from other layer-1 networks could be contributing to this decline in sentiment. The data paints a picture of investors reassessing Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Source: Sosovalue The divergence in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF flows offers valuable insights into investor psychology and market dynamics. Bitcoin’s ability to consistently attract capital signals its growing reputation as a safe-haven asset. Institutional confidence, spearheaded by major players like BlackRock, reinforces this narrative. On the other hand, Ethereum’s performance raises questions about its future. Although it remains the second-largest crypto asset, it has struggled to keep up with BTC, and there is growing competition. As Bitcoin solidifies its position, Ethereum faces mounting pressure to address these concerns and regain its footing. These BTC and ETH ETF trends are not just numbers; they reflect broader market shifts. Bitcoin’s strong inflows highlight its potential to serve as a hedge against volatility, capturing both institutional and retail attention. For Ethereum, the outflows suggest a need for clearer narratives to build confidence as a viable alternative asset class. BlackRock’s dominance in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets underscores the growing influence of traditional financial institutions in the crypto space. This trend signals a maturing market but also raises questions about the decentralization ethos that has long defined cryptocurrencies. – Read Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025-26 The latest ETF data highlights a tale of two cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s strong inflows reaffirm its position as the dominant force in the market, while Ethereum’s struggles emphasize the challenges it faces in maintaining investor confidence. As crypto evolves, ETF flows will remain a critical barometer of sentiment and a guide to understanding the shifting landscape.

Title: Bitcoin adoption is outpacing the internet and mobile phones – BlackRock

BlackRock also advocated Bitcoin exposure through its spot ETF, IBIT, as it deems direct exposure complex for many. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s (BTC) adoption is outpacing the transformative technologies of the past, including the internet and mobile phones, according to a recent report by BlackRock. The document highlighted that since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has quickly evolved from a niche innovation to a globally recognized asset. It attributed the evolution to demographic trends, economic shifts, and the ongoing digital transformation of finance. Younger generations, often referred to as “digital natives,” are significantly more inclined to embrace Bitcoin compared to Gen X and Baby Boomers. Their comfort with technology and preference for digital-first solutions have positioned them as the leading demographic in crypto adoption. Regarding economic shifts, trends such as rising inflation, geopolitical tensions, and concerns over traditional banking systems have highlighted Bitcoin’s value as a decentralized asset. It added that, in uncertain times, Bitcoin’s independence from central authorities has resonated with investors worldwide. The third driver is the maturation of digital asset infrastructure, which has lowered Bitcoin’s barriers to entry while creating new use cases. As the global economy digitizes, BTC is becoming integral to the evolving financial landscape. The document also advocates using BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT, to gain exposure to BTC. The asset manager argued that while Bitcoin’s adoption grows, direct investment in BTC remains complex for many. IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, with nearly $38 billion in inflows, based on Farside Investors’ data. It holds over $50 billion in assets under management and was the largest ETF launched in 2024. Notably, BlackRock launched a new Bitcoin ETF in Cboe Canada on Jan. 13, which will be denominated in Canadian dollars and trade under the same IBIT ticker. Meanwhile, the US dollar-denominated units will trade under the symbol IBIT.U. The ETF Store CEO Nate Geraci praised BlackRock’s efforts to drive Bitcoin adoption via ETFs. He also criticized Vanguard, the second-largest asset manager by assets under management, which has taken a completely opposite approach to Bitcoin. Meanwhile, independent analyst Sam Callahan highlighted that Paragon Advisors disclosed a $21.7 million allocation to IBIT in their 13F Form for last year’s fourth quarter. Paragon has $292 million in assets under management, with IBIT comprising nearly 7.5% of its portfolio, the largest allocation.

The Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) coalition — a United Nations–sponsored collection of financial services companies that have pledged to negate their portfolio’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner — suspended activities after investment firm BlackRock announced its departure from the group, according to a press release. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion and has been a leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, announced its exit from NZAM Thursday, with its vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand saying the firm’s involvement in the environmental coalition “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials.” Now, NZAM has pressed pause altogether, halting operations while it conducts a review of its activities, an NZAM press release published Monday stated.

BlackRock’s exit came amid a broader corporate strategy shift away from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, with the firm only supporting about 4% of the 493 environmental and social investment proposals shareholders put forward between the end of June 2023 and the end of June 2024, down from a rate of 47% in 2021. BlackRock was a major supporter of ESG investing in years prior, with CEO Larry Fink claiming in 2020 that “climate risk is investment risk” and that climate change would lead to a “fundamental reallocation of capital.” “The destruction of NZAM is a huge win for consumers,” Will Hild, executive director of conservative nonprofit Consumers’ Research, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Although there is a lot of work left to be done, what was effectively a cartel of asset managers has finally ceased taking the focus of businesses off of consumers, raising prices for everyday Americans everywhere from the gas pump to the grocery store.” When reached for comment, NZAM referred the Daily Caller News Foundation to its press release.
