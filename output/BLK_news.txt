Spot Bitcoin US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are roaring today, recording the highest inflow in four months as a total sum of $556 million streamed into 12 funds. Coincidentally, by the time the inflow was received, Bitcoin was rebounding as it touched a two-week high at $66,500. The highest single-day flow, at $239 million, came in through Farside (FBTC), the highest since June. Others performing well include Bitwise (BITB) at $100 million and BlackRock (IBIT) which managed to attract new investors to the rake in $79.51 million. Several funds posted inflows as the market continued to rally. The shares of ARK Invest and 21Shares (ARKB) stood at nearly $70 million, while Grayscale (GBTC), the bitcoin trust, recorded its first inflow since September at a little over $37 million even if the trust struggled with massive cumulative outflows of $20 billion since its inception. Other small funds that posted inflows included: HODL, EZBC, BTCO, Grayscale BTC Mini Trust, and Valkyrie whose inflows totaled over $29 million. Their growing action also pushed the trading volumes of these 12 Bitcoin ETFs up to $2.61 billion. Analysts project that this new rise will push such funds further by using the net inflows achieved in the past 10 months which is currently at $19.36 billion. This could also be due to Bitcoin ETFs also taking more than gold-based products, reaping $1.5 billion in net inflows this year. Bitcoin ETFs rose to the highest degree as compared to Ethereum ETFs, which responded relatively better. Net inflows into Ethereum ETFs stood at $17 million led by BlackRock (ETHA) with $14 million. Other funds in Fidelity (FETH), Invesco (QETH), and 21Shares (CETH) received flows ranging from $393,690 to $1.30 million. Trading volumes for Ethereum ETFs also rose to $210 million from $143.54 million the previous day. In fact, since their launch in July, Ethereum ETFs have seen net outflows of $542 million. The total cryptocurrency market also started to recover from its losses with Bitcoin trading at $65,268. Meanwhile, Ethereum increased by almost 3% to hit the $2,594 level by the end of the day. As Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, said, this day was a “monster day” for spot Bitcoin ETFs, as the crypto investment product continues to gain mass appeal ahead of traditional and safer assets, such as gold.

New York, New York, October 15th, 2024, Chainwire With the cryptocurrency market entering the final quarter of the year with major bullish momentum, the emerging altcoin platform DTX Exchange (DTX) has made a strong impact. The DeFi platform has raised over $4.75 Million weeks earlier than expected. This early success reflects the growing interest in platforms that offer access to a diverse range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, equities, and real-world assets (RWA), under a unified trading system. Despite the entry of financial giants like Blackrock and Morgan Stanley into the decentralized world, there is still a lack of a unified platform that integrates conventional assets like equities, stocks, and bonds with decentralized assets like cryptocurrencies. DTX Exchange has aimed to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized financial markets by allowing users to trade over 100,000 assets on a single platform. This innovative solution makes it possible for traders to access a wide variety of assets under a single platform with minimal trading fees. The global cryptocurrency industry is worth $2 trillion alone, with the broader equities market having over $90 trillion worth of assets. By enabling the trading of these assets, DTX provides traders with the chance to enhance liquidity. The DTX team aims to attract the attention of millions of retail and enterprise traders through this unique feature. DTX Exchange’s presale has seen considerable early participation across its initial rounds. The first round raised approximately $300,000 in a short period, while the second phase exceeded $1 million in total funds raised. The third presale round concluded ahead of schedule, with the platform raising over $4.75 million across all rounds to date. During this time, the token price increased from $0.01 to $0.08, reflecting initial interest in the platform’s offerings. DTX Exchange credits its early adoption to its unique product offerings, including: VulcanX Blockchain – This privacy blockchain powers the DTX ecosystem and is the first unified blockchain to support conventional financial assets. With a throughput of over 100,000, this blockchain is expected to power the next decentralized applications of the future. DTX Unified Wallet – The DTX Unified Wallet is the first crypto wallet to support forex, equities, and crypto assets under a single secure application. The product is expected to add features like P2P asset trading and portfolio management tools. Enterprise RWA Platform – DTX is onboarding conventional assets on the blockchain through the Real World Assets (RWA) builder platform. In the most recent development, the ongoing presale has sold over 50 million tokens and raised $3 million to sell out the 3rd round weeks ahead of schedule. The DTX team is now raising the token price, giving investors another opportunity to join the presale and secure DTX tokens before they launch on public exchanges. DTX Exchange has outlined its plans to make DTX tokens available for open public trading following the launch of the VulcanX blockchain. With a growing community of over 70,000 members, the platform is preparing for broader accessibility, which may help increase its reach and user base significantly upon public launch. Additionally, DTX also has an active developer community that is actively developing new products. Aside from offering a suite of trading features, DTX Exchange is expected to offer a wide range of products to developers and enterprise players in the finance world. Some notable products include the Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization tool that allows stakeholders in the Real Estate industry to tokenize assets and introduce new models of investment in illiquid assets. Additionally, DTX is expected to launch the DTX Unified Wallet, which allows holding stocks, cryptos, and forex assets. Additionally, future plans include holding the Digi-Hackathon to improve platform security and integrity. With the unique approach DTX Exchange has taken to unifying digital assets, its presale performance comes as no surprise. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, the platform is designed to improve transaction capacity compared to many layer-1 blockchains. Given the rapid pace of the presale sold, the altcoin could mirror the past trajectory of other cryptos that had exponential rallies. In the past, projects like Solana, Cardano, Polygon, and Dogecoin have all surged from small-scale altcoins into multi-billion dollar projects that have become household names. DTX Exchange aims to fulfill its potential and turn into a major powerhouse in the coming months. Investors can still become an early part of the DTX Exchange community. With a current price of $0.08 and a listing price of $0.20, investors are poised to enjoy growth in value in the coming months. With broad applications for the financial sector, DTX aims to become the cornerstone of the DeFi industry and carve out a sizeable portion of the $2 Trillion trading industry.

Title: Why Hyundai picked India for record $3.3 billion IPO
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/why-hyundai-picked-india-for-record-33-billion-ipo/a-70499104
Time Published: 2024-10-15T14:42:00Z
Full Content:
India is the world's third-largest auto market, set for further huge growth before the end of the decade. Hyundai is banking on the $3.3 billion IPO to solidify its market position. The South Korean auto giant Hyundai launched its initial public offering (IPO) on Tuesday, billed as India's biggest stock market debut, worth about $3.3 billion (€3.05 billion). The first carmaker to go public in India since Maruti Suzuki in 2003, Hyundai is offering 142 million shares for sale, which represents about 17.5% of the total shares of its Indian arm. Retail bidding, priced at 1,865 rupees ($22.20/€20.35) to 1,960 rupees per share, is expected to continue until Thursday. The stock market listing is expected to begin on October 22. Already India's second-largest carmaker by sales, Hyundai is keen to build on the advantage gained by its early entry into the national market in 1996. Last year, Hyundai sold over 605,000 vehicles in India, a 9% increase from the previous year. It hopes the additional funds will help close the market share gap with leader Maruti Suzuki. India already has the third-largest auto sector in the world — and it is growing fast. Last year, more than 4.1 million vehicles were sold. The auto sector is a major pillar of the economy and the country's large, growing consumer base and urbanization rate, along with relatively low production costs, make it an ideal location for Hyundai to manufacture and sell its vehicles. India's government is keen to boost domestic electric vehicle production, which aligns with the Korean carmaker's strategy. Hyundai also sees India as a critical alternative to China and Russia, where sales have dropped because of geopolitical issues. The South Asian country offers a more stable environment to its peers. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Globally, Hyundai's IPO will be the second largest this year in terms of money raised, following July's listing by Lineage Logistics, the world's largest cold-storage firm, worth $5.1 billion. Hyundai's listing will eclipse the 2022 IPO of the state-run Life Insurance Corporation of India, in which the government sold a 3.5% stake and raised $2.7 billion. Other top domestic listings in recent years include fintech giant Paytm, whose IPO was worth $2.2 billion in November 2021, and Coal India, which went public in 2010 at a value of $1.8 billion. India's stock market has been booming over the past four years, growing by 210% between April 2020 — during the first pandemic lockdown — and last month. On Tuesday, the SENSEX, the index of the Top 30 stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange, was trading at 81,820. India recently pipped Hong Kong to become the fourth-largest stock market in the world. In a sign of the popularity of Hyundai's listing, nearly $1 billion in shares were snapped up by institutional investors on Monday. The government of Singapore and BlackRock, the giant US investment firm, picked up stakes worth a total of $77.3 million, while Fidelity bought shares worth $76.5 million and domestic mutual funds were allocated shares worth a total of $340 million. Retail investors snapped up 18% of the available shares by the end of Tuesday, the first day of the public offer, media reported. India's auto market has rapidly become ultracompetitive, and smaller domestic rivals Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have eaten into Hyundai's market share. "India is one of the most exciting auto markets in the world," Unsoo Kim, managing director of Hyundai's Indian unit, told a news briefing in Mumbai last week. "[The] IPO will ensure that Hyundai Motor India is even more dedicated to succeed in India." Hyundai plans to use proceeds from the IPO to enhance its research efforts and develop new cars, seeking to transform the country into a production hub for other countries in the Global South. Hyundai already delivers its India-made vehicles to more than 90 countries. "We intend to become a global manufacturing hub for Hyundai for the emerging markets," Tarun Garg, chief operating officer of Hyundai India, told the Reuters news agency. "In [the] next 3-4 years, [a] 30% increase in production will improve our domestic and export volumes." The Korean automaker has already invested $5 billion in the country and plans to pump in another $4 billion over the next decade to help make its Indian operations a key plank of its electric vehicle (EV) production, as well as building EV infrastructure such as charging stations and a battery assembly plant. Hyundai currently has one manufacturing plant in India for local sales and exports. Production at a second plant is expected to begin operations in 2025, which will help take the firm's total capacity in India to beyond 1 million units a year. Edited by: Rob Mudge

Title: Bitcoin inches toward $68,000 following BlackRock’s CEO crypto endorsement

Time Published: 2024-10-15T14:41:42Z

Share this article Bitcoin hit a high of $67,800 in the last few minutes, moving closer to $68,000 and just 8% away from its March record high. The surge came after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink endorsed Bitcoin as a viable asset class. Fink recently reaffirmed his support for Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class during the company’s third-quarter earnings call. According to him, Bitcoin is not only a viable investment but also a rival to traditional commodities like gold. “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself,” said BlackRock CEO, adding that the company was discussing potential Bitcoin allocations with institutions worldwide. As of now, Bitcoin’s market cap has reached $1.3 trillion, a figure that proves its growing prominence and acceptance in financial circles, per CoinGecko. BTC is currently trading at around $67,400, reflecting a 3% increase over the past 24 hours. The upward trend follows a notable 5% gain yesterday, which came amid the strong performance of US spot Bitcoin ETFs. On Monday, these funds collectively drew in around $550 million in net inflows, Farside Investors data shows. Market sentiment remains bullish with expectations of further increases if Trump secures a victory in the upcoming election. Concurrently, the recent rally comes amid the WLFI token presale of Trump-backed World Liberty Finance. The project raised $5 million in the first hour despite website issues. Analysts suggest Trump’s involvement could boost the crypto sector, contrasting with Kamala Harris’s more conservative stance on digital assets. The extended rally occurred around the time World Liberty Finance, the DeFi project backed by Trump, launched its WLFI token presale. The project raised $5 million in the first hour despite website issues. Market sentiment remains bullish with expectations of further increases if Donald Trump secures a victory in the upcoming election. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: These Bank Stocks Hit Highs As Goldman Sachs, Charles Schwab Post Hot Earnings

Bank stocks surged Tuesday as several major financial institutions reported earnings, as the group gets a boost from lower interest rates. Charles Schwab led a financials rally Tuesday. Five of the eight largest U.S. banks by market capitalization reported third-quarter results Tuesday – Bank of America, Charles Schwab, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs – with the most notable metrics including 18% or better annual revenue jumps from Bank of America, Citi and Goldman’s equities trading divisions and shrinking debt from Schwab. The investor response was overwhelmingly positive to the batch of earnings, with Bank of America shares gaining 3% at open, Citi rising 1.7%, Schwab shares soaring 7% (on pace for its best day since July 2023), Goldman 3% and PNC 1%, though Citi and Goldman turned negative as trading continued. National banks Goldman and Morgan Stanley tallied all-time high intraday share prices Tuesday and a host of regional stocks like Bank of New York Mellon, PNC, U.S. Bancorp stocks registered 52-week highs, while other financial services firms like American Express and BlackRock also touched records. The S&P 500’s financials sector rose 0.8%, the third-largest gain of any of the index’s 13 sectors, while the BlackRock-managed iShares U.S. Financials exchange-traded fund also gained 0.8%, notching an all-time high. The iShares financials ETF is up 4% since last Thursday, as the U.S.’ largest and third-largest banks JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo reported bumper earnings Friday. It’s not just strong Q3 results driving the bank stock rally, but rather a “macro rotation,” noted Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O’Connor in a Friday note to clients. O’Connor added the market’s increased confidence that the U.S. avoided a recession is the “best outcome for banks.” That’s because investment banks get major boosts from better economic sentiment and declining rates as companies pursue mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings, and other financing routes that require financial advisory services. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates last month for the first time in more than four years, and is widely expected to continue lowering rates. Last year was the weakest for M&A globally since 2013, according to McKinsey & Company. Though it’s been a strong stretch for national banks, many regional bank stocks have struggled to return to glory after 2023 marked the worst year for bank failures in U.S. history as regional powerhouses First Republic, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks went under in a seven-week stretch. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF is down more than 20% since the end of 2021. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

New York, New York, October 15th, 2024, Chainwire With the cryptocurrency market entering the final quarter of the year with major bullish momentum, the emerging altcoin platform DTX Exchange (DTX) has made a strong impact. The DeFi platform has raised over $4.75 Million weeks earlier than expected. This early success reflects growing interest in platforms that offer access to a diverse range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, equities, and real-world assets (RWA), under a unified trading system. Innovative Multi-Asset Platform Meeting Market DemandDespite the entry of financial giants like Blackrock (NYSE:BLK) and Morgan Stanley into the decentralized world, there is still a lack of a unified platform that integrates conventional assets like equities, stocks, and bonds with decentralized assets like cryptocurrencies. DTX Exchange has aimed to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized financial markets by allowing users to trade over 100,000 assets on a single platform. This innovative solution makes it possible for traders to access a wide variety of assets under a single platform with minimal trading fees. The global cryptocurrency industry is worth $2 trillion alone, with the broader equities market having over $90 trillion worth of assets. By enabling the trading of these assets, DTX provides traders with the chance to enhance liquidity. The DTX team aims to attract the attention of millions of retail and enterprise traders through this unique feature. VulcanX Blockchain - This privacy blockchain powers the DTX ecosystem and is the first unified blockchain to support conventional financial assets. With a throughput of over 100,000, this blockchain is expected to power the next decentralized applications of the future. DTX Unified Wallet - The DTX Unified Wallet is the first crypto wallet to support forex, equities, and crypto assets under a single secure application. The product is expected to add features like P2P asset trading and portfolio management tools. Enterprise RWA Platform - DTX is onboarding conventional assets on the blockchain through the Real World Assets (RWA) builder platform. Given the rapid pace of the presale sold, the altcoin could mirror the past trajectory of other cryptos that had exponential rallies. In the past, projects like Solana, Cardano, Polygon, and Dogecoin have all surged from small-scale altcoins into multi-billion dollar projects that have become household names. DTX Exchange aims to fulfill its potential and turn into a major powerhouse in the coming months. Investors can still become an early part of the DTX Exchange community. With a current price of $0.08 and a listing price of $0.20, investors are poised to enjoy growth in value in the coming months.

Title: Bitcoin Market Cap to Reach $50 Trillion: Blackrock CEO

U.Today - Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), has once again stoked interest in Bitcoin, predicting that its market capitalization may eventually match that of the United States' the housing market, which is now worth more than $50 trillion. Fink, who highlighted Bitcoin as a unique asset class in and of itself, made these audacious predictions during BlackRock's Q3 earnings call. He has a clear vision: Bitcoin will continue to grow much like gold as a result of more international discussions about its place in institutional portfolios and liquidity. Fink says the emergence of digital assets like Bitcoin makes him think of the early days of the mortgage market, which is currently worth about $11 trillion. He emphasized that although Bitcoin's growth may begin slowly, similar to the mortgage market, it may eventually see widespread adoption with improved data analytics and transparency. The largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock has already made waves in the cryptocurrency space by demonstrating its dedication to the digital gold by applying for a spot Bitcoin ETF. This support indicates Fink's faith in Bitcoin's long-term prospects. It is interesting to note that Fink does not believe that regulation or even the White House plays a significant role in determining the success of Bitcoin. Rather, he thinks transparency and liquidity hold the key. According to his theory, the global acceptance of Bitcoin will grow as long as data-driven transparency rises. Fink's remarks also allude to Ethereum's future by highlighting the blockchain's expanding function and room for growth. The entire cryptocurrency market may experience previously unheard-of growth if greater acceptance is fostered and improved analytics are used. Despite Fink's optimistic assessment, it is crucial to keep in mind that BlackRock has a stake in the expansion of Bitcoin. Due to BlackRock's substantial Bitcoin holdings, demand may be further stimulated by its ETF. In any event, the CEO's remarks have fueled the flames, leading many to question whether Bitcoin can actually match the $50 trillion of the U.S. housing market going forward.

Title: Hyundai India's record $3.3 billion IPO subscribed 18% on first day of bidding

Business A family unveils a new Hyundai car at one of the motor group's showrooms in New Delhi, India, September 6, 2024. REUTERS/Ainnie Arif/File Photo Hyundai Motor India's $3.3 billion IPO was 18 per cent subscribed on the first day of bidding on Tuesday, led by employees who placed orders for four-fifths of the shares reserved for them in the country's largest share sale yet. The three-day share sale, the first by an automaker in India in two decades, ends on Thursday. Prior to the open bidding process, institutional investors including BlackRock and Fidelity on Monday snapped up shares worth $989.4 million as part of the offering. The initial public offering (IPO) marks Hyundai Motor's first such listing outside South Korea and comes at a time when companies are rushing to go public in an Indian equities market that has risen to record highs. Over 260 companies in India have raised more than $9 billion through IPOs so far this year, according to LSEG data. That's already higher than the $7.42 billion raised during the same period last year. The share sale is the world's second-largest IPO this year following Lineage Inc's $5.1 billion U.S. flotation in July. Employees of Hyundai India bid for 80 per cent of the 778,400 shares reserved for them, exchange data showed. The company had offered a discount of 186 rupees per share to eligible employees in the IPO, which was priced at 1,865-1,960 rupees per share, months after hundreds of workers at the company's main Indian plant at Sriperumbudur near Chennai protested to demand a share allocation. Qualified institutional buyers including foreign investors, banks and mutual funds subscribed to 5 per cent of the shares allotted for them, while retail investors bid for 26 per cent of their allocated shares. Hyundai India is targeting a $19 billion market valuation at the upper-end of the IPO price band. That values the company at about 40 per cent of its Korean parent. Its shares are expected to start trading on Oct. 22. Hyundai is India's No. 2 carmaker by sales with about a 15 per cent share of the country's passenger vehicle market and trails only Maruti Suzuki. However, a rapidly changing competitive landscape has seen domestic rivals Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra eat into the South Korean company's market share with new SUVs that are gaining popularity. Higher production capacity would help Hyundai bridge the gap with Maruti Suzuki and extend its narrow lead over Tata and Mahindra.

The integration aims to reduce investment costs and ease the subscription process for traditional finance players investing in BUIDL, Securitize said in a statement. The firm issues BUIDL tokens on the Ethereum blockchain in collaboration with BlackRock. Zero Hash, a blockchain infrastructure company, will facilitate the conversion between dollars and digital assets for the service, per the statement. “This integration allows digital asset companies to remain on-chain throughout the entire investment lifecycle, enabling near-instantaneous and transparent settlement and transfers across platforms,” Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, told Decrypt. The offering, available to qualified investors, is designed to accelerate investments into BUIDL, Domingo added. The fund, valued at around $550 million, is among the largest of its kind, according to data from Etherscan. The move comes as tokenized real-world asset funds grow in popularity, particularly following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. In April, BUIDL surpassed $375 million in assets under management, overtaking Franklin Templeton's OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund as the largest tokenized treasury fund. BUIDL, whose assets are estimated to have ballooned by roughly 46% in the following months, allows institutional investors to earn yields on U.S. dollars by purchasing tokenized shares, which represent investments in secure assets such as U.S. Treasury bills. According to the firms, the key advantages include immediate settlement, enhanced liquidity, and transparent on-chain transactions. In a bid to capture interest in the rising sector, several new blockchain-based RWA funds have emerged in recent months. In September, Guggenheim Treasury Services partnered with blockchain firm Zeconomy to launch a digital commercial paper fund, while Midas introduced two real-world tokenized products across Europe. Additionally, Ondo Finance and Mountain Protocol have begun using BUIDL as a backing asset for their yield-generating products.

Fidelity dominates Bitcoin ETF inflows with $239 million as Grayscale bucks outflow trend. Bitcoin ETF saw $809.5 million in net inflows across the last two trading days. Fidelity alone received $356 million worth of Bitcoin, according to Farside data. On Oct. 11, Bitcoin ETF net inflows totaled $253.6 million. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF led the way with $117.1 million in inflows, while Ark’s ARKB ETF added $97.6 million. Bitwise’s BITB ETF posted $38.8 million in inflows, and Invesco’s BTCO said $7.9 million. VanEck’s HODL ETF contributed $14.3 million. Grayscale’s GBTC ETF, however, saw outflows of $22.1 million. Other funds, including those from BlackRock, Franklin, Valkyrie, and WisdomTree, remained flat. By Monday, Oct. 14, Bitcoin ETFs saw additional substantial inflows of $555.9 million, indicating strong institutional demand. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF once again led with $239.3 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, which added $79.5 million. Bitwise’s BITB ETF contributed $100.2 million, while Ark’s ARKB ETF saw inflows of $69.8 million. Invesco’s BTCO and Franklin’s EZBC added smaller amounts, $4.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC ETF reversed its trend, gaining $37.8 million in inflows. Grayscale’s smaller BTC ETF also added $4.7 million. Ethereum ETFs On Oct. 11, 2024, Ethereum ETFs had a relatively quiet day, posting net outflows of $0.1 million. Fidelity’s FETH ETF saw $8.6 million in inflows, offset by $8.7 million in outflows from Grayscale’s ETHE fund. Other Ethereum ETFs remained flat, including those from BlackRock, Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, and Franklin. By Oct. 14, Ethereum ETFs rebounded with $17.0 million in total inflows. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF led with $14.3 million, followed by Fidelity’s FETH ETF, which added $1.3 million. Other small inflows were seen in 21Shares’ CETH and Invesco’s QETH, contributing $0.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively. No outflows were reported across any Ethereum products for the day. The strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs over the last two trading days, particularly in Fidelity, BlackRock, and Ark funds, suggest increasing confidence from institutional investors. Ethereum ETFs, while quieter, also saw renewed interest on Oct. 14, with BlackRock leading the way. Also known as "Akiba," Liam is a reporter, editor and podcast producer at CryptoSlate.

Title: How to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens during the WoW anniversary event

NEXT | The scarily good Overwatch 2 season 13, called Spellbinder, starts ... With the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Event and patch 11.0.5 arriving in just a week, the big question on everyone’s mind is “just how am I supposed to earn the Bronze Celebration Tokens so I can buy all of these cool rewards?” Thankfully, Blizzard has explained a few things and the rest we’ve gleaned from the PTR, so we have a good idea of what we need to do when the patch goes live. So strap on your work boots, because you’ve got some dailies to do. Some of the events for the anniversary have not been available for testing, so the numbers may change before the event goes live, but here’s what we know now.The anniversary includes two one-time events to get you started:Meet and Greet gives 4 Bronze Celebration Tokens.Truth of the Dark Irons (the Blackrock Depths quest) gives 5 Bronze Celebration Tokens.From here, the event seems to be all repeatable quests.Celebrate Good Fun! gives 3 Bronze Celebration Tokens daily.Your Khaz Algar “wizard chores” (Theater Troupe, Awakening the Machine, Wax Collecting, Spreading the Light, Severed Threads, and Special Assignments) give 1 Bronze Celebration Token each.Weekly Khaz Algar meta quests (Archives, The Call of the Worldsoul, and whatever the weekly is that week be it Timewalking or Delves or PVP) give 2 Bronze Celebration Tokens each.The 20th Anniversary Weekly Quests give 3 Bronze Celebration Tokens each. These include some returning Anniversary Weekly quests like Soldier of Time and The Originals as well as some new ones like Chromie’s Codex, An Original Path Through Time and Disturbance Detected: Blackrock Depths.Once you’ve earned 100 Bronze Celebration Tokens, your entire Warband will be able to get ungated tokens from the following:Blackrock Depths Raid Dungeon Raid BossesWorld BossesClassic Timewalking QueuesCodex of Chromie QueuesKorrak’s Revenge Daily QuestsYou’ll want to be doing these too, as the rewards this year are really good. Not only has Blizzard given us high quality revamped versions of the iconic Tier 2 armor sets (adding in armor for new classes as well), but you can grab mounts and pets from previous WoW anniversary events in case you are a newer player or just happened to miss it (like I did with the Obsidian Worldbreaker).Got your fill of everything you wanted but still have a surplus of Bronze Celebration Tokens? That’s okay! You can trade 1 Bronze Celebration Token for 20 Timewarped Badges, which you may want to do because there’s going to be a bunch of new Timewarped Badge loot as well in the Anniversary event — including the Claymore of the Knight’s Pledge, a Tier 2 Judgement set inspired two-handed sword for 2500 badges. There will also be 15 20th Anniversary Event titles available for 100 badges each, which will no longer be available after the event ends… so make sure you grab your Karazhan Graduate title before it’s gone!If anything changes or we find new ways to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens, we’ll update this post to let you know.Blizzard Watch is made possible by people like you.Please consider supporting our Patreon!Filed Under: Bronze Celebration Token, Patch 11.0.5, Tier 2 Armor, World Of Warcraft 20th AnniversaryAdvertisement The anniversary includes two one-time events to get you started: From here, the event seems to be all repeatable quests.

Title: Why Bitcoin Price Blasted Past $66,500: Key Reasons Revealed

Bitcoin experienced a significant surge, climbing from a low of $62,050 on Sunday to a peak of $66,500 late Monday. As of Tuesday, the BTC price is slightly correcting below this key resistance level, but hovering above $65,000. Several critical factors have contributed to the rally, including a short squeeze coinciding with the upcoming US elections, strong demand in the spot Bitcoin market, and substantial inflows into US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Yesterday’s price surge can be partly attributed to the liquidation of leveraged short positions. Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital writes in their latest investor note that nearly $80 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum leveraged shorts were liquidated, applying upward pressure on the market. While some speculate that the postponement of Mt. Gox’s repayment deadline to October 2025 played a role, this news was already published on Friday, suggesting other factors were at play during Monday’s rally. “Although there could be many factors that could explain today’s move, it is quite an interesting time if we look at historical price action. We are in the middle of October and just three weeks away from the US elections,” QCP Capital notes. In both 2016 and 2020, Bitcoin remained in a tight trading range for months before initiating a significant rally approximately three weeks before the US Election Day. In 2016, Bitcoin doubled in price from $600 by the first week of January following the election. Similarly, in 2020, it surged from $11,000 to a high of $42,000 by January. This year, October—often referred to as “Uptober” due to its historically strong performance—has been underwhelming, with Bitcoin up just 1.2% compared to an average of 21%. The current rally, occurring three weeks before the US elections, suggests that history might be repeating itself, potentially leading to further price appreciation as investor optimism builds. For the first time since mid-2023, Bitcoin’s buy orders are matching sell orders in spot market order books across exchanges. Ki Young Ju, Founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, highlighted this development via X: “Bitcoin buy walls on all exchanges are now strong enough to neutralize sell walls.” This shift marks a significant change from the trend observed since May 2021. “Data from the last cycle (2020-2022). It’s the accumulated difference between quoted buy and sell volumes. Since May 2021, sell walls had been consistently thicker than buy walls until the end of the cycle,” Young Ju shared. Monday witnessed one of the highest Bitcoin ETF inflows on record, totaling $555.9 million—the largest net inflow day since June 3. This substantial capital influx was spread among several major asset managers. BlackRock received $79.5 million, Fidelity attracted $239.3 million, Bitwise accumulated $100.2 million, Ark Invest saw inflows of $69.8 million and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced inflows of $37.8 million. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store and host of the ETF Prime podcast, commented on these inflows via X: “Monster day for spot btc ETFs… $550mil inflows. Now approaching *$20bil* net inflows in 10mos. Simply ridiculous & blows away every pre-launch demand estimate. This is NOT “degen retail” $$$ IMO. It’s advisors & institutional investors continuing to slowly adopt.” At press time, BTC traded at $65,750.

Title: BlackRock CEO Fink Unleashes Bitcoin Bombshell In Q3 Earnings Call

Time Published: 2024-10-15T12:30:00Z

During BlackRock’s third-quarter earnings call, CEO Larry Fink articulated a strong endorsement of Bitcoin and digital assets. Fink’s commentary not only underscored Bitcoin as a standalone asset class but also paralleled its burgeoning significance with historical financial markets like mortgages which are now worth $11 trillion and high-yield bonds. “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself,” Fink stated unequivocally. “It is an alternative to other commodities like gold.” He also revealed that BlackRock is actively engaging with institutions worldwide regarding digital asset allocation. “Conversations we’re having with institutions worldwide [are] about how they should think about digital assets, what type of asset allocation there should be,” he explained. Fink emphasized the inevitability of digital assets becoming a global reality: “I do believe the utilization of digital assets is going to become more and more of a reality worldwide.” Drawing parallels to the early days of the mortgage and high-yield markets, Fink suggested that digital assets are on a similar trajectory of growth and acceptance. “Years ago, when we started the mortgage market, years ago when the high-yield market occurred, [they] started off very slow but built as we built better analytics and data,” he recalled. “Through better analytics and data, more acceptance and a broadening of the market [occurred]. I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets.” Contrary to the common narrative that regulation is the primary hurdle for digital asset adoption, Fink argued that other factors are more critical. “I truly don’t believe it’s a function of regulation, of more regulation, less regulation,” he asserted. “I think it’s a function of liquidity, transparency, and then through that process, no different than when you […] built better analytics and data.” Fink also highlighted the transformative potential of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence in expanding digital asset markets. “We believe the technology of these blockchains is going to become very additive,” he said. “Then you will overlay AI, and having better data analytics, the applicability and the broadening of these markets will occur.” Besides Bitcoin, Fink specifically mentioned Ethereum, noting its capacity for significant growth: “I think the application of this form of investment will be expanded to the role of Ethereum as a blockchain can grow dramatically.” Addressing the digitization of national currencies, Fink distinguished between digital assets like Bitcoin and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). “How does each and every country look at their own digital currency? That’s a very different asset than a Bitcoin in itself,” he clarified. “We’re seeing big success in India, in Brazil in the digitization of their own currency for various different reasons.” When talking about the potential impact of the US presidential election on Bitcoin and the entire crypto market, Fink was dismissive of any significant effect. “I’m not sure if either President or other candidate would make a difference,” he commented, suggesting that other market forces are the primary drivers of adoption. At press time, BTC traded at $65,600. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Bitcoin’s ‘Uptober’ momentum fueled by pro-crypto US candidates and fading global tensions

Bitcoin Uptober narrative gains momentum with BTC reaching $66,000. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin surged to a high of $66,000 in the past 24 hours, breaking out of weeks of stagnation as the broader crypto market showed signs of recovery. October has historically been a strong month for investors, with gains as high as 60% and an average return of 22%. Despite this, the market has remained stable over the past weeks, leading to a more cautious outlook among investors. Yesterday’s upward movement, however, has rekindled optimism around the “Uptober” narrative as market analysts highlight why the top asset’s run could continue. According to CryptoSlate’s data, Bitcoin’s price has slightly retracted to $65,632 as of this writing. A major factor driving this renewed momentum is the growing perception that both leading US presidential candidates—Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump—are pro-crypto. This belief suggests that the crypto market could benefit regardless of the election outcome. Vice President Harris recently announced plans to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets, aiming to protect retail investors while promoting economic inclusion, particularly in minority communities. On the other hand, Trump has positioned himself as a strong advocate for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, making pro-crypto statements during his campaign. Blockchain-based prediction platform Polymarket shows Trump with a 56.2% chance of winning the impending election, while Harris stands at 43.4%. Despite the election uncertainty, leading institutions like Galaxy Digital believe Bitcoin will remain unaffected regardless of who wins. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed this sentiment, stating that Bitcoin is poised to soar regardless of the election result. He emphasized that Bitcoin’s growth is driven more by liquidity and transparency than by regulation or political leadership. Other potential drivers behind Bitcoin’s recent performance include shifting market sentiment and global economic factors. In an Oct. 15 note, trading firm QCP Capital noted that disappointment with China’s latest economic stimulus may have prompted some investors to redirect funds from Chinese equities into Bitcoin. China’s attempts to revive its economy have been underwhelming, leaving many to question the effectiveness of its policies to combat deflation. This uncertainty has drawn further attention to Bitcoin as an alternative. Additionally, the delay in repayments to creditors of the Mt. Gox exchange by another year has eased concerns about a sudden influx of Bitcoin supply flooding the market. Geopolitical risks also appear to be diminishing, with reports suggesting that Israel may hold off on targeting Iran’s crude oil and nuclear infrastructure. This reduction in tensions could provide further stability to global markets. QCP Capital also noted that the current lack of major inflation or labor data would allow the crypto market to rise with lower risk premiums. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Bitcoin ETF inflows cross $500 mln, But THIS still worries investors

Despite growth, Bitcoin ETFs have captured only 3% of overall market volume. On the 14th of October, Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs saw record-breaking inflows, with a total value of $555.9 million—their largest daily net inflow since June, according to Farside Investors. This surge in ETF interest coincided with BTC reaching a two-week peak. The coin was trading at $66,500, at press time. Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge and logged an impressive $239.3 million, marking its highest inflow since the 4th of June. Other notable ETFs included Bitwise’s BITB with inflows of $100.2 million, BlackRock’s IBIT at $79.5 million, and Ark 21Shares’ ARKB with just under $69.8 million. Grayscale’s GBTC had its first influx in October, at $37.8 million, the largest since May. Remarking on the same, ETF Store President Nate Geraci noted, Source: Nate Geraci/X Since their debut in January, BTC ETFs have amassed a notable $18.9 billion net inflows. Excluding GBTC, the nine new Bitcoin ETFs owned around 646,000 BTC, with GBTC adding 223,000 BTC to the total. These funds control 869,000 BTC, roughly 4% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. This year has seen remarkable growth in the ETF sector, with around 2,000 launches. This includes top funds like BlackRock and Fidelity. Remarking on the matter, Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas said, Source: Eric Balchunas/X However, despite recent growth, BTC ETFs represent only a small slice of the total Bitcoin trading landscape. According to Checkonchain data from the 11th of October, the Bitcoin Futures market recorded $53.4 billion in trades, with the spot market reaching $4.5 billion. In contrast, ETF trades totaled just $2 billion, capturing approximately 3% of the day’s overall BTC market volume. This little fraction demonstrates ETFs’ infancy in the larger Bitcoin market ecosystem. Well, this is also because determining the exact share of ETF inflows driven by the “basis trade,” or cash and carry trade, remains challenging. Major institutions like Goldman Sachs and Jane Street Capital are engaged in creating and redeeming ETF shares, which stabilizes the ETF’s price and liquidity. Hedge funds, such as Millennium Management and Capula Management, employ “basis trading” strategies to profit from discrepancies between Bitcoin’s spot and futures prices. However, not all large holders engage in basis trading. For example, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board holds the ETF for purposes like portfolio diversification. Yet, Bernstein, a private wealth management firm, suggests that basis trades could act as a “Trojan horse” for broader adoption, as increased liquidity and trading volume may encourage investors to adopt long-term positions in Bitcoin. Therefore, if options tied to IBIT are approved and physically settled, it would attract more sophisticated investors. And, for that, strategies like covered calls (selling call options while holding the underlying asset) would allow investors to generate passive income, while miners could use these options to hedge their holdings. Together, these elements could bring more maturity and volume to the Bitcoin ETF market.

Impact investment, whereby a fund creates beneficial social or environmental impact, has now grown to £76.8 billion in the UK in assets under management. Tens of thousands of new homes are set to be built across Britain funded by over half a billion pounds worth of impact investments announced today (Tuesday 15 October). Coming the day after the Prime Minister announced £63bn of investment into Britain at the International Investment Summit, the commitment from three major financial institutions to invest for impact will directly tackle the most acute housing crisis in living memory, which includes at least 5,000 new homes to address social inequality. This supports the Government’s priority to get the country building again, creating more jobs and boosting the economy. The announcement comes as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones this morning hosts a roundtable with some of the biggest impact investors in the world, including Schroders, M&G, International Bank of America, Blackrock and Barclays, as the Government looks to create the right environment for impact investment across the country. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said: Investors tell us they want to help in delivering a better Britain. Working in partnership with government, social impact investing can change people’s lives and improve communities across the country. We are dedicated to creating the right environment for impact investment across the country, and the announcement of over half a billion pounds worth of impact investment building tens of thousands of new homes is a great example of the change that we are delivering on. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: These new funds provide a much-needed, fresh opportunity to work in partnership with impact investors, tackling some of the most pressing social and environmental challenges while driving economic growth. We want to make the UK a world leading centre of excellence on the impact economy and look forward to working with the sector to unleash its full potential for our country. These three investments funds by Schroders, Man Group and Resonance are exemplars of private capital responding to major social and environmental challenges, delivering returns while also helping to grow the economy, the government’s central mission. Today’s £550 million impact investment underpins the government’s drive to foster public-private partnerships to drive meaningful impact across the country. Schroders, one of the UK’s largest investment managers, has today confirmed a new £50 million allocation from Homes England, into its recently launched real estate impact fund. The fund, which has an initial target of raising £200m with the aim of ultimately delivering 5,000 homes to address social inequality and deliver an appropriate financial return to investors, expects to make its first investments before the end of 2024. It is focused on helping to deliver more social and affordable housing, regenerate town centres and invest in social infrastructure, in places where housing benefits from public transport, green spaces, schools and GP surgeries. Man Group, a London-headquartered global alternative investment management firm managing $178.2 billion, has also announced a further £100mn investment to deliver affordable and environmentally sustainable housing for communities across England, with 90% of homes to be designated as affordable housing. The investment will have a particular focus on delivering homes with a low carbon footprint and addressing the housing needs of key and essential workers. This investment programme builds on the £385mn that has already been committed to affordable housing since 2021. Leading social impact property fund manager Resonance have today announced an expected 300% increase in investment – from £79m to £250m - into its initiative to tackle homelessness. This directly channels investment into residential property to help create pathways out of Temporary Accommodation for individuals and families. Resonance has set a target of reaching £1bn investment in this area in the next five years, so it can work directly with local authorities and housing partners across the country to help provide people at risk of homelessness with a stable home.

Title: $BTC ETFs Record $555M Inflows, Demand ‘Blows Away Every Pre-Launch Estimate’

Why Trust Tech Report Tech Report is one of the oldest hardware, news, and tech review sites on the internet. We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Yesterday, $BTC ETFs recorded $555.86M in net inflows, the largest since early June. ETF Store President Nate Geraci noted cumulative 10-month $BTC ETF inflows will soon reach $20B and called October 14 a ‘monster day.’ $BTC hitting $66K for the first time since September 27 could be one reason for such demand. But Geraci believes inflows come from institutions, not ‘degen retail’ investors. Let’s zoom in on crypto ETF performance in the US and beyond. Fidelity led the pack with nearly $240M inflows, twice that of Bitwise. BlackRock recorded nearly $80M inflows, while Ark & 21Shares a little less than $70M. Franklin, Invesco, and Valkyrie all had under $10M net inflows. The two smallest funds, Wisdom Tree and Hashdex saw zero investment. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF tops the list with the largest cumulative net inflows of $21.78B, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC ETF with $10.22B net inflows. Grayscale’s GBTC stands out as the only $BTC ETF with a negative cumulative net flow (–$20.15B). It may be that high sponsor fees coupled with an above-average price deter investors, forcing Grayscale to sell off its $BTC holdings. In March, Grayscale held nearly $25M in net assets. The fund had to reduce its holdings to $14.51B to meet redemption requests. Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink rightfully called IBIT the fastest-growing ETF to ever exist. He added that he’s bullish on $BTC in the long term. In BlackRock’s Q3 earnings call, Fink recognizes that $BTC is an asset class in itself and argues its adoption isn’t a matter of regulation. Instead, policymakers and industry players should focus on liquidity and transparency. Fink further compares crypto to the mortgage market, noting that better analytics and data accelerated its expansion. He believes digital assets will become as big as the entire US housing sector, now estimated at $50T. Fink and Geraci both highlight that no one expected such explosive demand, both from retail and institutional investors. $BTC ETFs have been doing well since launch. However, the same can’t be said for $ETH ETFs. The cumulative net outflow of $541.82M suggests institutional investors lack confidence in $ETH despite its mature ecosystem and bullish trend. The reason is simple: launched in 2017 as a trust, ETHE was initially a locked-in investment. In July, Grayscale gained regulatory approval for investors to redeem their assets. At the time, Grayscale held approximately $10B in $ETH. Within a week, investors withdrew over $2B from the trust, and it hasn’t recovered since. Another reason for poor $ETH ETF performance is the lack of staking yield available with direct $ETH exposure. Why miss out on 3.5% APY and pay a sponsor fee at the same time? On the other hand, BlackRock’s ETHA product saw solid interest from institutional investors. Yesterday’s $14.31M inflows brought the cumulative flows to $1.22B, nearly three times that of Fidelity’s FETH. The lackluster demand for $ETH ETFs in the US doesn’t discourage other countries from launching their crypto exchange-traded products. Crypto security firm BitGo and exchange Gemini act as custodians and are responsible for the assets’ safety. In August, Monochrome launched Australia’s first $BTC ETF (IBTC), which now holds over $15.9M in assets. One-month flows into IBTC topped $1.7M. While $BTC ETFs are thriving, US $ETH ETFs are having a rough time. Yet, their fate might be different in Australia if Monochrome manages to demonstrate crypto ETF appeal to institutional investors. As for Grayscale, Fink has hinted at the way to recovery. Increasing liquidity and lowering fees are the only salvation for GBTC and ETHE. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Analysis-European and US bonds rapidly diverge as economic wedge widens

By Harry Robertson LONDON (Reuters) - A rapid divergence between euro zone and U.S. government bond markets is expected to continue, as an increasingly lacklustre European economy adds to the pressure on the European Central Bank to quickly cut interest rates. The closely-watched gap between U.S. and German 10-year bond yields has risen to its widest since July at around 183 basis points (bps), as U.S. yields have climbed in recent weeks while the German ones have ticked up only slightly. Yields move inversely to prices. "We think these market dynamics have further to run," said Simon Blundell, co-head of European fundamental fixed income at $11.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), who favours European over U.S. bonds. While September's sharp acceleration in U.S. jobs growth highlights the strength of the U.S. economy, euro area business activity contracted unexpectedly last month. Traders now expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to slow down after a 50-basis point rate cut in September, but the ECB is this week tipped to deliver its third rate cut since June. Goldman Sachs said the U.S.-German bond yield gap is likely to rise to 200 bps, a level last seen earlier this year. "We continue to expect European rates to outperform the U.S, with data weaker and a central bank less willing to front-load," the bank's analysts said in a note. The widening yield gap is already spilling over to other markets, with the euro falling to its lowest level in around two months as higher returns draw investors towards U.S. bonds, boosting the dollar. EUROPE SPUTTERS Germany's finance ministry last week said Europe's largest economy would probably contract for a second year running in 2024. Its once-mighty manufacturing sector continues to struggle in the wake of an energy crisis sparked by the Ukraine war. "The numbers are really not good," said Michael Weidner, co-head of global fixed income at Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management. "Neither the hard numbers that are reported, nor the soft numbers regarding the outlook and various indicators. They all pretty gloomy, and the mood is even worse." France meanwhile has pledged to raise taxes and cut spending as it tries to reduce its budget deficit. While many investors see that as necessary, it will weigh on growth in the euro zone's second largest economy. Reinout De Bock, head of European rates strategy at UBS, said interest rates could fall as low as 1% in the euro zone next year if growth fails to pick up, and said France's deficit reduction would act as a drag. A slowdown in China, a key trading partner, is another concern for investors. In sharp contrast, the blow-out September employment report has allayed fears of a sharp U.S. slowdown and caused investors to scrub out bets that the Fed would lower rates by 50 bps for a second meeting running in November. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in September said it expected the U.S. economy to expand 2.6% this year and 1.6% in 2025, compared to growth rates of 0.7% and 1.3% in the euro zone. DEEP RATE CUTS Traders expect the ECB to stop cutting rates late next year at roughly 2%, well above the sub-zero levels that prevailed before the coronavirus pandemic. The ECB's main rate is currently 3.5%. Yet Bank of America analysts are skeptical that the euro zone economy can sustain 2% interest rates, a level many economists see as "neutral" - one that neither stimulates nor restrains economic activity. "The world of today does not differ a lot from the world of 2017-2018: private domestic demand remains surprisingly weak," BofA strategists, led by Ralf Preusser, wrote last week. BofA expects European bond prices to rise. Not all investors are gloomy about the euro zone's prospects, as they point to stronger growth in countries such as Spain and Italy. "The European data is OK and actually, relative to expectations, is perking up," said Lloyd Harris, head of fixed income at Premier Miton Investors. Harris said he thinks markets are pricing in too many rate cuts and expects bond yields to tick back up, although by more in the U.S. than in Europe. "The U.S. is just slightly different in that we've got more government expenditure and more willingness to run a larger deficit, and that's what's pushing the U.S. economy forward."

91% of respondents intend to increase investments in private assets over the next two years60% of insurers targeting clean energy infrastructure investments for low-carbon transition objectivesRespondents see value in technology for key challenges of private asset modeling (53%) and regulatory capital integration (51%) NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Global insurers are focused on increased allocations to private markets, clean energy infrastructure and utilizing innovative technology in 2024, according to BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s 13th annual Global Insurance Report. For the third year running, BlackRock's annual report shows a majority of insurers are planning increased investments in private markets, with 91% of all respondents saying they will do so within the next two years. This figure increases to 96% for APAC and 96% for North American insurers. The report tracks insights from 410 insurance investors surveyed across 32 markets, representing nearly $27 trillion USD in assets under management. Mark Erickson, Global Head of BlackRock's Financial Institutions Group, said, We've seen rapidly accelerated demand for private markets among insurers in recent years, given these investments' dual benefits of diversification and increased income generation. Navigating risk: finding the right investment partner With 2024 projected to be the biggest election year in history, insurers see political uncertainty impacting macro risks, citing regulatory developments (68%) and rising geopolitical tension and fragmentation (61%) as their top concerns. Additionally, interest rate risk (69%) and liquidity risk (52%) were highlighted as the most serious market risks for insurers. Despite this outlook, 74% of insurers have no plans to change their current risk profiles. Notably, many insurers reported they benefit from partnerships to augment their internal expertise for risk evaluation as well as portfolio construction. According to 40% of survey respondents, an investment partner who understands both their insurance business and its operating model is fundamental to the success of insurers' strategic priorities. Asset allocation: a balanced approach across public and private assets Within public markets, 42% of those surveyed planned to increase allocations to government and agency bonds. Inflation-linked bonds are also a priority, with 33% planning to increase exposure, given nearly half of insurers (46%) identify inflation as a major macro risk. Additionally, 44% of respondents are looking to increase their allocations to cash and short-term instruments for liquidity. In private markets, insurers report they are looking to increase allocations to private debt across multiple categories, including opportunistic private debt (41%), private placements (40%), direct lending (39%), and infrastructure debt (34%). As the scope of private debt has expanded to encompass a wider array of lending opportunities, BlackRock's report indicates this asset class can support insurance investment objectives for those needing long-term assets to support long-term liabilities, as well as increasing investment income through illiquidity rather than other investment characteristics. In addition, over half of insurers (52%) reported they will increase allocations to multi-alternative investments for greater flexibility and customization. Olivier Van Eyseren, Head of the Financial Institutions Group, EMEA for BlackRock said, Insurers face unique challenges when evaluating strategic asset allocation to alternative investments, including regulatory issues, liquidity needs, and higher capital charges. An important part of our work with insurance clients is helping them navigate these short-term complexities while working toward the best possible long-term portfolio outcomes. Seizing the moment for clean energy infrastructure Nearly all (99%) of insurers surveyed have set a low-carbon transition objective within their investment portfolio, with 57% of respondents citing management and/or mitigation of climate risks as a top motivation for doing so. Additional drivers for setting low-carbon transition objectives include responding to stakeholder and beneficiary interest and fulfilling regulatory requirements. To support their low-carbon transition strategy, clean energy infrastructure such as wind and solar (60%) and technologies such as batteries and energy storage (60%) were identified as the top two thematic areas that insurers plan to target. In addition, 66% of respondents stated that they have more conviction now towards investing in the low-carbon transition than they did one year ago. Leveraging innovative technology In an increasingly volatile and complex macroeconomic and regulatory environment, insurers recognize the importance of investing in technology. Integrated asset allocation (63%) and asset liability management (61%) were named as strategic priorities for their technology platforms. Regulatory capital integration (51%) was also cited as an area where technology could add value. As insurers look to continue their deployment into private markets, 53% of respondents view private asset modeling as an additional area to leverage technology.

Title: Most Asian shares track Wall Street higher, oil extends losses

By Stephen Culp NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed down on Tuesday, following world stocks lower as a weak sales forecast from chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML) weighed on tech shares, while crude extended its slide due to easing supply worries and weakening demand. The three major U.S. indexes ended the session in negative territory, with the S&P 500 and the Dow easing back from Monday's record closing highs. Financial firms Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America all posted better-than-expected profit, while healthcare companies UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) results underwhelmed investors. But Netherlands-based chip equipment maker ASML posted third quarter results that surprised markets with weak bookings and lower-than-expected sales forecasts, dour news that proved contagious to the U.S. chip sector. "The U.S. stock market is so heavily weighted in tech, it’s going to drive where the overall market appears to be going," said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. "But below the surface it’s not bad news across the board." "The global story is more due to soft data," Haworth added. Energy stocks suffered the steepest percentage drop among the major S&P 500 sectors, falling 3.04% on sliding crude prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 324.60 points, or 0.75%, to 42,740.62, the S&P 500 fell 44.54 points, or 0.76%, to 5,815.31 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 187.10 points, or 1.01%, to 18,315.59. European stocks posted their largest one-day percentage drop in over two weeks, weighed by tech stocks in the wake of ASML's disappointing annual sales forecast. Meanwhile, investors remained focused on the European Central Bank's rate decision on Thursday. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 6.20 points, or 0.72%, to 850.98. The STOXX 600 index fell 0.8%, while Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 19.22 points, or 0.92%. Emerging market stocks fell 11.40 points, or 0.98%, to 1,148.66. Oil prices slid to a near two-week low, extending Monday's losses amid easing supply pressures arising from the conflict in the Middle East, amid reports Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. President Joe Biden's administration that Israel would avoid striking Iranian oil targets. Additionally, OPEC and the International Energy Agency both lowered their global demand forecasts, mostly due to weakness in China. "Sliding oil prices are disinflationary and that’s a positive for the broader economy," said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist Ingalls & Snyder in New York. "What you’re seeing now is the speculation that Middle East oil properties are going to be exempt from attack." "And falling oil prices does say something about global demand." U.S. crude tumbled 4.40% to $70.58 per barrel, while Brent fell to $74.25 per barrel, down 4.14% on the day. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields edged lower, pausing after touching a 2-1/2 month high in the wake of soft manufacturing data from the New York Federal Reserve. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 3.7 basis points to 4.036%, from 4.073% late on Friday. The 30-year bond yield fell 5.8 basis points to 4.3237% from 4.382% late on Friday. The 2-year note yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, rose 1.1 basis points to 3.952%, from 3.941% late on Friday. The dollar was nominally lower against a basket of world currencies amid wagers that the Federal Reserve will proceed with modest rate cuts in the near term. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.06% to 103.24, with the euro down 0.2% at $1.0887. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar weakened 0.37% to 149.2. Gold gained traction, lifted by lower Treasury yields. Spot gold rose 0.4% to $2,661.80 an ounce.

The new spinoff NCIS: Origins represents a major change for the long-running procedural franchise, but will the Gibbs-centric prequel return for season 2? Debuting in late 2024, NCIS: Origins concerns young Agent Leroy Gibbs (originally played by Mark Harmon and now played by Austin Stowell) as he begins his career at Camp Pendleton in 1991 under his mentor, Mike Franks (Kyle Schmid). Exploring the early days of the franchise's most beloved hero, Origins is the first spinoff of NCIS to take place earlier in the show's timeline and eschew the typical procedural format found in other off-shoots. Though NCIS has been airing since 2003, NCIS: Origins marks the first time in the franchise's history that a spinoff has tried something new. The character-driven narrative not only serves to flesh out Gibbs, but also to deliver crucial context to what comes much later in the timeline. Instead of the narrowly-focused weekly cases of NCIS and its spinoffs, Origins (and the upcoming Tony & Ziva spinoff) shows a path forward for NCIS as it continues to set TV records. All that said, NCIS: Origins season 2 isn't confirmed yet, but it could get the green light soon. Even though Leroy Jethro Gibbs was a major character on NCIS for almost 20 years, there are several stories that only NCIS: Origins can reveal. Presumably, the spinoff is intended to be an ongoing series that will span across multiple seasons, but nothing has been confirmed yet. With a lot of buzz surrounding the debut season of NCIS: Origins, it is somewhat surprising that CBS has been tight-lipped about the show's future. Presumably, the spinoff is intended to be an ongoing series that will span across multiple seasons, but nothing has been confirmed yet. As such, Origins season 2 is not confirmed, and the network is likely waiting to see how the latest franchise installment fares before they make their final decision regarding its fate. NCIS as a franchise is in an odd place in the early 2020s, and Origins isn't a sure-fire hit. Though most of the show's off-shoots have done well, recent shows like NCIS: Hawaii were less fortunate, and CBS wasn't sentimental when axing it from their slate. However, with the promise of Mark Harmon's return as Gibbs, and a more recognizable framework for the story, there's little doubt that Origins will be able to hold its own in a crowded fall schedule. With the other character-driven spinoff, Tony & Ziva, also looming, CBS needs Origins to work as proof that the future of the franchise is in specialized spinoffs. Tony & Ziva is an NCIS spinoff focusing on the eponymous characters living in Europe trying to raise their daughter. The cast of NCIS: Origins is chock-full of familiar characters, even if the actors playing them have changed since the old days of NCIS. Austin Stowell was given the daunting task of playing the younger version of Gibbs, and he has slotted into the role excellently. Since it's his origin story that lends the spinoff its title, it stands to reason that Stowell will be back in the lead role alongside the likes of Kyle Schmid as Gibbs' mentor, Agent Mike Franks. Shockingly, Mark Harmon returned to play Gibbs (largely as a narrator) in season 1, but it's unclear if the actor is looking to make it a full-time gig. Another expected return is Mariel Molino as Special Agent Lala Dominguez, and her storyline seems to be just as crucial to the plot as Gibbs'. Similarly, Tyla Abercrumbie should be back as Field Operation Support Officer Mary Jo Sullivan, and Diany Rodriguez should reprise her role as Special Agent Vera Strickland, since Strickland is an original character in NCIS. The likely cast of NCIS: Origins season 2 includes: Actor NCIS: Origins Role Austin Stowell Young Agent Gibbs Mark Harmon Older Agent Gibbs Kyle Schmid Mike Franks Mariel Molino Agent Lala Dominguez Tyla Abercrumbie Officer Mary Jo Sullivan Diany Rodriguez Agent Vera Strickland Daniel Bellomy Agent Granville "Granny" Dawson Caleb Martin Foote Agent Benjamin "Randy" Randolf Julian Black Antelope ME Kai Blackrock Patrick Fischler SAC Cliff Walker Robert Taylor Jackson Gibbs As it stands now, it's impossible to guess exactly what will happen in NCIS: Origins season 2 since the season 1 finale hasn't aired yet. Unlike the procedural series found in the rest of the franchise, Origins will likely employ overarching narratives that will grow and change from season to season. Season 1 likely won't see Gibbs learn all the crucial skills he put to good use in NCIS, and there are likely more important connections he still needs to make. Furthermore, Gibbs' emotional storyline could take on a new dimension going forward as he learns how to really deal with the grief of losing his wife and daughter to a murder. This development will likely shape Stowell's Gibbs into the stoic and sure Gibbs that viewers met in the original series, but NCIS: Origins still has a long way to go before the accomplished agent can become self-actualized. Your comment has not been saved A young Gibbs embarks on his journey as a Naval Investigative Service agent in the early 1990s. Set against the backdrop of Camp Pendleton, the series explores Gibbs' formative years, the cases that shaped him, and the mentors who guided his path, including Mike Franks.

Title: Buy Woke, Go Broke: The Failure of ESG Investing

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From THE DAILY SCEPTIC by Tilak Doshi Terrence Keeley is a long-time ESG practitioner who until recently headed the official institutions group in the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock advising sovereign wealth funds, central banks, finance ministries, and public pension funds. He claimed in 2022 that “ESG investing could well be the biggest thing in finance since the Dutch East India company issued shares in 1602…ESG’s success or failure could literally impact every living creature on Earth.” Mr. Keeley’s boss, Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, was equally hyperbolic in his annual letter to CEOs in early 2020: We believe that sustainability should be our new standard for investing…all investors – and particularly the millions of our clients who are saving for long-term goals like retirement – must seriously consider sustainability in their investments…I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance. Alas, the ESG and sustainability movement, a financial juggernaut in its heyday, has performed poorly in the past two years. This poor performance has been a result of a combination of factors including the boomeranging impact of Western sanctions on Russia energy exports, the collapse of “clean” energy stocks, the rise in interest rates, and the widespread backlash against ‘woke capitalism’ and climate change regulations in Europe and the U.S. ESG investment momentum has slowed on both sides of the Atlantic since 2022. In 2022, for the first time in more than a decade, investors pulled more money from funds marketed as “sustainable” than they added. In the first half of 2024, the U.S. ESG market experienced net outflows of over $13 billion, on the heels of a $9 billion outflow in 2023. Morningstar, a financial research firm, found nearly 2,500 fewer sustainable funds globally in 2023 relative to the prior year and 2024 is on track for an even steeper plunge. According to Torsten Lichtenau, Bain and Company’s global carbon transition practice lead, “When you look at the importance of [environmental, social and corporate-governance efforts], you can clearly see a huge peak in 2021 to 2022 where there was also a lot of action off the back of the Glasgow COP26 climate conference in 2021. Now it’s dropped back to 2019 levels.” Competitive Sustainability Enter “competitive sustainability”, a buzz phrase of choice of its most vociferous proponents. The European Commission’s 2022 Annual Sustainable Growth Survey (ASGS) presented a “competitive sustainability” agenda for the EU covering four dimensions: productivity, environment, fairness, and stability. In a word salad worthy of Brussel’s unelected bureaucrats, it describes the agenda as one where “a fair, just, green and digital transition which requires sustainable social conditions, will serve as a foundation for future prosperity and resilience. Well-designed labour market policies and social protection systems are the basis for resilience and inclusive growth.” In offering a Panglossian world where all good things go together – high productivity, environmental sustainability, fairness and stability – “competitive sustainability” is now the battle cry for the Cambridge Institute of Sustainable Leadership (CISL). It is mom’s venerable apple pie, something no reasonable person could object to. There are no difficult trade-offs to be made since “competitive sustainability” ensures both economic growth and environmental sustainability, not to mention equity and stability. In an article published in the Financial Times last month, the interim CEO of CISL Lindsay Hooper begins by saying: “The business case for sustainability is clear: companies cannot thrive on a planet suffering from cascading crises and unmanageable risks. Yet, despite decades of corporate commitments, businesses continue to damage the planet, carbon emissions to rise and fossil fuel companies to chase growth.” Ms. Hooper asserts that “It is time to confront the uncomfortable truth: ESG as it stands – grounded in disclosures and voluntary market action – will not deliver the necessary change. The solution is a radical shift towards ‘competitive sustainability’.” What does this “radical shift” entail? To deliver change, Ms. Hooper says we must “redesign” penalties and incentives which “will require a critical mass of businesses to push for government action”. Evidently, market decision-making in the context of disclosure rules and voluntary action by company executives is not enough. She finds it imperative that governments “create conditions that make it economically compelling to phase out damaging activities. Otherwise businesses that voluntarily transition will be undermined by those that don’t.” There we have it, straight from the hallowed halls of academe. Governments – presumably advised by sustainability-congruent academics – must replace markets by diktats that determine which industries are pursuing “damaging activities” and need to be proscribed, and which are not. An extreme case of governments picking winners. The familiar trope of market myopia is trotted out by Ms. Hooper: “As long as the market rewards short-term gains over long-term resilience, businesses will harm the planet, and markets will destroy the foundations on which they depend.” Evidently, Mr. Hooper seems not to be too concerned about the “short-termism” of governments bound by electoral cycles. Meanwhile, in the Real World… Firms favoured by ESG investment metrics – the “non-damaging activities” as per Ms. Hooper – such as wind and solar system providers, electric vehicle manufacturers, “green” hydrogen producers, and other such “sustainable” entities have been having a hard time after initial enthusiasm and high IPO values. The Renewable Energy Industrial Index (RENIXX) is a global stock capitalisation index of the 30 largest renewable energy industrial companies in the world including First Solar, Gamesa, Orsted, Plug Power, Solarcity, Tesla, and Vestas. Established on May 1, 2006, with an initial value of 1,000 points, the index stood at 1,013 points on September 25th, essentially registering zero value growth over the last 18 years. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index more than quadrupled over the same period. The RENIXX is down three years in a row from 2021, losing half its value. It should be noted that that this performance would have been far worse if the outperforming Tesla stock was removed from the index. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF aims to “target access to clean energy stocks around the world”. Last year its value fell by 26.1% and from its inception in 2008 it has lost about 60% of an initial investment of $10,000. Perhaps the best example of ESG-inspired debacles is provided by bp, the hitherto “woke” oil company that has used lower-case letters for its name and logo since 2000. In the high road of the climate crusade, marked by corporate brochures extolling social responsibility and environmental sustainability, the company was first among its peers. Its then-CEO John Browne – now Lord Browne – declared in a 2020 speech at Stanford University: “We need to reinvent the energy business. We need to go beyond petroleum.” According to an article in the Telegraph published on Monday, bp has abandoned its target to cut oil and gas production by 2030 “as its new chief executive scales back a switch to green energy to boost its share price”. Its new CEO Murray Auchincloss plans to focus on investments in oil and gas projects in the Middle East and the Gulf of Mexico to boost output. Quite unsurprisingly, in the real world where money matters, the company’s shares rose as much as 1.3% after the story was first reported by Reuters. Perhaps rather late in the day, the company’s senior management has decided that its fiduciary duties to maximize shareholder profits trump its devotion to “sustainability”. Them Weasel Words The question about the ethically appropriate role of business firms in societies in which they operate is as old as the business firm itself. Adam Smith, a keen observer of businesses – he authored An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations after all – was not at all uncertain in his response to this question in 1776: it is from the appeal to the self-interest of the butcher, the brewer and the baker that we expect our dinner, not to their benevolence. He had also “never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good”. Almost two centuries later, Smith’s most famous acolyte Milton Friedman was just as clear: “There is one and only one social responsibility of business – to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.” He too was distrustful of businessmen who talk of promoting desirable social ends, for they are “unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades”. In the battle of the greatest weasel words of recent years, “ESG” and “competitive sustainability”, along with their corollaries such as “energy transition” and “net zero by 2050”, surely come out at the top. It is not capitalist free markets but those that seek to replace them that threaten to destroy the foundations of modern civilization. Dr. Tilak K. Doshi is an economist, a former contributor to Forbes, and a member of the CO2 Coalition. I hedged my bets by having one small investment in a battery storage investment trust and another in a wind farm investment trust. Both have continued to pay reasonable dividends but the share price has headed relentlessly downwards… I rest my case. I made several millions over the years investing in stocks—not trading, investing. As a general rule never invest when there is dubious management (Boeing today), or when there is not a clear value proposition (battery storage and wind). Or, as Charlie Munger used to say, better to buy great companies at fair prices than fair companies at great prices. In the main, Rud, that’s my investment philosophy too but in this case I hazarded a couple of small amounts “just in case I was wrong”. I knew the risk I took and, as I said, they have been consistent dividend payers. Could be worse. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GEVO/ Blackrock’s support of ESG violates their sole legal duty as a fiduciary—maximize beneficiaries financial returns. Mr. Fink’s name says it all. Agreed. I have never figured out why some group of enterprising young attorneys has not sued the crap out of them for that. Find a little old lady that suffered diminished returns, put her in front of a Texas (for example) jury, and rake in gigantic contingency fees. I am an attorney (among other things) albeit no longer young or enterprising. Too hard to prove ESG (only) damages. As one example, damages soley from DEI personnel policies. My brother is a stock broker. As far as he can tell, putting a sympathetic little old lady on the stand and getting a judgement on her behalf doesn’t require much of that difficult stuff like evidence, etc. If they touted ESG on the basis of better returns, and failed to beat a long litany of stock market alternative benchmark returns, then I think you could make a case. If you could certify a class action, I think they would offer a crap ton of money far beyond “nuisance money”. IANAL, but that seldom stops me from discussing legal issues! 😉 Go Woke, Go Broke: A Brief Guide to ESG Investing. Go Woke, Go Broke: Snowflakes scared of rainbows throw a temper tantrum…again If you had half a brain, you would be gifted. Very nice. WEF, ESG, DEI, and AGW are designed to destroy the middle class because it is the major impediment to gathering everyone under the Marxist flag. Burn down the village to save it under their ideology. If more people don’t see this slow moving train wreck gaining momentum we’re doomed to 1984. I worked for the U.S. government for the last 10 years of my career, and had their equivalent of a 401K, the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). There are five different funds available in a TSP, four of them equities of various types, and one federal government securities. All are managed by BlackRock. Toward the end of the Obama Administration, I noted with alarm that all of my equities funds were losing money, and a lot of it. My wife, who handles all of her own investments, remarked that the funds I had (small cap and international) had some down periods recently. I told her the percentage loss my funds had, year to date, and it was the one and only time I’ve ever seen her shocked to hear anything. I put everything into the government securities fund, where it remained, not losing numerically but not keeping up anywhere near inflation, until I rolled it into an IRA this year. I wonder how many government employees, who would mostly favor ESG investing, realize how much of their net worth was flushed by BlackRock. It is good to see articles like this one by Dr Doshi that amplify the theme of “Go woke, go broke.” However, a great deal more has to be done. The Western World is in hypnotic trance from 30 years of relentless propaganda on the vital importance of “environment protection.” This “EP”, we have been told, over and over that EP must be a supreme priority; we will have eternal damnation if we tread on the delicate toes of the environment. In the real world, our environment is a tough, self-sufficient being that does quite well without the Hand of Man to help or hinder. Read Charles Darwin on the Evolution of Species. Look at fossil creatures that lived hundreds of millions of years ago, markers in a trail of evidence of survival of Life with no creature named Man existing for the vast majority of this time. It is a human conceit to think that puny latecomer Man needs to Protect the Environment. It is even more dreadful to assume that Man has the intelligence, experience or motivation to do good with home-made EP. Mankind has long had survival of self and offspring as a major driver. Nothing that Mankind has done to Protect the Environment has been a significant advance. It has been in the category of children playing in the sandpit looking for coins. The real effort of Man, survival, has recently acquired a measurement device. It is called money. Money is the big motivator, way ahead of EP. It is so far ahead that most people who claim a godly effort of EP are in reality in the game to make money. The seductive force of more money is currently causing simple-minded folk to say and do silly things, hoping for public approval and more money again for their continues noble effort. I suggest that more effort is needed by “influencers” to tell the reality story about EP instead of the propaganda story. Geoff S The only thing that ever made ESG funds attractive was the massive government subsidies – just ask Warren Buffet. All these green energy companies are doomed to fail because their businesses are fundamentally inefficient money losers. All I want is a ham sandwich and a cold beer. Well, that and a couple of other things. When individual companies go the ESG route in a large diversified mutual fund, an investor has the choice of dumping that fund and becoming less diversified or compromising. I never invested in one of the ESG-directed offerings, but did, mostly, stay with the multi-company holdings. Boeing is a prime example of a ESG failure. A big green failure. One mans loss is another mans gain. i hope they don’t fail too badly. My pension is tied up with them. And, according to friends with visibility into TBC, DEI. Have they told China about this? Money is the dominant driving force behind the Man Made Climate Change catastrophic hoax and it has been since the day of its modern inception. The creation of an idea as an asset class was the genius of a small handful of amoral men. It has happened before but in much more modest forms; South Sea Bubble, Teapot Dome, Tulip mania ; but this one is huge and has global reach. Here on WUWT we spend a lot of time and intellect discussing “the science” which is nuanced and affected by exotic statistics and great insights while the real game plays out at Davos and similar places where money and its corollary power is discussed and allocated. In centuries past the French, Russians and Chinese attempted to solve this problem but their methodology failed. Maybe Trump’s attempt will succeed maybe not, but it is worth a try. ““ESG investing could well be the biggest thing in finance since the Dutch East India company issued shares in 1602… invested in tulips ” fixed it! 🙂 And we all know how that turned out. I think they are all terrified of investor law suits for breaching their fiduciary duty as a money manager … ESG is a clear breach of that duty … Login Become a WUWT Sponsor - click here Free signup if you want to post comments (includes ads) click here “Walk toward the fire.

After reporting a record-breaking profit of $5.2 billion in the first half, Tether explores inefficiencies in credit for the commodity market. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tether Holdings, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, is looking to expand beyond the crypto industry and explore new ventures in traditional finance (TradFi), including potentially lending to commodities trading firms, Bloomberg News reported on Oct. 14, citing CEO Paolo Ardoino. People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Tether is already in discussions focused on lending US dollars to commodity traders, a sector where access to credit is critical to sustaining the flow of multimillion-dollar shipments of oil, metals, and agricultural products. Ardoino confirmed the rumors during an interview with Bloomberg but did not disclose further details about the plans or the amount the firm intends to invest in them. However, he clarified that these explorations will remain distinct from the firm’s core stablecoin business. While major players like Trafigura Group enjoy extensive access to credit lines — reportedly $77 billion from 150 institutions — smaller traders often struggle to secure funding. Tether’s alternative approach could prove attractive, as its loans are not subject to the regulatory conditions traditional lenders face, potentially speeding up transactions. According to the sources, the company is looking at ways to expand USDT’s use in mainstream commodity trades globally, leveraging the liquidity and stability it offers, the report said. Tether reported $5.2 billion in profits for the first half of 2024, most of it related to the firm’s investments in traditional assets, such as US Treasuries, totaling $97.6 billion. The firm’s exposure to US Treasuries surpasses major nation-states, including Germany, the UAE, and Australia. The firm has seen remarkable growth and maintains a dominant position in the stablecoin sector, with USDT approaching a $120 billion market capitalization, which will be a new all-time high for the stablecoin. The recent foray is the latest in Tether’s efforts to channel its significant growth into new ventures. Tether has been working on expanding to new sectors for several months now, starting with an expanded focus on artificial intelligence (AI) announced in March. A month later, in April, Tether created four new business divisions focused on data, finance, power, and education. Following that, the firm made its first investment in neuroscience less than two weeks later by acquiring a stake in the brain-computer-interface company Blackrock Neurotech. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: There are major risks, but also solutions for AI in the Global South

Co-founder of Igarapé Institute and Lecturer, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) Dr. Robert Muggah is affiliated with the Igarapé Institute, an independent think and do tank that develops research, solutions and partnerships to address public, digital and climate security challenges. Dr. Muggah is also an advisor to the United Nations, the IMF and the World Bank, and a member of the SecDev Group. Dr. Muggah is involved in developing new technologies and testing AI systems for security and governance. He also coordinated a global task force on predictive analytics in 2023 and 2024. Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) provides support as an endorsing partner of The Conversation BR. View all partners While artificial intelligence (AI) promises immense benefits, it also imposes tremendous risks. Some of them - accelerating misinformation, sophisticated cyber attacks and soaring energy consumption - have already arrived. Others, including super intelligent machines that take decisions independently of human oversight, are likely still a few years away. Although awareness about these risks is growing, there are many others that have yet to be defined. And for all the incalculable opportunities afforded by AI, especially in developing countries, it is risky business. Concerns are mounting about the ways in which the rapid adoption of AI will negatively impact societies, including in the Global South. Last year my Institute together with New America convened a Global Task Force made up of AI specialists from across the Americas, Africa, and Asia to review ways to improve AI safety and alignment. And in 2024, the task force issued a primer to practically mitigate risks and improve resilience while also closing governance and regulatory gaps between the Global North and South. One of the most significant risks the group identified is mass automation and job displacement. AI is expected to impact vast numbers of workers across sectors ranging from agriculture, manufacturing, retail to the law, medicine, finance. While new forms of employment will undoubtedly emerge, the jobs of up to 800 million people are at risk of automation by 2030, including 300 million in wealthy countries. The International Labor Organization estimates that over 56 percent of all jobs in low- and middle-income countries are at “high risk” of automation. Without safeguards in place, this could sharpen economic inequality and exclude low-skilled workers. Another risk involves deepening digital divides and sharpening inequality. The gap between those who can access advanced technologies and those who cannot is expected to widen over the coming years, leading to lower productivity, reduced economic growth, and greater social and economic inequality. This is particularly so in lower and middle-income settings already facing shortfalls in digital talent and related services. Biases and discrimination are another risk associated with AI. Advanced technologies and models designed in the US, China, and EU can perpetuate and amplify biases already present in the training data. This can lead to discriminatory outcomes in everything from credit scores to policing. It can also result in unfair exclusion from opportunities in the job market, credit and loans, and health services due to biased algorithms. The intensification of surveillance and privacy violations are also enabled by AI. The integration of AI into everything from smart cities to law enforcement can infringe on privacy, civil liberties, and human rights. This is especially so in countries with weaker democratic institutions. Indeed, authoritarian regimes are already deploying AI-enabled systems to track political opponents, suppress dissent, and target marginalized communities based on ethnic, religious, or ideological grounds. What is more, the reliance of foreign technologies and expertise also constitutes a risk in the Global South. The over-dependence on US, Chinese and European innovations can potentially reduce the incentives to build domestic tech sectors in lower-income settings. It can also degrade the bargaining power of local governments, contributing to higher costs for technology while reducing control over standards. Dependence on foreign suppliers can also result in data being more easily accessed, controlled, manipulated and exploited by foreign actors, raising concerns about privacy, property theft, and integrity of critical infrastructure. Given all these risks, what are some of the solutions being considered in the Global South? For one, there is a growing chorus for more involvement of developing country governments and experts in the formulation of global standards. This is a call echoed in a recent 2024 UN General Assembly resolution on AI inclusion and a recently agreed Digital Compact intended to overcome digital, data and innovation divides. A consensus is emerging to ensure that AI is more equitable, inclusive, and sensitive to the specific challenges of the Global South. Practically, more investment in education and vocational training is essential to prepare for coming automation and job losses. This requires developing training centers and online courses, retraining grants, job placement services, and progressive unemployment benefits as well as universal basic income (UBI) schemes. And promising examples are emerging: India’s AI for All initiative, Rwanda’s digital ambassadors, and Brazil’s Conecta program are all helping people and companies transition to the digital economy. And countries as varied as Kenya, Namibia and India are piloting UBI, though more action is needed. Public and private actors will need to dramatically scale investment in digital infrastructure to redress digital divides across the Global South. This includes expanding internet access and broadband access to the 2.6 billion people who are still not connected. Policies that promote digital hubs, equitable access to digital services and lost-cost technology programs are essential. One example of how to amplify such activities is Smart Africa Alliance’s AI for Development (AI4D) program which is building ethical AI frameworks for governance, agriculture and healthcare. Bias and discrimination can be minimized through improved guidance and standards for AI development and deployment. Countries, companies, and digital activists need to craft and enforce regulatory frameworks that mandate algorithmic transparency and regular audits. There are also major opportunities to mandate that data used to train AI systems is more diverse and representative. The Global Task Force identified close to 700 such strategies, albeit over two thirds formulated in wealthy countries suggesting that more work needs to be done to close the gap. Curbing surveillance and privacy violations requires robust data protection and privacy laws to safeguard personal information. The European Union and countries like Brazil, India, Kenya, South Africa, and Tanzania, are developing agile regulatory frameworks tailored to their specific realities. There also needs to be clear regulation governing the use of AI for surveillance to minimize invasive practices as well as public awareness campaigns together with advocacy from civil society for stronger protections. And reducing over-dependence on foreign technology providers requires investment in local AI policy and research, alongside grants and incentives for local accelerators, start-ups and labs. International partnerships and collaboration also play a key role, such as programs to skill-up law makers and civil servants led by ITU, UNESCO, UNDP- as do dedicated centers for workforce training and education provided by groups such as Google, Intel, and Microsoft. Measures to reduce AI risks must address the gaping AI governance divide between the Global North and South. This gap is expressed not just in terms of data scientists and data centers, but also in terms of regulation. A key priority involves stepping-up the participation of Global South decision-makers and experts in AI policy development, including in the G20 and OECDcontexts. Notwithstanding legitimate concerns with regulatory fragmentation, AI governance frameworks also need to be aligned with local contexts. The recently agreed AI Strategy and Digital Transformation Strategy established by the African Union offers promising signposts. The good news is that a recent UN Resolution on Inclusive AI, High-Level Panel on AI, and Global Digital Compact are charting a positive path forward. The compact calls explicitly for more inclusive AI policy development, the standing-up of an independent scientific panel on AI, and a global dialogue to anchor AI in human rights. Perhaps most important, it also recommends the launch of a global fund to support digital infrastructure and skills development. Such a fund will need to make big bets (similar to those set out in private-led initiatives such as the recent fund launched by IBM and Blackrock if it is to help close the AI governance and capabilities gap.

In other recent news, Piedmont Office Realty Trust reported strong leasing growth in the second quarter of 2024, marking the highest quarterly volume in over a decade. The increase was driven by more than 400,000 square feet of new tenant leasing and significant renewals. Despite a decrease in Core FFO per diluted share for Q2 2024, reported at $0.37 down from $0.45 in Q2 2023, the company remains optimistic about future leasing trends. In related developments, Piedmont Office Realty Trust has appointed Sherry Rexroad as the new Chief Financial Officer (CFO), effective November 8, 2024.

Additionally, the company has reported minimal damage to its Orlando properties following Hurricane Milton, underscoring the effectiveness of its management and preparedness strategies.

The company's stock is currently trading near its 52-week high, with a price that is 99.12% of its peak, confirming the article's observation. This surge is part of a broader trend, as InvestingPro data shows a substantial 109.49% price total return over the past year, slightly exceeding the 100.59% increase mentioned in the article. The company's strong momentum is further evidenced by its 55.25% price total return over the last six months.

Previous reports suggested Musk, the owner of X and Tesla, was omitted from the guest list following controversial social media comments he made regarding Britain’s summer riots, where he controversially claimed civil war was “inevitable.” In response to the snub, Musk recently said on X: “I don’t think anyone should go to the UK when they’re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts.” However, in an interview with Times Radio this morning, Kyle said: “Elon Musk has never come to any of the past investment summits that have been held under the previous government, he doesn’t tend to do these sort of events, but I stand absolutely ready to engage with him, to talk about any potential global investments he’s making – I’m not aware of any at this moment in time.” He added that “we have good engagement with some of his companies” and praised Musk for the safe landing of his booster rocket yesterday. On Sky News today, Kyle also denied that Musk was not invited because he called the prime minister “two tier Kier”. The international investment summit, taking place today, will see Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledge to slash red tape that is hindering investment in the UK. Australian infrastructure giant Macquarie is expected to announce £20bn in new investment in the UK, and total pledges from businesses at the summit could reach as high as £50bn. High profile speakers at the event include Blackrock boss Larry Fink, former Google chairman Eric Schmidt, ex-England manager Gareth Southgate, and Aviva chief Amanda Blanc.

Title: BlackRock’s Blood and Tears-Fueled Rise: How Does Infamous Vulture Fund Make Its Money?

Between 2008 and 2009, BlackRock’s assets under management climbed from $1.31 trillion to $3.35 trillion - a 250%+ boost in a single year. Surpassing the $4 trillion mark in 2014 to become the largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock more than doubled its fortune to $8.68 trillion six years later in 2020, as the Covid pandemic swept the globe. “I do believe, emotionally, those who truly believe in a capitalistic system will be flooding Ukraine with capital,” Larry Fink predicted in January 2023. “And I’m not talking about philanthropy…I’m talking about if we can rebuild Ukraine, it can be a beacon to the rest of the world of the power of capitalism,” the financier said. “What essentially is happening under the guise of attracting private investment for large-scale projects in key areas of the economy, is a transfer of state sovereignty to external corporate management of the world’s largest investment fund, headquartered in New York,” he said.

The reason, according to European asset manager CoinShares, is that they think a Republican in the White House now looks a bit more likely than before. CoinShares said in a Monday report that investors are now more concerned with who the next president will be, rather than economic data. And with polls showing narrower odds between the two candidates, the firm believes that it’s having an impact on crypto ETF investments. The Republican candidate for next month’s election, ex-President Donald Trump, has branded himself as the more crypto-friendly candidate. He told Bitcoiners he wants the asset to be produced solely in the U.S., he has a colorful history with NFT collectibles, and even is launching a DeFi project. “This trend is evident in the fact that stronger-than-expected economic data had little impact on stemming outflows, whereas the recent U.S. vice presidential debate and a subsequent shift in polling towards the Republicans, perceived as more supportive of digital assets, led to an immediate boost in inflows and prices,” the report said. The price of Bitcoin is up as a result: the biggest virtual coin is now trading for $65,642 per coin—a neary 3% seven-day rise, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin rose above the $66,000 mark earlier Monday for the first time this month. CoinShares said that investors put a total of $407 million in digital currency funds. Investors pulled money out of products giving exposure to Ethereum and short Bitcoin investment vehicles, aka funds that allow people to bet on the price of Bitcoin going down. Most of the focus last week was on Bitcoin-related investment funds, the firm said. There are funds all over the world that can give investors exposure to cryptocurrencies, but for Bitcoin, newly-approved exchange-traded funds (ETFs) trading on stock exchanges make the biggest impact. The Securities and Exchange Commission approved the funds—released by Wall Street titans such as BlackRock and Fidelity—in January. Both candidates ahead of the election have adopted a crypto-friendly outlook—but Democratic Kamala Harris was late to admit positive plans for the industry. On Monday, though, the current Vice President said that she would support “a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets so Black men who invest in and own these assets are protected.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Pink Warriors ‘Swim in Pink’ for Breast Cancer Awareness in Greystones Greystones was awash in pink as hundreds of people gathered for the third annual ‘Swim in Pink’ fundraiser yesterday morning to raise funds for breast cancer. Participants of all ages took a dip in the chilly waters of the Irish Sea adorned in pink hats, wigs and swimsuits. The event was a heartwarming display of emotions with participants cheering and hugging each other. Lucianne Hughes, organiser of the ‘Swim in Pink’, described the event as a “wave of emotions”. “It's such an exciting day. It's very emotional for a lot of people, people who are going through treatment, people who have survived, people who have lost their loved ones.” The event began four years ago in Blackrock Beach Tower, Galway, as an initiative of the National Breast Cancer Research Institute. Ms Hughes was unable to attend the Galway event and took the initiative to organise a local event in Greystones three years ago. “I kind of thought it would be myself, my friends, my family, and maybe, you know, 20 people, 30 people, and about 150 people showed up the first year,” she said. The event has grown significantly since it started, attracting over 300 participants on Sunday. “Breast cancer touches so many people that it really does affect everybody. So yes, three years on, where it's just getting bigger and bigger every year,” she added. Among the participants was Sharon Felton, who shared her personal journey with breast cancer. After undergoing 16 rounds of chemotherapy, 10 rounds of radiation, and a lumpectomy, she is now cancer-free and overjoyed to be part of the event. "I'm so happy to be here today, just with these amazing people here, and also just to acknowledge the people out there that have lost their lives, and also the people that have beat breast cancer," said Ms Felton. Other swimmers like Jennifer Kehoe and Anne Rooney, highlighted that early detection is key and shared the significance of regular breast checks. “Always go to your GP, don't be afraid to get checked. Always keep an eye. Know your own body. Keep an eye on it, get checked,” they added. As of October 14, the Swim in Pink fundraiser has successfully raised €184,154, contributing to breast cancer research.

Title: CEO of Gargantuan Pro-ESG Company Defends Big Tech Monopoly on CNBC

ESG-obsessed BlackRock CEO Larry Fink strongly opposed holding Google accountable after the biased, pro-censorship search giant was declared a “monopolist” in court. Fink went to bat for Google, Apple and Amazon in response to a question from chronically wrong CNBC host Jim Cramer on the Oct. 11 edition of Squawk on the Street. Cramer, who slavishly praised Fink throughout the segment, asked the BlackRock CEO whether the government was right to take Google to court while tussling with Amazon and Apple. The leader of a Leviathan asset manager that uses the size of its investments to pressure companies argued that Big Tech needed to stay big. “I like the U.S. position in technology, and it seems odd that we are now questioning the scale of these companies,” Fink said. “These companies actually are going to get quite a bit larger.” U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta ruled on Aug. 5 in U.S. v. Google that “Google is a monopolist and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.” Specifically, Mehta found that Google has a monopoly in “general search services” and “general search text ads.” Over 90 percent of internet searches take place on Google and its subsidiary YouTube, amounting to billions of searches a day. The Department of Justice is considering serious consequences for Google, including possibly forcing the tech giant to “divest its Chrome browser and its Android operating system.” Fink did not agree, casting support for Big Tech as somehow patriotic. “I'm not in agreement with the government,” he said. “They may have more knowledge than I do so I can’t speak about the specifics, but at the same time, we say that we … have a competitive advantage right now against China, and you know, the key is about our relative strength in technology, and it seems odd, at the same time we're becoming more and more dependent on our technologies, and we're now talking about breaking up these technology companies?” Rather than serve any patriotic purpose, Google exploits its massive power for partisan ends, several MRC Free Speech America studies have found. Google has interfered in American elections on behalf of its preferred candidates at least 41 times from 2008 through early 2024. Google buried Trump’s campaign website so far down that it did not appear on the first page of results during the Republican National Convention and ahead of the July presidential debate between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. The search giant also did this while Trump shortly after a guilty verdict following Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s politicized prosecution of him. More recently, Google has been caught burying the Trump campaign’s website beneath negative news about the former president, while pushing any news from American right-of-center publications deep down in the search results. Fink’s BlackRock, which controls trillions of assets, also abuses its power. Fink has boasted that BlackRock has been "forcing behaviors" to achieve goals on gender and race. The BlackRock CEO, who has always been a huge proponent of ESG investing, continues pushing for the world to move away from cheap and abundant energy. During an October interview with leftist billionaire Michael Bloomberg’s Bloomberg TV, Fink said that “we have to be decarbonizing,” as he discussed BlackRock’s future plans for promoting infrastructure.

Title: Data centers that power AI will soon hit limits of energy grid...
URL: https://www.semafor.com/article/10/11/2024/microsoft-azure-cto-us-data-centers-will-soon-hit-limits-of-energy-grid
Time Published: 2024-10-14T16:00:03Z

The data centers that make generative AI products like ChatGPT possible will soon reach size limits, according to Microsoft Azure Chief Technology Officer Mark Russinovich, necessitating a new method of connecting multiple data centers together for future generations of the technology. The most advanced AI models today need to be trained inside a single building where tens (and soon hundreds) of thousands of AI processors, such as Nvidiaâs H100s, can be connected so they act as one computer. But as Microsoft and its rivals compete to build the worldâs most powerful AI models, several factors, including Americaâs aging energy grid, will create a de facto cap on the size of a single data center, which soon could consume multiple gigawatts of power, equivalent to hundreds of thousands of homes. Already, some parts of the national grid are overwhelmed on hot days, when air conditioners are running full blast, forcing rolling blackouts and brownouts. Microsoft has been working furiously to help add capacity to the grid, inking a deal to reopen the Three Mile Island Nuclear power plant, launching a $30 billion fund for AI infrastructure with BlackRock and inking a $10 billion deal with Brookfield for green energy, among other projects. Overhauling the USâ energy infrastructure was a big part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which provided $3 billion in incentives for building out transmission lines, among other priorities. But companies like Microsoft canât afford to wait around for more money from Washington, on top of the time it would take to deploy those funds. Microsoft has also innovated on how GPUs are utilized to help data centers run more efficiently. Given their AI ambitions, a solution could be building data centers in multiple locations to avoid overloading any one regionâs power grid. It would be technically challenging, but it may be necessary, Russinovich told Semafor. âI think itâs inevitable, especially when you get to the kind of scale that these things are getting to,â he said. âIn some cases, that might be the only feasible way to train them is to go across data centers, or even across regions,â he said. Connecting data centers that are already pushing the limits of modern computer networking will be no small feat. Even linking two of them is a challenge, requiring fiber optic speeds that, until recently, were not possible over long distances. For this reason, Russinovich said it is likely the data centers would need to be near each other. He wasnât sure exactly when the effort would be required, but it would involve several Microsoft teams as well as OpenAI. It could be years before the effort is necessary. âI donât think weâre too far away,â he said. In this article: When the largest foundation models are trained, the computation is split up among tens or hundreds of thousands of AI processors (such as Nvidia GPUs). There are many versions of this so-called âparallelization,â but the general idea is to divvy up tasks so that each GPU is working constantly. During the process, data must travel back and forth between all the GPUs. If you imagined a large foundation model were a skyscraper and construction workers were GPUs, it would be like trying to get them all to work constantly at full speed during the entire project, while simultaneously communicating with one another so that everything got built in the correct order and followed the blueprints. Creating a perfectly synchronized system to build one massive AI model is a huge technical challenge and it often goes wrong. GPU failures (often from overheating) can ruin a training run. Even a lag in communication between GPUs could prove disastrous in training. Adding the complexity of multiple data centers spaced out geographically means there are even more things that could go wrong. Semiconductor analyst Patrick Moorhead, founder and CEO of Moor Insights and Strategy, said data centers are pushing the limits in a lot of areas. For instance, theyâve moved to more efficient liquid cooling systems, something that, before the era of massive AI data centers, was considered unnecessary. Data centers may reach a point where the cooling systems alone become the bottleneck, drawing too much power from the grid or becoming too inefficient when reaching a certain size. Chinese hyperscalers have already been experimenting with connecting multiple data centers to train AI models, Moorhead said. Those efforts, however, donât employ the most powerful AI chips, which are illegal for US companies to sell there. While connecting two data centers is challenging, some people believe training an AI model might one day be possible with smaller computers spread out all over the world. Companies like Gensyn are working on new methods of training AI models that can take advantage of essentially any kind of compute, whether from a less powerful CPU or a GPU. The idea is an exponentially more complicated version of SETI@home, an experiment that allowed anyone to use their computer to help analyze radio telescope data, in hopes of detecting extraterrestrial life. For now, training the biggest and most powerful AI models needs to be centralized, even if two or three data centers can train the same model simultaneously. But if Russinovichâs idea is a first step toward a truly distributed method of training AI models, it would be a big deal and could eventually make AI training more accessible to those who donât have billions of dollars. It would also mean AI chips, like Nvidiaâs GPUs, wouldnât be as important. You could use less advanced chips but connect more of them to get the same level of compute. Chip makers are already bending over backwards to make a single processor more powerful. Nvidiaâs Blackwell chips are really two separate ones combined. Cerebras makes one the size of a dinner plate. And TSMC is working on ways to make chips even bigger. Whatâs cool about the effort to push AI training and inference in the distributed direction is that it opens up new avenues for startups to innovate and potentially disrupt incumbents.

Aparna Prabhakar, Senior Vice President, Strategy and Sustainability, Schneider Electric. "The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there." This timeless quote from English writer L.P. Hartley serves as a poignant reminder that the past, with its valuable insights and lessons, provides context for our present actions. As we navigate the challenges and opportunities of today, it's essential to draw inspiration from the past while recognizing the need for innovative solutions tailored to our current circumstances. But there's that other turn of phrase that comes to us from Einstein: "We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them." In August 2024, I had the privilege of visiting Padua, Italy. There, I discovered a hidden gem: the Scrovegni Chapel. Standing beneath the breathtaking blue fresco painted by Giotto, a master of the Renaissance, provided an experience that stays with me. The chapel's interior is one of the artist’s masterpieces—rows of painted vignettes bathed in warm morning sunlight. The colors are so vibrant and the details so intricate that it's hard to believe they were created centuries ago. The chapel's delicate frescoes have only recently undergone extensive meticulous restoration and ongoing protection. They offer a glimpse into a bygone era. Yet, beneath the beauty of the chapel’s painted walls lies a valuable lesson for our time: the necessity of planning for a sustainable future. The chapel offers a microcosm of research into temperature and humidity levels to prevent further damage. Then, steps were taken to ensure the long-term preservation of these peerless treasures. However, protecting something priceless can be very difficult indeed. The world grapples with the consequences of climate change, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events and the depletion of natural resources. We see the reminders of the past as they become our present. And thus, it becomes imperative to adopt a similar forward-thinking approach. Every action we take, from the products we consume to the energy we use, has implications for the future. • Understand the risks. Identify how and which environmental and social factors could impact your business. By anticipating potential challenges, you can develop strategies to mitigate risks and seize opportunities. • Invest in sustainability. Allocate resources for sustainable initiatives to reduce your carbon footprint, improve energy efficiency and source sustainable materials. • Adopt a long-term perspective. Take a page out of the chapel’s book—create a five- or 10-year road map with benchmarks and continual progress evaluation. Focus not just on backward measurement but also on creating opportunities to model forward outcomes. • Engage with stakeholders. Collaborate with employees, customers, suppliers and communities to address sustainability challenges and create shared value. Work up and down the value chain to increase supplier sustainability and compliance. Help educate the marketplace at regular intervals. • Communicate your sustainability efforts. Share your goals and progress with stakeholders. Transparency can build trust and enhance your brand reputation. As corporate leaders, we have a unique opportunity to drive positive change. By prioritizing sustainability in our business practices, we can contribute to a brighter future. Here are some questions to consider: • How can we integrate sustainability into our core business strategy? Are there opportunities to develop sustainable products and services? Can sustainable factors be considered at the bill-of-materials level? • How can we reduce our carbon footprint and minimize our environmental impact? Don’t let goals exist only at the top levels—they must be built bottom up. How can we get granular in assigning targets and tracking progress? • How can we engage our employees and stakeholders in sustainability initiatives? Are there opportunities for employee education, volunteerism and community outreach? Is there a segment of our employees who will give voice to our actions? • How can we measure and report on our sustainability performance? Are we transparent about our environmental impact and progress toward our sustainability goals? Honesty is harder when operating environments are under threat. Yet, greenwashing does no one any favors. We need to continually assess and share where we are—and what we're doing about it. At my home base, Schneider Electric, we call these corporate leaders "Impact Makers." They are the innovators and visionaries who drive these principles. They ask hard questions and create sustainable solutions, driving a better future in their industries. Here are a few examples: • Hewlett Packard Enterprise has set a net zero-goal across its entire supply chain by 2040. They’re developing ambitious energy-efficient solutions such as their GreenLake platform. • Ramboll, a global engineering and consultancy firm, partnered with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and has established a target of having 70% of their suppliers set science-based targets for 2028, focused on supply chain sustainability. • As one of the world's largest asset managers, BlackRock is integrating sustainability into its investment processes and its own carbon footprint. They engage companies on climate resilience, electrification and clean energy innovations. The Scrovegni Chapel's story is a powerful reminder of the proactive measures we must take to ensure a sustainable future. By prioritizing sustainability in our business practices, we not only help protect our planet but also create a lasting legacy for future generations.

Title: Futures mixed before earnings-heavy week; key economic data on tap
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/futures-mixed-ahead-of-week-packed-with-earnings-economic-data-3661145

By David French (Reuters) -Wall Street ended higher on Monday, with both the S&P 500 and the Dow posting fresh record finishes, as investors bought into technology stocks ahead of a busy week packed with corporate earnings and crucial economic data. On a somewhat subdued day for trading, given bond markets were shut due to the federal holiday, just 9.55 billion shares changed hands, versus the 12.05 billion shares, which moved on average over the last 20 trading days. However, there was enough upward momentum carried over from Friday, when major banks kicked off the third-quarter corporate earnings season on a positive note, to send the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 43,000 points for the first time. With 41 S&P 500 companies expected to report results this week, this flood of new data points from corporate America will help investors assess the health of the U.S. economy, and whether companies can continue to justify stretched stock market valuations. Before then though, it was technology stocks, which helped drive markets higher on Monday with semiconductors particularly in vogue. An index of semiconductor companies jumped 1.8% to a more than two-month high, aided by the 6.8% advance by Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), as well as market heavyweight Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which rose 2.4% to a record close. The information technology index was a leading gainer among the S&P 500 sectors, rising 1.4%. Among other growth stocks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all advanced between 0.6% and 1.6%. The S&P 500 gained 44.82 points, or 0.77%, to 5,859.85 points, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 159.75 points, or 0.87%, to 18,502.69. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 201.36 points, or 0.47%, to 43,065.22. Despite the Dow's positive milestone, its gains on Monday were kept in check by a 2% drop in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), following a brokerage downgrade, and a 1.3% fall in Boeing (NYSE:BA) after the planemaker flagged a larger-than-expected Q3 loss on Friday. Bank earnings may have boosted hopes that solid results could help stocks continue their strong 2024 run. However, with stock valuations stretched - the S&P 500 is trading at 21.8 times forward earnings, versus a long-term average of 15.7 - companies might struggle to satisfy investors. Year-over-year third-quarter earnings growth for the S&P 500 is estimated at 4.9%, according to data compiled by LSEG on Friday. "If you think about the earnings backdrop going into it, I would expect the bias to probably lead to the upside in this earnings cycle," said Kevin McCullough, portfolio consultant at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions. "It's not like the prior earnings cycles where you went in with a really lofty set of expectations and it was really hard for companies to deliver on that," he said, adding because the bar was now a little bit lower, it was easier for investors to see company reports in a positive light. Among those reporting numbers on Tuesday are a slew of big-name financials, including Bank of America and Citigroup, as well as healthcare giants Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). Investors will also watch for crucial economic data this week, notably the September retail sales figures, for clues on the financial health of U.S. consumers. Natixis' McCullough said consumer-related data is becoming more important for clues on Fed thinking, as the central bank switches more towards fulfilling the growth side of its mandate. The two Fed speakers on Monday both adopted cautious tones on future rate policy. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he sees modest interest-rate cuts ahead as inflation hovers near the central bank's 2% target. Speaking this afternoon, Fed Governor Christopher Waller called for "more caution" on interest-rate cuts going forward.
