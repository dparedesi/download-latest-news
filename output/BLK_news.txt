‘72! 72! 72!’ The chant rose into the cloud-covered sky as Blackrock captain Sam Bishti lifted the Leinster Schools Senior Cup after securing the school’s 72nd title at Tallaght Stadium on Monday. On the evidence of previous rounds, the two most physical schools made it to St Patrick’s Day. An early indiscretion by Blackrock offered an attacking platform which Terenure used to spring centres Alvaro Swords and Michael Kennedy. The ball was moved at speed to build momentum and Blackrock edged the kicking contest for a five-metre lineout. Hooker Harry O’Neill’s throw was grabbed by Michael Walsh to secure possession. From the back of the ensuing maul, O’Neill dotted down to give Blackrock a 5-0 lead on eight minutes. Now trailing, Terenure’s Geoff O’Sullivan and Swords led the pushback, breaking tackles to open up the ‘Rock’s defence, but without the vital support runners their efforts amounted to little. A scrum penalty in the 18th minute offered Terenure’s way into the game, outhalf Gareth Morgan striking from 30 metres to make it 5-3. The deficit reduced to two points, Terenure’s confidence in moving the ball grew, O’Sullivan providing the greatest threat. Coming under pressure, Blackrock’s indiscipline cost them when Morgan shot Terenure into the lead with a penalty in the 27th minute. With half-time approaching, Luke McNiff got a hand to a five-metre lineout, offloading to Mikey Smyth who kicked long for James Browne to gather. Jamie Coleman nudged the ball into touch to bring about the break, Terenure holding a 6-5 lead. The even nature of the contest put discipline to the fore. A hand in the ruck was all Paddy Clancy needed to recover the lead for Blackrock, nailing a penalty in front of the posts in the 42nd minute to make it 8-6. The agility of Blackrock flanker Michael O’Sullivan on the floor was good for a penalty and position inside the 22, where a forward pass was greeted with joy by Terenure supporters. But their decision to run the ball out proved costly when Artur Smykovskiy swooped for a penalty on the 40-metre line which Clancy slotted over for 11-6 in the 49th minute. Terenure, however, looked to have put themselves back ahead when Swords, playing with penalty advantage, reached for the line. But it wasn’t to be, the try chalked off for obstruction in the lead up. Instead they had to make do with another penalty from Morgan to make it a two-point game in the 53rd minute. Terenure pushed hard in possession, but when the ball went to ground Albert Lindner smartly tumbled a kick for a 50-22 to Blackrock. Terenure recovered the ball as Blackrock’s concentration slipped under pressure, but Lindner was again on hand, this time snatching an interception. The scramble defence was laudable but not squeaky clean, giving Clancy the opportunity to land a routine penalty to extend Backrock’s lead to 14-9 in the 62nd minute. A scrum penalty offered Terenure a much-needed reprieve. Clancy duly stepped up to the kicking tee on the 40-meter line but his effort, while on target, dropped short. That left Terenure with just one last chance, Swords, O’Sullivan, Ethan Balamash, Senan Gavin, captain Ben Blaney and others combining in search of a late try. Ultimately, Blackrock’s forwards held firm to keep Terenure out. Under pressure, they would not be broken. BLACKROCK: J Reddan; J Browne, J O’Sullivan, B White, A Vetjens; P Clancy, A Lindner; B Guerin, H O’Neill, S Bishti (capt); G Wall, A Smykovskiy; M Walsh, M O’Sullivan, B Walsh.

Title: Who Is Satoshi? Benjamin Wallace Goes Down the Rabbit Hole in New Book

Full Content:
Who created Bitcoin? More than 16 years ago, on Halloween Day of 2008, an entity by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto sent out the whitepaper for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system to a cypherpunk email list. Bitcoin launched shortly thereafter; it quickly spawned a global cultural movement and a multi-trillion dollar industry. Benjamin Wallace wrote a piece on the phenomenon for WIRED in November 2011, making him one of the very first mainstream journalists to ever cover the crypto space. Back then, nobody seemed to know Nakamoto’s identity, and despite robust efforts, Wallace couldn’t figure it out either. Amusingly, the author of “The Billionaire’s Vinegar: The Mystery of the World's Most Expensive Bottle of Wine” (2009) was sucked back into the enigma in 2022 after receiving persistent emails from an ex-Tesla employee who was absolutely convinced that Elon Musk was Nakamoto all along. Wallace stays clear of that particular theory, but he lays out his own findings in “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto,” a 342-page investigation set for release on March 18.Read more: Marc Hochstein - Satoshi Nakamoto: The Mystery That (Probably) Will Never Be Solved The conclusion? Well, by the end of it, Wallace is forced to admit that he failed to solve the Nakamoto riddle once again. But his obsession yielded a thoughtful survey of Bitcoin’s history with a special emphasis on the cypherpunks whose ideas contributed to the cryptocurrency’s birth. “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto” is a perfect work for crypto veterans and beginners alike who are curious to know more about Bitcoin’s origins; in that respect, it’s comparable to Laura Shin’s “The Cryptopians: Idealism, Greed, Lies, and the Making of the First Big Cryptocurrency Craze” (2022), which focuses on Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum’s early days. Wallace shuffles through a long list of suspects throughout the book. His favourites include Hal Finney, the recipient of the first-ever bitcoin transaction; Nick Szabo, who designed a digital currency in the 1990s called “bit gold”; Len Sassaman, one of the main developers and operators of the Mixmaster remailer; the relatively obscure cypherpunk James A. Donald; and longtime Bitcoin critic Ben Laurie. One of the things that makes “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto” a fun read is that you can watch Wallace slowly go insane as he bounces back and forth between these names. Each time he narrows it down to one person, a new piece of information rolls in and detonates his theory. Wallace deserves credit for his multi-faceted approach to the affair. He makes abundant use of stylometry for Nakamoto’s emails and code, deeply investigates circumstantial evidence, interviews almost all of the potential candidates, and even learns to code to get a better grasp of what the cypherpunks are talking about. Looming over the investigation, of course, is the debate over whether Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity even matters in the first place. There has been renewed interest in the question lately, between HBO’s “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery” documentary (which came out last fall) and VanEck’s head of digital assets Matthew Sigel stating in February that he believed Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey created Bitcoin. As Wallace notes, Nakamoto’s identity is one of the great secrets of the 21st century. With Wall Street and the White House beginning to fully embrace the crypto sector, there is perhaps a feeling that putting a face on Bitcoin’s inventor is necessary to make the digital asset a little cleaner and safer to integrate into the global financial system. Nakamoto’s identity is crucial because its discovery would impact the way people see Bitcoin, Wallace argues. Crypto folks, he says, prefer to think of Satoshi as a kind of promethean figure that unleashed Bitcoin as a gift to mankind before disappearing for the greater good. But what if Nakamoto was an outright criminal like former cartel boss Paul Le Roux who simply cannot access his private keys because he’s behind bars? Would BlackRock and Fidelity still race to recommend exposure to the cryptocurrency to their clients? Wallace eventually sort of settles on the idea that Hal Finney probably took part in Bitcoin’s creation, but that he likely wasn’t working alone, and that in any case any theory is almost impossible to verify without Nakamoto providing irrevocable proof. But “The Mysterious Mr. Nakamoto” is crafted intelligently and the lack of resolution does not feel anti-climactic. At the end of the day, it’s all about the chase. “What could we possibly learn from Nakomoto’s biography?” Wallace muses at some point, after a friend of his suggests the story would be better without an answer. “That he was a random professor who’d had a lucky brainstorm? No, what was most interesting about Nakamoto was his absence. He was defined by what we didn’t know about him.” Tom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America. He has a bachelor's degree in English literature from McGill University, and can usually be found in Costa Rica. He holds BTC above CoinDesk's disclosure threshold of $1,000. About Contact

Title: Home of The Best Meme Coins, Solana, Turns Five

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Solana celebrated its 5th birthday yesterday. In honour of the occasion, we decided to take a look at this blockchain’s journey to becoming a leading platform and the home of the best meme coins. Solana was launched on March 16, 2020, by Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko and Solana co-founder Raj Gokal and his team. That was right around the time the entire world was forced into lockdown by the COVID-19 pandemic. Some 408B transactions and close to $1T in trading on DEXs later, today Solana is second only to Ethereum in terms of total value locked, at $6.85B. Solana was designed to address the scalability issues that plagued the likes of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. And, over the past five years, it has been widely adopted in areas such as DeFi, NFTs, gaming, Web3 applications, and – of course – as the launchpad for some of the best meme coins. The high-speed, low-cost Layer 1 blockchain has had its fair share of ups and downs over the past five years. At the peak of the 2020–2021 bull run, Solana’s market cap surged to $77.8B. However, it plummeted by a massive 96% in late 2022. The Solana price fell to $8.30, and its market cap bottomed out at around $3B. Yet, Solana has proven quite the comeback kid, thanks in large part to the meme coin craze. Last year, the meme coin market exploded, and its collective market cap grew by 330%, according to CEX.io. Solana’s impressive speed (up to 65K transactions per second), low costs, strong community, and developer-friendly environment have made it the go-to blockchain for the best altcoins, giving it a considerable edge over competitors. As Solana celebrates its 5th birthday, it seems good things are in store for this blockchain. For one, US President Donald Trump recently announced $SOL will be included in the country’s proposed strategic reserve. Institutional players are acknowledging Solana’s strong position – with the likes of asset manager BlackRock on the brink of launching $SOL spot ETFs. Solana also has two protocol upgrades in the pipeline. The first, SIMD 0123, proposes a system whereby Solana’s priority fees go to validator stakers. This should boost staking rewards, block off-chain transactions, and improve on-chain processing. SIMD 0228, meanwhile, is a proposal to change how new $SOL tokens are released, in a bid to make token issuance more balanced and efficient. Instead of a fixed schedule, staking rewards would adjust based on how many people are staking. Solana’s ecosystem continues to flourish in the cryptocurrency and Web3 landscape, proving that speed, efficiency, and innovation can co-exist in a decentralized world. That said, the Solana blockchain is still known for traffic congestion and failed transactions. To the rescue comes Solaxy ($SOLX), the meme coin behind the world’s first-ever Solana Layer 2 ecosystem. $SOLX aims to build on Solana’s good points (speed and low transaction costs) by boosting scalability and adding even more speed. As an Ethereum-based token, Solaxy will bridge Solana and Ethereum, meaning $SOLX holders will be able to capitalize on the strength of these two blockchain powerhouses. This is exciting news for the crypto world, and investors are taking note. The Solaxy presale has raised $26.7M since it launched in December last year. Right now, 1 $SOLX costs $0.0016666 (with 153% staking rewards). Being a presale, however, it won’t stay that low for long. If you’re interested in investing in what is potentially a game changer for Solana, the Solaxy whitepaper is a good starting point, as is the $SOLX X channel. Our guide to buying $SOLX will walk you through the steps if you decide this is the investment for you. Remember to do your own research, as we’re not financial advisers. That said, it will be exciting to see what’s in store for the Solana blockchain if the last five years are anything to go by.

Title: BlackRock CEO: Social Security Reform With Private Investment Accounts

Time Published: 2025-03-17T13:30:00Z

ByShahar Ziv ByShahar Ziv , Contributor. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink put Social Security reform in the spotlight, suggesting a controversial ... [+] change: let Americans invest part of their Social Security taxes into private accounts for retirement. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink put Social Security reform in the spotlight, suggesting a potentially controversial change: let Americans invest part of their Social Security taxes into private accounts for retirement. Speaking at BlackRock’s retirement summit, Fink argued this would allow workers to earn higher returns through the market. "The problem we have now, we have a plan called Social Security that doesn’t grow with the economy," Fink said​ as reported by Semafor, pointing out the current program’s meager bond-bound growth. Fink’s proposal centers on boosting retirees' returns by harnessing the stock market's long-term performance. Today, Social Security's trust funds invest only in special U.S. Treasury bonds with modest yields. By contrast, investing a portion in stocks could let retirement savings "grow with your country," said Fink, as reported in Semafor. .​ "If we create a plan that every American can grow with our economy, they’re going to feel more attached to our economy," Fink added, suggesting that owning a stake in real assets would make workers more optimistic about their golden years than relying solely on a government check. Crucially, Fink isn’t advocating ditching Social Security’s guaranteed benefit. He envisions personal investment accounts as a voluntary supplement to the baseline benefit, not a substitute. This nuance echoes the stance of many retirement experts and aligns with AARP, the nation’s most significant seniors’ lobby. Marie F. Smith, former president of the organization, said to The New York Times in 2004 that the group "adamantly opposes replacing any part of Social Security with individual accounts." However, she added that AARP supported incentives for people to establish personal retirement accounts in addition to Social Security. The organization’s former policy director, John Rother, echoed this view, saying, "We favor private accounts when they are in addition to Social Security, but not as a substitute." Fink's idea aligns with that philosophy – aiming to enhance retirees' overall security without undermining the safety net. The concept of privatizing Social Security isn’t new. In 2005, President George W. Bush proposed letting workers invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in personal accounts. The plan met fierce resistance. Democrats blasted it as an attempt to privatize the program, and even many Republicans got cold feet. Opposition helped wreck Bush’s second-term agenda and the proposal died in Congress. Americans were unconvinced that turning a guaranteed benefit into a market gamble was worth it. Critics warned that diverting payroll taxes to Wall Street could force benefit cuts or balloon the deficit to pay current retirees. Spooked by the risks, the public balked – and since 2005, the notion of privatizing Social Security has been essentially political poison. By floating private accounts, Fink has reopened the long-running debate about risk versus reward in retirement security. Proponents argue that Social Security’s government-run trust fund doesn’t generate enough growth. According to Investopedia, they believe investing even a portion of contributions in equities could "deliver higher benefits for participants" over time. The potential upside is higher returns and personal ownership of retirement assets that individuals control. A recent post on X by David Friedberg, CEO of Ohala, makes the case cogently. “If instead of buying treasuries, OASI [the Social Security Trust Fund] bought the S&P500 index starting in 1971 (the year the US went off the gold standard), it would have a $15.1 trillion balance today and Americans would all share ownership of ~1/3 of America’s best companies, likely supporting increased retirement benefits, lowering taxes, and reducing Federal debt levels while being the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund. Instead, OASI has a $2.7 trillion balance today and is projected to go bankrupt in 2032, as retirement benefits swell while annual returns on US treasuries held by OASI have shrunk to <3% per year recently.” Opponents counter with a clear warning: those higher returns come with higher risk. What if the market crashes at the wrong time? Social Security’s great strength is that it guarantees a lifelong benefit regardless of market conditions – a safety net that privatization could weaken. Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), a vocal defender of the program, notes that during the 2008 financial crisis, many 401(k) accounts plunged in value, yet "Social Security never missed a payment."​ To Larson and like-minded critics, exposing the bedrock of Americans' retirement to Wall Street volatility is an unacceptable gamble. They also point to the transition problem: diverting payroll taxes into private accounts leaves less money to pay current retirees, likely requiring painful benefit cuts or large federal debt in the interim. This daunting transition cost is a key reason past privatization efforts faltered. On the other hand, supporters of reform say Social Security's looming financial shortfall means all options should be considered. The program's main trust fund is projected to run out of reserves by 2033, after which it could only pay about 79% of promised benefits​. To advocates of private accounts, harnessing market growth is one way to help fill that funding gap – potentially reducing the need for big tax hikes or benefit cuts. They argue that accepting some market risk now may be preferable to an automatic 21% benefit reduction later. Despite the renewed buzz, Social Security reform that includes adding private accounts faces an uphill battle in Washington. Republican lawmakers, mindful of the 2005 backlash, have mostly avoided endorsing private-account ideas. Polls suggest the idea remains unpopular – a recent survey found that voters across party lines "overwhelmingly oppose" efforts to privatize Social Security​, according to Data For Progress. Still, Fink's high-profile advocacy shines a new spotlight on this once-taboo proposal. His stature as head of the world's largest asset manager lends weight to the conversation, and his emphasis on supplementing (not replacing) Social Security could make the concept more palatable to some. Any serious move toward private accounts would require safeguards to preserve Social Security's guaranteed benefits, and even then, it would ignite fierce debate. Lawmakers must convince a skeptical public that such a reform won't jeopardize the checks seniors rely on. For additional article on Social Security reform and current events:

This marks the fifth consecutive week of capital flight, bringing total outflows to $6.4 billion—an all-time high. As a result, year-to-date inflows for the sector have now dropped to $912 million. James Butterfill, CoinShares’ Head of Research, highlighted that the market has endured 17 consecutive days of outflows—the longest streak recorded since data tracking of global crypto ETPs began in 2015. According to him, the prolonged downturn has caused total assets under management (AuM) to shrink by $48 billion to $133 billion. Investors in the United States led the exodus, accounting for 93% of the total outflows last week, with $1.16 billion leaving the market. The heavy outflows can be linked to the fact that US spot Bitcoin ETF providers, including BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, and Ark 21Shares, saw outflows of $401 million, $134 million, $317 million, and $68 million, respectively. This resulted in Bitcoin-related investment products recording $978 million in outflows, bringing their five-week flows to a negative $5.4 billion. Short-Bitcoin positions also saw sell-offs, with investors withdrawing $3.6 million amid Bitcoin’s sideways price action. Meanwhile, Ethereum and Solana investment products experienced outflows of $175 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Blockchain equity funds also suffered, with $40 million exiting the sector. Butterfill pointed out that Binance faced a near-total wipeout of its AuM after a seed investor’s departure, leaving only $15 million under management. XRP stood out as a rare bright spot, attracting $1.8 million in fresh inflows last week. This brought its monthly total to $7.4 million, ranking it second only to Solana, which led with $14.2 million in inflows. For the year, XRP remains one of the best-performing assets, with $212 million in inflows—trailing only Bitcoin’s $612 million and Ethereum’s $412 million. The rising demand has driven XRP investment products to a record high of $1.2 billion in total assets under management. Several market factors have fueled this momentum. The long-running legal dispute between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be approaching a resolution, with both parties reportedly working toward a settlement. At the same time, reports also suggest that the SEC may consider classifying the digital asset as a commodity, which could boost the likelihood of approving an XRP-focused spot ETF product.

Title: The Great Un-Wokening Meets the Campus Resistance

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/17/2025 5:32:13 AM PDT by karpov Many of America’s large corporations are beating a retreat from their former commitments to saving the planet from catastrophic climate change. They are also reassessing their earnest allegiance to DEI policies. Indeed, the whole apparatus of ESG (“environmental, social, and governance”) policies in the for-profit sector now looks a bit like the Pacific Palisades after the fire. Not just climate and race stuff, but other progressive causes, including “gender diversity” and “aspirational hiring,” are facing early retirement. The list of companies that are participating in what might be called the Great Un-Wokening is impressively long and, in its way, diverse. State Street (asset management), Warner Bros. (mediocre movies), Paramount (“A Mountain of Entertainment”), Goldman Sachs (investing in everything), BlackRock (ditto), Citigroup (more of the same), Pepsi and Coca-Cola (carbonated beverages), Google (advertisement emporium) and Disney (worse-than-mediocre movies and overpriced theme parks) stand out, but the list is much longer. Exactly why an epidemic of sanity has broken out in the corporate world is a topic for wiser heads than mine. It could be that these companies are tired of squandering money on silly ideological crusades, or it could be a collective reawakening to the wisdom of Adam Smith. Great shifts in the capital spirit seldom occur without responsive echoes in the American academy. And, indeed, in the behavior of some colleges and universities, echoes of the Great Un-Wokening can be discerned. What is especially interesting, however, is how faint these echoes are. It is as if higher education wants to play along with State Street et al., but its heart isn’t really in it. (Excerpt) Read more at jamesgmartin.center ...

* CK Hutchison and sister company to report results on Thursday * State-owned media posts second critical editorial on port deal * China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office reposted commentary By Clare Jim HONG KONG, March 17 (Reuters) - Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison, which is facing pressure from Beijing authorities over a port deal with a BlackRock-led consortium, will not hold earnings conferences this week, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. CK Asset, a property developer in Hong Kong which also has interests in overseas utility assets, told Reuters on Monday it will not hold analyst and media conferences. "This is very rare for a blue-chip company not to hold an earnings conference," said an analyst briefed on the matter, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. "The company has not said anything since the port deal. The stock market could view this negatively." Both companies are due to report their 2024 financial results on Thursday. Neither provided the reasons for their decisions. While CK Hutchison confirmed it will not hold a media briefing when asked by Reuters, it did not say whether it still planned to hold an analyst briefing. They have held analyst conferences for both their semi-annual and annual results for many years as well as media briefings for their annual results. CK Hutchison said this month it had agreed to sell most of its global ports business, including assets it holds along the strategically important Panama Canal, to a group led by BlackRock. It will receive more than $19 billion in cash proceeds under the deal. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for the Panama Canal to be removed from what he says is Chinese ownership, has hailed the deal. China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) on Thursday reposted a commentary criticising the deal as a betrayal of China, sending the conglomerate's shares sharply lower the following day. The article, originally published in Hong Kong-based state-owned newspaper Ta Kung Pao, said the deal neglects national interests and shows CK Hutchison is profit-seeking. HKMAO on Saturday reposted another Ta Kung Pao editorial in which the paper criticised CK Hutchison and said Hong Kong companies must stand with China in the face of what it called "U.S. hegemony".

Title: Lowell Lenders Push to Get Better Terms as Part of Debt Deal

Time Published: 2025-03-17T10:12:24Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- The lenders to British debt collector Lowell are seeking better terms as part of a deal that would see the company extend its maturities and get fresh cash from its bondholders. The creditors exposed to a revolving credit facility want an improvement to some of the conditions put forward by the company, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the process is confidential. They include banks, but also funds Alinor Capital and Värde Partners on a sub-participation basis, some of the people said. Discussions are ongoing between the creditors, the company and bondholders who support the transaction. The company needs the backing of the revolving credit facility lenders to implement a consensual transaction, Lowell said in a statement on Jan. 24. The debt collector is backed by the private equity firm Permira. In December, Lowell reached agreement with some bondholders to extend the maturity of its notes by three years, while repaying some of them in cash and reinstating another part as payment-in-kind debt. The company was supported by investors including BlackRock Inc. and Invesco Ltd. In January it won the backing of its largest creditor, Arini Capital Management, by adding €250 million of new money to the proposal. The fresh cash will be provided by bondholders. As part of the deal, the revolving credit facility would see its maturity extended to August 2028. While the collateral package and the covenants would be improved, the deal would preserve the same pricing and other terms, according to a presentation by Lowell. Lowell had been in talks for months with its bondholders on how to address its nearing maturities with the help of advisers PJT Partners Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Spokespeople for Lowell and Alinor Capital declined to comment. Värde Partners didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The challenging backdrop for debt collectors has also prompted other overly leveraged companies to overhaul their capital structures. Intrum AB, based in Sweden, has also undergone a debt restructuring, while creditor Arrow Global took over iQera Group. --With assistance from Libby Cherry.

Title: In Pursuit of the Bitcoin God

Time Published: 2025-03-17T09:00:04Z

This article was featured in One Great Story, New York’s reading recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. If Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, was who I believed him to be, he was not going to acknowledge it. He probably wouldn’t talk to me. And seeing him was going to mean sitting on a plane for 20 hours and driving another eight. But I needed to try to have a conversation with him, and it had to be face-to-face. Nakamoto had disappeared in the spring of 2011. I learned about him that summer, when I wrote one of the first magazine feature articles about Bitcoin, the internet-based currency that operates beyond the control of a government or bank. Twelve years later, Bitcoin’s creator remained unknown and his enormous, multibillion-dollar fortune untouched. The modern history of science supplied no precedent for someone who brought a revolutionary technology into the world without taking credit, or spending a penny of the billions of dollars it earned him. Denied a flesh-and-blood human to venerate, acolytes of Bitcoin had conferred on the pseudonym the halo of legend. In 2022, Kanye West stepped from an Escalade in Beverly Hills wearing a Satoshi Nakamoto baseball hat. In Budapest, adherents unveiled the first statue of Nakamoto, a depiction in bronze of a hooded, spectral figure. A trio of libertarians bought a decommissioned cruise ship, christened it the MS Satoshi, and recruited settlers for the world’s first sovereign Bitcoin-powered society. More than one fellow technologist lobbied for Nakamoto to receive a Nobel Prize. When I first wrote about Nakamoto in 2011, I couldn’t have foreseen that more than a decade later his identity would remain a mystery. Since then, numerous attempts to unmask Nakamoto had failed, sometimes spectacularly. In 2014, Newsweek confidently identified the wrong guy, a California systems engineer whose real name was Dorian Nakamoto, unleashing a media siege of his house that lasted for days. Even 60 Minutes, with untold resources and a deep bench of seasoned investigative journalists, threw up its hands and declared the challenge “mission impossible.” Yet now, against all odds, I believed I had cracked it. I was nervous. This was someone who’d gone to great lengths to be unfindable. And what I’d learned about him was disturbing. He was nothing like how people had imagined Satoshi Nakamoto. He’d repeatedly described himself as dangerous. He had guns. He also owned at least four properties on two continents. I’d initially thought he was hiding out in a remote part of Hawaii’s Big Island, but now, in the summer of 2023, I’d come to believe that he lived in a small beach community on the east coast of Australia. I was fretting about all this when I met my sister for dinner. I told her my anxieties. She’d been a TV-news producer for 20 years and had been onsite in Montana with 48 Hours after the FBI raided the Unabomber’s property and arrested him. She suggested I take professional security people with me. And that I wear a bulletproof vest. And give local police a heads-up. “Thanks,” I mumbled. Later that night, she texted me: “Couldn’t sleep not sure why.” It was 4:09 a.m. “Two thoughts. Maybe doorstep him in a public place if he ever leaves the house. Also might be worth having someone video the encounter (from a safe distance) for evidence.” Eighteen months earlier, on New Year’s Eve 2021, an email had arrived in my inbox. “Subject: New information re Satoshi.” Since writing that early Bitcoin article, I’d periodically receive emails like this. Someone was always shopping a new Satoshi theory. Usually, I paid little heed to these, which tended to rekindle a fleeting hope of learning something fresh before proving unconvincing. This email had no text, but a link led to a blog post titled “I’m the SpaceX Intern Who Speculated Satoshi Is Elon Musk. There Is More to the Story.” The author, Sahil Gupta, had produced a ripple on the internet four years earlier with another post making the case that Musk was “probably” Nakamoto. Now he presented further evidence: an account of an interaction he’d had with Musk’s chief of staff, Sam Teller. It seemed slight and ambiguous, and I didn’t respond. Two days later, I received another email from the same address. This one contained a link to Gupta’s detailed case for Musk as Nakamoto. I didn’t know what to make of his arguments, which ranged from vague to highly technical. Still, I wrote back. Sahil told me that in 2015, when he was an undergraduate at Yale, he’d scored a summer internship writing inventory-management software at the SpaceX rocket factory in Hawthorne, California. Musk was in the office maybe three days a week, and Sahil would see him in the hallways. Sahil was majoring in computer science, and for a senior thesis he proposed a central-bank digital currency called fedcoin in which the U.S. improved the dollar by taking the best aspects of Bitcoin. The paper’s acknowledgments thanked “Satoshi Nakamoto for being a straight up legend.” While researching the thesis, Sahil steeped himself in cryptocurrency literature, starting with the nine-page white paper where Nakamoto first described Bitcoin. Reading the Bitcoin creator’s writing, he was struck by similarities to Musk’s language. Both spoke of “order of magnitude” reasoning and used the word bloody. Nakamoto talked about money in a conceptual way, as Musk had done when he was an executive at PayPal in the early aughts. Musk, like Nakamoto, had a history of programming in the C++ language and was knowledgeable about cryptography. Sahil began to wonder: Might the inventor of Bitcoin have been in front of us all along, hiding in the dazzle of his own celebrity? When Sahil graduated from college, he decided he wanted to work directly for Musk. After emailing Musk several times, he got a phone interview with Teller, his chief of staff. As the call with Teller drew to a close, Sahil took a chance: “Is Elon Satoshi?” “Teller didn’t say anything for 15 seconds,” Sahil told me. “Then he said, ‘Well, what can I say?’” “That was another big clue,” Sahil said. “It’s pretty clear what’s going on. Like, I surprised him. The answer I got is pretty telling.” Later that year, Sahil wrote his “Elon Musk Probably Invented Bitcoin” blog post. He argued that the Bitcoin community, which had been riven by strife over how and whether to mainstream the technology, would benefit from the return of its founder to guide it. A few cryptocurrency blogs picked up Sahil’s theory, and Bloomberg News covered it. For his part, Musk tweeted: “Not true. A friend sent me part of a [bitcoin] a few years [ago], but I don’t know where it is.” As the years passed and he connected more dots, Sahil became even more convinced that Musk was Nakamoto. He noted that Luke Nosek, a cofounder of PayPal, had once said that the company’s original goal was to develop a currency free from banks. Musk, like Nakamoto, had a history of using two spaces after a period in his writing. Musk regularly flew in and out of Van Nuys Airport, which matched up with perhaps the only security lapse Nakamoto had ever made: Early in Bitcoin’s history, an email from Nakamoto to another software developer inadvertently betrayed an IP address in north Los Angeles. Sahil learned that early Bitcoin coders had considered Satoshi “bossy”; Musk was certainly that. In late 2021, Musk had recently been named Time’s Person of the Year. SpaceX had successfully docked a capsule at the International Space Station. Musk had even tweeted playfully about dogecoin, a meme cryptocurrency (it subsequently went parabolic in price, then crashed). Sahil felt that the media might now finally be ready to accept that Nakamoto, who was now seen almost universally as a benevolent genius, and Musk were the same person. Sahil told me he was “99 percent sure” about his theory. He chalked up others’ doubts to prejudice against Musk. Okay, but Musk wasn’t humble, so why would he deny being Bitcoin’s creator? To Sahil, this was evidence of Musk’s savvy. “Unlike a company that needs marketing, Bitcoin was stronger and could grow faster, in the early days, when it had the aura of an anonymous founder.” I didn’t know if Sahil was right, but I could relate to his fixation. Bitcoin had recently hit an all-time high of nearly $70,000 for a single coin, and the market value of all bitcoins in circulation had passed $1 trillion. El Salvador had recognized bitcoin as legal tender. In 2011, it hadn’t seemed like such a big deal that no one knew who Nakamoto was. But how was it possible that even now no one knew? Six months later, I quit my job to devote myself full time to unraveling the mystery that had first beguiled me a decade earlier. On Halloween 2008, someone going by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto had posted a short write-up outlining “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system” on an obscure, moderated email list about cryptography informally known as Metzdowd. That none of its subscribers had heard of Satoshi Nakamoto didn’t strike anyone as odd. Metzdowd was frequented by people devoted to secrecy. They were used to aliases. In his write-up, Nakamoto described a new kind of money. It would run on a network of volunteers’ computers. It would use a transparent public ledger collectively maintained by the network, rather than relying on a bank’s or government’s database of debits and credits. Nakamoto included a link to a more detailed formal description that would come to be known as “the Bitcoin white paper.” A few members of the list gave Nakamoto feedback on the software he was writing, and he gamely welcomed it. “I appreciate your questions,” he told one in an email, adding, “I actually did this kind of backwards. I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.” In early January of 2009, Nakamoto released an alpha version of Bitcoin on SourceForge, then a popular site for open-source software projects, which welcome any programmers who want to take part. The first day, according to one early Bitcoiner, 127 people downloaded the Bitcoin software. A lot of the first participants were programmers who thought money was overdue for a product update. Paper bills and coins faded, wrinkled, tore, got dirty, spread germs. They were available only in fixed denominations, could be counterfeited, and were hard to move in any significant quantity. Bitcoin was durable, unforgeable, almost infinitely divisible. It might finally realize the internet commerce dream of microtransactions. You could send any amount of it anywhere instantly. Bitcoin, as a currency based on 0s and 1s in a cloud maintained by far-flung, ordinary individuals, was also immune to meddling by central powers. Unlike bars of gold, bitcoin couldn’t be seized. Unlike a bank account, it couldn’t be frozen. Unlike a national currency, it couldn’t be devalued at the whim of a central bank or subjected to capital controls by a dictator. At the heart of Nakamoto’s creation was something called the blockchain, an ever-lengthening record of all transactions (buy, sell, etc.) that had occurred in the system. Approximately every ten minutes, the latest batch of transaction records were bundled into a “block,” and the block was “chained” onto the block that had preceded it using some clever math that made it impractical for anyone to go back and tamper with the block’s contents. This record, or ledger, which in traditional finance would be maintained by an institution such as a government or bank, was maintained by a network of volunteers’ computers, each of which ran the Bitcoin software and stored constantly updating copies of the ledger. Although Bitcoin was an open-source project — an it-takes-a-village group effort — someone needed to be in charge, and for the first 20 months that was Satoshi Nakamoto. He would release code, other developers would suggest patches, and he would integrate the ones he liked. Four months after Gavin Andresen, a software developer, began contributing programming code to the Bitcoin project, his dedication and computer-science chops seemed to have won Nakamoto’s trust. First, Nakamoto gave Gavin direct access to the source code. Then, around September 2010, Nakamoto told Gavin that he was getting busy with other projects, and over the coming months he would hand over control of both the code repository on SourceForge and the project’s “alert key,” which allowed the broadcasting of urgent messages to all machines running the Bitcoin software. For an open-source project, these were the closest things to a leadership badge; at that point Gavin effectively became the project’s head developer, guiding a team of five other volunteer coders. Over the next few months, Nakamoto continued to chime in occasionally on technical questions, but Gavin’s openness chafed against his reclusive tendencies. After PayPal and Visa froze WikiLeaks’s accounts, a faction of Bitcoiners argued that the cryptocurrency could be helpful to the controversial organization. “Bring it on,” someone wrote on a forum called BitcoinTalk. Nakamoto bristled. “No,” he replied. “Don’t ‘bring it on.’ The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin … The heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.” For journalists covering Bitcoin, Gavin had become the natural person to call first. His mild, reasonable manner and willingness to use his real name made him the Bitcoin ambassador Nakamoto had never been. But Nakamoto seemed to grow uncomfortable with Gavin’s interactions with media. In late April of 2011, Nakamoto emailed Gavin: “I wish you wouldn’t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle.” This turned out to be the last time Gavin heard from Nakamoto. When I first spoke with Gavin that July, he said he hadn’t communicated with Nakamoto “in a couple months.” After Gavin told Nakamoto in an email on April 26 that he’d agreed to give a talk on Bitcoin to the crypto-curious CIA at its headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Nakamoto never responded. Around the same date, Nakamoto wrote emails to at least one other programmer who’d worked on the project. Then he went silent. He’s never been heard from again, with the possible exception of a single forum post years later that may or may not have been Nakamoto’s. Gavin and the other early Bitcoin developers agreed on a few things about Satoshi’s identity. The second place Nakamoto had announced his white paper was the website of the P2P Foundation, an idealistic nonprofit dedicated to peer-to-peer networks of all kinds. In his profile on the site, Nakamoto gave his residence as Japan. But no one believed he was Japanese. His English was flawless. He sounded British. In both the Bitcoin source code and his posts to the BitcoinTalk forum, Nakamoto favored Anglo spellings like colour and optimise. Nakamoto guarded his identity closely. When registering the domain bitcoin.org, he had done so through a masking service called anonymousspeech.com, which itself had been registered from a temporary-housing broker in Tokyo. That service gave him an email address at vistomail.com, which offered the option of manipulating the date and time an email was sent. A third email address Nakamoto used was from gmx.com, another free webmail provider. In communication, Nakamoto expressed himself with a practiced opacity. He’d answer technical questions but would ignore attempts to draw him out on personal matters. Nakamoto’s programming style was a bit dated, suggesting he might be on the older side. He used something called Hungarian notation, a convention of variable naming popular among Windows programmers in the 1990s. Gavin had the impression that the Bitcoin code had been written by a small group or even just one person. When programmers collaborate, they tend to insert regular comments in their code, telling one another what this or that block of instructions is supposed to accomplish. The Bitcoin software contained few of these. Others felt that Bitcoin worked too smoothly from the moment it launched to be the product of a single brain. And the white paper used “we,” which suggested Satoshi Nakamoto must be the catch-all for a group of people or an institution. Even before Nakamoto evaporated, he was coming to be revered. On April 16, 2011, a BitcoinTalker named Wobber pointed out how varied Nakamoto’s expertise was, and how unusual his behavior — to come up with something so innovative, not take credit for it or exploit his stature, and leave without telling anyone. Someone likened Nakamoto to Zorro or a masked David who’d aimed his slingshot at the Goliath of banks and governments. Might the name itself contain a clue? Satoshi Nakamoto, roughly translated from Japanese, could mean “central intelligence.” Perhaps this pointed to the role of spies in Bitcoin’s creation. Maybe the National Security Agency was playing a long game, launching an off-the-books financial network it could use either to pay assets in the field, anywhere in the world, or as a honeypot where adversaries would transact with a false sense of security while the spooks at Fort Meade monitored their every move. It wasn’t a totally crazy idea. The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory had birthed the Onion Router, the anonymizing software known as TOR that enabled the dark web. The FBI would later secretly create its own line of encrypted phones and a messaging service, ANOM, that were unwittingly adopted by organized criminals, resulting in more than 800 arrests. And in the summer of 1996, researchers in the Cryptology Division of the NSA’s Office of Information Security Research and Technology had internally published a paper, later made public, titled “How to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash.” You could also read Nakamoto’s name as a portmanteau of big tech-company names — SAmsung, TOSHIba, NAKAmichi, MOTOrola — so maybe a corporate cabal was behind it. Redditors pooled their deciphering skills, also finding Satoshi Nakamoto to be an anagram of, among other phrases, “Ma, I took NSA’s oath” and “So a man took a shit.” Dan Kaminsky, who’d shot to prominence as a young programmer in 2008 when he discovered a technical glitch that could have undermined the entire internet, thought Nakamoto might be a group at a bank. “I suspect Satoshi is a small team at a financial institution,” Dan told me. “I just get that feeling.” But Kaminsky added that he didn’t think that Satoshi’s identity “is that critical to what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is larger than Satoshi.” This jibed with a sentiment I’d heard voiced more than once: The whole idea of Nakamoto as an unknown pseudonymous entity who’d dematerialized was an integral part of Bitcoin’s design. At the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami, Satoshi Nakamoto was, in absentia, everywhere. The Nakamoto Stage, where the keynotes and most important panels took place, was flanked by illuminated screens featuring a rotating display of snippets from his writings. They had the Dianetics-like quality of being banal to outsiders and profound to insiders. Imagine if gold turned to lead when stolen. I’m sure that in twenty years there will either be very large Bitcoin transaction volume … or no volume. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Peter Thiel, the PayPal founder turned venture capitalist, emerged stage right and threw a wad of hundred-dollar bills into the front rows: “It’s kind of crazy that this stuff still works, you know?” Bitcoin was a warning, he said, that the fiat system was over. What stood in the way of the crypto revolution, Thiel said, were “the enemies of this movement,” among whom he enumerated Warren Buffett, JPMorganChase CEO Jamie Dimon, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Thiel told the crowd that the enemies he’d named were “extensions of the state.” Bitcoin, by contrast, wasn’t a company and had no board. “We do not know who Satoshi is,” Thiel added for emphasis. We do not know who Satoshi is. Back in 2011, he’d been the no-name coder of an experimental money that was of interest mainly to a fringe community. Ten years later, he was the mythic founder of a project with a $1 trillion market capitalization, making it the ninth-most-valuable asset in the world, just below Tesla and above Meta. Whoever Nakamoto was, he was fantastically rich. Through some clever analysis of the early blockchain, a computer scientist named Sergio Demian Lerner had estimated that, at the time, Nakamoto held some $40 billion worth of bitcoin (today the figure is much higher). Nakamoto was by far the largest holder of the currency. When the crypto exchange Coinbase went public in the spring of 2021, one of the risk factors listed in the prospectus the company filed with the SEC was the public identification of Nakamoto. It wasn’t hard to think of scenarios where who Nakamoto was — and what his motives and intentions were — might be relevant. In the Bitcoin realm, the Nakamoto mystery was coming to be seen as necessary — a feature rather than a bug. To be truly decentralized required that Bitcoin have a virgin birth. Depriving it of a human figurehead, a flawed individual with a particular identity that might be palatable to one group but not to another, gave it the best shot at being taken up en masse. And so the Nakamoto alias had come to be hallowed. While some people conjectured that the Bitcoin creator had gone to ground mainly for his own protection, lest he be prosecuted for tax evasion or physically attacked for his coin stash, the common view was that he’d acted selflessly. The most zealous Bitcoiners treated inquiries into Nakamoto’s identity as a sort of blasphemy, as if they were Scientologists being asked about Xenu. In the summer of 2022, I tacked a spreadsheet of the hundred-plus candidates who’d ever been proposed as Satoshi Nakamoto onto my office wall. Most of the leading candidates were cypherpunks whose names had been floated as possible Satoshis many times over the years. There were more obscure names from adjacent fields like math, cryptography, and economics. Some were programmers involved early on with the Bitcoin software project. Others were creators of newer cryptocurrencies. Many were just Famous Smart People: Bill Gates. Steve Jobs. Musk. For a number of years, the consensus leading candidates have generally been considered to be Nick Szabo, Adam Back, and Hal Finney. Szabo, a programmer who had advocated for decentralized money years before Bitcoin appeared, had conceived a kind of Bitcoin precursor called “Bit Gold” in the late nineties. He had the necessary technical skills, and there were superficial similarities between his writing style and Nakamoto’s. But he has always denied being Satoshi, and no definitive evidence linking him to Nakamoto or to Bitcoin’s early development has ever been produced. Adam Back’s name was mentioned in the Bitcoin white paper as the creator of another cryptocurrency precursor, Hashcash, and his email address is one of the first to have been contacted by Nakamoto. He, too, denies being Nakamoto, and his writing style matches up less closely than Szabo’s. Hal Finney, a legendary programmer and cryptographer, received the first-ever Bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto. But Finney, who also denied being Satoshi, was diagnosed with ALS in 2009, declining rapidly to the point where he was physically incapacitated. If ever Satoshi were to be unmasked, Finney is the most hoped-for candidate among Bitcoiners because of his tragic-heroic story and his general aura of kindly benevolence — and also because, being conveniently deceased (he died in 2014), he can’t create unsavory press with unsavory behavior or associations. There had always been the faction hostile to inquiry about Nakamoto’s identity. Last fall, when an HBO documentary posited that a libertarian Canadian computer programmer and crypto enthusiast named Peter Todd was the most likely candidate, the Bitcoin community reacted not just with strong skepticism about the documentary’s conclusion but with anger that such a project had even been undertaken. He has made a valuable contribution, so his wishes for anonymity should be honored. What matters is not the person but the idea, the code. But Nakamoto had plunked his gizmo in the public square, so I felt it was reasonable to inquire who’d put it there and why. I combed through the 60,000 words Satoshi Nakamoto had left behind. He wrote in a plain style, rarely opining or showing personality. Whenever I found the slightest hint of individual style, I’d add it to a list of Nakamoto-isms, which eventually included more than 200 words and phrases. Wet blanket. Sweet. Clobbering. I wrote a computer program, the Satoshitizer, which trawled through the archived writings of various suspects, scanning for Nakamoto-isms and generating tables of statistics. I could instantly rank an archive using more than a dozen criteria, including users of Nakamoto-isms, users of e-cash terminology, and discussers of software tools employed by Nakamoto. One day in late April 2023, I found myself thinking about a word I’d seen in Nakamoto’s writings: hosed. Given Nakamoto’s tendency to write in a style stripped of personality or association with any particular milieu, hosed stood out. I hadn’t recently heard the word, in its sense of screwed or wrecked, and vaguely associated it with turn-of-the-1990s surfing or fraternity lingo. I went back through my scraped archives and noted each time someone used the word. I looked at Metzdowd. In the three years leading up to October 31, 2008, when Nakamoto first announced Bitcoin there, the word had been used four times. Twice it was by the same person: James A. Donald. Though Donald hadn’t played much of a role in the public discussion of Bitcoin, he’d had a cameo in its early history as the first person on the discussion list to respond to Nakamoto. Donald’s response had been a technical criticism related to Bitcoin’s scaling potential, and after a few exchanges with Nakamoto he’d dropped out of the conversation. He was just one of many cypherpunks who’d been interested in digital money. At that point, Donald was only No. 42 on my Suspects spreadsheet, far below the consensus leading candidates and on the list at all primarily because he was a cypherpunk and libertarian who had coded in C++. But intrigued by the “hosed” coincidence, I went back and looked at the lists of rare words the Satoshitizer had compiled. I wanted to see whether Donald had used any other rare Nakamoto-isms. He had. Donald showed up as the only person on any of the two decades’ worth of lists I’d scraped who had ever used the word fencible — in the sense of stolen goods “able to be fenced.” This was a word Nakamoto had used once, in the expression non-fencible. And it appeared in a post by Donald on the cypherpunks list in October of 1998. My brain started pinging. The verb fence was common enough slang, but the adjective fencible was an oddity. A Google search turned up hardly any instances on the internet. When I queried the archives of the daily New York Times, which went back to 1857 and included more than 13 million articles, fencible, in the sense I was interested in, hadn’t appeared once. Unlike, say, trusted third party or zero-knowledge proofs, which are unexceptional in conversations among digital-cash or crypto experts, fencible and hosed weren’t words unique to cryptography or even to computer science. They were more revealing of someone’s voice. I began looking more closely at Donald. He had a slippery internet presence. Websites variously declared that he was Canadian, that he had died, and that “James A. Donald” wasn’t his real name. In his posts, he almost never revealed personal details, but a few were strewn here and there. He was Australian but had lived in Silicon Valley for many years. Like Nakamoto, he sometimes used American spellings and other times used Commonwealth spellings. Ideologically, Donald had fused a libertarianism so extreme that it was really anarcho-capitalism with a fervent conviction in the world-changing power of cryptography. “So guys, that is the plan,” he wrote in 1996. “We destroy the state through higher mathematics. We do this by replacing the current institutional mechanisms of corporations with cryptographic mechanisms. This will give more people the opportunity to evade and resist taxes.” He had a particular interest in digital money. “Eventually people will bypass the banks, directly transferring funds to each other,” he wrote in 1995. On Metzdowd, between 2006 and 2009, Donald employed more of the e-cash vocabulary Nakamoto used than any other poster. I examined Donald’s programming style. In the late 1990s, he’d promoted a piece of communications encryption software called Crypto Kong. He’d written it in C++, the language Nakamoto used for Bitcoin. Using the Wayback Machine, I found an archived copy of the source code. Crypto Kong bore other similarities to Bitcoin. Like Nakamoto, Donald had coded the software for Windows and, more esoterically, used the Hungarian notation that Nakamoto did. Like Nakamoto, Donald used sweeping lines of slashes to separate sections of code. Like Bitcoin, Crypto Kong used elliptic curve cryptography to generate private-public key pairs. I gleaned more information about Donald. He was born in 1952, so was now over 70 — fitting the profile of an older programmer that various early Bitcoin developers had noted Nakamoto’s coding style suggested. Donald wasn’t on Twitter or Facebook or LinkedIn, at least under his own name. His $2.8 million Palo Alto house was blurred on Google Street View, as was his $400,000 Austin house. This was an option you could exercise only by submitting a formal request to Google (or perhaps by working at Google, as one of Donald’s two sons had). There were no easily found photographs of him. Like Nakamoto, Donald used a privacy-focused email provider, Switzerland-based Proton Mail. He had a blog titled Jim’s Blog, untethered from his last name. He had spent, he’d told the blog’s readers, “a lot of time off the grid.” Click-click-click. The tumblers were falling into place. I now began to think about the significance of Donald’s response to Nakamoto being the first. I pictured Nakamoto in 2008: He’d just launched his work of genius into the world and … crickets. So he decided to both nudge things along (while also creating a useful misdirection) by lobbing a criticism at himself. Jim’s Blog revealed a few more clues. In the run-up to October 31, 2008, Donald had been focused on the financial crisis. His post on October 11, titled “The Cause of the Crisis,” began: “The bailout will fail.” This was notable because the London Times headline embedded in the Bitcoin Genesis block, the first block in the chain produced by Satoshi, had been “Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout.” I found further coincidences. Donald owned several pieces of property in Hawaii. On June 19, 2008, a few months before Satoshi Nakamoto began communicating with the world about his invention, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser had run an obituary for “Satoshi Nakamoto,” a veteran of World War II who’d died at 84. Could Donald have lifted the name when casting about for a pseudonym? Though “Jim” rarely mentioned any details that betrayed his identity or location, he revealed things about his beliefs in various posts. Before he was a libertarian or crypto-anarchist, he’d been a radical leftist. At age 15, he’d joined the Spartacists, a faction of Trotskyites, but “I became disillusioned with the sparts, and disillusioned by participatory democracy—and none too keen on representative democracy either.” At 17, he joined two other radical groups, the anarcho-socialists and the Maoists, “mostly because these were the two groups most hated by the trots.” Eventually he concluded that freedom lay in property rights, and he became an anarcho-capitalist. I spoke with people who’d known him when he was a graduate student in the School of Physics at the University of Sydney. Bob Hewitt, who was on the department faculty, interviewed Donald as part of the application process. Donald had come from Melbourne, and Bob recalled him as “bohemian”; asked whether he’d arranged for a place to stay in Sydney, Donald said he’d sleep under a bridge. He was “a friendly kind of guy,” Hewitt said, “just strange.” Donald never completed the Ph.D. program. Every student was supposed to give a colloquium, but “no one understood what he was saying,” Hewitt recalled. “We couldn’t say he was brilliant, but he was certainly incomprehensible when he tried to explain his paper.” Donald ended up dropping out after his dissertation, “Assumptions of the Singularity Theorems and the Rejuvenation of Universes,” was rejected.He started writing software for Apple computers, then moved to the U.S. and programmed video games for Epyx. Later, he worked at database companies. Poring over Jim’s Blog, I saw that Donald had an authoritative understanding of Bitcoin and its vulnerabilities; he clearly took a long, historical view of it as a stepping stone toward a particular future he wanted. Bitcoin, he wrote, “is a prototype that is prematurely being used as the final system.” I’d never shared the presumption, prevalent in the Bitcoin world, that Nakamoto must be a benign figure. I’d always felt that the Bitcoiners who elevated Nakamoto to semi-divine status were indulging in wishful projection: that he was selfless. That he was humble. That he had come from the future to exalt humanity. Hal Finney had made for a particularly appealing Satoshi Nakamoto because he lived up to that image. Donald did not. On his blog, Donald espoused a dark ideology called neoreaction that had beguiled certain people in Silicon Valley. Neoreactionaries believed that society had been hijacked by what they called the Cathedral — academic and media and bureaucratic elites. They disdained efforts to achieve social justice. The best way forward, they argued, was to jettison democracy and restore a monarchy. Donald’s particular flavor of neoreaction also incorporated an overtly Christian element and a generous dose of paranoia; he attributed the COVID pandemic to a Jesuit conspiracy. Along with his baroque politics, Donald produced a regular feed of racist, homophobic, and misogynist opinions and offensive language. He was so abrasive that, in 2014, even Slate Star Codex, an influential Silicon Valley blog with a history of tolerating discussion of taboo subjects like IQ science, had banned him. But on his blog, hosted on a relatively uncensorable domain in Laos, he advocated “whipping a woman on the buttocks or upper back” to keep her in line and argued that “very few rape accusations are true.” Donald had a substantial following in the red-pilled, alt-right blogosphere. If Donald was Nakamoto, wasn’t it obvious why he’d chosen a pseudonym when launching Bitcoin? He wanted his work of genius to be taken on its own terms rather than dismissed because it was his. He had hidden not because Bitcoin could be a risk to him but because he could be a risk to Bitcoin. I wondered whether there were crypto people who knew or suspected that Donald was Nakamoto. If Nakamoto were a harmless private citizen like Dorian Nakamoto, “Satoshi deserves his privacy” would be at least a reasonable position to take. If Nakamoto were a dissident living under an autocratic regime, I’d want to protect his secret too. But if Nakamoto were Donald? It would undermine the narrative of Bitcoin’s inventor as a crypto Christ who’d passed up fame and treasure for the sake of a higher good. Was it possible that some of the Satoshi-deserves-his-privacy people, recognizing that it would be a PR calamity for Bitcoin to have been invented by a far-right whackjob, were really just safeguarding the reputation of their religion and the value of their investments? In June 2020, the HashCash founder Adam Back, himself long suspected by some of being Satoshi, had tweeted: “Maybe we should get mentally prepared to disown Satoshi. Nuke the nym from orbit, just to be safe.” “Satoshi’s identity doesn’t matter,” Ray Dillinger, who along with Hal Finney had done code review for Nakamoto before Bitcoin’s launch, wrote. “The protocol is what it is. If it’s a third-world dictator, a homeless guy living under a bridge in Belize, a Bedouin working from a cell phone as she traverses Bir Tawil on a camel, or a pushcart vendor in Nairobi, the protocol is exactly the same as it would be if it were a cryptanalyst working for the NSA or someone at a ‘troll farm’ drawing a salary from the GRU, or a well-known Security researcher or Cypherpunk. ‘Satoshi’ doesn’t exist outside that protocol. Satoshi is just a hat somebody wore while they were developing it. And it doesn’t matter who was wearing the hat.” I wrote to Jim Donald asking for an interview. Several days later, to my surprise, I heard back from him. “Email discussion would be convenient,” Donald wrote, but he might be able to talk over phone or video. He’d have to let me know in a few days. Two months later, Donald still hadn’t made himself available for a live conversation. Should I travel all the way to Australia to find him in person? One thing that gave me pause about Donald as Nakamoto was that Nakamoto, in his communications, displayed a recognizable range of emotion. He could be appreciative (“Many thanks”), compassionate (“poor thing”), humble (“my apologies”), and modest (“I’m better with code than with words”). I scrolled through years of Jim’s writings, squinting for a trace of empathy or gratitude or enthusiasm, hoping to see an exclamation point, or an apology, or a moment of sympathy or fellowship. Instead, I saw only flatness. But of all the cypherpunks preoccupied with digital cash, only one had ever said they knew Satoshi’s identity. “I know who Nakamoto was,” James Donald had written in a comment on a comment on a post on Jim’s Blog, “and what his political and social goals were.” If true, this would make him the only person on record who credibly possessed this knowledge. I decided I needed to see him. Though Donald had spent most of his career in California, he clearly owned or had owned a house in Australia. Looking through real-estate assessment records for his various U.S. properties, I’d found that for a couple of years in the aughts, a house he owned in Austin was registered to him at a street address on the northeastern coast of Australia. In more recent assessments, the U.S. properties were registered to him in the same Australian town, though now only a PO box was given. I knew his wife had died in 2016, and using the Find a Grave site, I found a photograph from the Australian town’s cemetery of a plaque memorializing her. Five years later, he’d posted a small photo on his blog of what appeared to be the view from his deck: In the foreground was a small glass and a jug of what he described as homemade moonshine. In the distance was a gleaming blue sea, the horizon disrupted by a couple of small islands. I compared this view with other ocean-view images taken from the same town, and they seemed to match. I found a private investigator, Daniel Quinn, who lived within a reasonable drive of the seaside town where I suspected Donald was. I sent Quinn the house address and a 20-year-old photo of Donald I’d found on an abandoned college blog of one of his sons. A few days later, Daniel sent me a surveillance report. “The yard is in a very unkempt state with very long grass and overgrown shrubbery and trees, he’s definitely not a plant lover.” He attached a photo of James’s house and the patchy driveway it shared with two other homes. There was a lonely palm tree near the curb, and up the hill was a bungalow on stilts, set amid the overgrowth, with a deck looking out at the Coral Sea. Daniel didn’t see James that day, but several weeks later, I awoke to a message: Daniel had managed to get a photo of a man standing in the house’s doorway. He was a clear 20-years-older match to the man in the photo I’d sent. Same dense beard, though now it was white. Similar large metal-rim glasses. Same fleshy nose. Three days later, I was on a plane to Australia. There was a screen door and no doorbell, so I knocked on James’s doorframe. My mouth was dry from nerves. While I wasn’t convinced that James himself was necessarily Nakamoto, I thought he might have been part of Nakamoto. In any case, he was the sole remaining person I knew of who claimed to know who Nakamoto was. I worried about how he’d receive me. James had gone out of his way to be unfindable. Crossing his porch toward the front door, I could see Donald sitting at a computer in the living room and wearing headphones. His latest blog post, put up just a few hours earlier, was a rambling screed about how Georgians (as in the country of Georgia) don’t want “their Churches destroyed or turned into shrines of Gaia and gay sex, their old and beautiful buildings bulldozed and replaced by demonic postmodern eyesores.” Western NGOs were working to see “Georgia faggotized and thrown into the meat grinder against Russia.” When he didn’t respond to my knock on the doorframe, I knocked directly on the front door. A moment later James opened it and stepped outside in black long johns and a red camouflage long-sleeved shirt. I started talking. I’d sent him an email and — “Oh, I’m rather sporadic at reading my emails,” James said. I reminded him of our exchange the prior year and of the book I was writing. “Ah, right,” James said. I said something about how I’d have been remiss if I didn’t make every effort to speak with him. “Okay,” James said. “Well, the short of it is that I can’t even tell you what I don’t tell you.” His tone was pleasant, bemused. I pointed out that he’d publicly insisted he knew who Nakamoto was and what his social and political goals were. Could he elaborate? “No, sorry.” “Okay … Do you really know? Or do you sort of think you have a strong idea of who it might be?” “I have a very good idea of who it might be, but I don’t actually, uh, no.” “Do you think it was Hal Finney?” “I can’t answer that.” “Is that just because you’re respecting his privacy?” “I’m not allowed to tell anyone anything, and I’m not allowed to tell people what I’ve already told ’em.” Could I buy him a beer while I was in town? “Ah,” James said. “In wine there is truth. And I’m obligated not to tell people the truth.” “Lunch?” I offered. James laughed. “Look,” he said. “I have a tendency to talk too much, and I have a big tendency to talk too much after a few drinks, so I’m sorry.” I tried to keep the conversation going — giving him my contact information along with a previous book I’d written — but his answers became monosyllabic. “Well, I can understand why you’d live here,” I said, gesturing at his stunning view. “Yeah,” James said, looking down. I thanked him and made my way back down the hill. I’d spent 15 years trying to identify Satoshi. In pursuit of this quest, I’d learned to code, recruited a machine-learning expert and a stylometry specialist and a private investigator, and made a 37-hour journey for a three-minute encounter. I was pretty sure no one had spent as much time as I had in trying to solve this. I was starting to feel a kinship with Sahil Gupta, who couldn’t be persuaded that Nakamoto was anyone other than Elon Musk. At some point, I needed to stop. Perhaps someday AI will allow us to definitively identify Satoshi. But I am now convinced that, barring some unpredictable declassification of a government secret, we will likely never know beyond a reasonable doubt who he was. Memories fade. People die. There is no paternity test for Bitcoin, no way to prove who Nakamoto is unless he comes forward and demonstrates that he has the relevant private keys, or at least non-forged contemporaneous documents supporting his story. As years pass, the trail, if there was one, grows fainter. I felt some relief in accepting this. I remained dazzled by the achievement of Nakamoto’s invention — but almost equally by the perfection of his vanishing. As a utopian project, Bitcoin had never stood a chance. But as a new asset class, it has proved resilient. Its price continues to rise and fall, and rise again, reaching a new all-time high above $109,000 in January. (As of this writing, it’s at $85,000.) Fidelity now advises retail clients to allocate a small portion of their investment portfolios to cryptocurrency. The spread of blockchain technology feels inevitable. Satoshi Nakamoto was something that whoever was behind the pseudonym could never be — an idea that, without a body or a history to drag it down, would live forever.

Title: Covid Redux: The Bird Flu Scare

Time Published: 2025-03-17T04:00:00Z
Full Content:
The World Health Organization (WHO) has been sounding the alarm on a bird flu pandemic in 2025, and the plandemic — for that is what it is — is well upon us. Caused by the H5N1 virus, bird flu has been transmitted to humans, killing more than half of those infected — 460 out of 950 cases — in the past 22 years. Transmission between humans hasn’t occurred so far, but the prospects are alarming. While mutations or interaction with other viruses could certainly wreak havoc, the fear could be used — as in the 2020–21 Covid pandemic — to force people to isolate, get vaccinated, and remain under surveillance. And that is exactly what some experts fear is happening — a Covid redux, with the same playbook in operation. Only, this time, a slightly different approach is being taken. Instead of directly targeting humans, our food is the focus for the creation and mandating of ineffective vaccines. It’s a plausible scenario, considering how the authorities and the WHO have been ratcheting up the fear. In 2024, there were 81 cases of bird flu in humans, with 66 of those cases in the U.S. In 2025, so far there are three cases in the U.S., and one fatality (from Louisiana). Egg prices are skyrocketing — over $8 a dozen in some parts of the country — and more than 166 million wild and domestic fowl have died of the flu or been culled since 2022. During the last quarter alone 20 million chickens have died or been culled. Last week, Harvard Medical School put out a warning quoting Dr. Jacob Lemieux, an infectious diseases expert at Massachusetts General Hospital, as saying, “I think we are living next to a volcano, and it may erupt or it may not. But we need to prepare for the possibility of a pandemic.” But Dr. Clayton J. Baker of the Brownstone Institute, an internist and former professor of medical humanities and bioethics at the University of Rochester, believes the crisis is artificial. He says it has been created by so-called pandemic experts who are “actively seeking to perpetuate it.” Baker goes so far as to say that the bird flu virus was bioengineered for transmission across animal species and made potent to be able to infect humans. Meanwhile, technologies were developed and patented for making vaccines against this bioweapon. Baker alleges that one of the labs where reckless gain-of-function has been conducted for decades, with multiple lab leaks, is the Kawaoka bird flu lab at the University of Wisconsin. According to him, in 2022, a strategic leak of the virus was arranged — from USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, and other laboratories in the U.S. and abroad. As PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing for bird flu turns up many false positives, causing alarm, the media dials it up further, allowing globalist agents in the government to use the fear factor to force the use of vaccines in the food supply chain. “This is not conspiracy theory,” Baker writes. “This is basic pattern recognition.” He calls for shutting down and investigating the Southeast Poultry Research and Kawaoka labs. The best course for preventing a real outbreak — as opposed to an engineered one — is to stop culling the flocks and allow them to develop immunity. Dr. Peter McCullough, a cardiologist who championed alternative treatments during the Covid scare, echoes Baker’s suspicions, particularly those of a vaccine cartel at work. On February 16, he tweeted: “(The) vaccine cartel gets closer to realizing its dream of vaccinating 308 million egg-laying hens in the U.S., even though leaky vaccines are likely to result in new pathogens.” He says poultry vaccination has failed miserably in China and southeast Asia for decades because it breeds resistant strains and increases transmission to other animals. The U.S., he believes, is making the same mistake. According to McCullough, culling and the compensatory payouts to poultry farms — some $1.25 billion so far — have created a “perverse profit incentive.” Instead of stopping the spread, culling, he says, has led to the transmission of the virus to humans. He cites a New England Journal of Medicine study that found almost all human cases linked to such efforts. The connection to the agents of the Great Reset is evident. In an interview, McCullough says, GAVI, the global vaccine alliance, which is part of this bio-pharmaceutical alliance I’ve written about, said in 2021 that bird flu is the next disease X. And now the World Economic Forum (WEF), WHO, and CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness) – all have bird flu positioned as disease X. Like Baker, he alleges that the strain causing the current bird flu outbreak was gain-of-functioned. The Trump administration, first and foremost, needs to have all the gain-of-function and lab leak allegations investigated. Besides the Southeast Poultry Research and Kawaoka labs, many military laboratories need to be investigated for infiltration by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The suspicion may seem unfounded, but Col. Lawrence Sellin, an Afghanistan veteran and PhD in physiology who has worked with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), believes PLA infiltration of American medical research has been going on since the 1990s, with a steady trickle of PLA-trained scientists arriving to study or work at American universities. He alleges that the army’s Fort Detrick, Maryland, lab, where he spent four years, has long been a PLA target. He says Chinese researchers at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Maryland, have worked with the virology division of USAMRIID and Dr Anthony Fauci’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), dealing with dangerous pathogens which are part of China’s biowarfare program. These scientists, he alleges, have even received funds for collaborative research with PLA labs. The second major step the Trump administration needs to take is to disband the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR), something the president had vowed to do as a candidate in April 2024, if elected. As Baker puts it: “Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now.” The OPPR, created by Congress in 2022, advises the president on pandemics and other emergencies. On February 6, Trump nominated Col. Gerald Parker, a champion of Covid vaccines and gain-of-function research, as its director. Parker is a staunch advocate of One Health, and as someone who has spoken of strengthening the WHO, his views align with the globalist elite who are pushing for a Great Reset. Under the Biden administration, he was charged with crafting recommendations for rules governing research that could create riskier pathogens. He also headed the USAMRIID’s Fort Detrick labs, which Col. Sellin alleges has been compromised by PLA infiltration. Trump’s appointment of Col. Parker to the OPPR is at odds with both his promise to disband OPPR and to withdraw from the WHO. The third major step the Trump administration needs to take is to thwart the attempts of the vaccine lobby to profit from the bird flu scare. The risk with such vaccines is that they allow the virus to replicate in the vaccinated hosts and develop immunity, as well as to gain the ability to infect humans. Field tests of such vaccines may already have caused resistant viruses to enter the food chain. Former president Joe Biden had issued a $590 million contract to Moderna for developing a bird flu vaccine. Baker is convinced this should be cancelled, as should the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s conditional approval of a bird flu vaccine developed by Zoetis, the world’s largest producer of medication and vaccines for pets and livestock. The company, as might be expected, is linked to the usual Great Reset suspects — Pfizer, BlackRock, the Gates Foundation. Similar conditional approval is awaited on a bird flu vaccine for cattle, created by Medgene. McCullough calls the bird flu scare “a six-sigma event.” In real terms, it could devastate our food supply and cause mass starvation. With the Covid-19 conspiracy and its objectives coming to light, it’s time for us to oppose this dangerous iteration and say: “We will not comply!” Image: Free image, Pixabay license.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. A cargo ship sails through the Panama Canal next to the entrance of the Balboa Port, in Panama City, Panama, March 13, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Angus Whitley Mar 16, 2025 (Bloomberg) – Chinese authorities increased pressure on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. over its plan to sell its Panama ports stake by sharing a second newspaper commentary attacking the deal. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Saturday reposted a commentary originally published in Ta Kung Pao, saying the planned sale of the ports by the Hong Kong company had triggered deep concerns among Chinese people and questioned whether the deal was harming China and aiding evil. “Why were so many important ports transferred to ill-intentioned US forces so easily? What kind of political calculations are hidden in the so-called commercial behavior on the surface? Great entrepreneurs are never cold-blooded and speculating profit-seekers, but passionate and proud patriots!” said the opinion piece in the newspaper, a publication that tends to support Beijing’s policies. The Chinese government agency, the country’s top office on Hong Kong affairs, first indicated its displeasure over the transaction last week by sharing an earlier Ta Kung Pao commentary. That post drove CK Hutchison shares down 6.4% on Friday, their biggest decline since 2020. The conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, this month agreed to sell off the bulk of its global ports business to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc. The sale included a controlling share in ports near the Panama Canal, an apparent victory for US President Donald Trump after he had raised concerns about their ownership. The first Ta Kung Pao commentary called on companies to be careful about which “side they should stand on.” It said social media users had accused CK Hutchison of “spineless groveling” and “selling out” Chinese people. Under the agreement, CK Hutchison will sell 43 ports in 23 countries, while keeping facilities in mainland China and Hong Kong. The transaction is set to generate cash proceeds of more than $19 billion. Because the deal involves only overseas assets it is unlikely to need Beijing’s sign-off, but the recent attacks have stoked concern that China might somehow try to intervene. The fresh opinion piece lauded the “heroic actions” of Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese phone and device manufacturer that has long been targeted on national security grounds by the US and other Western nations. “Both history and reality remind entrepreneurs at the forefront of the storm that in the face of the U.S.’s bullying, only by standing firmly with the country and fighting bravely can they defend their country, win dignity and maintain their reputation,” the commentary said. Those who choose to do the opposite, it said, may “make a lot of money for a while, but in the end they will have no future and will bear history’s blame.” Calls and an email sent to CK Hutchison offices in Hong Kong went unanswered outside of office hours on Sunday. The apparent expression of disapproval by Chinese authorities underscores the balancing act facing executives whose companies get caught up in the widening China-US rivalry. CK Hutchison and sister company CK Asset Holdings Ltd. are registered in the Cayman Islands — a move carried out in 2015 as part of a group-wide restructuring. CK Hutchison accrues almost 90% of its revenue from outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. The potential purchase by BlackRock would be one of the biggest acquisitions of the year. Before the agreement, Trump argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: How Vently became San Francisco’s top event party planner
URL: https://sfstandard.com/2025/03/16/vently-event-startup-takes-over-san-francisco/
Time Published: 2025-03-16T16:18:22Z

When Nicolas Khonaysser, 26, moved back to the Bay Area after graduate school in 2024, he was thrown by how unfamiliar the city felt. He’s been in Walnut Creek since age 10, when his family relocated from France. As a teenager, he’d felt connected to the Bay’s thriving social scene. But after grad school, things felt different. “It was fragmented,” he said “You needed 10 different apps to know what was happening. And even then, you’d miss out on something cool.” He felt lonely. And he wasn’t alone. Data analysis from the Chronicle shows that 20-somethings are the largest demographic leaving San Francisco, with some citing a lack of connection as the reason. Jacob Wells, Khonaysser’s friend from Arizona State University, and some of his new connections felt similarly. Last May, they decided to take action, renting a six-bedroom house above a bar in the Excelsior. For Khonaysser and the others — five men and one woman — the house became a home, party venue, and the headquarters for their business, an events startup called Vently, which throws parties and lists events throughout the city. Khonaysser is the CEO. The goal? To help Gen Z, and everyone else, have fun again. And to make money by being Gen Z’s go-to events platform while they’re at it. The competition is stiff: Vently is up against legacy platforms like Eventbrite and Facebook Events, as well as newer players Posh, Lu.ma, and Partiful, which have collectively raised more than $50 million. Vently’s $500,000 in seed funding is comparatively pennies, but its party-forward, fun-centric brand has struck a chord with San Francisco’s dwindling 20-somethings, and the founders are hoping they can bring the city’s youthful energy back to life. Everything you need to know to start your day. When the friends moved into Vently HQ (which is also their home), they equipped it with three coffee machines, furnished the living room with cream loveseats and a 400-pound marble table, and decorated with porcelain vases tastefully printed with breasts, rehomed from a breast-milk startup that was moving out of the state. They installed a cold plunge tub on the deck, naturally, and a weights bench in the living room. To cap off the startup vibes, they hung a bedazzled purple Vently “V,” gifted from an investor, above the fireplace. They purchased an eight-seat Escalade so they could travel together. The month after they moved in, the team threw their first party. Khonaysser posted the invitation to Instagram: “Wine dinner. Eight strangers. … Dinner, drinks on us. Dm us.” Hundreds responded — nannies, tech workers, venture capitalists, local politicos — which confirmed his hunch. “People are hungry for connection,” he said. “They just need some help.” The night of the party, he donned a butler’s jacket, set the table, and waited by the door. All 12 RSVPs showed up, and from then on, “Dinner With Strangers” became a monthly event. Nowadays, it boasts a 5,000-strong waitlist. In the past year, Vently has promoted and hosted hundreds of events: Orangetheory workouts, bank raves, boat parties, a SantaCon takeover, viral “lookalike” contests. It has partnered with TechCrunch and the Golden State Warriors (“They reached out to us!,” Khonaysser said). The company has amassed 12,700 followers on Instagram and in November launched a platform where event organizers and venues can list and sell tickets, send text blasts, and manage their communities. Of course, living with cofounders — and hosting parties in the home — can put a strain on relationships. But Gargi Kand, 26, Vently’s head of growth and self-proclaimed “big sister” of the house, thrives on intensity. (Last year, she ran a marathon with no training. “Don’t recommend it,” she said. “Dislocated my knee a month later.”) Living in a party house with her colleagues has been generally low-stress, she said, noting that the guys are respectful and clean up after themselves. The only disagreements are over Khonaysser’s “pathological need” to blast the heat; the others forgive him because he makes a killer espresso martini. As for romantic entanglements, only Khonaysser is in a relationship. “If someone has girl problems, I’m the one they talk to,” Kand said. Jacob Wells, 22, who went to college with Khonaysser and is Vently’s COO, said he’s on standby if Kand needs relationship tips. “Gargi comes to me when she wants a straight-shooter opinion on her many dating problems,” he said. Vently’s evolution has led the founders to expand far beyond hosting parties: They aim to be the online platform of choice for any event in the Bay. Think Eventbrite, but with fewer fees, and for Gen Z. Andrew Wasilewski, CEO of The Faight Collective, an artist event space in the Haight, is a happy early Vently adopter. “Eventbrite’s fees are brutal,” he said. “We don’t just want random ticket buyers. We want to build a real, engaged community.” If Vently can streamline his team’s marketing and admin work from eight apps to one? “Game-changer.” The demand for a hub that centralizes local community events is real, said Nicolas Meader, a VC at Lioncrest Ventures, which backed Vently’s seed round. “The hardest time to make friends is if you move after college,” he said. “You go from having 20 friends down the street to no one, plus a ton of work responsibilities. Vently [helps] you get involved in the community.” Vently closed out January with its biggest partner event yet: the Quarter Century Tech Giga Party, a 2,500-person, five-floor conference-turned-club-night at Temple nightclub that ran from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. The team was hyped about the lineup, which included California State Treasurer Fiona Ma; VCs from Andreesen Horowitz, Sequoia, and Blackrock; and DJ sets from Twitch cofounder Justin Kan, and Arielle Zuckerberg (Mark’s sister). The night was beautifully chaotic: the layout was confusing, the acoustics made it hard to hear speakers, and attendees hadn’t been able to figure out if they should dress for a club or a conference. But there were many charming moments: the silent disco on the rainy rooftop, the hands that shot up when someone asked who’d used DeepSeek, the man in a cardboard robot costume doing the robot on the dance floor. It was a big night, but not Vently’s best party, according to some attendees, who referenced the 2025 New Year’s Eve masquerade ball, Hibernia bank rave in November, and the Halloween haunted mansion bash at a Palo Alto luxury estate. Khonaysser isn’t fazed by the growing number of well-funded event startups with which his company competes. “San Francisco is the best place to start something, the best place to party, the best place to make your mark,” he said. To drive that point home, Vently in January acquired issfback.com from an Andreessen Horowitz scout. In an odd twist, that website once redirected visitors to an October 2024 story in The Standard with the headline “SF is so back.” (We had nothing to do with it.) Now the URL takes you straight to Vently.

Title: Why Is the Trump Administration So Obsessed with Shipping Lanes?
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/03/why-is-the-trump-administration-so-focused-on-shipping-lanes.html
Time Published: 2025-03-16T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
The Trump administration’s focus with shipping lanes and maritime infrastructure has been most visible in the Western media on the Panama Canal and Greenland but is occurring elsewhere as well. Most indications are that the goal is to push back Chinese influence while cementing US naval dominance so as to be capable of enacting a global maritime blockade of China. As is often the case with Trump, he is only saying more loudly what has been US policy for some time. The US has for years worked to sabotage China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The US Marines shifted their focus to sea control capabilities as part of an effort to maintain naval dominance over China. [1] CSIS, 2018 So this is not unique to the Trump administration or simply the result of Trump’s reported interest in ships. It is US policy to encircle China, control global shipping, and have the capability to shut down maritime trade routes. Washington is now attempting to take or increase control of key global maritime chokepoints. Recently introduced legislation from a bipartisan group of senators is illustrative. Its stated aim is to monitor and counter China’s expanding control over strategic ports worldwide. There’s much attention paid to that “expanding control” by American think tanks and politicians, who throw around maps likes this: What do the numbers say? Here’s the Jamestown Foundation: While the United States dominates global maritime security, there is a huge disparity in the other direction when it comes to influence over maritime trade. Unlike the PRC, which controls around 12.6 percent of global port throughput through COSCO and CMP, the United States has no state-backed firms among the world’s leading terminal operators. In terms of global port influence, the United States would likely rank behind not only the PRC but also the United Arab Emirates (DP World), France (CMA CGM/Terminal Link), and Singapore (PSA International). Nevertheless, the US is calling it a “​​direct threat to American national security and economic interests.” More from gCaptain: The Strategic Ports Reporting Act, introduced by Senators Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Ted Budd (R-NC), and Rick Scott (R-FL), would require the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense to develop a comprehensive global mapping of ports considered vital to U.S. military, diplomatic, economic, and resource exploration interests. The legislation specifically targets efforts by the People’s Republic of China to build, buy, or control strategic maritime infrastructure around the world. That’s largely what the US is already doing. Let’s look at a few spots the US has circled as key to its goals. Panama Canal On March 4, BlackRock helped fulfill the Trump goal of “taking back” the Panama Canal when it purchased crucial berths on both sides of the waterway that sees about 6 percent of global trade passing through it. An Associated Press article reported that the sale effectively puts “the ports under American control after President Donald Trump [had] alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.” Nick Corbishley has more, including on US efforts to revive the Monroe Doctrine in order to squeeze China out of Latin America. But Panama ports accounted for only four percent of the deal value between BlackRock and Hong Kong-based CK Hutchinson. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. While it was a BlackRock-led consortium making the deal, it was largely the result of a US pressure campaign on the seller. From the WSJ: In the days before finalizing the deal, Fink held calls with Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and national security adviser Michael Waltz, ultimately garnering the administration’s blessing, according to people close to the deal. It was more than just a blessing: Behind the scenes, Hutchinson executives had grown uneasy that a hostile Trump administration could make life hard on their sprawling global conglomerate… Hutchinson executives had weighted selling these and dozens more ports before, but the timing wasn’t right. With Trump applying pressure — and Hutchinson shares trading at a substantial discount to the company’s underlying assets — that changed. …executives were surprised by Trump’s decision to revoke special trade privileges for Hong Kong, and Panama authorities had just announced an audit of Hutchinson’s contract. The story got more interesting on Thursday when Beijing, late to the party, made clear its displeasure with Hutchinson’s decision to sell to BlackRock. The website of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, the Chinese ministry in charge of the two special administrative regions, reposted a harsh criticism from the newspaper Tai Kung Pao towards the deal. What does that mean? Here’s more from Zichen Wang at Pekingnology: It is now crystal clear that Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison never coordinated with Beijing against Donald Trump’s economic coercion… The Ta Kung Pao condemnation, translated below, reveals Beijing’s concern that BlackRock, a U.S. company, will cooperate with Washington to impose additional costs on Chinese shipping or even threaten Chinese maritime trade… The condemnation didn’t ask CK Hutchison to unwind the deal but did describe the deal reached so far as “in principle.” The Hong Kong conglomerate has now been asked to reflect which side it is on – Beijing’s or Washington’s. Shortly after news broke that the US is drawing up plans to get its military on site at the Panama Canal — perhaps a way to keep the pressure on Hutchinson in case it’s thinking about trying to back out of the deal? Here’s NBC News: U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops’ seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States. The Trump administration’s goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China’s influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. It doesn’t get much clearer than that. Greenland “Greenland is growing in importance as we find ourselves in a global competition with China and in a new technological revolution with regards to warfare,” Rebecca Pincus, director of the Wilson Center’s Polar Institute and a former adviser to the U.S. Defense Department on Arctic strategy, told RFE/RL. “So, Greenland is important from a missile-defense perspective, from a space perspective, and from a global competition perspective, in which shipping and maritime sea lanes are increasingly important,” she said. For the purposes of this piece, I’ll focus just on the shipping. The US used Project Ukraine to isolate Russia from the other seven Arctic states (Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the US). Finland and Sweden are now, like the others, in NATO, and their Arctic regions are being further militarized. As a result, all Arctic states except Russia are NATO members. Greenland, as a self-governing territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, is by default part of NATO, but there has been talk about independence, and it has in the past flirted with a closer relationship to Beijing — although China has largely abandoned most of its interest in in recent years. Some background there from the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs: China has shown interest in Greenland’s mineral wealth and proximity to potential shipping routes, but in recent years its presence on the island has dwindled. In 2018, China released a white paper detailing its Arctic strategy, including its intention to build a “Polar Silk Road,” in parallel with its Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure investments in other regions. During the 2010s, Greenland courted Chinese mining companies to invest, but subsequent mining projects involving Chinese partners have stalled or failed. Pressure from the United States also helped quash Chinese bids to construct new airports and convert an abandoned Danish naval base into a research station. Though Greenland has expressed openness to working with international partners, China has not renewed its overtures. Greenland occupies a key position along two potential shipping routes through the Arctic: the Northwest Passage, along the northern coastline of North America, and the Transpolar Sea Route, through the center of the Arctic Ocean. As Arctic sea ice melts, these routes could reduce shipping times and bypass traditional chokepoints like the Suez and Panama Canals. These routes are economically unfeasible at the moment, but that’s expected to change, which means more stuff to fight over. From Antiwar: The extent of Arctic Sea Ice is now “more than two million square kilometers less than it was in the late twentieth century,” and “reductions in the amount of Arctic sea ice that survives summer melt have resulted in more newly formed ice (first-year ice) and less of the relatively thick, old ice that makes up the perennial ice cover.” Computer models suggest that by 2060, “the oldest ice will have completely disappeared and the sea ice will reach an irreversible tipping point,” suggesting that the Arctic Ocean will be “seasonally ice-free” by the end of the 21st century, which may even allow for opening of new Trans-Arctic shipping routes that completely avoid Canadian and Russian territorial claims sometime in the next century. The changes to ice cover in the Arctic are expected to increase use of the NWP and NSR for shipping, and to open more areas of the Arctic for efficient resource extraction and export thereof. South Africa We wrote last month about the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against South Africa and how it’s likely that shipping and naval base considerations are playing a large role. Just to recap: in South Africa this focus means a lot more attention for a small outpost in the Western Cape called Simon’s Town, which is home to the South African Navy’s largest base. Why would Simon’s Town help explain US pressure on South Africa? Here are Dr Frans Cronje, head of the Washington DC-based Yorktown Foundation for Freedom, and Rear Admiral Robert Higgs (Ret), who commanded the Fleet of South Africa from 2008-2010 and served as Chief of Naval Staff from 2011 to 2016 (he was also the first SA Navy officer to attend the US Naval War College), writing at Real Clear World: Simonstown’s contemporary importance is best understood as one of three points of a triangle that determines the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific. That triangle is formed by drawing a 5,000 mile line northwards from Simonstown to Djibouti on the African east coast where the Bab al-Mandab Strait narrows the gateway into the Red Sea (and the Suez Canal beyond) to just 20 miles. The balance of power around that gateway shifted in 2016 when China was granted a lease on a naval base just more than a decade after the United States had secured a similar lease. From Djibouti extend the line 8,000 miles eastward to the Solomon Islands off the east coast of Australia. The Japanese, after crippling the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, sought to occupy the islands to isolate Australia and their retaking was a key allied objective in the liberation of South-East Asia. However, in April of 2022, eight decades after the defeat of Japan, China signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands. As the islands lie east of the confines of the two major “island chains” around which John Foster Dulles’ Pacific containment strategy was conceived at the end of the Second World War the Chinese pact is the starkest challenge yet to the idea of the Pacific as “America’s lake”. Extend the line from the Solomon Islands back to Simonstown to complete the triangle and territory within sees the passage of more than half of all sea-borne global trade with the triangle’s three points determining access to the Red Sea, the South Atlantic, and the Pacific. Fight for the Red Sea On Feb. 1, President Donald Trump ordered the first airstrike of his presidency, against alleged senior Islamic State commanders in northern Somalia. That has continued: The US launched two airstrikes against Al Shabab in Somalia within a few days of each other. Not good. pic.twitter.com/4Ex3QMxqru — Dave DeCamp (@DecampDave) March 2, 2025 Why is the collapsed Horn of Africa country the recipient of so much violence from the “America First” administration? There are a few explanations. One could be found in friend of Trump Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post, which right on cue after the Feb. 1 airstrike was out with a story, “The Islamic State has regrouped in Somalia — and has global ambitions.” That would mean that the result of US counterterrorism strategy is that terrorism continues to magically spread like wildfire and that the US must bomb Somalia to smithereens in order to prevent ISIS from continuing to spread. The other explanation is that the US is in the process of increasing its presence in Somalia with an eye towards a battle over Red Sea shipping. Samar Al-Bulushi and Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim writing at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft believe this is the case: It is a clear indication of the growing geopolitical significance of the Horn of Africa, and comes at a time of mounting concerns (mostly attempts by Yemen’s Houthis to disrupt global shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza) about securing the flow of international commerce via the Red Sea. There is also the issue of China’s military base in Djibouti. The US, Germany, Japan, and Italy all had military presences in Djibouti, but it became a problem when China opened its first foreign military base there in 2017. Beijing’s stated interest — like the others — is to protect its shipping. And according to Responsbile Statecraft, “Djibouti is also important for China’s Belt and Road Initiative as a key maritime stop and a new railway line to Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa that connects the countries. China is the largest investor in Djibouti, with a total of $14.4 billion in infrastructure being built, a huge sum for an economy that is only worth $4.67 billion.” For the US, however, it is unacceptable, and Washington became more determined to do something about it when Djibouti denied the US request to use force against the Houthis targeting ships trading with Israel. The US blamed China for Djibouti’s decision. Under Trump, we’re getting a renewed focus on Somalia and Somaliland: Rather than accept Djibouti’s position, foreign policy experts have sought to escalate tensions, blaming Djibouti for being pro-Houthi and pro-China. Hoping to find a more reliable partner, many propose that the United States recognize and work with Somaliland instead. Somaliland is an unrecognized state that asserted its independence from Somalia in 1991. Close to Yemen and next Somalia, it seems Somaliland offers everything Djibouti has with no strings attached. Project 2025 recommends “the recognition of Somaliland statehood as a hedge against the U.S.’s deteriorating position in Djibouti.” Again, the Trump administration is just ramping up existing US policy. Last year, the US signed a deal with the government of Somalia to construct up to five military bases for the Somali National Army in the name of bolstering the army’s capabilities in the ongoing fight against militant groups. The bases are intended for the Danab (“Lightning”) Brigade, a U.S.-sponsored Special Ops Force that was established in 2014. The US at first funded Danab from the State Department, which contracted with private security firm Bancroft Global. More recently, funding comes from the Pentagon’s proxy war fund called the 127e program, which bypasses congressional oversight by allowing US special operations forces to use foreign military units as surrogates in counterterrorism missions. Fun stuff. Across the Gulf of Aden, escalation with Yemen is now taking place. The Houthi movement (Ansarallah) announced on Wednesday that they will resume attacks on Israeli ships over Israel’s refusal to allow into Gaza what the Western media calls “aid”: It’s not aid. It’s water. It’s electricity. It’s food. It’s medicine. It’s the stuff of life. — Eman Abdelhadi (@emanabdelhadi) March 3, 2025 And so the Trump administration is upping sanctions pressure and issuing threats to Yemen (and Iran with belief that will restrict Houthi weapons) and has redesignated Ansarallah as a “foreign terrorist organization” but is also saying that should sanctions fail to achieve their objectives, they will take military action. And so they are. Still Going After Georgia Elsewhere, the US hasn’t forgotten about Georgia. NEW! A bipartisan legislation calling for sanctions against those undermining Georgian democracy, known as the MEGOBARI ACT, has now made its way to the U.S. Senate and the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is expected to take up in a matter of days 1/3 — Alex Raufoglu (@ralakbar) March 7, 2025 What’s MEGOBARI really about? Former Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs James O’Brien was blunt in a July Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation hearing: allow the US to control the country with money pouring into media and NGOs and no China port. Here’s what he said: Two things. One is it should be clear to the governing party in Georgia that there is a path back, that having free and fair elections without violence against civil society, making whatever transparency requirements they want. This Foreign Agent Law, make it compatible with EU law rather than compatible with Russian law, and not have China develop a deep water port in Anaklia. These are steps that are really important for Georgia to take. The deep water port at Anakalia refers to China’s deal to build one there on Georgia’s Black Sea coast. So, once again US policy remains the same despite the turnover in government in Washington. China Counter Strategy Would the US really be so crazy to retry its Russia “isolation” strategy against China? That would inevitably mean a collapse of the global economy and a contest of who could withstand the pain longer. China, which is striving for autarky and would, barring future developments, have direct land connections to Russia and Central Asia for minerals, natural resources, and other needs, might not get as hurt as some like to believe. The US, meanwhile, would face product shortages — including in a defense industry reliant on China — and inflation that would make recent years seem quaint by comparison. More likely is that the bright minds in the bowels of the Blob envision a return to the China of 20 years ago when it helped enrich American oligarchs with its low-wage manufacturing but knew its place. China has other plans and has been preparing for years to withstand US containment efforts. The West’s failed attempt to collapse Russia turned out to be a major gift to China as Moscow and Beijing doubled down on their economic ties. Here’s a glimpse of the latest Beijing strategy courtesy of Kyle Chan at High Capacity: Chinese companies are racing to build factories around the world and forge new global supply chains, driven by a desire to circumvent tariffs and secure access to markets. Chinese companies have been building manufacturing plants directly in large target markets, such as the EU and Brazil. And they’ve been building plants in “connector countries” like Mexico and Vietnam that provide access to developed markets through trade agreements. Morocco, for example, has emerged as a surprisingly popular destination for Chinese investment tied to EV and battery manufacturing due to its trade agreements with both the US and the EU. While tariffs and trade relations may change over time, an expanding global production network creates more robust channels of market access for Chinese companies, particularly as local jobs become attached to Chinese factories. One might see this as the third phase of China’s development of global supply chains more generally. The first phase was about securing access to resources. The second phase—the Belt and Road Initiative—was about building the infrastructure for global production and shipping. And now the third phase is about securing access to markets. How can the US reasonably be expected to hold back this wave? It’s impossible — at least by peaceful means. That’s why China and Russia continue to insist on “strategic interdependence.” The only other option for the US, in attempting to be the lone actor that can determine global outcomes, burns the world down rather than accept others having a seat at the table. Notes [1] Background from The Forge: Aspects of the global order are being challenged by rising powers such as China, whose economic development and military evolution mean that even a superpower such as the United States can no longer assume Sea Control in contested areas. This reality manifests itself in General Berger’s guidance, where he is directs the Marine Corps to restructure in order to support Sea Control operations designed to maintain the Navy’s freedom of action. He sees a return of the Fleet Marine Force concept that was used to good effect during the Pacific Campaign of World War 2 where Marines were integrated into Navy Sea Control operations – in effect working directly for the Navy – rather than being the main effort with the Navy supporting them. Berger foreshadowed the release of a new concept – the Stand-in Forces – to support the US National Defense Strategy and the US Navy’s Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) concept. The Stand-In Forces are designed to generate “technically disruptive, tactical stand-in engagements that confront aggressor naval forces with an array of low signature, affordable and risk-worthy platforms and payloads”. Thanks for the summer upper. Since Trump wants to time machine back to the McKinley era it would hardly be surprising that his admin is trying to revive Mahan and the sea power controls the world theory. But now that ships are increasingly vulnerable to attacks from above and below is that even possible? And when it comes to the Arctic the time frame suggests that Trump and his minions will be obsolete long before any of this becomes relevant. “Computer models suggest that by 2060, “the oldest ice will have completely disappeared and the sea ice will reach an irreversible tipping point,” suggesting that the Arctic Ocean will be “seasonally ice-free” by the end of the 21st century, which may even allow for opening of new Trans-Arctic shipping routes that completely avoid Canadian and Russian territorial claims sometime in the next century. The changes to ice cover in the Arctic are expected to increase use of the NWP and NSR for shipping, and to open more areas of the Arctic for efficient resource extraction and export thereof.” So is it all signal or is it just noise so the flighty Trump can pretend he actually has a foreign policy suited to the 21st century instead of he 19th? Here’s agreeing with Larry Johnson in Links that Trump needs to concentrate on that Peace Prize and detente–an achievable goal–rather than trying to be the new Teddy Roosevelt. new Trans-Arctic shipping routes that completely avoid Canadian and Russian territorial claims sometime in the next century. Presumably this is a factor in Trump’s drive to annex Canada and Greenland. The Northwest Passage becomes entirely within US territorial waters. Looking at that map showing Greenland, I’m going to guess that Trump sooner or later will be saying how the US needs Iceland too because of its strategic significance. The 390,000 people living there cannot be allowed to get in the way of Trump’s idea of security. Sorry, not sorry. Regardless. I can see a flaw with this plan for domination of the world’s shipping lanes by the US and that is the US Navy. They are not up to it. They are overstretched and undermanned with their ships falling behind in maintenance. Their actual numbers are going down and not much thought seems to be going into the vital support ships that the US Navy needs. The Navy is continuously being given new missions and the Admirals just say ‘Yessir’ and work out how they can try to do it. And now here you are talking about patrol squadrons for Panama, the Galapagos islands, Greenland, Somalia and god knows where else. Where will the ships come from. What about the people to man them. How is the logistics of it all going to work? You try to control everything and in the end you control nothing. And Navies are not cheap. Some may scoff at the PMC complaining about eviction from obscure or not so obscure study projects, but how much more wasteful and less employment friendly is the Pentagon, with its many golf courses and fixation on aircraft carriers and reliving the Battle of Midway? Musk has at least been somewhat consistent in calling the F35 “junk” but we are still waiting for that promised drawdown of military spending. If Trump takes a far too familiar blob direction and declares us at “war” with his critics therefore traitors then the Pentagon will of course never be touched, if anyone was expecting that. It is a bewildering time–and has been for years. I was wondering the same, what good is all this naval manoeuvring if you don’t have the ships, and the US definitely doesn’t have the ships, not even a merchant marine, really. And no capacity to build them, either. Nor the materials to build them, now that Trump is waging tariff warfare. Also, it seems to me that Greenland was of much more strategic significance in the cold war when the “GIUK Gap” was a thing and submarine launched nuclear missiles were considered the biggest threat. Greenland, Iceland and the UK have all cooperated with NATO against this threat, so what does acquiring Greenland add to the equation which already established NATO cooperation does not? And does this mean Trump is going after Iceland and the UK next? And anyway, isn’t the sub threat now obsoleted with Oreshnik? Is the idea that the US just plans to blow all container and tanker shipping out of the water, is putting ASuW missile bases within range of all commercial shipping as part of what is expected to be a final big showdown? Oreshnik is not a strategic silver bullet, in spite of all the hype. It in particular is a medium range IRBM with manoeuvring kinetic RVs replacing the nuclear warheads. That’s it. In principle, there’s a very short step to doing the same with long range ICBMs, except then you’re stepping closer to the risk of inviting a massive counterstrike when you launch it because there is no way to tell on launch if there is a nuke in the nose or not, so any and all ICBM launches will be assumed to be nukes (and trigger the counterstrike – use it or lose it). The reason Oresnik is a game changer is mainly European – it tells the decision makers in Paris, Berlin and London “we can hit you and not destroy your city” (and/or their military bases), so it dramatically increases the range of Russian NON-nuclear capabilities with absolutely nothing to counter it on the other side. Like Sarmat and Avangard? They already have the same capability with their ICBMs… Re when I said ‘The Navy is continuously being given new missions and the Admirals just say ‘Yessir’ ‘ Just read earlier today that the US Navy now has to send the USS Gravely, a guided-missile destroyer, to the Caribbean to patrol it. Maybe to stop the Gulf of America from being renamed back to the Gulf of Mexico again? https://archive.md/YsASc#selection-515.43-515.53 I thought they say “aye aye”. 🫡 All those strategic plans regarding shipping lanes are understandable, but how will they be implemented? 1) China reportedly has a shipbuilding capacity that is 232 times the one of the USA — which is itself negligible in absolute numbers on a worldwide scale. 2) The USA has an enormous backlog of repair and maintenance for the ships and submarines of its navy. 3) The navy is so short of technical resources and personnel that it must decommission ships before they even reached the end of their useful life. 4) Almost every shipbuilding project in the past couple of decades — littoral combat ship, Zumwalt-class destroyer, Ford-class aircraft carrier — and now Constellation-class frigate, all expensive boondoggles. 5) What regards the Arctic, the USA has yet to renew its hopelessly aged fleet of (one barely functioning) icebreakers — and since it is the first time in 50 years a firm from the USA designs and builds one, skills have been lost and everything takes much more time than expected. 6) The fleet of auxiliary ships has been whittling away, and, because of a lack of personnel, the navy is idling those essential logistical vessels. Far away naval bases need to be manned and resupplied, and must keep a reliable lifeline with the home country, and be able to rely upon a relief fleet could break a siege. It will be interesting to see how this will be achieved in view of all the aforementioned issues. Imperial overstretch on steroids aided by an unshakeable belief in one’s own propaganda. Looking at the economic and technological trends, say over several decades, any expansive US plan to maintain hegemony that requires growth relative to China are comforting pipe dreams. In part it is an admission that the capablility to provide a convoy system in time of war no longer exists. No cheap and cheerful escort carriers, no where near the numbers of anti-submarine corvettes needed. The ships most needed to be convoyed, the VLCC’s and gas carriers impossible to protect due to size and slowness. The Russian riposte is the Poseiden torpedo system targeted to block up the limited number of carrier repair harbours and to close the main canals and perhaps to force the closure of the Malacca Straight. Should be able to block up places like Simons Town as well if the yanks force their way in there. They have to keep hostilities below the official war level because they have no counter to enemy strategic weapons but have to damage their economies enough to make them toe the line. The possibilities of a mistake are incredibly high. This is just my opinion The Pres has struck his deal. It is clear that the President has fully positioned himeself to place blame upon others if things go bad (lifelong business and personal practice). He has made the deal that whatever the 2025 Presidential Transition Project has in its objectives is the plan going forward, he does not want to be bothered with the details, just give him the talking points so he can go back to acting the part he played on TV. In return, he is to made to look the good guy, the boss, the one with the bright ideas but never the clueless ones and, above all, never is he to hear rummors that he wears no clothes. So why is Trump so obsessed with shipping lanes? It’s all laid out in the 2025 Presidential Transition Project – great detail sprinkled throughout with national security being the rational control the shipping lanes… his Tariffs, his objectives, his talking points, his culling of the ‘woke’ his putting cost onto the NATO on europes dime ….on and on it goes. What amazes me is such agastatude and shock both parties pretend – when it’s all in the document – after-all many of the projects… as noted above have been a bi-partisan work — I suppose, to promote a common cause by hiding their support for Genocide and other bi-partisan attrocities and economic idiocy they seam to use their mutual complicity – a cross blackmail of sorts – the same sort of child arguments – No you did it…no you did it..no you did it loop to obfuscate through verbal complexity a glaring truth (to me alone maybe – my truth) A shining light at the top of the hill, or a true democracy, a true republic, is most endanged when stained with the blood of genocide, human rights abuses, unchecked power and a distrust/disdain for the people who have elected by those elected. – Their remains a chasim/ a void of legitimacey thrust upon this country by those driven by lust for power. The Trump has put his transparent 2025 Presidential Transition Project clothes on to play the part he wants. However, he is naked without all his boot lickers (probably the wrong anotomical part). A fraudulent king. Some parts of the 25 project to lend some credibility to my pontifications above. Make irregular warfare a cornerstone of security strategy. 1. Make burden-sharing a central part of U.S. defense strategy with the United States not just helping allies to step up, but strongly encouraging them to do so. 2. Support greater spending and collaboration by Taiwan and allies in the Asia–Pacific like Japan and Australia to create a collective defense model. 3. Transform NATO so that U.S. allies are capable of fielding the great majority of the conventional forces required to deter Russia while relying on the United States primarily for our nuclear deterrent, and select other capabilities while reducing the U.S. force posture in Europe. 4. Sustain support for Israel even as America empowers Gulf partners to take responsibility for their own coastal, air, and missile defenses both individually and working collectively. 3. Directly counter Chinese economic power with all elements of national power in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean to maintain maritime freedom of movement and protect the digital infrastructure of nations in the region. Prioritize a denial defense against China.U.S. defense planning should focus on China and, in particular, the effective denial defense of Taiwan. “Tonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us. President Donald J. Trump, 2019 State of the Union Address” partner countries match the U.S. tariff rate under pressure from the American President, and then under Scenario Two, in which the U.S. matches the tariffs of partners that refuse to lower their tariffs. Project 2025 is itself a throwback to the Reagan/Gingrich drown the government era but as you say it’s doubtful Trump has even read the lengthy document. But I do think it’s valid to say that Trump is trying to revive Reagan rather than the more intellectual Nixon. And guess what…so was Obama. Almost all of our presidents are figureheads in one sense or another. They used to call Eisenhower “the great golfer.” That said, Trump’s motives seem a lot more obscure to me. Maybe we need a Ouija board. The US Navy’s main mission, as presented by a retired US Navy admiral in an article in War on the Rocks, is to restrict access of enemy vessels on the shipping lanes. The Freedom of Navigation and protection of shipping lanes blurb is just that. The truth is just the opposite. Good to see that for now the Northeast Passage is not disputed… The arctic sea passage is in the 2025 Project for strategic resources and shipping lane control. Which is why Trump is demanding that Canadians hand their country over to him – he wants their strategic resources and have control of those shipping lanes. If he was smart, he might have suggested a sort of North American Federation to do this by but instead he just wants a land grab with Canadian resources – which includes its people – to help balance the US bottom line financially i.e. an Anschluss. ‘As of March 17, 2025, Canada’s national net worth, the sum of national wealth and its net foreign asset position, is estimated at roughly $17.5 trillion.’ For some people, that would be pretty hefty payout if Trump ever did it. For the bulk number of Canadians however, they would be net losers big time. In the words of Dr Martin Luther King Jr almost sixty years ago, “My country is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today.” The US already controls Panama via a massive military presence: it can ‘invade’ Panama from within at any time, as it did in 1989. The US also maintains a sizeable military presence in Greenland. Thule AFB, recently renamed Pituffik Space Base, is home to B52 nuclear bombers, one of which exploded there in 1968. So all this talk about owning or controlling Panama and Greenland is for show. The US already owns them. A good video discussion. https://conflictsforum.substack.com/p/europe-and-israel-decline-and-fragment Did I miss any reference to Ellesmere Island? Given what I’ve watched about Trump messups re laws, he problem misspelled “shopping lines” in an attempt to get people buying stuff.

Title: China Ramps Up Criticism of Li Ka-shing’s BlackRock Ports Deal

Chinese authorities increased pressure on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. over its plan to sell its Panama ports stake by sharing a second newspaper commentary attacking the deal. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on Saturday reposted a commentary originally published in Ta Kung Pao, saying the planned sale of the ports by the Hong Kong company had triggered deep concerns among Chinese people and questioned whether the deal was harming China and aiding evil. “Why were so many important ports transferred to ill-intentioned US forces so easily? What kind of political calculations are hidden in the so-called commercial behavior on the surface? Great entrepreneurs are never cold-blooded and speculating profit-seekers, but passionate and proud patriots!” said the opinion piece in the newspaper, a publication that tends to support Beijing’s policies. The Chinese government agency, the country’s top office on Hong Kong affairs, first indicated its displeasure over the transaction last week by sharing an earlier Ta Kung Pao commentary. That post drove CK Hutchison shares down 6.4% on Friday, their biggest decline since 2020. The conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, this month agreed to sell off the bulk of its global ports business to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc. The sale included a controlling share in ports near the Panama Canal, an apparent victory for US President Donald Trump after he had raised concerns about their ownership. The first Ta Kung Pao commentary called on companies to be careful about which “side they should stand on.” It said social media users had accused CK Hutchison of “spineless groveling” and “selling out” Chinese people. Under the agreement, CK Hutchison will sell 43 ports in 23 countries, while keeping facilities in mainland China and Hong Kong. The transaction is set to generate cash proceeds of more than $19 billion. Because the deal involves only overseas assets it is unlikely to need Beijing’s sign-off, but the recent attacks have stoked concern that China might somehow try to intervene. The fresh opinion piece lauded the “heroic actions” of Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei Technologies Co., a Chinese phone and device manufacturer that has long been targeted on national security grounds by the US and other Western nations. “Both history and reality remind entrepreneurs at the forefront of the storm that in the face of the U.S.’s bullying, only by standing firmly with the country and fighting bravely can they defend their country, win dignity and maintain their reputation,” the commentary said. Those who choose to do the opposite, it said, may “make a lot of money for a while, but in the end they will have no future and will bear history’s blame.” Calls and an email sent to CK Hutchison offices in Hong Kong went unanswered outside of office hours on Sunday. The apparent expression of disapproval by Chinese authorities underscores the balancing act facing executives whose companies get caught up in the widening China-US rivalry. CK Hutchison and sister company CK Asset Holdings Ltd. are registered in the Cayman Islands — a move carried out in 2015 as part of a group-wide restructuring. CK Hutchison accrues almost 90% of its revenue from outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. The potential purchase by BlackRock would be one of the biggest acquisitions of the year. Before the agreement, Trump argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US. With assistance from Alice Huang. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: This 15.6% Dividend Is A Smart ‘Buy The Dip’ Play

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Buy on the dip There are two things I need to bring to your attention right now, especially if you’re an income investor. One is my outlook for the market, as volatility really hits home. The other is a 15.6%-yielding(!) fund that just changed its name and ticker—and really grabbed contrarians’ attention in the process. Let’s start with what’s really going on with this wild market. The NASDAQ is now down more than 10% from its peak price, and stocks on the whole are down for the year. I don’t expect this to last very long. My take: 2025 is likely to be a year of volatility rather than a year of decline. Even so, the volatility we’ve seen so far is relatively new. It was only the middle of last month that stocks started making a clear reversal from their long climb, and the NASDAQ 100 is still up 12.6% annualized over the last three years as I write this, while the S&P 500 is up an annualized 9.6%. Market Dip Just a quick look at this chart tells you that buying the dip during this period has been a winning strategy. It also tells us that both indices are setting up for another dip-buying opportunity, where stocks will fall to a point where they become irresistible. During volatile markets, however, the psychological pressures are tough, with sharp declines and trillions of dollars of wealth seemingly vanishing in a matter of days. This has always been a problem for markets, but I think it’s less of a problem now, for one reason: COVID-19. This might sound a bit strange, so let me explain. At the start of the pandemic, trillions of dollars disappeared in hours. People were literally prohibited from economic activity, as they were forced to stay in their homes. Oil prices actually went negative. And yet stocks recovered, both because of monetary policy (the Fed swooped in with emergency rate cuts and massive buys of government bonds—so-called “quantitative easing”) and, after that, technological progress (including changes in infrastructure responding to the pandemic, such as new supply chains; new medical technologies; and, of course, AI). In other words, investors have already seen the worst and it’s fresh in their minds, so even if we face a recession over the next year or two, stocks are unlikely to collapse like they did in 2020 or 2008. So, in a sense, this time is different, but not in the way one might think: People are less likely to give in to total fear (or 2020-like despair!) as the business cycle weakens. Which means that while stocks are likely to fall, they’re not likely to collapse. In such a situation, a smart play is to buy the dip slowly, steadily and strategically. Since fear is unpredictable, we can’t wait for the market to bottom and swoop in to buy everything, but we can start buying when there’s a correction, buy a little more as it worsens, and buy even more when it becomes a full-on bear market. And we can essentially double our “dip-buying discount” by purchasing stocks within a closed-end fund (CEF) trading at an attractive discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). That’s where the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), payer of that outsized (to say the least) 15.6% dividend. BTX is the fund’s newest ticker, which BlackRock changed from BIGZ last month. It also changed the name from the old monicker: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust. As the name now says, the fund invests part of its portfolio in private equity, which can have bigger returns than public stocks in the long run, while the “term” refers to the fact that the fund will come to maturity in 12 years. (Although there is fine print stating that the fund can convert to a perpetual fund, and I fully expect this to happen, so I don’t pay much attention to the “term” in the name here). The most important thing here (besides the huge dividend, of course) is the discount, which has been narrowing lately: BTX Discount Narrows Since the melodramatic fear-induced selloff of 2022, BTX’s discount has narrowed as investors realized that a 20%-off sale on the fund’s tech-stock holdings, including Marvell Technology (MRVL) and NVIDIA (NVDA), was a sweet deal. BlackRock, the fund’s management firm, even realized this and started a stock-buyback program in early 2024. There’s just one problem (or at least there was): BTX (under its former incarnation, BIGZ) lagged other BlackRock tech CEFs. But these days the fund is worth your attention. The changes to this fund run much deeper than a rebrand. BlackRock also made major revisions to its mandate, letting it invest even more in tech stocks. Now, at least 80% of its assets will be in public and private tech companies, instead of the previous focus on small- and mid-cap growth stocks. That mandate didn’t work because small-cap stocks have underperformed other types of stocks for years, as you can see in the benchmark index fund for small caps, in blue below, compared to the NASDAQ (in orange) and the S&P 500 (in purple). Small Caps Lag This wasn’t always the case, and the reason why small caps underperform more now than they used to is another article unto itself. In short, this was one of the reasons why I was wary of BTX when it was BIGZ. Ironically, BIGZ wasn’t as “big-focused” as it should have been. That has changed, along with BTX’s fund managers, with the fund now being run by Tony Kim and Reid Menge. This is great news because Tony and Reid also manage the BlackRock Technology Opportunities Fund (BGSAX), which has run the table on the indices, including the NASDAQ, a particularly tough one to beat. This kind of outperformance deserves a premium, which BTX will likely get eventually. Until then, the fund remains attractive when it trades at a discount, as it is now.

Editor Tech Iain Davis, Independent media alliance, Unlimited Hangout In continuing to unpack the ideologies of the oligarchs who are part of the new Trump administration, Iain Davis examines how their ideas are being translated into policy. He considers the consequent infrastructure rollout that is preparing the US and the world for an imminent Gov-corp Technate within a multipolar world. In Part 1 of this series, we explored the political philosophies that have long been adopted and promoted by Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and considered the implications, given both men’s obvious influence on the Trump administration. Musk is a high-profile advocate of Technocracy, and Peter Thiel is an accelerationist neoreactionary who favours, in particular, the Dark Enlightenment. Before you read this article (Part 2), I urge you to familiarise yourself with the explanations of Technocracy and the NRx (the neoreactionary movement) provided in Part 1. Otherwise, many of the references here will lack context. As we noted in Part 1, Thiel and Musk are part of the oligarchic class by virtue of being invited to join a network led by other oligarchs whose stratospheric wealth far surpasses that of the names published on the “richest people in the world” lists. Welcomed into their exclusive club, Thiel and Musk are made men. In Part 2, we will explore how the political philosophies and the associated economic theories of Thiel and Musk are shaping public policy. Keep in mind that these two men are far from alone in attempting to create an American gov-corp Technate. Although they borrow some libertarian ideas, there is nothing truly “libertarian” about either technocrats or accelerationist neoreactionaries. Their convoluted theories, once applied, could not be more authoritarian, more anti-liberty. Just as it is an oxymoron to describe Musk as a “libertarian technocrat,” so is it absurd to think of Peter Thiel as an “anarcho-capitalist.” Yet propagandists persist in encouraging us to see them in these terms. Witness a 2014 article in The Atlantic titled “The Libertarian Capitalist’s Case for State Power and Making No Money.” It is possible that people like Thiel and Musk self-identify as libertarians because they think “liberty” means freedom granted by — and to — the oligarchy. In Part 1, we referenced the Venetian Republic. The Doge of Venice was the ruler of the banking, finance, and commercial empire of the Venetian Republic. That is to say, the Doge was given the liberty to rule by the oligarchs of the day. We might wonder if the naming of the Department of Government Efficiency (the DOGE) that Musk leads deliberately references the Venetian magistrate. Some say it does, while others suggest another possibility. Created as a joke in 2013 by cryptographers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, the Dogecoin, a memecoin, has seen its price and market cap soar and fluctuate wildly thanks in no small measure to Elon Musk’s comments about it. Much of Musk’s talk about Dogecoin has been deliberately provocative. For example, in 2019 he declared himself the “former CEO of Dogecoin,” though that was never the case. His social media posts alone have provoked major changes in the price of Dogecoin. Musk has also aggressively hiked its value by, for instance, hinting it might become the basis of the proposed “X pay” payment system on his newly acquired ‘X’ platform — formerly Twitter. Musk encouraged bullish investment in Dogecoin. Of course, just because someone encourages you to do something that doesn’t negate your personal responsibility to conduct due diligence. When some investors lost their shirts, as Dogecoin prices tumbled, they tried to sue Musk in 2022 with a potential $258 billion class action lawsuit. The case was dismissed last year. The judge ruled that Musk’s comments were just “aspirational and puffery, not factual and susceptible to being falsified.” Though it is worth noting the offhand comments of one man took the Dogecoin from a literal joke — a crypto parody — to achieving a market capitalisation of $14.5 billion in 2021. If there is an in-joke to the naming of the DOGE, nominally led by Elon Musk, some argue it is Musk’s fondness for the Dogecoin that is reflected in the D.O.G.E acronym. Yet, the symbolism of “the Doge ”— one who is granted the liberty to rule by oligarchs — is perhaps more conspicuous. Just as with the term “Accelerator” — meaning high-impact investment to accelerate the growth of a startup — an obvious underpinning ideology is implied, even if rarely discussed. In the introduction to his 2012 treatise, “The Dark Enlightenment,” political philosopher Nick Land highlighted the importance of an article written three years earlier by oligarch Thiel. Land wrote: One milestone was the April 2009 discussion hosted at Cato Unbound among libertarian thinkers (including Patri Friedman and Peter Thiel) in which disillusionment with the direction and possibilities of democratic politics was expressed with unusual forthrightness. Thiel summarized the trend bluntly: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” In a related article Thiel penned, titled “The Education of a Libertarian,” he was describing himself, and yet the personal philosophy he outlined in it was pure accelerationist neoreactionism. Thiel opined that “the prospects for a libertarian politics appear grim indeed,” given that the government’s response to every crisis was “more government.” He also claimed that the post-WWI deflationary depression in Western nations was the last “sharp but short” shock to have allowed the alleged advantages of Schumpeterian “creative destruction” to flourish. After that depression, he said, so-called “democratic” politics had stifled the opportunities to capitalise on crises. As a result, Thiel said he no longer believed “that politics encompasses all possible futures of our world.” Asserting, in so many words, that democracies were useless, Thiel announced he had found a new life goal: In our time, the great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms — from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called “social democracy.” The critical question then becomes one of means, of how to escape not via politics but beyond it. For Thiel, the “unthinking demos” is us: the holders of the “neo-puritan faith” in progressive “social democracy” — the acolytes of the Cathedral (and the people whom Nick Land considers “inarticulate proles”). In Thiel’s view, we must embrace our “technoplastic” future, become intelligible, move beyond politics, and liberate capitalist innovation by swearing fealty to the gov-corp model. To this end, Thiel identified three “technological frontiers” upon which he could construct his darkly enlightened aristocracy.[1] Cyberspace was the first frontier he identified. There, Thiel focused on creating “a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution.” Cyberspace would enable “new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states” — and would result in a new world that would “force change on the existing social and political order.” [2] Outer space would be another Thiel frontier, where the “libertarian future of classic science fiction” could be built. [3] Seasteading would be his interim frontier, where the unclaimed oceans could be settled by humans. He called seasteading “more tentative than the Internet, but much more realistic than space travel.” Seasteading would at least give us the time to develop the outer-space ideas on earth, prior to colonising the stars. These frontiers are necessary, Thiel insisted, because “we are in a deadly race between politics and technology.” He concluded: We do not know exactly how close this race is, but I suspect that it may be very close, even down to the wire. Unlike the world of politics, in the world of technology the choices of individuals may still be paramount. The fate of our world may depend on the effort of a single person [Trump?] who builds or propagates the machinery of freedom that makes the world safe for capitalism. [Emphasis added.] Between 2006 and 2012, Thiel was instrumental in organising the Singularity Summits convened by the Machine Intelligence Research Institute — originally the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI) — in partnership with Stanford University. Thiel provided much of the funding. Thiel cannot be both an advocate of accelerationist neoreaction and simultaneously an anarcho-capitalist — a libertarian. The two philosophies are mutually exclusive. In Part 1, we noted the technocrats’ rejection of the notion that “all men are created equal.” In a similar vein, Land, Yarvin, Fisher, and other accelerationists consider it essential to have a ruling entity, which can only be comprised of a few human beings exercising an unequal, additional right to rule. Both the technocrats and the accelerationists fundamentally misunderstand, or misinterpret, what the Preamble to The Declaration of Independence means. They completely ignore the second clause of the relevant declaration — namely, “that they [human beings] are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” “Equality,” in real libertarian thinking, does not infer a held belief that everyone is the same — though that is certainly how technocrats interpret the word. Libertarian “equality” doesn’t deny that people have relative strengths and weaknesses. It is not a rejection of either leadership or possible forms of meritocracy. It self-evidently means that every human being has an equal right to “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” These rights are unalienable — or inalienable. Our rights are not decided for us by others or limited by others, and no one on earth has any more or any fewer “equal rights” than anyone else. This idea is not difficult to grasp. It is central to the political philosophy of anarcho-capitalism, as clearly enunciated by Murray Rothbard (1926–1995): [N]o man or group of men may aggress against the person or property of anyone else. This may be called the “nonaggression axiom.” “Aggression” is defined as the initiation of the use or threat of physical violence against the person or property of anyone else. Anarcho-capitalism wholeheartedly rejects the initiation of the use of force — the aggressive imposition of claimed authority — by the state to coerce individual persons or seize their property. An example is the threat of fining or imprisoning someone who hasn’t paid taxes to the “proper” authorities. Anarcho-capitalism resoundingly rejects the state and all its dictatorial demands. By contrast, the proponents of Technocracy and the proponents of the Dark Enlightenment, such as Musk and Thiel, are not interested in restricting state power, though they may say otherwise. Instead they wish to move the state from the public to the private sector and expand its power once sufficiently privatized. True, they oppose “representative democracy” and characterise it as both a “democracy” (which it isn’t) and a bureaucratic system riddled with problems (which it is), but the solutions they offer, to all intents and purposes, magnify the power of the very state they supposedly condemn. What the believers in Technocracy and the believers in the Dark Enlightenment both propose are compartmentalised, hierarchical sociopolitical power structures that couldn’t be more state-like or more authoritarian. They seek to expand and maximise the power of the state, though in slightly different ways. Calling their new model of the state either a Technate (as technocrats do) or a gov-corp (as accelerationist neoreactionaries do) doesn’t change the nature of the tyrannical statism they desire to foist on the rest of us. The term “technopopulism,” coined by political theorists Christopher Bickerton and Carlo Accetti, has increasingly been bandied about. While the US voters who elected Trump were offered technopopulist promises, this was clearly a sales pitch to entice them to support a gov-corp Technate. “Populism” can be broadly defined as a political attempt to “appeal to ordinary people who feel that their concerns are disregarded by established elite groups.” “Technocracy” is commonly said to mean “a government or social system that is controlled or influenced by experts in science or technology.” Neither left-wing nor right-wing, technopopulism promises a new kind of politics based on the belief that the more limited role of elected politicians is to put the appropriate teams of experts together to guide policy and to find technological solutions to social and economic problems, thereby benefiting “ordinary people.” But the apparent technopopulist offer to retain democratic accountability in the US is a deceit. The technopopulists say they want to unleash “technocracy” — with a small “t” — for the public good. But the new government system they propose is constructing “Technocracy” — with a big “T” — to serve the interests of the “American elites.” This is evident from The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 (aka The 2025 Presidential Transition Project), Promise to America. It claims its purpose is to “defang and defund the woke culture warriors who have infiltrated every last institution in America.” While defanging and defunding woke warriors holds allure for American voters, the Project 2025 methodology actually subverts US “representative democracy.” The Trump administration is evidently closely allied with Project 2025 — denials notwithstanding. One such obvious tie: Trump has nominated Russell Vought to return to the post of director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and, by no coincidence, Vought was a key figure in convening the Project 2025 initiative. Project 2025 contributors were influential in Trump’s first administration and are no less conspicuous in his current picks for office. Project 2025 sets a presidential agenda for the first 180 days in office that seeks to empower the executive branch to meet these key goals: dramatically reduce the size of the public sector bureaucracy; privatise and deregulate the functions of the state; and liberate American technological innovation by “shuttering” it off from the China tech sector’s alleged infiltration. Thus, according to Project 2025, US technology can, if applied properly, be used to resolve all manner of social problems—from anti-American inequality of opportunity in the education system to woke propaganda infesting the media. In other words, American technology produced by Americans and for Americans can supply every long-sought answer to America’s ills. The power of American AI can be set free to, for example, police social media and tackle abuses such as Medicare fraud. Project 2025 offers the additional justification that the US is in an AI arms race with China and, therefore, must invest in AI accordingly. Trump issued a slew of executive orders following his inauguration. These days, this is not an unusual practice for an incoming US president. However, Trump’s EOs were clearly heavily influenced by Project 2025. Ironically, The Heritage Foundation and its Project 2025 are bankrolled by some of the “elites” the project accuses of betraying Americans. The Coors, Koch, Uihlein, Barre Seid, Bradley, and Scaiffe families are among the financial backers of both the Foundation and Project 2025. Rather than technopopulists it is the “TechnoKings” (see Part 1) who have been “assisting” Trumps selection of his administration’s personnel. Musk’s influence is well known but Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, is another influencer. Andreessen has not just been involved in making Trump’s picks for technology and economic related positions — areas where he perhaps has some expertise — but also for US defense and intelligence posts. Andreessen’s Machiavellian reasons for supporting Trump are obvious. As reported by the Verge, in July 2024 Andreessen spelled out that he and his partners were backing Trump, not because they shared any of the concerns voiced by Republican voters, but because they could use the Trump administration to deliver the regulatory environment they wanted for their project to succeed. That project is a gov-corp Technate. Not technopopulism but Techno-Optimism. In 2023, Marc Andreessen published The Techno-Optimist Manifesto. He explained precisely why he and his TechKing partners have seized their opportunity: We can advance to a far superior way of living, and of being. [. . .] We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology. [. . .] We have a problem of poverty, so we invent technology to create abundance. Give us a real world problem, and we can invent technology that will solve it. [. . .] Combine technology and markets and you get what Nick Land has termed the techno-capital machine, the engine of perpetual material creation, growth, and abundance.[. . .] We believe in accelerationism – the conscious and deliberate propulsion of technological development – to [. . .] ensure the techno-capital upward spiral continues forever. [. . .] We believe intelligence is in an upward spiral, [. . .] as people form symbiotic relationships with machines into new cybernetic systems. [. . .] We believe Artificial Intelligence is our alchemy, our Philosopher’s Stone. [. . .] We believe in Augmented Intelligence just as much as we believe in Artificial Intelligence. Intelligent machines augment intelligent humans, driving a geometric expansion of what humans can do. This is pure accelerationist neoreaction strongly influence by Technocracy. It is Nick Land and notably not Curtis Yarvin that Andreessen considers among the “Patron Saints” of Techno-Optimism. People like Thiel, Andreessen, and Musk are serious. They want to implement the Dark Enlightenment and are hell-bent on establishing gov-corp Technates. Their oligarch network is indistinguishable from the Trump administration. Currently, the most powerful nation on earth is in their hands. In true technopopulist fashion, it is perhaps Andreessen’s identification of gov-corp enemies that is most revealing: Our enemies are not bad people – but rather bad ideas. Our present society has been subjected to a mass demoralization campaign for six decades – against technology and against life – under varying names like “existential risk”, “sustainability”, “ESG”, “Sustainable Development Goals”, “social responsibility”, “stakeholder capitalism”, “Precautionary Principle”, “trust and safety”, “tech ethics”, “risk management”, “de-growth”, “the limits of growth”.This demoralization campaign is based on bad ideas of the past – zombie ideas, many derived from Communism, disastrous then and now. The eradication of these “enemies” reads like an American voters’ wish-list. Ridding themselves of the globalist’s overreach exercised through institutions like the WHO, the WEF, the UN and even NATO, is what they seemingly voted for. Andreessen attempt to associate ideas like “sustainability,” “stakeholder capitalism” and even “social responsibility” with communism is, at best, wrong, but appears to be disingenuous and mere pandering. This is the Dark Enlightenment’s technopopulist sales pitch. Escaping the grasp of the oligarchs was obviously a vote winner. But the American public has not escaped, on the contrary it has fallen into the clutches of the most authoritarian oligarchs imaginable. Oligarchs who, perhaps for the first time in history, not only have the political authority but the technology to make their gov-corp Technates a reality. This is a clear and present danger to all of us. Not just Americans. The same commitment to accelerationism and creative destruction is evident everywhere. In essence, gov-corp is the ultimate public-private partnership — a kind of inverted fascism where the private stakeholders use the claimed authority and violence of the state to achieve their goals. The construction of Technates is not limited to the US. Arguably China, for example, is already operating a public-private Technocracy. What is happening under our noses is no libertarian dream realized. It is the construction of an all-cognizant, all-controlling, all-consuming global network of gov-corp Technates overseen by a bureaucracy of multiple poles. On the surface, the new brand of technopopulist politics we’ve been examining seems to be anti-Establishment. At least, that’s how it’s being presented. It will use high-tech solutions and AI analysis to, for instance, deliver “lower taxes, much cheaper energy (green and fossil), faster growth and a productivity revolution.” Lest we forget, it will “make America great again” (MAGA). The trouble with this pipe dream, though, is that the ostensible “technopopulists” and avowed neoreactionaries behind it are actually installing Big “T” Technocracy and gov-corp as their solution. Not MAGA, but “Dark MAGA.” In 2020 Pronomos Capital, a venture capital firm backed by Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen , and Coinbase established the low tax, low regulation nascent city state called Próspera on the island of Roatán in Honduras. The promotional blurb for Próspera read: Próspera is a startup city with a regulatory system designed for entrepreneurs to build better, cheaper, and faster than anywhere else in the world. The current Honduras government considers Próspera’s claim to enjoy special economic and regulatory status illegal. The previous Honduras administration under Juan Orlando Hernández (JOH) — who was later convicted of drug smuggling in the US — initially created three so-called Zones for Employment and Economic Development (ZEDEs) of which Próspera is one. The initiative was fiercely opposed by the people of Honduras. The ZEDEs create a “special regime” where investors — Pronomos Capital (Thiel, Andreessen, etc.) — have absolute control of “fiscal, security and conflict resolution policy.” For all intents and purposes, the ZEDEs are startup gov-corps. In 2022, the incoming administration of Xiomara Castro Sarmiento started the process of repealing the ZEDE legislation. This is proving difficult because the Próspera ZEDE framework has a fifty year “built to last” clause in it guaranteeing the project for that period. Gov-corp investors instigated an $11 billion law suit to stop the Honduras government’s attempts to stymie their ambitions. The technocrat oligarchs deployed the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) mechanism against the elected government of Honduras. It is not unreasonable to describe their action as a direct threat to bankrupt the entire nation. As we’ll discuss, these oligarchs are not “nice” people. Whether they call themselves Christian or not. Many of the Próspera trademarks are held by NeWay Capital LLC, founded by Erick Brimen and Trey Goff. NeWay Capital formed the Freedom Cities Coalition (FCC) which is similarly backed by Pronomos Capital — Thiel, Andreessen, Coinbase et al. In 2023, Trump proposed establishing ten so called “Freedom Cities” in the US. The mainstream media focused on his comments about “flying cars,” but he was really talking about embryonic gov-corp Technates. Reportedly, the FCC is now supposedly “in discussion” with the Trump administration to create gov-corp Technates across the US. Trey Goff said “the energy in DC is absolutely electric” and the ambition was to create “not just ten, but as many as the market can handle.” If approved by Congress, these “startup nations” — neoreactionary realms — will be city states like Próspera. The FCC calls these “special districts” Prosperity Zones. The technopopulist offer is to unleash innovation, onshore employment opportunities and revitalise the American economy. The FCC objective is to “accelerate the development of new urban centers.” Freedom Cities will operate in de facto US ZEDEs. The objective is to remove all regulation and allow tech-oligarchs the freedom to do whatever they like. These will be cities without limits, say the FCC and will be “zones of regulatory clarity and economic dynamism, [. . .] allowing entrepreneurs and builders to move at the speed of human ingenuity.” The accelerationist neoreactionaries and the technocrats are racing ahead. As evidenced by Andreessen’s Techno-Optimist Manifesto, there is no doubt what they have in mind. In 2022, Balaji Srinivasan — former Andreessen Horowitz general partner and former chief technology officer for Coinbase — published his book The Network State: How to Start a New Country. In it, he outlined the neoreactionary strategy to “escape politics in all its forms” and enable tech-billionaire oligarchs to form their own sovereign states—sov-corps. There is nothing pro-American about the NRx’s collective vision. Srinivasan wants the proposed “startup nations” to secede from the US and considers the US outdated and obsolescent. Shortly we’ll discuss Trump’s peculiar and seemingly unilateral declaration that his administration is intent upon grabbing Greenland — and Gaza apparently. We are supposed to believe that it is Trump who wants Greenland (and perhaps Gaza); that Trump is the great strategist playing some sort of 5D geopolitical chess game. But it is Peter Thiel and his oligarch network that wants to build a gov-corp Technate called Praxis on Greenland. The people of Greenland should be wary. There is no legal limit to the “built to last” territorial expansion of Próspera and the TechnoKing oligarchs have the backing of the World Bank to make sure their project does last. Following Trump’s inauguration, The New York Times published an adversarial interview with aforementioned political theorist of the neoreactionary movement (NRx) Curtis Yarvin. Outlining Yarvin’s contention that the US should be run as a corporate monarchy (gov-corp) under the leadership of an all-powerful CEO (Trump), Times‘ writer and interviewer David Marchese formulated his arguments on the suspected racist aspects of Yarvin’s ideology. The pair debated nothing of notable interest. The piece allowed Yarvin to forward some of his ideas to a wider public — but without disclosing any of their appalling implications. Meanwhile, the Times‘ Marchese posited a practically irrelevant counterargument. The legacy media is not going to point out those appalling implications. But this is what Yarvin, the leader of the NRx admired by Peter Thiel and other neoreactionary oligarchs, had proposed in 2008 under his pen name, Mencius Moldburg: Our goal, in short, is a humane alternative to genocide. That is: the ideal solution achieves the same result as mass murder (the removal of undesirable elements from society), but without any of the moral stigma. The best humane alternative to genocide I can think of is not to liquidate the wards [people]—either metaphorically or literally—but to virtualize them. A virtualized human is in permanent solitary confinement, waxed like a bee larva into a cell which is sealed except for emergencies. This would drive him insane, except that the cell contains an immersive virtual-reality interface which allows him to experience a rich, fulfilling life in a completely imaginary world. The suspected racist streak in Yarvin does matter when we consider the implications of his gov-corp philosophy. But to imagine that identity politics provides any kind of intellectual basis to tackle the NRx dooms all such opposition to failure. If the objective is to resist accelerationist neoreaction, then harping on about the divisions between the progressive left and the right-wing — or “alt-right” — serves no useful purpose. Such arguments don’t even come close to comprehending what the Dark Enlightenment is. They only deflect the public from paying vital attention to real threats. The Dark Enlightenment is not racist. It is anti-human race. Its advocates do not care what colour gov-corp’s customers are. They seek, rather, to transform all of humanity, to bring an end to what it is to be a sovereign human being. Musk has already stated his desire to transform his X platform into a payment service provider and finance portal that, he hopes, could become “half of the world’s financial system.” Thanks in part to the headway made by Facebook’s Libra (Diem) project — more in this shortly — in 2023, Musk was able to start applying for the necessary regulatory approval for his financial domination project. Via its “Digital State” — again, we’ll cover this in a moment — Ukrainians are the Digital State’s “customers.” Musk wants to X to form the basis of a worldwide Digital State in which all users will be customers. Citizens as customers of government services is a key component of the gov-corp structure that neoreactionaries like Thiel and Andreessen desire. Just as we see the rise of the accompanying “accelerators” everywhere, so to the description of us as “customers” is seeping into the lexicon of governments the world over. In 2019, the US multinational corporation IBM, whose operations make it the largest industrial research organization in the world and whose chequered history includes assisting the Nazis to perpetrate a holocaust, explained why we all need to consider ourselves the customers of our governments: Today’s society is changing at a record pace as companies worldwide develop innovative solutions designed to make the world a more efficient and sustainable place. [. . .] Apps provide us with personalized information based on geolocation; we can shop online from the comfort of our couch, and organize our finances on our smartphones.[. . .] [I]t’s time to rethink and reinvent public sector services, [. . .] a digital reinvention helps build trust in the public sector as a brand: the government has your back. [. . .] At IBM, we’re there to guide you through the current age of digital reinvention. IBM, alongside CIA-linked Oracle, is a partner of the UK government’s Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and is assisting it to “accelerate transformation” to a new digital DWP service. For its part, as it proceeds to make a £6 billion cut, the UK DWP has stopped winter fuel payments to pensioners and has committed to freezing and restricting access to disability payments to the disabled. It is effectively lowering unemployment benefits for the sick and disabled and tightening the eligibility criteria for nearly all state benefits. At the same time, the UK government is pushing through the Terminally-ill Adults (End of Life) Bill — commonly referred to as the Assisted Dying Bill — to make it easier for the state to kill people who just can’t take it any more. All of this, according to the DWP, is part of its drive to provide a better “customer experience.” In 2021, The Biden administration issued Executive Order 14058 to improve the US federal government’s customer’s experience. Consequently, according to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS): [. . .] every person who pays taxes or uses Medicare is a customer of the federal government. Every veteran who uses a VA facility is a customer, every government employee that fills out their timesheet is a customer. The “customer experience” is how people experience and perceive our government services. It is what happens at the touchpoints when someone interacts with a government service. The customer experience can be a single touchpoint or several over a longer relationship between the “customer” and government. Each touchpoint is an opportunity for a positive interaction that adds up to a positive customer experience. The mainstream media is avidly pushing the idea that politicians like Trump are in charge. But, not only does EO 14058 illustrate the clear shift towards NRx gov-corp aligned thinking, it also shows that the transformation is not dependent on whatever administration happens to be in office at the time. Gov-corp represents the underlying philosophy driving this governance reinvention. Technocracy is the operating system for the impending Technates, regardless of who you vote for. The shift to digital money and “digital states” is key to the reimagining of society. Rather like the WeChat “everything app” in China, which operates as a public-private partnership between the government and Tencent — enabling the technocratic state to directly influence an estimated 1.3 billion Chinese customers –– the size of the X user-base gives Musk’s network an opportunity to construct his version of an everything app digital state. With an estimated 600 million users, Musk’s team is ready to launch his platform’s X-money payment system. It seems Musk doesn’t anticipate any regulatory problems, as another building block of the X-digital state is dropped into place. As X moves toward becoming a “comprehensive financial services hub,” working in partnership with Visa, the plan is to reportedly integrate digital currencies into the X-money system by the end of the year. The new interoperable global monetary system that is emerging has been designed to perpetuate the same old monetary game with the added benefit of AI surveillance and behavioural control. Investors can speculate — engaging in creative destruction — while protecting their digital finance empires by storing value in new digital reserve assets, almost certainly bitcoin. A so-called Synthetic Hegemonic Currency can and is being created, primarily using USD-denominated stablecoins underwritten by US debt. In contrast to the investor experience, it is unlikely to benefit many of its customers. Contemplating new methods of genocide to rid yourself of whomever you find “undesirable” is something we associate with tyrannical megalomaniacs not egalitarian democratic “leaders.” Unfortunately, certainly in the US, it seems the maniac tyrants have the upper hand. As many Unlimited Hangout readers already know, Thiel received investment funds from the CIA’s In-Q-Tel to accelerate Palantir. Part of that arrangement was for Palantir to establish a public-private partnership that would rescue a US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) project called Total Information Awareness (renamed the Terrorism-IA program in 2003). The purpose of the TIA was to create an all-pervasive US surveillance and population control system, with a heavy focus on pre-crime and other “predictive” interventions that would allow the state to justify any policy it chooses. The TIA project faltered when the US public learned of its intentions. State funding was officially withdrawn — which simply meant that the “less controversial” aspects continued under the guise of combating terrorism while the controversial projects went darker still. Ever since 9/11, “terrorism” has been the convenient PR buzz word for covering up a multitude of illegalities. The TIA program continued, unabated, to spy on the entire US population as a public-private partnership. Shortly after incorporating Palantir in 2003, Thiel and Palantir co-founder and CEO Alex Karp reportedly met with the TIA’s chief architect, John Poindexter. The pair apparently impressed upon Poindexter that they shared his vision of a US domestic digital gulag. Yet, unlike TIA, which had been housed at the Pentagon’s DARPA, they would develop the TIA system as a private entity. According to New York magazine, Thiel and Karp convinced Poindexter that Palantir would “pull together data collected by a wide range of spy agencies — everything from human intelligence and cell-phone calls to travel records and financial transactions.” Evidently, In-Q-Tel’s seed funding followed soon thereafter. The CIA remained Palantir’s sole client until 2008. That is to say, Palantir enjoyed a monopoly due to its partnership with the state. Although Thiel’s cadre at PayPal — often called the PayPal Mafia — is supposedly responsible for ousting Musk from the company’s CEO spot, the rift between the two men seems somewhat overstated. Just as it is clear Musk hankers to install Technocracy, Thiel’s passion for the Dark Enlightenment is equally unambiguous. Both ideologies are mutually reinforcing. While there are some apparent tensions between Musk and Thiel, they are on the same path. Yarvin, for one, certainly values Musk’s contribution. Thiel and Musk are already megarich magnates on the order of the robber barons of old. As such, their respective Dark Enlightenment and Technocracy dreams, when realized, are intended to make them “sovereigns” of what Yarvin calls a “patchwork of realms.” The shared view of technocrats and neoreactionaries that society would be better if it were ruled by the likes of Musk and Thiel is an absurd and dangerous folly. We shouldn’t labour under any illusions that they’re nice. Anduril Industries CEO Palmer Lucky is another Thiel protégé who, having sold his Oculus VR headset business to Mark Zuckerberg, moved into the war business with the help of Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund. Through Anduril, Thiel is investing in a defence technology that maximises AI’s ability to kill. Peter Thiel and Elon Musk have both been instrumental in the development of AI. They combined forces in 2015 to accelerate Thiel protégé Sam Altman’s OpenAI as a “non-profit” research company. Today, propelled by the success of its ChatGPT generative AI chatbot, OpenAI is valued at around $160 billion. Consequently, its “for profit” subsidiary, OpenAI Global LLC, is poised to make fantastic profits. OpenAI was pitched as a tool for developing AI to “benefit humanity as a whole.” Presumably, OpenAI’s defence contracts and its participation in the Silicon Valley consortium bid to dominate the US military-industrial complex reflect this principled commitment. Or perhaps the ethical stance of the team behind OpenAI is about as plausible as their “non-profit” pretensions. There is every reason not to trust hypocrites like Thiel and Musk. One of those reasons is Palantir’s encroachment into national health-data systems, which is creating a virtual healthcare data monopoly in some countries — including the UK. This is extremely concerning, because it is obvious that patient care — or even basic human compassion — is not a priority for Thiel’s Palantir. There is nothing “Christian” about Thiel’s conduct. On the contrary, Palantir has actively participated in Israel’s Palestinian genocide and in the almost-complete destruction of the Palestinians’ healthcare system. In January 2024, Thiel and Palantir CEO Alex Karp agreed to a strategic partnership with the Israeli Ministry of Defense and signed a deal with the Israeli Occupation Forces (IOF) to “harness Palantir’s advanced technology in support of war-related missions.” Of this deal the British Medical Journal observed: IOF operations have been described as a “war on hospitals” because of the systematic destruction of Gaza’s entire health system and 943 IOF attacks on healthcare. Hundreds of health workers have been detained, tortured, and killed. In addition to directly attacking healthcare, ongoing bombardment, forced displacement of Palestinians, and near complete siege of Gaza, the IOF has created a severe health and humanitarian crisis with high rates of malnutrition, infectious disease, famine, and dehydration. Several Thiel-backed companies — Palantir (seed-funded by In-Q-Tel),Anduril and digital surveillance company Clearview AI — have all evidently used the Ukraine-Russia conflict as a test bed for their technology. As noted by Stavroula Pabst in her Unlimited Hangout article, “How Peter Thiel-Linked Tech is Fueling the Ukraine War,” these companies are “taking advantage of the conflict to develop controversial AI-driven weapons systems and facial recognition technologies, perhaps transforming both warfare and AI forever.” Despite Thiel’s self-described libertarian and Christian beliefs, Pabst noted that the net impact of his venture capitalism couldn’t be more inhuman: [T]hese Thiel-backed groups’ involvement in war serves to develop not only problematic and unpredictable weapons technologies and systems, but also apparently to advance and further interconnect a larger surveillance apparatus formed by Thiel and his elite allies’ collective efforts across the public and private sectors, which arguably amount to the entrenchment of a growing technocratic panopticon aimed at capturing public and private life. Within the context of Thiel’s growing domination over large swaths of the tech industry, apparent efforts to influence, bypass or otherwise undermine modern policymaking processes, and anti-democratic sentiments, Thiel-linked organizations’ activities in Ukraine can only signal a willingness to shape the course of current events and the affairs of sovereign nations alike. Though Pabst’s piece was written in October 2023, her prescient observations have certainly been playing out. As we embark on 2025, it is clear that Thiel and Musk are among a troop of tech titans who have ingratiated themselves with the Trump administration. While the war in Ukraine has evidently been used by the “TechnoKings” behind Trump to develop AI weapon systems, the Trump administration has hypocritically positioned itself as peace broker. On their own, the ideologies of communitarianism, stakeholder capitalism, Technocracy, the Dark Enlightenment, and any other political ideology amount to little more than academic musings. Once implemented through the power and authority illegitimately claimed by the state, however, they couldn’t be more significant. Thiel has heavily backed current Vice President JD Vance and other Republican political candidates, such as Blake Masters, who co-authored Zero to One: Notes on Startups, Or How to Build the Future with Thiel in 2014. There is a nexus of Thiel protégés surrounding the new Trump administration. It is hard to see how Vance could rise to what some call the second-most-powerful position in the US were it not for the career-long support he has received from Thiel. As Thiel’s man, Vance’s admiration for the Dark Enlightenment is transparent. Adopting Yarvin’s “Retire All Government Employee” (RAGE) motto, which now seems to be embodied by the DOGE, Vance suggested that a future Trump administrator should “fire every single midlevel bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, [and] replace them with our people.” In 2017, Buzzfeed published extracts from the dump of an email exchange between Curtis Yarvin and Milo Yiannopoulis. In one email, Yarvin revealed that he had watched the 2016 US election results with Thiel and said that Thiel was “fully enlightened, just plays it very carefully.” In his 2021 book, The Contrarian: Peter Thiel and Silicon Valley’s Pursuit of Power, Bloomberg Technology writer Max Chafkin describes Yarvin as the “house political philosopher” of the “Thielverse,” according to a July 2024 article by Gil Duran in The New Republic. Of course, Thiel does not want it widely known that he supports the Dark Enlightenment of the NRx. With its aim to destroy the political realm and replace it with a corporate monarchy, the Dark Enlightenment, if fully understood by the public, would outrage them and would be, for Thiel, a PR disaster. Despite the potential for that to happen, Yarvin’s ideas continue to influence him. One such crazy notion was revealed by Yarvin in his talk at the March 2012 BIL Conference (an alternative to TED). Speaking as Mencius Moldbug, Yarvin advocated for gov-corp: There is no difference between a CEO and a dictator. If Americans want to change their government, they’re going to have to get over their dictator phobia. Just a few weeks later, Thiel gave a lecture at Stanford, where he said: A startup is basically structured as a monarchy. We don’t call it that, of course. That would seem weirdly outdated, and anything that’s not democracy makes people uncomfortable. We are biased toward the democratic-republican side of the spectrum. That’s what we’re used to from civics classes. But the truth is that startups and founders lean toward the dictatorial side because that structure works better for startups. Ten days prior to Trump’s inauguration, Thiel used the Financial Times as an outlet to pontificate about the second-term President’s second-time promises to disclose details of the Kennedy assassination plot and to protect free speech, etc. Time will tell if these promises are kept. In the same article, Thiel laid bare the lineage of his own philosophy: Darker questions still emerge in these dusky final weeks of our interregnum. [. . .] The future demands fresh and strange ideas. New ideas might have saved the old regime, which barely acknowledged, let alone answered, our deepest questions — the causes of the 50-year slowdown in scientific and technological progress. Certainly from 2009 onward, Thiel has viewed politics as a vehicle to promote his accelerationist NRx-aligned objectives. Not because he particularly shares the values of any political party, either Democrat or Republican — or, for that matter, Libertarian — but because he recognises that people are programmed to feel comfortable as long as they believe whatever they support has something to do with “democracy.” Remember, Thiel calls us the “unthinking demos.” In 2014, reporting the evidence of some of the other links between Yarvin and Thiel, Corey Pein, writing for The Baffler, accurately lumped Thiel in with the NRx and called them collectively a bunch of “mouthbreathing Machiavellis.” Responding to Pein’s piece, Thiel said, according to an article published shortly thereafter in The New York Times: Actually, I found that vaguely flattering. [. . .] It was the full-on conspiracy theory. In truth, there’s nobody sitting around plotting the future, though sometimes I think it would be better if people were. This was blatant baloney. Thiel well knows there are people “sitting around plotting the future.” He himself maintains a web of connections with the plotters of which he speaks — and is obviously one of them. Thiel, as President of Thiel Capital, sits on the Bilderberg Steering Committee. The steering committee sets the agenda for the secretive Bilderberg Meetings where around 130 selected globalist delegates debate policy initiatives behind closed doors. Palantir CEO, Thiel’s associate Alex Karp, is also on the steering committee, as is former chair and CEO of Google Eric Schmidt and the President of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Børge Brende. Consequently, it isn’t surprising that the main topic for debate at the last 2024 Bilderberg meeting was Artificial Intelligence (AI). Former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has been selected as the chair for the next Bilderberg Meeting and will also serve as chair of the next Munich Security Conference (MSC). The UK Guardian reports that his appointment marks a moment where the “influential” Bilderberg group is contributing toward the “concentration of control at the top of the Atlantic alliance.” Noting that Bilderberg brings together “prime ministers, EU commissioners, bank bosses, corporate CEOs and intelligence chiefs,” it was ridiculous for Thiel — a senior Bilderberger — to feign ignorance of those who evidently are “plotting the future.” Yarvin, in the earlier-referenced interview with David Marchese in The New York Times, was asked what he meant when he said Thiel was “fully enlightened”: Fully enlightened for me means fully disenchanted. [. . .] It’s a disenchantment from believing in these old systems. And the thing that should replace that disenchantment is not, Oh, we need to do things Curtis’s [or Peter’s] way. It’s basically just a greater openness of mind. Sure, the Dark Enlightenment rejects the “old systems” — i.e., representative democracy — but Yarvin’s diplomatic response cannot hide the fact that Thiel and other members of the NRx evidently know what they want to replace it with: gov-corp overseeing a network of sovcorp-managed functional sequences in a Technate instead of within existing nation-states. While the war in Ukraine has evidently been used by the “TechnoKings” behind Trump to develop AI weapon systems, the Trump administration has hypocritically positioned itself as peace broker. Obviously, any sane person would welcome the end of hostilities, but there is a clear subtext to the US policy shift. The Trump administration has emphasised the US potential deal with Ukraine to access Ukraine’s possible rare earth metal deposits as a “win” for US voters. He told the US public that there were “$500B worth of rare earth” in Ukraine. This is highly speculative. While Ukraine certainly has a lot of coal, oil, gas and uranium, much if that is in territory currently occupied by the Russian Federation. The estimates of rare earth metal deposits in extant Ukrainian territory were made around half a century ago and some, such as independent energy and mining consultant Tony Mariano, have significant doubts about the commercial viability or even the presence of the alleged deposits: As far as I know, there are no economically viable rare earth deposits in Ukraine. I have evaluated clay deposits that I thought had potential, but I found that they are not viable. This does not mean that there are none, but that more exploration and evaluation is needed. With regard to the minerals deposits that are known to exist in Russia’s “new territories,” including any possible if unlikely rare-earth deposits, Russian president Vladimir Putin has indicated his willingness to collaborate with the US again. In the spirit of public-private partnership (stakeholder capitalism), Putin told journalist Pavel Zarubin that Russia was ready “to offer [cooperation] to our American partners – when I say partners, I mean not only administrative and government structures, but also companies.” While Russians and Ukrainians continued to die, Kirill Dmitriev, former Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and WEF investment guru, and the current CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund — appointed in 2023 by Putin as special representative of the Russian president for investment — said that US energy corporations would welcome “access to Russian natural resources.” In 2014, the US enabled and supported Ukrainian Nazis (the Right Sector and others) to orchestrate the violent Euromaidan Coup that overthrew the elected president Victor Yanukovich. Ukrainian Nazi atrocities in Odessa and Mariupol immediately followed and marked the start of an eight-year-long war that Russian forces officially entered in 2022. From the moment Russia began its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine, the US response was focused on seizing economic, financial and resource control of Ukraine in exchange for bolstering its military. It is not unreasonable to observe that Russian intervention enabled the US public-private partnership to capture Ukraine. With the Russian government now looking forward to working with its US partners, and given that the US state was instrumental in instigating the current conflict, one has to wonder what this war has really been about. Large US corporations, such as Microsoft and Amazon, began the process of digitising the Ukrainian government on February 24th 2022, the day Russia is said to have “invaded” Ukraine. This process has since seen Ukraine become a world leader in “digital democracy.” Ukrainian citizens are being coerced towards accepting digital ID, digital payments and into total reliance on digital infrastructure for many of their everyday needs. This has been met with great enthusiasm from globalist think tanks, such as The Centre for International Governance Innovation. As Ukrainian energy and technological infrastructure became more reliant on US corporations, global investors — through the asset management giant BlackRock — agreed to deals with the Ukrainian government to “structure the nation’s reconstruction funds.” In November 2022 BlackRock announced: BlackRock FMA [Financial Markets Advisory] will advise the MoE [Ukraine Ministry of Economy] on establishing a roadmap for the investment framework’s implementation, including identifying design choices for the envisioned setup, structure, mandate and governance. The MoU [Memorandum of Understanding] formalizes the discussions the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, Larry Fink, held in September on the possibilities of driving public and private investments into Ukraine. The WEF arranged further meetings between Zelensky’s administration and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon alongside a consortium of investors represented by executives from BlackRock, Bridgewater Associates, Carlyle Group, Blackstone, Dell, ArcelorMittal, and others. With the financial architecture in place, and US and other multinational corporations set to capitalise, the emphasis shifted in early 2024 towards reducing the investment risk. War is the preferred business model for private military contractors (PMCs – mercenaries), or International Defense Companies (IDCs) as they are called in Ukraine. With Ukrainian government legislation in the pipeline to legalise IDCs operating in post-war Ukraine — coinciding with the Pentagon’s decision to ease restrictions supposedly placed on US PMCs (IDCs) working in Ukraine — US PMCs are just one corner of the US military industrial complex set to exploit the thirty-five-fold increase in the Ukrainian defence market created by Russia’s “invasion.” This is yet another tantalising Ukraine war opportunity for multinational financiers, such as BlackRock’s investors for example. Obviously, a “post-war” Ukraine is needed to turn these investment opportunities into solid ventures. With the US public-private stakeholder invasion of Ukraine complete, and the Russian public-private stakeholders ready to do business, Ukraine finds itself in a precarious position. It is almost completely in the hands of US corporations. For example, Ukraine is now heavily reliant on Musk’s Starlink for its internet connectivity and other communication systems. Indeed Ukraine’s “digital democracy” is now largely controlled by oligarchs like Musk. The Ukrainian Diia app is the product of a joint project between the CIA front organisation USAID and the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation which named Diia the literal Digital State. Diia is an “everything app.” It ties Ukrainian citizens to a centralised digital control system (Diia) through which they access government services. Their digital IDs and digital passports, driving licenses, fine levies and payments, their tax returns, tax accounts, their mRNA vaccine certificates and more can all be overseen by the Digital State. Of course, the overwhelming priority is to end the war. From a humanitarian perspective, at this point, nothing could be more important. Trump will almost certainly be credited if his apparent diplomacy succeeds and this will surely be perceived as more evidence of his great leadership by his supporters. We are supposed to believe that the Ukraine government’s stalling over Trump’s deal for US corporations’ access to Ukrainian rare earth deposits is the reason why the US has reportedly threatened to cut off Ukraine’s Starlink connectivity. The privatisation of a state like Ukraine couldn’t be more dangerous for its people. Musk was quick to point out that he could personally end Ukraine’s war effort, claiming the Ukrainian military’s “entire front line would collapse if I turned it off.” He later added this is something he would not do. Though obviously, given the Dogecoin debacle, Musk’s team fully comprehend the impact his comments have. In truth, there is a vast network of international investors looking at a post-war Ukraine with avarice. The rare earth deal is a sideshow to keep the public bemused. The whole nation state of Ukraine is ripe for the picking and the transition to a US satellite gov-corp Technate is already well underway. As previously noted, one of Peter Thiel’s long-term ambitions has been to create “a new world currency.” Fortuitously, one of Trump’s first executive orders was aimed at strengthening US leadership in digital financial technology. In it, he promised his voter base that he would prohibit “the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use of a CBDC [Central Bank Digital Currency] within the jurisdiction of the United States.” But there is a caveat: The order “shall be implemented consistent with applicable law.” As we know, legislative “laws” are subject to change at any time. Trump included in this EO a US government commitment to promote and protect “the sovereignty of the United States dollar, including through actions to promote the development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide.” [Emphasis added.] As extensively reported in the four-part investigative series on the cryptocurrency industry published last November by Unlimited Hangout writers Whitney Webb and Mark Goodwin, rather than averting the societal risks associated with CBDC, Trump’s January 23rd executive order arguably portends something far worse. As Webb and Goodwin pointed out: [T]he policy of the Federal Reserve since last year has made it clear that they favor “private stablecoin issuance rather than official CBDC issuance.” With stablecoins being just as programmable and surveillable as CBDCs, and some stablecoin issuers like Tether already allied with U.S. intelligence and security agencies, the current stablecoin bill is poised to pave the way for the U.S.’ de facto CBDC and to ensure that Wall Street and well-established titans of digital finance like PayPal have the advantage. In particular, Thiel, PayPal, Facebook (now Meta), and US financial regulators have, for some time, been preparing for “a new world currency.” In order to understand the process they have been setting up, we first need to consider how this public-private partnership has apparently shaped the financial regulatory framework in the US. Thiel emphasised the “new world currency” idea in his aforementioned 2009 article, “The Education of a Libertarian” (the piece, you may remember, that influenced Nick Land’s conceptualisation of the Dark Enlightenment). In that piece, he wrote: [T]he founding vision of PayPal centered on the creation of a new world currency, free from all government control and dilution — the end of monetary sovereignty, as it were. In the 2000s, companies like Facebook create the space for new modes of dissent and new ways to form communities not bounded by historical nation-states. By starting a new Internet business, an entrepreneur may create a new world. The hope of the Internet is that these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order. Peter Thiel sat on the Meta (Facebook) board of directors until 2022, when he left to reportedly “focus on political endeavours.” Upon his departure, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered his personal gratitude to Thiel for “teaching me so many lessons about business, economics, and the world.” In 2019, under Thiel’s evident influence, Facebook announced its intention to launch a stablecoin payment system called Libra, which it soon renamed Diem. The project was co-headed by David A. Marcus, who moved to Facebook from PayPal in 2014, and by Morgan Beller, who migrated from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Libra appears to have failed. But, as Whitney Webb and Mark Goodwin explain, that interpretation depends upon what one views the purpose of Libra (Diem) to have actually been. With an estimated two billion-plus Facebook users worldwide, if Libra had succeeded, it would have represented the potential “end of monetary sovereignty” as far as central banks were concerned. Apparently, the mere announcement of Libra’s proposition sent financial regulators into an tailspin. The unregulated issuance of “money” couldn’t be allowed to happen! Hence, Zuckerberg had to be seen being quizzed by pretty much the entire global financial and political “elite.” In May 2019, Thiel protégé Sam Altman wrote a blog post in which he said: Although I don’t think the US government can stop cryptocurrency, I do think it could create the winner — let’s call it “USDC” for US Digital Currency — and fix some challenges that governments currently face with cryptocurrency. I think the first superpower government to do something like this will have an enviable position in the future of the world, and some power over a worldwide currency. In August 2019, at the G7 central bankers symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the main topic of discussion was what the Bank of England’s then-Governor Mark Carney called a growing “destabilising asymmetry at the heart of the IMFS” [International Monetary and Financial System]. Carney told the gathered bankers and financiers that the “world economy was being reordered.” He said that the US dollar remained “important” in the short term but that “the game” must change to suit a “multipolar world.” Therefore, “the global reserve currency”—the US dollar (USD) — needed to transform into some sort of “Synthetic Hegemonic Currency” (SHC). Carney added: While the likelihood of a multipolar IMFS might seem distant at present, technological developments provide the potential for such a world to emerge. Such a platform would be based on the virtual rather than the physical. [. . .] Technology has the potential to disrupt the network externalities that prevent the incumbent global reserve currency [the USD] from being displaced. [. . .] The most high-profile of these has been Libra—a new payments infrastructure based on an international stablecoin fully backed by reserve assets in a basket of currencies including the US dollar, the euro, and sterling. [. . .] The Bank of England and other regulators have been clear [. . .] the terms of engagement for any new systemic private payments system must be in force well in advance of any launch. As a consequence, it is an open question whether such a new Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) would be best provided by the public sector, perhaps through a network of central bank digital currencies. [. . .] Even if the initial variants of the idea prove wanting, the concept is intriguing. It is worth considering how an SHC in the IMFS could support better global outcomes, given the scale of the challenges of the current IMFS and the risks in transition to a new hegemonic reserve currency like the Renminbi. So, here is Carney saying that the Libra stablecoin raised the “intriguing” possibility of creating a new SHC “backed by reserve assets” but that Libra itself was “wanting” due to the lack of clear “terms of engagement.” However, if the requisite regulatory “terms of engagement” were “in force well in advance of any launch,” Carney raised the potential to create an SHC using Libra-like stablecoins. This, he proposed, could stave off challenges from new possible hegemonic reserve currency alternatives, such as China’s Renminbi, and create a USD SHC suitable for a “multipolar IMFS.” A month after Jackson Hole, in September 2019, Zuckerberg met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to discuss “future internet regulation.” He was also invited to the White House for a “surprise” meeting. Then, in October, Zuckerberg testified before the House Financial Services Committee about the aforementioned Libra (Diem) and was invited again to the White House — this time for dinner and this time accompanied by then Facebook board member Peter Thiel. The Trump administration didn’t think it necessary to disclose what was discussed, according to an NBC News report. Immediately thereafter, Zuckerberg’s Libra project began to shift away from a stablecoin based on “a basket of currencies,” and by 2020 it was more closely aligned with the USD. The Financial Times reported in late November 2021 that Libra would initially launch as “a single coin backed one-for-one by the dollar.” Webb and Goodwin speculate, with good reason, that the whole point of Facebook’s purportedly aggressive pursuit of Libra (Diem) was not so much about the stablecoin itself but rather about creating a threat that would appear to warrant regulatory change. It appears the team behind Libra always anticipated the failure of Libra and the resultant formation of a regulatory framework for a potential USD Synthetic Hegemonic Currency. Going back to July 2019, two months before the Jackson Hole symposium, Facebook stated in an SEC filing: Libra has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. [. . .] These laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may delay or impede the launch of the Libra currency. [. . .] As such, there can be no assurance that Libra or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely manner, or at all. The fact that Facebook (now Meta) knew Libra might fail and was counting on new regulations that would open new digital financial markets could cause careful observers to conclude that Zuckerberg’s Libra project was intended to be an embodiment of “creative destruction.” While the Libra (Diem) stablecoin didn’t make it, the stablecoin market as a whole has done quite well, if one measures by market capitalization. The leading stablecoins are Tether’s USDT ($140 billion), Circle’s USDC ($44 billion), and the Ethereum blockchain-based “decentralised” DAI ($3 billion). Then we have FD121 Ltd.’s FDUSD ($1.8 billion) and USDD ($750 million), initially issued on the TRON blockchain. PayPal stablecoin PYUSD, issued by the Paxos Trust Company and currently at $480 million market cap, stands apart because Paxos is a fully regulated US custodian. What’s more, PYUSD is perhaps the most firmly 1:1 USD-pegged stablecoin, backed as it is with a mix of USD deposits, short-term US Treasurys, and cash equivalents. When the Nixon administration closed the gold window in 1971, ending the monetary system formulated at Bretton Woods in 1944, the USD became fully disassociated from any real intrinsic value (gold), though fractional reserve banking had already practically relinquished the dollar-and-gold association. The subsequent fiat currency monetary system has led to an enormous expansion of the money supply and ballooning of global debt. Those inevitabilities ultimately caused what Carney described as the “destabilising asymmetry at the heart of the IMFS.” Carney recognised that the world’s leading holders of US debt were Japan and China. Both countries have been accelerating the process of dumping US Treasury securities (government bonds). Their bond market moves further threaten the dominance of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Now Trump has come to the White House with a fiscal policy package promising low domestic taxes and higher international trade tariffs at the very time that his country’s “exorbitant privilege” — the US economic advantage gained by funding its own deficit by issuing the reserve currency every other nation needs to buy — is receding. US public spending is fuelled by borrowing — by issuing government bonds. The traditional monetary view would suggest that the only option available to the US is to massively inflate the money supply — again! But, with its staggering $36 trillion national debt, and with other national governments increasingly unwilling to buy that debt (creating a lower demand), US borrowing costs seem set to rise and exacerbate the mounting debt problem. Bluntly put, the US dollar and the US economy would appear to be screwed. Unless, of course, the US can find some other outlet to absorb its debt. If it can, there’s no reason why the monetary Ponzi scheme can’t carry on. Obviously, it will continue to have a terrible impact on people around the world, especially the poorest — including the poorest Americans. But when have rapacious oligarchs ever cared about social deprivation? The total supply of stablecoins has now eclipsed $200 billion. In the US, Tether is currently the third-largest buyer of US 3-month Treasuries and the 16th-largest purchaser of US government bonds globally. Because they absorb US debt, stablecoins are seen as the key to stabilising US interest rates. The proposed Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act has led some to suggest that it might become a regulatory requirement for USD-denominated digital tokens (stablecoins) to back their coins with nothing but US Treasury bills. If so, under Paxos’ custody, PYUSD is already well-placed to take advantage. The bitcoin (BTC) hard cap, embedded in its code, ensures that no more that 21 million BTC can ever be “mined” (that is, issued). Every four years “halving” occurs, thereby theoretically reducing bitcoin issuance. This is the polar opposite of the fiat monetary system, in which the money supply can, realistically, only expand. The resulting inflation persistently devalues fiat currency. Bitcoin, however, is inherently deflationary. It is a tempting store of value for oligarchs who have treated the fiat currency system as if it were their own fiefdom to control and have run it into the ground. Currently the top 21 holders of bitcoin collectively possess 2.3 million BTC, representing around 11% of the total bitcoin supply. At today’s prices, that is the equivalent of $236 billion in BTC holdings. The presumably pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, author (or authors) of the original bitcoin white paper and possessor of perhaps as much as 1.1 million BTC, is officially the 19th wealthiest individual on the planet, worth around $91 billion. He may not be an individual but a collection of bitcoin founders. Some believe the name was made up by intelligence officials who could be behind the creation of bitcoin. MicroStrategy, which provides business intelligence and mobile software services and whose leading shareholders are Capital Group, Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, and BlackRock, is the second-largest holder of bitcoin after Nakamoto. The third largest are the combined governments of the US and the UK, which reportedly hold $19 billion and $6 billion of bitcoin, respectively. Block.one — backed by Thiel — is the fourth largest, with more than $15 billion. The fifth-largest holder is Tether, owner of the USDT stablecoin, which has $8 billion and is the world’s largest trader of cryptocurrency. Tether has committed to investing 15% of its annual profits in bitcoin. MicroStrategy founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, grilled last March by Yahoo Finance, called BTC “the most valuable asset in the world” and “the endgame for anybody that wants to own the greatest property in the 21st century.” And, according to a blurb last October by Forbes senior contributor Billy Bambrough, who has the magazine’s bitcoin and blockchain beat, “Saylor has revealed [MicroStrategy’s] endgame [. . .] to become a bitcoin investment bank—and to buy up to $150 billion of bitcoin.” MicroStrategy investors are presumably eager to see that bid succeed. They’re aware, as is Saylor, that being bullish on bitcoin further stimulates demand for BTC and brings “the endgame” closer. BlackRock apparently agrees. The multinational investment company has seen its global asset portfolio increase to approximately $11 trillion, thanks in no small measure to its pivot toward digital currencies. Hitherto cool on cryptocurrencies, as other large investment houses have been, BlackRock now considers bitcoin in particular to be a digital asset. “We believe,” said CEO Larry Fink last October, that “bitcoin is [an] asset class in itself, an alternative to other commodities like gold.” Also, BlackRock is now among those advocating digitizing the dollar. Trump’s executive order establishing the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets has tasked that group with developing “a Federal regulatory framework governing digital assets, including stablecoins, and evaluating the creation of a strategic national digital assets stockpile.” Simultaneously, the trajectory toward setting bitcoin as the “new gold alternative” is well underway. Notably, the Swiss government has already started the formal process of amending Article 99 of the Swiss Federal Constitution to allow the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to hold BTC reserves. “On-ramps” are payment services that allow users to exchange fiat currency for digital assets like stablecoins. “Off-ramp” services allow users to convert digital assets back into fiat currencies. Using stablecoins, pegged 1:1 to the USD, greatly simplifies the process if you want dollars. That said, in a “multipolar IMFS,” Chinese and Japanese customers, for example, might not want USDs. Advances in decentralized finance technology (DeFi) are homogenizing global currencies. An effective SHC, with the USD set to dominate, is rapidly approaching. Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) facilitates cross-border payment in USDC. This is fine if you want to off-ramp into fiat USDs, but if you want Euros, you still need to deal with the USD-Euro exchange rate (market price). This additional exchange reduces speed and increases the cost of the transaction (gas fees), thereby limiting scalability to non-USD customers. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as Uniswap, make use of Automated Market Maker (AMM) DeFi. This better enables cross-border transactions between stablecoins backed by different fiat currencies. Cross-chain interoperability protocols facilitate communication and data-sharing between different blockchains. Combined with AMM advances, cross-border stablecoin transactions are consistently becoming faster and cheaper. Circle’s EURC is a Euro-backed stablecoin fully compliant with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). In 2024, researchers from Warwick Business School on-ramped in USD (USDC) and off-ramped in Euros (EURC) using Circle’s AMM. The researchers reported: Given that EURC is pegged to the Euro and USDC to the US dollar, trading in the EURC/USDC market should closely track developments in the traditional EUR/USD market. Indeed, we found that the blockchain market operates efficiently, with EURC/USDC prices staying within 20 basis points — or 0.2 percentage points — of traditional EUR/USD market prices. Furthermore, blockchain prices responded to macroeconomic information, such as interest rate announcements from the US Federal Reserve. The USD-backed stablecoins have primacy, and a USD-denominated SHC seems by far the most likely outcome. That said, some experts, such as former Binance.US CEO and 1Money founder Brian Shroder, predict a multicurrency stablecoin future. In a recent interview with CoinTelegraph, Shroder said, “We envision a global network powered by stablecoins representing all major currencies.” Equally, if interoperability protocols and AMM DeFi development continue to accelerate, such a multicurrency system is still likely to protect the USD. Those pushing USD dominance, such as the Thiel-led consortium behind the Global Dollar Network’s USDG stablecoin, with its proposed cross-chain interoperability, evidently have the edge. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) runs The Taskforce on Cross-border Payments Interoperability and Extension (PIE Taskforce). The committee was formed in response to the G20 Roadmap for Enhancing Cross-border Payments (established in 2020 with the final stage three report published in 2023 — hereafter referred to as the G20 Roadmap), which, the BIS notes, seeks to enhance “cross-border payments’ speed and transparency, while increasing access to cross-border payment services and reducing their costs.” The G20 — short for Group of 20 — is an international forum comprised of 19 member states (including the US, the UK, Russia, China, and India) plus the European Union (EU) and the African Union (AU). Formed in 1999, it is structured as a multipolar global forum of five internal groups with the aim of coordinating economic policy. The finance ministers and central bank governors of the respective G20 member states and of the EU and AU dominate G20 deliberations. An important contributor to the G20-and-BIS-aligned CPMI-PIE taskforce is Coinbase, which was accelerated into existence by Y-Combinator (see Part 1). Coinbase responded to the recent PIE consultation by making the point that all the G20 Roadmap targets could be met by properly regulated stablecoins. Coinbase observed that “a mixed-payments ecosystem” that supports “traditional bank rails and wholesale payments” can benefit from stablecoin adoption. The global digital ID network is being created from a range of “interoperable” but “vendor-agnostic” digital ID products. There won’t be just one global digital ID card or biometric ID product—such as a single facial recognition system. Instead, all such products and systems will export data using an agreed-upon machine-readable format. In the case of digital ID products and systems, they will comply with ISO/IEC 19794 Series and ISO/IEC 19785 biometric data interchange formats. Thus, it is entirely possible that a single global database, perhaps the World Bank’s ID4D or some similar global solution, could collect data from all the interoperable vendor-agnostic digital ID products and systems worldwide. The ID4D project is supporting the introduction of global interoperability standards that will be “capable of facilitating transactions in the digital age.” The International Organization for Standardization, abbreviated as ISO (not IOS), has an international standard for electronic data interchange between financial institutions. This standard, called “ISO 20022,” is explained as: [. . .] a global messaging standard designed to improve communication between financial institutions through structured, machine-readable messages. [. . .] ISO 20022 facilities interoperability and efficiency across payment systems, securities markets, and other financial domains. Its rich data fields and extensibility make it a cornerstone for modernizing global financial infrastructure. It goes without saying that the BIS — specifically its Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) — is eager to embrace the ISO’s “payments data harmonisation,” which it announced last month. As noted by CentralBank.com, “A key factor in achieving more efficient cross-border payments is the use of the same data standards by all countries, and the ISO 20022.” ISO 20022-compliant stablecoins and underlying blockchains are emerging, according to a December 2024 article in CryptoNews.com. This innovation is being propelled by the multipolar G20 Roadmap and raises the potential of establishing a global “unified ledger” — or “shared ledger” — that effectively oversees every digital financial transaction on earth. In 2024, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, recognizable by its acronym, SWIFT, reported: The concept of a new, universal shared ledger for digital payments and assets is gaining interest as a way of transforming how transactions are recorded and settled. [. . .] In its Annual Economic Report 2023, the BIS presented its blueprint for a future monetary system, envisaging a new type of financial market infrastructure—a “unified ledger”—which could “capture the full benefits of tokenisation.” [. . .] [T]he shared ledger model could potentially help to improve the cost, speed, predictability and accessibility of cross-border payments — thereby supporting the G20 roadmap. [. . .] [A]n ISO 20022-based messaging layer will enhance the shared ledger proposition. A Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) is being constructed, but, like its global digital ID counterpart, it is very unlikely to be one stablecoin or one digital asset or token. Rather, as Coinbase developers put it, the SHC will be a “mixed-payments ecosystem.” The SHC is going to be an interoperable network of “vendor-agnostic” digital tokens. Stablecoins are accelerating the SHC’s development. Interoperability, enabled by machine-readable data harmonisation, will revolutionise business-to-business (B2B) transactions. The race is on to seize control of the “new world” of regulated stablecoins. Peter Thiel and his protégés, working in partnership with Musk and others, have established a global network of tech and tech-finance companies that have been key drivers in creating a “new world currency.” That we find ourselves where we are today is no accident. In 2023, Tether’s new CEO, Paolo Ardoino, was under investigation by the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs for potential sanction-busting financial activity. He submitted a letter to the committee in which he reported yet more evidence of the close relationship between leading players in the financial technology (FinTech) development community and the US defence-and-intelligence complex. Ardoino wrote: On December 1, 2023, we launched a wallet-freezing policy designed to significantly enhance the tools available for law enforcement agencies seeking to combat illicit use of stablecoins. [. . .] Tether recently onboarded the United States Secret Service into our platform and is in the process of doing the same with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). These strategic relationships reinforce our commitment to supporting law enforcement. [. . .] We have assisted in freezing, as of the date of this letter, approximately 326 wallets totaling approximately USDT 435 Million for the Department of Justice, US Secret Service, and FBI. [. . .] We look forward to maintaining a close working relationship with law enforcement, policymakers, and regulators in shaping a secure, compliant, and resilient future for digital currencies. During the Canadian trucker protests against pandemic mandates in early 2022, commercial banks and payment providers facilitated the Canadian government’s demand to freeze protesters’ financial assets and disable supporters’ ability to donate to fundraising campaigns for the truckers. Similarly, the UK government is currently forming legislation that would allow authorities to access citizens’ bank accounts and seize control of their finances — under the guise of combatting fraud. In both of these examples of the public-private abuse of claimed authority, two mechanisms were and are needed to enforce tyranny: agreement (that is, the banks and payment providers’ willingness to collaborate) and legislation (either existing or new). But in a world of solely digital money, neither policy debates nor the passing of legislation are strictly necessary. Total surveillance of our use of money and the ability to programme our spending is innate to the “new world currency” —USD SHC. From humanity’s perspective, no matter where we reside, the most alarming aspect of digital currencies — stablecoins, retail CBDC, or otherwise — is their surveillance capabilities and, in particular, their programmability feature. Trump’s new executive order on digital finance suggests that instead of elected officials programming our money, this task should be handed over to multistakeholder partnerships. To understand why programmability is a risk to all of us, consider the words of Bo Li, the former Deputy Governor of the Bank of China and the current Deputy Managing Director of the IMF. In October 2022, Bo Li said: CBDC can allow government agencies and private sector players to program — to create smart contracts — to allow targeted policy functions. For example, welfare payments; for example, consumption coupons; for example, food stamps. By programming CBDC, [. . .] money can be precisely targeted [to] what kind of [things] people can own, and [the kinds of ways] this money can be utilised. Digital “money” can be programmed to automatically bar us from donating to the “wrong” cause or from transacting with certain “undesirable”individuals. Every transaction we make and all funds we receive will be recorded on the corresponding “ledger” (likely to be a blockchain) from which our financial activity will be monitored, analysed, and inspected. Such a system obviates the need for legislation to snoop into our bank accounts. China’s digital states — WeChat pay, and the similarly popular Alipay — are fully integrated with China’s e-CNY retail central bank digital currency (r-CBDC). China’s stakeholder capitalist approach to controlling its “customers” payments is not dissimilar to that currently being pursued in Ukraine—using its e-Hyrvnia r-CBDC—and a similar system is proposed by the Russian public-private state. The head of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, Anatoly Aksakov, told the news outlet Rossiyskaya Gazeta that the battle against cybercrime and financial fraud meant that the Russian retail CBDC — the digital ruble — would allow accounts to be blocked, depending on “certain rules.” Payment restrictions could be applied, transactions inspected and control measures taken “if necessary,” he said. Also adopting the stakeholder capitalism model, Aksakov said Russia’s “major telecom operators, cybersecurity experts and key IT companies,” alongside the commercial banks, would partner with the Russian government to put together these “new measures.” Looking to the future, he suggested “joint ventures” could include the “American banks,” adding that “Visa or Mastercard” could assist with the rollout of the digital ruble control measures. Like Bo Li, Anatolov also emphasised the social engineering potential of the digital ruble: Payments in the digital ruble can be linked to smart contracts, where the transfer or remuneration to the contractor is regulated by a computer program, not a person. [. . .] We are now focusing on using the digital ruble to control the targeted spending of the [fiscal] budget. [. . .] Should we convert maternity capital or child benefit into the digital ruble and make it so that they cannot be spent on alcohol and cigarettes? In my opinion this is a justified measure and such restrictions are necessary. The US is evidently taking a different path towards its proposed digital state, preferring cryptocurrencies and stablecoins for programmability. But irrespective of whether your government and its partners opt for the retail CBDC or the approved stablecoin route, the outcome is a digital surveillance and control system. Stablecoins are certainly no less programmable than CBDCs. Global outsourcing digital employment agency Rise observed: The programmability of stablecoins through smart contracts opens avenues for innovations such as machine-to-machine payments in IoT applications. [. . .] The future of stablecoin payments is bright, with ongoing innovations and increasing adoption promising to transform how we conduct financial transactions. These technological innovations portend much more than simply transforming “how we conduct financial transactions.” In its totality, interoperable, AI-controlled digital technology threatens to change every aspect of our lives. If it does, we should not lose sight of the fact that AI is programmed by motivated human beings who hold ideological beliefs. The Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet of Bodies (IoB); advances in machine-to-machine (M2M) payments — with AI algorithms automatically deducting digital money from our digital wallets absent any human interaction –– and an interconnected network of smart homes on smart grids paints a dystopian future few of us wish to contemplate. Unfortunately, the enabling gov-corp Technates are being built. The digital currency powered smart home concept has already arrived. This is achieved by linking IoT powered homes to digital wallets overseen by surveillance of the smart grid to which they are attached. Howard Lutnick’s—Trump’s pick for secretary of commerce — investment in Satellogic, via Endeavour, places him and his partners in prime position to capitalise on what the WEF calls the “trillion dollar opportunity” presented by the Earth Observation industry (EO). Orbiting satellite networks harvest data from digital devices and the subsequent AI analyses of the gathered EO data is set to revolutionise pretty much every industrial sector. Now in office, Lutnick can be confident in his assertion that Satellogic and its investors, including Tether, are “uniquely positioned to dominate the Earth Observation industry.” Just as cryptocurrencies, stablecoins in particular, are providing space for expansion of US debt, so to they are enabling accelerated investment in the development of the emerging “digital states.” Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, such as that being developed by Musk’s Neuralink, is bringing us closer to becoming “technoplastic beings.” It comes as no surprise that Peter Thiel is a Neuralink investor. Thiel also invests in Musk’s BCI competitors — Blackrock Neurotech is one. Again, Tether is also an investment partner of Blackrock Neurotech. There is evidently technological competition. On the one hand we have Musk’s Space X, Neuralink and X-pay, on the other we have Sattelogic, Blackrock Neurotech and Tether. But as we can see from Thiel’s investment strategy, it is the transhumanist and neurowarfare potential of BCI technology that excites technopopulist oligarchs. Competition stimulates development until the winning monopoly establishes itself. The programmable nature of the so-called “digital money,” combined with smart devices on smart grids, enabling precise monitoring of our energy use means that, de facto, “Energy Certificates” are being rolled out. Trump’s digital finance executive order does not nullify the threat posed by CBDCs. It simply diverts public attention away from the immense threat posed by programmable digital currency in general. Programmable, privately issued stablecoins are intended to avert the looming US debt crisis by absorbing US debt in cryptocurrencies. But the evident additional hope is that this tactic will give the US a head start in the race toward Technocracy. When Technocracy was designed in the 1930s, the scale of the surveillance and control system it proposed was soon discarded as unworkable. The idea of creating a bureaucracy capable of monitoring the energy use of every citizen and every business across a continent, using the technology of that day, was a fantastical proposition. Measuring a citizen’s or business’ energy usage via any kind of manageable monetary system, with expenditures controlled by linking the currency to identity, was simply not feasible. But today, not only is Technocracy finally technologically possible, the infrastructure for the rollout of Technocracy is ,as a result, being actively constructed. Technologically, such a dystopia is well within the realm of possibility. Do you imagine that the oligarchs behind the construction of the necessary infrastructure would never implement this digital panopticon? If so, perhaps it is time to ask yourself why they are building it. Is it simply because people like Elon Musk want us to live “lives of abundance”? To be clear: programmable money combined with digital ID is likely to enable oligarchs, via public-private partnership, to oversee “the science of social engineering, the scientific operation of the entire social mechanism”—that is, Technocracy. It will potentially give them total control of the distribution of “goods and services to the entire population.” In short, technological innovation has made a Technate eminently possible. The newly not-elected prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney, is among the few, in the current crop of politicians, who is closely and directly connected to the globalist oligarchy. In a interview with Juno News, given shortly before he became prime minister, Mark Carney argued for the alleged benefits of said global oligarchy: I know how the world works, I know how to get things done, I’m connected. [. . .] People will charge me with being elitist or a globalist, to use that term, which is, well, that’s exactly, it happens to be exactly what we need. Carney’s proposed Synthetic Hegemonic Currency (SHC) is intended to position the West in preparation for the emerging multipolar world order. It is obvious, therefore, that multipolarity poses no threat to globalist oligarchs. The so-called “global elite” have always been quite open about their ambitions, but Carney’s words suggest that they feel extra-emboldened at the moment. There is nothing new about their concept of a world split into more manageable “regions” or “poles,” but we do seem to be approaching the end of an inexorable path toward it. We do not have to take that path. It is not yet set in stone. Carney has openly told us that he and his globalist cronies have not haphazardly stumbled into his proposed SHC, nor have they randomly meandered into the clutches of a multipolar world order or its new IMFS. Conscious, deliberate decisions have been made, and specific steps have been taken, to bring about this state of affairs. There are people who insist that the push toward multipolarity is being led by the BRICS+ nations — in particular, the Russian and Chinese governments. President Putin and Paramount Leader Xi Jinping have been prominent advocates of multipolarity, for sure. Speaking in October 2024 in the lead-up to the 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Russia, Xi explained the multipolar vision. He said it is about fostering “inclusive economic globalization.” This can be done, he noted, by building “solidarity and cooperation” between countries. The BRICS (now BRICS+) project forms a bloc, or “pole,” of nation-states. It has already started to redesign globalism. As pointed out by former Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff, who now chairs the New Development Bank (NDB) at the heart of the BRICS+ project, “measured by GDP, the BRICS countries have already surpassed the G7 in importance.” In truth, a multipolar world order has always been the penultimate destination prior to establishing full-blown, centralised global governance. The evidence supporting this conclusion is abundant. Renowned American historian, professor, and author Carroll Quigley meticulously catalogued the activities of the British/American oligarch network that was inspired by the imperial vision of the early-20th century Rhodes-Milner Group (also known as the Round Table Group). In a 1974 interview with Washington Post reporter Rudy Maxa, Quigley spoke about the “three-power world” that the network envisaged prior to WWII. The idea was that a transatlantic bloc and a united European bloc and an Eastern Soviet bloc would dominate a global “balance of power” structure. Following a 1956 Special Studies Project directed by Henry Kissinger at the request of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a 500-plus-page document titled Prospect for America: The Rockefeller Panel Reports emerged (its copyright spans 1958–1961). The five reports in it aimed to define the problems and opportunities the US faced in the late 1950s, clarify national objectives, and develop a framework on which national policies could be based. The United Nations had already been established in 1945 (the UN headquarters was built on land donated by the Rockefellers), but, according to some of the panel report researchers, this international organisation hadn’t delivered on its goals. So, these researchers returned to the original prospect outlined by the Rhodes-Milner Group and suggested “a world divided into smaller units” [page 26] that would “consist of regional institutions under an international body of growing authority” [page 26]: The most natural multination arrangements are frequently regional. [. . .] Fully developed, they imply a joint accord on monetary and exchange arrangements, a common discipline on fiscal matters, and a free movement of capital and labor. [. . . ] We believe that this regional approach has world-wide validity. [. . .] What is needed immediately is a determination to move in the direction they imply. Regional arrangements are no longer a matter of choice. They are imposed by the requirements of technology, science, and economics. Our course is to contribute to this process by constructive action [pages 188–190]. In October 1968, the Rockefellers supported the foundation of a globalist international policy think tank — the Club of Rome — to implement the “regional arrangements” that they had declared seven years earlier to be “no longer a matter of choice.” The 1973 third symposium of the WEF is considered by the WEF to have been an important moment in its history. At this event, Club of Rome co-founder Aurelio Peccei outlined the Club’s concept of the “sustainability of global economic growth” which, WEF delegates were told, required society to reconcile “economic development and environmental constraints.” Consequently, with this in mind, the WEF adopted “Klaus Schwab’s stakeholder concept.” In same year, September 1973, the Club of Rome wrote a confidential report titled “Regionalized and Adaptive Model of the Global World System.” It proposed that the world be divided into ten “Kingdoms”—comparable to blocs, or poles. Though presented simply as an analytical computer model, the Club of Rome added a vision statement to its report: Our efforts in the immediate future will be concentrated on further use of the already developed [Kingdoms] model. [. . .] Implementation of the regional models in different parts of the world and their connection via a satellite communication network [will be] for the purpose of joint assessment of the long-term global future by teams from the various regions [Kingdoms or “poles”]. Implementation of the vision for the future outlined by leaders from an underdeveloped region in order to assess with the model existing obstacles and the means whereby the [multi-Kingdom or multipolar] vision might become a reality. More recently, World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab co-wrote, with Thierry Malleret, COVID-19: The Great Reset. One point they made in their book is that global supply chains are fragmenting due to global existential crises. They pinned the blame on a lack of cohesive global governance and offered a solution: The most likely outcome along the globalization–no globalization continuum lies in an in-between solution: regionalization. The success of the European Union as a free trade area or the new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in Asia (a proposed free trade agreement among the 10 countries that compose ASEAN) are important illustrative cases of how regionalization may well become a new watered-down version of globalization. [. . .] In short, deglobalization in the form of greater regionalization was already happening. COVID-19 will just accelerate this global divergence as North America, Europe and Asia focus increasingly on regional self-sufficiency rather than on the distant and intricate global supply chains that formerly epitomized the essence of globalization [page 79]. Shortly before the 2025 Munich Security Conference, Trump’s pick for Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave an interview to Megyn Kelly where he said: [. . .] it’s not normal for the world to simply have a unipolar power. [. . .] That was an anomaly. It was a product of the end of the Cold War, but eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet. [. . .] [F]oreign policy has always required us to work in the national interest, sometimes in cooperation with people who we wouldn’t invite over for dinner or people who we wouldn’t necessarily ever want to be led by. And so that’s a balance, but it’s the sort of pragmatic and mature balance we have to have in foreign policy. Casting the multipolar world order as a confrontation between great powers but also a “pragmatic and mature balance,” Rubio’s comments were congruent with the view of the globalist think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)—which has consistently promoted multipolarity. The CFR believes the international rules-based order (the unipolar model) is “disintegrating at an accelerating pace.” CFR fellow Thomas E. Graham sees five potential regional poles in a multipolar global governance system consisting of the US, China, India, Russia, and Europe. The CFR line of thinking is that the US can contribute to multipolarity through foreign policy that seeks to constrain China as a great power; nurture India as a power, preserve Russian power and promote European power. Europe is considered the greatest challenge by the CFR because, despite its economic and possible military might, it “lacks political cohesion.” Therefore, in January 2025 the CFR argued for a new US foreign policy mindset “to encourage Europe to assume the responsibilities of a great power [. . .], one that has the hard power needed to deal with most security contingencies in its immediate neighborhood.” In March 2025, the Trump administration’s very public press conference spat with the visiting Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was immediately followed by the US supposedly withholding military aid to Ukraine. This was met with seeming condemnation from the US’ European partners who responded by publicly announcing an €800 billion ($841.5 billion) “ReArm Europe” plan. This gives further impetus to the EU’s long-held desire for European military unification. It seems that Trump’s order not to supply US arms to Ukraine doesn’t apply to Thiel-backed enterprises like Anduril. While Trump was telling American and European voters that the US would not supply arms, Anduril was finalising a deal with the UK government to send their Altius 600m and Altius 700m attack drones to Ukraine. It is hard to say if the press conference between Trump (the former reality TV personality) and Zelenskyy (the former actor and TV comedian) was entirely staged or not. Obviously, both presidents were, at the very least, briefed prior to their quite extraordinary public row. What is not in doubt is that the trajectory of the global policy response is precisely as modelled and suggested by the think-tanks. Elon Musk’s ‘X’ social media platform is, at the time of writing, heavily promoting Trump as the global peace maker who just wants to stop the slaughter in Ukraine. Consequently, the public debate swirling across the entire western media and social media landscape is polarising opinion between those who want peace and those who argue this is short-sighted appeasement and Ukraine must keep fighting to stave off “Putin’s aggression.” Meanwhile, the globalist plans for a multipolar world order are surging ahead regardless of which of those two, pre-determined options is championed by the US or any other government. Political leaders, influential financiers, and representatives of policy think tanks across the West have evidently been planning for some time, even enthusiastically endorsing, construction of a regionalised multipolar world order. Their fundamentally globalist project is the latest iteration of the oligarchs’ persistent dream: global governance under their exclusive control. The Munich Security Conference (MSC) is ostensibly a transatlantic forum where hi-ranking so-called “thought leaders” engage in a “marketplace of ideas.” The self-appointed glitterati discuss, plan and agree security and defence policy trajectories. The theme of MSC 2025 was “Multipolarization.” In the executive summary for the Munich Security Report 2025 we are told that “multipolarization is a fact.” Again, presenting us with the idea that things just happen organically: there is no design. We are given to understand that those who are positive about multipolarity see “opportunities for more inclusive global governance and greater constraints on Washington.” Whereas, those who are more pessimistic believe it “increases the risk of disorder.” The report notes the international enthusiasm for the United Nations 2024 Pact for the Future, replete with its Global Digital Compact and a Declaration on Future Generations. Following the UN’s “quiet revolution,” the Pact is grounded in stakeholder capitalism’s public-private partnerships and “draws on the energy and expertise of governments, civil society and other key partners.” The UN Pact promises more public-private global censorship, centralised world economic and financial control partnerships (global taxation), and firmer mechanisms for global governance partnerships to seize control of nation states as deemed necessary. The MSC thought leaders conclude “for this cooperation [UN Pact] to materialize, the world could well use some ‘depolarization’.” The evident plan is for the global order to undergo a process of creative destruction to deterritorialize it in its current form and reterritorialize it as a more efficient multipolar global governance structure. To this end the MSC report notes: The next four years will show whether a more selectively engaged US fuels or contains global disorder. As other actors will (have to) step up to fill the gap, the multipolarization of the international system could accelerate. Despite US policy decisions supposedly being designed to confront and oppose China, again, as a result of the same US policy decisions, China has shown it is ready to “fill the gap.” In his MSC speech the head of China’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission — China’s foreign minister — H.E. Wang Yi said: [. . .] we should work for an equal and orderly multipolar world. [. . .] China will surely be a factor of certainty in this multipolar system, and strive to be a steadfast constructive force in a changing world. [. . .] The U.N. is at the core of practicing multilateralism and advancing global governance. [. . .] We have firmly upheld the authority and stature of the U.N. J.D. Vance address to the MSC has been reported as harsh criticism of European censorship of its citizen’s and its media, especially with reference to the censorship of US commentators. Within his criticisms, Vance also advocated construction of a European “pole”: [. . .] the Trump administration is very concerned with European security and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, and we also believe that it’s important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense. [. . .] [W]e think it’s an important part of being in a shared alliance together that the Europeans step up while America focuses on areas of the world that are in great danger. The extremely rapid response to the US foreign policy shift toward Ukraine has stimulated EU military unification and rearmament. This is entirely in keeping with the strategies and plans laid out by globalist policy think-tanks. Perhaps random events collide and every decision is nothing more than a reaction, but the weight of evidence thoroughly contradicts mere “coincidence theory.” We are supposed to believe that US isolationism is the pessimistic response to multipolarity while the more positive multilateral approach is closer aligned to the essence of the UN’s Pact for the Future. Either way, both pessimistic isolationism and positive multilateralism seem likely to accelerate multipolar global governance. Despite the different approaches, the geopolitical outcomes are seemingly indivisible. Both portend a regionalised world order bureaucracy and this has always been the planned administrative reorganisation of the planet prior to imposing firm global governance and, ultimately, global government. The Trump administration is blatantly declaring its isolationism. Trump, has publicly withdrawn from the World Health Organisation, the Paris Agreement, and the US pact with the OECD to work on a Global Tax Deal. He has imposed international trade tariffs and his toughening of US border security is apparently one of the primary reasons he was re-elected. A lot of what Trump and his staff say is rhetoric and horse-trading. A lot of what Trump and his staff say is rhetoric and horse-trading. OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann has already said Trump’s posturing was interpreted as “concerns raised.” Cormann also said the OECD would “keep working with the U.S. and all countries at the table to support international cooperation that promotes certainty, avoids double taxation, and protects tax bases.” Trump may be haggling for a stronger negotiating position, and we should certainly take his grand statements with a pinch of salt. That said, if we put all this together, what we see is a distinct narrative shift toward polarisation. It is important to stress that we’re witnessing a full-on propaganda offensive. Nevertheless, we are supposed to believe that there are real geopolitical tensions between the EU and the US, not just in relation to Ukraine, but in relation to Greenland. The European Council President António Costa said Denmark had the EU’s “full support” in the Danish government’s alleged confrontation with the US government. Trump has also made aggressive gestures toward BRICS+, warning that tariffs will rain down if the group dumps the USD. Meanwhile, one of he BRICS+ leading nations Russia has said that Trump’s “withdrawal” from the WHO risks “dangerous consequences.” Alexei Kurinney, deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Health, said that “from the point of view of protecting exclusively the interests of the United States, this is an isolationist step.” In response to seeming US isolationism, the Chinese government has also criticised the US withdrawals from the WHO and from the Paris Agreement. As we’ve just highlighted, China has offered itself as a reliable global partner to these two entities. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said: China is concerned about the US announcement to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. [. . .] Climate change is a common challenge that all of humanity must face. [. . .] The role of the World Health Organization should only be strengthened, not weakened. The stage is clearly set for the final push toward the multipolar world order. But, strange as it may seem, this very push toward multipolarity is bringing the nations closer to a single global political, economic, and (perhaps most notably) financial and monetary “union.” In other words, multipolarity, as it is presented to us, appears to be a monumental psychological operation (psyop). There have been many attempts over the years to form a North American Union (NAU), which would be composed of Mexico, the United States, and Canada. This geopolitical goal received a boost in 1994 with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but the plan stalled after receiving strong resistance by the populace of all three countries. On and off, the US government has made numerous attempts to pry Greenland away from Denmark — more often than not citing US defence needs. Greenland is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Its inhabitants are therefore citizens of Denmark and, by extension, of the European Union. In 1951, the US and Danish governments signed the Defense of Greenland Treaty, which ostensibly appeased US national security concerns. The US maintains the Pituffik Space Base — formerly known as Thule Air Base — on the island of Greenland. Greenland has never been mentioned with respect to any proposed versions of either a North American Union or a free trade agreement. The prospect of building the Praxis gov-corp Technate on Greenland has evidently reignited enthusiasm. The original American technocrats, however, did include Greenland, along with Caribbean island states and Central American states — as far south as the northernmost territory of South America’s Columbia and Venezuela — in their proposed model of a North American Technate. Prior to this year’s inauguration, Trump outlined his dreams of establishing what can only be described as a plan almost geographically identical to Technocracy Inc.’s original North American Technate. In a series of off-the-wall-sounding statements — not unusual for him — Trump indicated that he wanted to add Greenland, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama to a NAU of Mexico, the US, and Canada. He even threatened the use of force, both economic and military, to construct a geopolitical map that is exactly mirrors the aforementioned North American Technate. There is no realistic prospect, in any geopolitical sense, of this imaginary North American Technate actually being formed. But, as we have already discussed, the Dark Enlightenment and Technocracy portend a kind of geopolitics more reminiscent of the system of city states ruled by the Venetian bankers. The Venetian city state was perhaps the most powerful seasteading project the world has ever known. Trumps seemingly weird ideas about seizing control of Gaza and Greenland, as if they can simply be acquired as sovereign states, and where the sovereignty of the people living there is considered “with derision,” is the epitome of the Dark Enlightenment thinking. Forced displacement of the “unthinking demos” is meaningless if you fervently believe “the system must be first.” The North American Technate map that Trump appeared to deliberately outline first appeared on the cover of the Technocracy Study Course. Yet even the original technocrats didn’t explain how all these nation-states would fall in line with their unhinged ideas. Ironically, the technological advances that have today made the prospect of a Technate feasible have also rendered the concept of a geographical Technate moot. By its nature, global communication technology globalises. The technocrats’ notion of a geographically bounded political Technate has largely been subsumed by the globalist oligarchs’ rollout of global governance architecture and technology. The Club of Rome’s Ten Kingdom model was precisely that: a model. While it is obvious there has been a global effort to make that model a functioning reality, it is clear that the gov-corp Technates under construction will first and foremost be economic and financial administrative zones rather than physical or geopolitical nations as we understand them. The technology used to construct each digital state is common to all. Gov-corp realms may be distinct, with, for example, Amazon dominating its sov-corp realm in the West and the Alibaba-Group dominating its sov-corp realm the East, but the “patchwork of realms” will be global. The decentralisation toward the digital city state is the network enabling centralised control. The formation of regionalised poles looks more like bureaucratic reorganisation in preparation for a simplified global governance administration of realms. Nonetheless, the symbology of Trump’s otherwise bizarre imperial statements seems relatively easy to interpret. Trump and/or his close advisers want to make it clear that Technocracy and the Dark enlightenment are the ideas driving the administration. I suspect Trump will say whatever he is told to say, within reason, on this subject or any other. In my opinion, posturing as a would-be emperor probably appeals to his ego. Personally, I doubt Trump even understands what a gov-corp Technate is, but he may. Whatever the case, the communicated signal could not be made more obvious: The neoreactionary technocrats are in control. Thiel and Musk are not the leading architects of the project to establish the global gov-corp Technate. But they are firm believers and, as made men, have been positioned to lead the US in that direction. Ultimately, the digital transformation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution renders the very concept of the nation-state superfluous. The technocrats and accelerationist neoreactionaries know this. Oligarchs have never had an affinity for one nation more than for any other. The system they seek ignores nation-states completely. If their plan succeeds, the only borders that will still have any relevance to them will be those delineating the “Kingdoms” or “poles” of a much-simplified multipolar global governance structure overseeing a network of realms. Once the mycelium-like global financial network is thriving and once seamless cross-border transactions are instantaneous — enabled by a digital SHC fit for a multipolar world — then geographical political borders will cease to have any economic or monetary meaning. As Peter Thiel observed in a 2001 PayPal all-hands meeting: The ability to move money fluidly and the erosion of the nation-state are closely related. The global system of gov-corp Technates that is emerging represents the most oppressive, totalitarian system of absolute behavioural control ever devised. There will be no need for government policy when entire populations — comprised of millions of individual human beings who were born to think for themselves — can be mentally hijacked and literally programmed by corporate behemoths. But of all the psyops foisted upon us, the greatest among them is the millennia-long propaganda campaign to make us believe we are powerless. This is perhaps most clearly illustrated by the “representative democracy” charade. Recognising the staggering audacity of the globalists’ plans and the enormous resources they presently have under their command is not to be “blackpilled.” On the contrary, it is the first step toward liberation. In order to resist the maniacs, we first have to understand what they’re doing and how and why they’re doing it. After that, the only hurdle we must surmount is that of putting all of our own solutions into effect. Our solutions do not have to reimagine the world, we just have to reimagine our tiny portion of it. You don’t need to worry about energy costs if you are energy self sufficient—or as close to it as you can be. You don’t need to be too preoccupied with food prices if you grow it yourself or barter goods and services with those that do, and you don’t need to be overly concerned with exchange rates if you choose your own medium of exchange and trade with other like-minded people in your own community. International financial institutions do not control “money.” Oligarch investors do not control technological development. Governments do not control populations. Only deception, coercion and the use of force ensures these false perceptions. Deception works by bombarding people with propaganda and psyops. Coercion and manipulation are designed to convince us to accept that which we can — and must — decisively reject. Force will almost certainly be used if we do, but there are also eight billion of us. There are better alternatives to top-down oligarch control. Despite the hopes of Musk and Thiel and their ilk, gov-corp Technates are not inevitable. We need only peaceably decline to obey their demented edicts, quit subscribing to their insane schemes, and build something better.

Title: Dementia Don Has Pentagon Drawing Up Plans To Seize Panama

Yambo The Demented has directed the Pentagon to prepare plans for carrying out his threat to "take back" the Panama Canal, including by military force if needed, two U.S. officials familiar with the situation said Thursday. Via Common Dreams: According to the outlet, the officials said that U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) is drawing up potential plans that run the gamut from working more closely with Panama's military to a less likely scenario in which U.S. troops invade the country and take the canal by force. They also said that SOUTHCOM commander Adm. Alvin Holsey has presented draft strategies to be reviewed by U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who is scheduled to visit Panama next month. The officials explained that the likelihood of a U.S invasion depended on the level of cooperation shown by the Panamanian military. Trump has repeatedly refused to rule out use of military force to seize control of the vital U.S.-built waterway, as well as Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. Last week during his joint address to Congress, Trump proclaimed that "to further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal," but his administration has not clarified precisely what "reclaiming" entails. If his family wants to keep the grift going so badly, they don't want to put him in a nice memory care facility, maybe the cabinet members can do that 24th Amendment thingie? Maybe he sees a giant rabbit! After all, what Donnie Darko is proposing is a violation of international law! We know he can't read. Will Pete Hegseth act it out for him with toy boats? The Republican president says the U.S. needs to retake control of the Panama Canal to enhance "economic security," and has falsely claimed that the waterway is "operated by China." Earlier this month, the New York-based investment firm BlackRock led a group of investors in a $23 billion deal to purchase ports at both ends of the Panama Canal from a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, an agreement Trump dubiously seized upon as proof that "we've already started" reclaiming the conduit. Panamanian President José Raúl Molina countered that "the Panama Canal is not in the process of being reclaimed... The canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!"

Title: Panama holds 'firm' as US mulls military options for canal takeover

Iran Press TV Friday, 14 March 2025 5:50 AM Panama City has reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining independence following reports that US President Donald Trump is considering measures to "reclaim" the Panama Canal. NBC reported on Thursday that the White House had asked the military to come up with options to "reclaim" the Panama Canal. The American television network said the White House had directed the US military to draw up options to increase the American troop presence in Panama to fulfil Trump's desire of "reclaiming" the Panama Canal, according to two US officials familiar with the planning. In response, Panama's government emphasized on Thursday that it would remain "firm" in defending its sovereignty and the Panama Canal. "With respect to these statements, I have nothing more to say than that Panama remains firm in defending its territory, its canal, and its sovereignty," Panamanian Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha told reporters. "Let it be clear, the canal belongs to the Panamanians and will remain so," he added. The Trump administration's goal is reportedly to increase the US military presence in Panama to diminish China's influence there, particularly access to the canal. Also, in his joint address to Congress last week, Trump insisted that "to further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal." Trump's remarks came after the US firm BlackRock and a consortium of investors announced a deal to buy two ports at either end of the canal from a Chinese firm. Already, the US military has reportedly more than 200 troops in Panama, but the number fluctuates as troops rotate in and out. The US formally took over control from the French of building the canal in 1904. After 10 years the US-controlled canal became operational. In 1999, the US relinquished control and the canal was formally handed over to Panama. The artificial 82-kilometer waterway connects the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean.

St. Patrick’s Day is right around the corner and it’s time to paint the town green. In every nook and cranny of Ireland, volunteer parade committees are getting ready to unleash marching bands, colourful clubs and bonkers floats on our streets, creating a riot of sound and colour to celebrate Lá Fhéile Pádraig. To find out what’s happening near you, click on our interactive map below. Over half a million people are expected to line the streets of Dublin for the National St Patrick’s Day Parade, which begins at noon. Over 4,000 people will be taking part in the spectacle, with Grand Marshal Victoria Smurfit leading the way. Fresh from their RTÉ Choice Music Prize win, Kabin Crew will act as Grand Marshal for the Cork city parade at 1 p.m., while trad music icon Sharon Shannon will be front and centre over in Galway. Over 30,000 people are expected to watch the parade in the City of the Tribes, which gets under way at 11.30 a.m. Local sporting heroes will lead quite a number of parades around the country, with Paralympic silver medallist Róisín Ní Ríain honoured to take on the role in the Treaty City at noon and three-time Olympian Thomas Barr acting as Grand Marshal in Waterford city at 1 p.m. Limerick St Patrick's Day parade 2024.

The variety of themes for this year’s parades will no doubt result in some fantastic surprises on the day, as creative minds turn their wild ideas into thrilling floats. Showbiz will be inspiring a number of events this year, with Wicked (Ballincollig), That’s Entertainment (Clane) and Movie Magic – The Oscars (Kilmallock) among the themes. People should Bee the Change in Tipperary town or show Whatever Floats your Boat in Cobh; meanwhile, up in Donegal, Ballyshannon will be celebrating the life and works of Rory Gallagher to coincide with his 30th anniversary. As always, plenty of places are offering a little something extra as part of their St. Patrick’s Day celebrations. In Doonbeg, a dog ‘pawrade’ will precede the traditional event, as will a leprechaun chase at Blackrock in Dublin, while a charity duck race will be held in Kilcock once all the marching is done. For those who want to go a little greener on this greenest of days, a pedal-powered parade will take place in Cavan’s Mountnugent, while the great wheelbarrow parade is pencilled in for Thomastown in Kilkenny. Those very impatient folk who simply can’t wait for St. Patrick’s Day to arrive might like to know that a maritime parade and fireworks will take place in Kinsale the night before, while on the day itself, the traditional Dingle Fife and Drum March takes place at 6 a.m. – more than six hours before the main parade. On the flipside, those who like their parades short and sweet also have options – Oram in Monaghan calls itself the shortest parade in the world, while Curragraigue in Wexford describes itself as the ‘smallest’ and ‘least well-known’. A whole weekend of festivities are being planned in a number of towns. Queen Maeve is the theme for the Sligo St. Patrick’s Festival, the highlights of which include performances by Sharon Shannon and Ruaille Buaille plus an attempt to break the world record for gathering the most leprechauns together. In Drogheda, there will be a carnival, market, leprechaun hunt and plenty of music throughout the weekend.

Title: There’s more to New Zealand wine than Marlborough sauvignon

We have an ongoing love affair with Marlborough sauvignon in this country. Those lifted aromas, bright fresh fruit and zingy lime acidity are a winning combination that draws us back time after time. It has been 50 years since the first grapevines were planted in Marlborough, and the region has expanded hugely in that period. So what is it that makes this wine so special? As every visitor is warned, New Zealand has high levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun that requires the application of sun block on a regular basis. This UV light allows grapes to ripen at lower temperatures, thereby retaining acidity, while the constant wind (“our secret weapon”, one winemaker told me) keeps temperatures down. In addition, the cool night-time temperatures and warm days allow the grapes to ripen slowly and evenly. Marlborough, named “Kei puta te Wairau” or “the place with the hole in the cloud” by the Māori has even less cloud cover and more sunshine than other parts of the country. However, similar conditions can also be found in other parts of New Zealand and with other grape varieties too. Waipara and Nelson, both a short drive from Marlborough, produce some great white wines, including sauvignon. But New Zealand grows a range of other white grapes (as well as some reds) including Chardonnay, Riesling, Pinot Gris and even Albariño. All of these share the same lively acidity and succulent ripe fruit that make them a great food-friendly alternative to sauvignon blanc. One of each grape variety is featured below. Lightly honeyed with succulent textured nectarines, orchard fruits and vibrant acidity. This would go nicely with Asian prawn dishes.

March 14, 2025 19:37 ET | Source: Primior Holdings Primior Holdings Irvine, California, March 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Primior Holdings Inc. (OTC: GRLT), a leading luxury real estate development firm, today announced its full-year financial results for 2024, marking a transformative year following the successful merger with Primior Inc. The company reported $2.67 million in total revenue, a 425% increase in EBITDA, a strengthened gross margin of 87%, and a major investment in real estate tokenization technology. With total assets reaching $29.37 million, Primior continues to expand its footprint in luxury real estate development and technology-driven investment strategies. Primior Holdings Inc. Reports Strong 2024 Performance: $2.67M Revenue and Pioneering Advances in Real Estate Tokenization “These results demonstrate Primior’s ability to scale operations while improving profitability and strategically investing in the future,” said Johnney Zhang, CEO of Primior Holdings Inc. “Our 425% EBITDA growth reflects strong operational execution, while our investment in Gaia, our asset tokenization platform, is setting the foundation for next-generation real estate investment. We remain focused on enhancing shareholder value through expansion, innovation, and financial strength.” 2024 Financial Performance Highlights Balance Sheet Strength & Liquidity Gaia: Primior’s Strategic Investment in Asset Tokenization A key highlight of the year was Primior’s $750,000 investment in the research and development of Gaia, the company’s asset tokenization-as-a-service platform. Gaia aims to revolutionize real estate investing by enabling fractional ownership of assets via blockchain technology, unlocking greater liquidity, transparency, and accessibility in property investment. We plan to continue investing a significant portion of our earnings into the development of Gaia, as we believe tokenization is the future of the market. As Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has stated, "Tokenization is the next generation of markets," and Primior intends to take a leadership position in driving this revolution with Gaia. This platform is poised to disrupt the financial market and fundamentally change how people own real estate in the future. Investor Outlook: Shares Poised for Higher Valuation With total assets of $29.37 million and 3.85 billion outstanding common shares, this equates to an approximate asset value of $0.0076 per share—a figure that reflects Primior’s strong real estate holdings but not yet its full growth potential. Additionally, earnings per share (EPS) of $0.00031 provide a baseline that does not fully account for anticipated revenue growth from new developments, Gaia’s launch, and ongoing operational efficiencies.

Title: Reports: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth Requests Military Options for Unfettered Panama Canal Access

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth asked defense officials to “provide credible military options to ensure fair and unfettered US military and commercial access to the Panama Canal,” according to reports. CNN reported that the request was outlined in a memo sent to senior leaders titled “Interim National Defense Strategic Guidance,” which replaces the 2022 National Defense Strategy and will guide the Department of Defense in line with President Donald Trump’s vision. NBC News reported that U.S. Southern Command presented draft strategies to Hegseth this week and that potential strategies include “simply ensuring that U.S. ships have safe passage through the canal to restoring total U.S. ownership and operation of it.” Other options reportedly under consideration include using the U.S. military to secure existing ports in Panama, build new ports in Panama or use the Army Corps of Engineers to operate the canal’s locks. Trump’s goal is to take control of the 50-mile canal and counter China’s growing influence over the area, out of concern China could shut down the canal to American shipping and the U.S. military in the event of a conflict. Banana declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with China after Secretary of State Marco Rubio in February warned Panamanian leader José Raúl Mulino to reduce Chinese influence or face potential retaliation. Hegseth will reportedly visit Panama next month. Last week, Trump said, “a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” As NBC News reported, BlackRock is part of a group buying a 90 percent stake in the Panama Ports Company, which operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal from a Hong Kong-based firm, CK Hutchinson, for $22.8 billion. An official told NBC News the U.S. military has more than 200 troops in Panama, some of them Special Forces units working with Panamanian forces to protect the country from internal threats. CNN reported that Hegseth’s memo outlined the Trump administration’s priorities as securing the U.S. border, reinforcing the U.S.’s presence in the Western Hemisphere, and focusing on China. It also reportedly called for European allies to step up as “allies — not dependents,” called for providing military aid to Israel and continuing to arm Arabian Gulf partners, and called for greater military cooperation between Israel and the Sunni Gulf states.

Title: Trump’s Restructuring of the U.S. Empire – Tariffs, Eliminating USAID, Ending Ukraine War and more. Jack Rasmus

The policies animating sectors of the world, from the Democratic benches in Washington, to the Mainstream corporate media, to EU leaders throughout Europe, are shaking up the globe. They could lead to the end of NATO as we have known it. America gobbling up land masses in the Western Hemisphere, including Canada, and more. Dr. Jack Rasmus says that this is not an instance of Trump losing his mind. It is a determined decision to restructure the U.S. economy – the fourth in a series of other restructurings that took place since 1917-1918. The following is an excerpt of the entire discussion carried out between Dr. Rasmus and Michael Welch on the Global Research News Hour on Friday March 14. Dr. Jack Rasmus, Ph.D Political Economy, was a former teacher of economics at St. Mary’s College in California. He is the author and producer of the various nonfiction and fictional workers, including the books The Scourge of Neoliberalism: US Economic Policy From Reagan to Bush, Clarity Press, October 2019; Alexander Hamilton & The Origins of the Fed, Lexington books, March 2019; and Central Bankers at the End of Their Ropes: Monetary Policy and the Coming Depression. Jack is the host of the weekly radio show, Alternative Visions, on the Progressive Radio Network, and a journalist writing on economic, political and labor issues. His site is jackrasmus.com and his twitter handle is @drjackrasmus. Global Research: Greenland and the Panama Canal were threatened with annexation, possibly with military force by Trump. Is America turning back to the 19th century Monroe Doctrine imperial conquest, or are they making nightmare threats to get a less harsh goal? Jack Rasmus: No, the empire is consolidating, restructuring. You know, we’ve had these periodic restructurings of the American empire for over a century now. World War I was the first as the U.S., after it finished its first imperial foray offshore the continent with the Spanish-American War, 1898-1903. You know, that war was funded by taxing property owners, and it didn’t go over very well. And the U.S. imperialists knew that, you know, if they were going to participate in a conflict in Europe, which was imminent by 1912, that they would have to restructure. They could not participate in that, and nor could the U.S. empire, now beginning to economically move offshore, really play with the European empires if it did not have a position in terms of its currency and its military. So what happened in World War I was we created a central bank, the Federal Reserve, which was really dominated and run by the New York banks. That’s why the New York Fed to this day handles all the international transactions and the currency issues, you see. It’s kind of like the central bank within the central bank. And we created a new fiscal system based upon the corporate income tax, which, by the way, taxed mostly the rich. The working class was not covered because they weren’t making enough money by the income tax in 1916-17. So we had a new fiscal monetary policy. And after World War I, of course, the U.S. dollar became the co-currency along with the British pound, and the U.S. stepped on to the global stage. Well, another restructuring occurred with World War II. And in that one, obviously, the dollar and the U.S. became the hegemonic economy and country in the world. The Brits and the French had to pretty much sign over their empires to the U.S. They kept vestiges of it and then lost that. And we had a new monetary policy and a new fiscal policy, a new industrial policy, and a new external policy. So every time you have a restructuring, it’s usually related to the empire either expanding its role, participating, or the third restructuring, which followed in the wake of the collapse economic crisis of the 1970s, economic and political. A third restructuring has been called neoliberalism, occurred late 70s, early 80s, and expanded in various ways throughout it. We had a new mix of fiscal, monetary, industrial, external policies that enabled the U.S. empire to expand once again. It was really a class-based policy, neoliberalism, and it was about taming its capitalist challengers, which were Japan and Europe at the time, and weakening its non-capitalist challenger, the Soviet Union. It proved to be successful. It also was successful in attacking working class and their unions in the U.S. and the social movements and so forth. So it was very successful imperial policy. That’s how you need to understand neoliberalism. Neoliberalism, I’ve always said, is kind of an obfuscating term. It’s really about imperialism and class-based politics. So that neoliberalism succeeded for several decades, but then the contradictions, as I argue in my new book, began to intensify in the 21st century. And since the 2008 crash, and then the 2020 crash, and in between slow growth, what we’ve had is an increasing inability of the neoliberal policies to deliver for the empire. And what we have today is the empire as it’s structured here in the neoliberal period is unaffordable. They’ve got to restructure it with the purpose of reducing the cost or moving the costs to areas of the empire that are considered more fundamental and more strategic. The U.S. has decided, at least this wing under Trump, has decided that the Ukraine war at $350 billion is a waste of money. The trillions of dollars thrown into the Middle East with the war against terrorism and certain countries hasn’t produced significant results. And NATO is a waste of money. NATO doesn’t need, we don’t need to keep providing a security umbrella to Europe. And that’s what Trump keeps saying. He says, pay your own way. I mean, you know, you’re rich enough. Why are we paying your way? Well, we’re paying their way so they can maintain these nice social program and benefits for their population because they don’t have to fund a defense. Now, of course, they’re trying to realize they have to do that now. And what we’re going to see in Europe is funding warfare at the expense of welfare. That’s coming. And even their media is talking about that, Financial Times and others. So that’s in progress right now. We can return to that topic. But what it means is that the U.S. is cutting its costs, you know, whether it’s NATO, whether it’s Ukraine, whether it’s the Middle East, whether it’s the 800 bases around the world, whether it’s USAID and NED and all the other wasted expenditures, which are part of the empire. And it’s looking back into the Western Hemisphere and saying, well, you know, we’ve got to shore up our strategic homeland here, which is North America, Western Hemisphere. And that’s how you got to understand Greenland and the Panama Canal. You see, this isn’t crazy Trump. This is very conscious policy. They know what they’re doing here. What they’re doing in Greenland is they’re trying to, America’s trying to develop an Arctic strategy. It’s way behind the curve with Russia’s Arctic strategy, which is well developed. The U.S. virtually has no Arctic strategy, even though it has Greenland at the western side of its Arctic. I mean, Alaska, it wants Greenland at the eastern side. Right. And then, of course, it’s got to somehow get the northern Canadian territories in shape here for that Arctic strategy, because as the Arctic clearly is, you know, the ice cap is disappearing, it’s opening up a transition, a pathway for Russia and especially China to Europe. That’s a strategic estuary or whatever you want to call it there on the western side of Greenland. So, the U.S. wants to consolidate that in Arctic strategy, control, basically prevent the flow of Chinese commercial shipping through that pathway there. And there are rare earths in Greenland that they want to exploit. Panama is similar. Panama is about checking China. You see, China has been buying up properties and deepening its influence within the Panamanian government. And the U.S. is no, no, no. And it’s already taken moves, put pressure on the Panamanian government, which has cut a number of projects, economic projects, with China as a result. Also, the Panama Canal needs to be enlarged significantly. And Panama doesn’t have the money and doesn’t want to do the enlargement. Why? Because the new Ford class U.S. aircraft carriers can’t make it through the canal as it exists. So, it’s strategic in that sense. And in the latest development, BlackRock recently just bought up the ports on both sides of the Panama Canal as the beginning of this. And the Panamanian government is backing down and talking about more U.S. control and influence of the canal itself. So, both the canal and Greenland are part of long-term strategic moves to check Russia and to check China. And that’s how it should be seen. And to talk about the 51st state of Canada is really to put pressure on Canada, I think, to really go along with the developing of a Northern Arctic strategy and also as a way of Trump raising funds through tariffs in order to also help fund the restructuring of the empire. You see, it’s not just saving foreign aid and foreign adventures and unnecessary expenditures abroad, but it’s also the tariffs, the primary objective. There’s two objectives of Trump’s tariffs. One is to politically browbeat allies and whomever for political objectives. Like in Mexico, it’s all about really the immigration and fentanyl flows and so forth. And it works. It works. Well, we saw the same thing with Panama. It works because Trump found in his first term, even though his trade strategy failed to check China, it did raise significant revenues. And Biden continued those revenues, by the way. And Trump sees revenues as a key way of reducing the debt and the budget deficit by raising revenues, but also as a way of moving the expenditure cuts, whether they’re in Europe or wherever, or whether you raise money, to move that money into new weapons investments. You see, the US is way behind China and even Russia in drone technology and in hypersonics and ballistic missiles and so forth, and AI and so forth. Well, it’s pretty much in a big competition with China for AI. But there’s a lot of crash weapons programs that need to be funded, and the empire structure cannot fund it now because it’s throwing away all hundreds of billions of dollars every year in places that aren’t strategic to US interests anymore. Ukraine is not strategic to US interests, and even conflict with Russia is not strategic Russia per se. The big challenge to the empire is the BRICS and the Global South, which is really the most serious challenge, I think, to the empire, certainly even more so than both Japan and Europe and Soviet Union during the 80s. The Global South in the 80s was a non-entity. It was undeveloped, and it was pretty much exposed to whatever pressures the US wanted to put on it, economic or political. Well, that’s not the case today. The Global South is industrialized. It’s a major player in the world now, and it’s the future major player. And the BRICS could undermine the dollar and the currency and international payment system and so forth. And I think the Trump wing of the capitalists realize that, and they’re trying to orient to the Global South. But to do that, they got to put this Ukraine nonsense to bed, you see. And then they got to pull financially out of Europe, which they’re going to do. And the Europeans, of course, see this, and they’re panicking, right? Because now they got to raise their own industry, their own weapons industry, which is virtually non-existent, especially next generation technology weapons like AI and so forth. Europe’s not even a game when it comes to AI. 90% of all the AI patents are filed by the US and China. So Europe is the backwater of technology right now. It’s the backwater of banking. Its industry development lags the US in a whole number of ways. The US is making Europe a dependency, an economic dependency, not just because of sanctions and blowing up the Nord Stream thing, which made them dependent on US gas and oil, but driving Russia out of the European economy altogether, in which American companies are flooding in the vacuum. But US policies that have to do with taxes, even under Biden, tax policies were passed that’s just sucking money capital out of Europe right now. And on top of that, we got the tariffs now, the tariff policies, right? And on top of that, you’ve got Europe saying, we’re going to remilitarize, we’re going to develop weapons, we’re going to spend $800 billion to develop a weapons industry, which is at the tip of the iceberg, by the way. Germany is going to spend $500 billion just on infrastructure, who knows how much more for weapons. So we have this massive weapon industrialization going on in Europe. But Europe can’t produce the weapons, at least for another five years. It takes that long to really develop these factories, plus they’re way behind in AI and will remain behind. So what’s all this about? Well, the US is going to pull out of Europe and the NATO bases and that wasted expenditure. But guess what? The Europeans are going to raise bonds and raise money. And where are they going to get the weapons in the meantime? From the US. But they’re going to pay full market price now, you see. That’s the difference. Well, it will make Europe even more dependent on the US economically. This whole war with Russia was really about debilitating the Russian economy and regime change. Well, that didn’t work at all. In fact, quite the opposite happened, but it weakened Europe. And I kind of think that was always the plan B of the United States with this war anyway, make Europe dependent on it, drive Russia out of Europe altogether, not just out of energy, right? And make Europe dependent on US industry and US banks. And that’s happening. That’s happening as we speak. So the US does not have to throw money at Europe anymore, does not want to. It needs to develop its own weapons industry even more. It needs to take care and consolidate the empire in the Western Hemisphere once more. And it needs to orient toward taking care of its lake called the Pacific Ocean, you see. So that’s what’s happening. It’s a restructuring a la 1980s economic restructuring, a la World War II, 1944, Bretton Woods, a la you know, 1917-18. The empire goes through these periodic restructurings. It changes the mix of its economic policies. It forges new political institutions, global. And that’s how you must see what’s going on. Now, the problem in the US is the whole capitalist class is not united around that particular vision. You still got the old guard, the Democrats and a huge bureaucracy that’s blown up after 50 years in the US of the empire neoliberalism, right? They’re fighting back. They don’t want to change anything. They wanted to keep everything the way it is. Well, you’ve got this domestic element of this restructuring, which is, well, we’re going to cut cost the government and we’re going to move it somewhere else. And the Democrats don’t want to do that. They want to keep the, I mean, they are totally blind and terribly led and have no alternative to what’s going on, except no change, keep it the same, keep it the same. And of course, the bureaucracy likes that because the bureaucracy has done quite well. It’s really expanded over the last 40, 50 years. So you got this alliance between the Democrats and the old bureaucracy, and you got Trump, which is more than just MAGA now. They’re all signed of a new coalition there, and they want to change things. And it’s going to be a protracted fight here for some time to come. GR: Jack Rasmus, in terms of this stage of restructuring, having to face new realities in the empire and so on and so forth, I have to also ask about restructuring for whom? I mean, when he was inaugurated, Donald Trump had 13 billionaires in his camp, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Elon Musk is a major player in his team. I remember Michel Chossodovsky talking about how the COVID crisis was the excuse, he says, deliberately planned to engineer a broad economic depression, cancel millions of jobs, impoverish people with the lockdowns, and then appropriate and redistribute the wealth that remains among the wealthy. And according to a 2022 report by Oxfam International, while 263 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty that year, the world’s billionaires saw their collective wealth go up by $12.7 trillion. That’s about 42% what they had during the pandemic. Now, effectively, it’s like the 1929 stock market crash, right? Now, is this new restructuring of the U.S. economy actually being designed specifically for the status of the billionaire class in America in mind? I mean, make sure the Americans know who’s really in charge in this new restructured America, in other words. JR: Well, you know, they certainly benefit from all this, and their interest pushing it means even more money for them. So you can’t separate out the advantages and the benefits that flow to the very rich, the capitalists and the billionaires and the tech, you know, the new leading edge of capitalism. And they lever it, they take advantage of it. And, you know, that’s part of the deal to get it pushed through. You can’t separate out their interests and the whole restructuring because they’re the big beneficiaries of the whole thing. They make money when wars are started and they make money when wars are ended. And that’s what’s going on in Ukraine. You know, all this talk about minerals and everything. And the deal is really about how we’re going to, quote, redevelop what’s left of Ukraine and who’s going to really get that money. Well, it’s going to be the capitalists who get the money. Europe has its pot of money called the Russian assets, 300 billion, right? Well, the U.S. doesn’t have a pot to pay its capitalists to redevelop Ukraine. That’s what this 500 billion is about. Create a pot, right? Some of it will go to, you know, U.S. capitalists who are already deeply entrenched in Ukraine, by the way, and they’ll get that money just as the European capitalists will get some of the Russian money, right? That’s how they make money off of ending wars, just as they make money off of starting them. So I don’t think it’s a question of either war or what came first. You know, the capitalists saying, you know, Peter Thiel and all those guys saying, well, we want you to do this, Trump. It’s a very fluid thing where, you know, certain people for domestic reasons and for economic reasons and for foreign policy reasons sort of come together. Some of the many may not even know of this bigger picture, but, you know, conditions push them along in that direction. You know, as far as the COVID thing, yeah, they made a lot of money. The billionaires made a lot of money. That’s documented. That’s fact. Well, how did they make the money? Well, mostly they made it off of financial assets. Well, how did they get it off of financial assets? Well, the monetary policy was such that it gave them free money. You know, the Fed gave $4 trillion more to bankers and investors. They didn’t need it because this, you know, the COVID thing wasn’t like 2008 where you had the financial system collapse, where they threw $4 trillion to prevent the further collapse. No, no. The banks and the financial system was not in trouble in 2020, but they threw $4 trillion at them anyway. They took advantage of the crisis, you see, and stocks just blew right through the whole COVID thing in the last two years. Stock markets are up, what, 50 to 65 percent just in two years, last two years. So, yeah, these policies benefit, are always benefiting the very wealthy, especially the finance capitalists and the technology companies and the energy companies, these leading edge in the capitalist class. You know, your local real estate guys aren’t big players in all this, but the big capitalists always benefit from this. And yeah, they took advantage. I don’t know if they told Trump, you know, what to do here. You know, it’s kind of hard to make those connections, but you, it’s obvious you’ve got a huge smoking gun. The 2008-09 policies benefited them tremendously. The 2021 policies, in which, by the way, we spent $10 trillion. 2021, 6.7 trillion in fiscal stimulus, another $4 trillion in monetary stimulus, $10 trillion. And what did we get for the economy in the full two years that the economy was open, 22, 23, 24? We barely got 2% GDP growth. So, we threw $10 trillion at the economy to get an average, historical average, GDP growth, which means fiscal and monetary policy are broken in this country. That’s part of the contradictions you see of neoliberalism. They’re just not working anymore, but boy, are they funneling the wealth, both through monetary and fiscal policy, into the hands of the billionaires and all of them below them on the capitalist pyramid. GR: Would you care to comment on the selection of Mark Carney as the new leader of the Liberal Party and, you know, ultimately the new Prime Minister of Canada? I mean, he was a former Goldman Sachs banker and the governor of the Bank of Canada and the governor of Bank of England, and he reportedly directed the Canadian government on how to avoid the effects of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. On the tariffs from Donald Trump, Carney had said the following, I believe. He said that, well, he said he would go with the dollar-for-dollar tariffs and, in fact, aim it at them with the least impact on Canadians. So, do you think this is the best strategy for avoiding or diminishing the effects of Donald Trump’s tariffs? JR: Well, I see Carney as put in place there by the finance capitalists, who are not just Canadian finance capitalists, but, you know, finance capitalism just sort of breaches country boundaries, right? They want a normal, quote, normal controlled change in the restructuring of the tariff and external policies. You know, Trudeau was just a big problem. Trudeau was just aggravating the hell out of Trump, and he was a big drag on trying to contain and control the whole process of the restructuring and tariff policy going on. Carney is a person who, you know, will work closely with his finance capitalist cousins in the US and Canada and elsewhere, and they will try to bring some rationale to the whole process of what’s going to happen with tariffs and other policies as well. So, you know, the capitalists see him as the right guy to sort of tame and control the whole process that’s going to happen. Trudeau was just going to aggravate it. He was going to maybe take it out of control, you know, and cause, you know, extreme tit for tat. We saw the same exchange, you know, with Ford and Trump, you know, Ford, the Ontario guy there, saying, oh, we’re going to put tariffs at 25% on your electricity. So Trump just, you know, bumps it up to 50%. You know, he sends a signal to him, you know, you better get this guy out of the picture, right? Let’s talk with Carney and, you know, there’ll be a settlement. There will be some increase in what Canadians are going to have to pay with the tariffs, but it will be controlled. It will be kept in a reasonable range. And that’s what I see Carney as the selection and what his role will be.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading above $84,000, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. BTC topped $85,000 for the first time in five days earlier in the day before retreating. "Some renewed macro stability is seeing Bitcoin and crypto recover in tandem other risk assets," Strahinja Savic, head of data analytics at crypto advisory FRNT Financial, wrote in a Telegram message to Decrypt. "Lower than expected inflation numbers, perception that geopolitical risk is easing, among other factors, are contributing to an easing of macro anxieties and providing a tailwind for Bitcoin." Savic noted that some Bitcoin bulls had "certainly used the opportunity to buy the dip...contributing to this recovery." Bitcoin's rise came after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would vote for a Republican measure that would fund the government. A shutdown might have further unsettled markets already rocked by mounting evidence that the U.S. economy was headed for stagflation, in which growth slumps while prices rise. Risk-on assets of all stripes have been swooning for weeks as the country wrestles with the growing prospect of a trade war instigated by U.S. President Trump's tariffs on its biggest trading partners, controversial government cost-cutting measures and other macroeconomic uncertainties. On Friday, the University of Michigan Sentiment Consumer Index, a measure of confidence in the economy, fell to its lowest level since 2022. The same survey showed expectations for inflation also increasing to their highest point in more than two years. BTC's rise returned the asset to over its 200-day average just a day after it had fallen below the widely watched measure for the first time in more than six months. The average is a favored indicator among investors to consider Bitcoin's longer-term prospects. Other major crypto assets were trading well into positive territory with Solana and Chainlink recently rising 9% and over 6% from Thursday, respectively, according to CoinGecko. Solana has been buffeted in recent weeks as meme coins which favor the blockchain have plummeted. Ethereum, which has also lost ground in recent weeks, rose more than 3.5%. Major equity indexes closed upward with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumping 2.6% and 2.1%, respectively. The S&P had dropped into correction territory the previous day, meaning it had dipped at least 10% from its previous high. Gold, a traditional risk-off asset, which spiked above $3,000 for the first time in its history on Thursday, sank below the threshold on Friday. In a text to Decrypt, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto asset manager BitBull Capital, wrote that the Unversity of Michigan survey had likely pushed "investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge," and noted that BlackRock had resumed Bitcoin purchases with a $25 million investment, "reinforcing institutional confidence." But he warned of "volatility and possible significant corrections ahead."

This week: It’s spring time for Coinbase and on-chain assets. The company is going after its tokenized security white whale. CEO Brian Armstrong and his founders have been wanting to offer tokenized stocks since before the company even went public in 2021. Will they do it this time? Meanwhile: What’s that in the sky? An IPO, a new ETF? Turns out it’s both. Real world wins for Coinbase Things keep falling into place for Coinbase. This week alone, the company saw a lawsuit against it in Vermont dropped and got approval to offer its services in India. Now, onlookers are watching to see if Coinbase will get the green light to offer tokenized securities. It’s something the company has wanted to do since before it went public in 2021. If Coinbase got the OK to tokenize securities, it would be a huge boon for the already growing RWA, or real-world asset, segment. The RWA market aims to bring assets like stocks, bonds, property, or even land on-chain. Sometimes that’s been looked at as gimmicky by traditional finance types. But Wall Street has been working to reduce settlement times for years. What faster way to get there than by bringing some assets on-chain? Currently, BlackRock has dominated the RWA space. Just yesterday its BUIDL fund topped $1 billion worth of assets under management. The fund holds dollar-equivalent assets like cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Next in line is the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin, which boasts an AUM of $868 million and grants traders exposure to short duration U.S. Treasuries and reverse repo U.S. Treasuries. In the past month alone, RWAs grew by 18% to $18.3 billion, according to rwa.xyz. RWAs are an interesting, but not at all surprising, counterbalance to the global crypto market—which has dropped 16% in the past month, according to CoinGecko data. As more RWA products come on-chain, it would mean investors could flock to the safety of T-bills without having to off-ramp funds into a traditional brokerage account. But Coinbase doesn’t just want to do this on its home turf. The San Francisco company said in a blog post earlier this week it’s calling for “regulatory frameworks that match the scale of opportunity” in Europe. Perpetual futures are the vast majority of global crypto trading - but there has been no path to launch them in the US...until now. That’s about to change. https://t.co/WCUfDnu6SP — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 10, 2025 This week the crypto exchange also launched 24/7 access to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. Adding more trading hours for its products is the kind of news that will likely help pad Coinbase’s bottom line. As the company pointed out in its most recent 10-K filing: “Our largest source of cash provided by operations are revenues generated from transaction fees.” And as of the end of 2024, cash generated from operations had ballooned to $2.5 billion. That means that revenue stream has more than doubled from $922 million in 2023. On Friday afternoon, Coinbase, which trades on the Nasdaq under the COIN ticker, closed at 183.12, up 3.17% on the day. Up, IPO and away! There’s a growing list of companies rumored to be considering an IPO in 2025, but—look, a flying Bitcoin (and an excuse to talk about this news we missed last week). Last night, crypto exchange Gemini flew a Guinness World Record-breaking “aerial display of a cryptocurrency logo formed by multirotor/drones” in Austin, Texas. What do you think we’ll see first: A buzzing horde of drones snatching their record or an IPO? PROOF OF RECORD pic.twitter.com/0tno2sY1UN — Gemini (@Gemini) March 14, 2025 People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg last week that the company confidentially filed for an IPO with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. That means Gemini is the first to make the jump from the rumored IPO list—which includes stablecoin issuer Circle, crypto exchanges Bullish, Kraken, and Blockchain.com—into the actual race. If any of the other crypto companies start filing IPO paperwork, it may be a while before investors hear about it because of relaxed Securities and Exchange Commission rules. But relaxed rules are precisely why this year could see an uptick in public offerings, according to a recent Law360 column. Wen buy Bitcoin? It was another bye week for Michael Saylor's Bitcoin amassing Strategy. The company, which recently changed its name from MicroStrategy and trades on the Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, has seen its Bitcoin holdings remain unchanged at 499,096 Bitcoin since Feb. 24. At the time, the company said that it had purchased Bitcoin for an average price of $97,500 per Bitcoin. Bettors, however, are optimistic the company will announce another buy over the weekend. Prediction market traders on MYRIAD believe Strategy will confirm a new Bitcoin purchase on Monday, estimating a 76% chance that the firm’s holdings do not remain unchanged for a third consecutive week. (Disclosure: MYRIAD is owned by Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.) On Friday afternoon, Strategy, which trades on the Nasdaq under the MSTR ticker, closed at 297.49, up a whopping 13% today. Other keys Asset manager Rex Shares is nothing if not creative. On Friday, the company launched an ETF to bring Startegy’s Bitcoin-backed bond offering to the everyman. “Until now, these bonds have been difficult for individual investors to reach,” REX Financial CEO Greg King said in a statement. “BMAX removes those barriers making it easier to invest in the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor.” Earlier in the week, Rex and Osprey Funds applied to offer an ETF that would track the price of MOVE, the Movement Network token that launched in November. It’s also the same firm that filed to offer ETFs linked to Official Trump (TRUMP), BONK, and Dogecoin. Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: BlackRock’s XRP ETF Coming After SEC Lawsuit Ends, Predicts Expert

Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, Host of ETF Prime, and Co-Founder of The ETF Institute, has stoked fresh speculation around potential altcoin-focused ETFs for XRP and Solana by BlackRock. In a series of comments posted today on X, Geraci asserted his belief that the world’s largest asset manager will eventually add both crypto assets to its growing portfolio of exchange-traded funds. “I’m ready to log formal prediction… BlackRock will file for both Solana & XRP ETFs,” Geraci wrote, adding that he believes, “Solana could be any day. Think XRP once SEC lawsuit concluded.” He elaborated on BlackRock’s motivations, noting: “BlackRock is currently the leader by assets in both bitcoin & ether ETFs… I simply don’t see them allowing competitors to come in & launch ETFs on 2 of the top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets w/out any sort of fight. I also believe BlackRock will file for crypto index ETFs btw.” Geraci’s prediction marks a significant shift from BlackRock’s previously stated position on expanding its cryptocurrency ETF lineup. In July last year, Samara Cohen, the firm’s Chief Information Officer, told Bloomberg that BlackRock had no plans to launch ETFs other than Bitcoin and Ethereum in the near future. Several months later, in December, Jay Jacobs—BlackRock’s US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs—clarified that the $10 trillion asset manager was primarily focused on its existing crypto offerings, indicating that altcoin-based ETFs were not on the company’s immediate roadmap. Despite BlackRock’s earlier reservations, industry analysts have highlighted growing demand for altcoin-based exchange-traded products (ETPs), including those tracking Solana and XRP. In January, banking giant JPMorgan released projections in January suggesting that a green light for these ETPs could trigger inflows of up to $14 billion in their first year alone. According to the report, Solana-related ETPs could attract between $3 billion and $6 billion in assets within 6 to 12 months, while XRP-based products could garner between $4 billion and $8 billion over the same timeframe—assuming a favorable regulatory environment. As of March 13, 2025, nine issuers have submitted their respective applications with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for XRP-centric ETF products. These include Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, WisdomTree, ProShares, Grayscale, CoinShares, Volatility Shares, and Franklin Templeton. Both ProShares and Volatility Shares have also proposed multiple variants—including short and leveraged ETFs—indicating a concerted push to provide a broad spectrum of trading strategies for investors. Central to Geraci’s prediction is the resolution of the ongoing SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs. The asset’s regulatory status has been under scrutiny, and many market observers believe that a definitive outcome would pave the way for major financial institutions—like BlackRock—to feel comfortable launching any new crypto-focused investment vehicles. At press time, XRP traded at $2.31. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Print This week, BlackRock, one of the largest U.S. asset management firms, signed an agreement with CK Hutchison Holdings to acquire 90% of Panama Ports Company, which operates the crucial Balboa and Cristobal ports. The acquisition comes amid U.S. concerns that the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison could create a strategic foothold for China in the Panama Canal. The deal also addresses some of the U.S.’s strategic anxieties for now, yet the implications extend beyond the Canal’s waters. The agreement holds critical weight in the broader context of U.S.-China competition across the Americas. Click here for the full story in Mandarin
