U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia, the first stop of his four-day tour of the Gulf region, which will focus more on economic deals than on the security crises plaguing the area—from the war in Gaza to the escalating threat posed by Iran’s nuclear program. Accompanied by powerful business leaders, including Tesla CEO and close associate Elon Musk, Trump first visits Riyadh, where the U.S.-Saudi Arabia Investment Forum is being held. Tomorrow, Wednesday, he will travel to Qatar, and on Thursday, to the United Arab Emirates. Trumpets blared as Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman walked across an outdoor purple carpet to stand under a pavilion during the arrival ceremony at the Saudi Royal Court in Riyadh. Trump saluted during the U.S. national anthem and then stood with his hands at his sides for the Saudi national anthem. Later, he spoke with several Saudi royals. Afterward, a cavalry unit escorted Trump’s presidential limousine to the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman welcomed the CEOs of major technology companies at the royal palace in Riyadh as part of his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. Standing beside Trump, bin Salman spoke with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and OpenAI chief Sam Altman. The business leaders are expected to participate in a joint U.S.-Saudi investment forum. The American president has also stated that he may visit Turkey on Thursday, where a possible meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky may take place. This is Trump’s second trip abroad since assuming the presidency for a second term—the first being his visit to Rome for Pope Francis’s funeral—and it comes at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions. Trump and the Geopolitical Chessboard of the Middle East Beyond his pressure to end the war in Ukraine, the Trump administration is pushing for a new aid mechanism for war-torn Gaza and is calling on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire in the region. Over the weekend, American and Iranian negotiators met in Oman to discuss a possible agreement regarding Tehran’s nuclear program. Trump has threatened military action against Iran if diplomacy fails. However, aside from the potential visit to Turkey, these issues are not the focus of Trump’s current Middle East tour, as it is presently scheduled. The U.S., Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates are expected to announce investments potentially amounting to trillions of dollars. Saudi Arabia already committed in January to investing $600 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, but Trump has stated he will push for that figure to reach one trillion dollars. Alongside Elon Musk, other business leaders on the Middle East tour include BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser. Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are also accompanying the president. While in Riyadh, Trump is expected to propose a defense deal to Saudi Arabia exceeding $100 billion, according to sources cited by Reuters. The deal may include a range of advanced weapons systems, including C-130 transport aircraft. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia are expected to avoid discussing the normalization of Riyadh-Israel relations, according to Reuters sources, despite this being one of Trump’s longest-standing geopolitical goals in the region. Trump’s envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said last week he expects progress on the Abraham Accords—a series of agreements brokered during Trump’s first term under which Arab states, including the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco, recognized Israel. However, Netanyahu’s refusal to end the war in Gaza or to support the creation of a Palestinian state makes progress in talks with Riyadh unlikely, sources told Reuters. Talks at Trump’s second and third stops—Qatar and the UAE—are also expected to focus on economic issues. The Qatari royal family is reportedly planning to gift Trump a luxurious Boeing 747-8 aircraft, which will be converted for use as a presidential plane (Air Force One). The gesture has sparked controversy, as the U.S. Constitution prohibits officials from accepting gifts from “any king, prince, or foreign state.” Trump has said that after his term ends, he will donate the aircraft to his presidential library foundation.

Photo Credit: X/ @SECGov The Crypto Task Force was established by US President Donald Trump earlier this year The US is likely to get the draft of its crypto laws ready by August this year. In order to finalise these regulations, the US SEC's Crypto Task Force is meeting with industry stakeholders to voice important concerns related to the management of the crypto sector. This week, the roundtable discussion focussed on tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs). Paul Atkins, the chairperson of the Crypto Task Force, addressed the roundtable where he acknowledged that securities were rapidly migrating from off-chain databases to on-chain ledger networks, indicating the adoption of Web3 technologies. Atkins, as part of his keynote address, said that the crypto rules would comprehensively cover the guidelines and restrictions around the issuance, custody, and trading of digital assets. These assets would include cryptocurrencies as well as tokenised RWAs among others. The "Evolution of Finance: Capital Markets" was the main topic for this fresh roundtable session. Representatives from asset management firms like Fidelity, BlackRock, and Apollo Management joined the discussions with SEC officials including Atkins, Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, and Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda among others. Commenting on tokenisation of RWAs, Atkins said, "tokenisation can enhance capital formation by transforming relatively illiquid assets into liquid investment opportunities." He further added that "on-chain securities can utilise smart contracts to transparently distribute dividends to shareholders on a regular cadence." According to Atkins, the shift of securities from off-chain to on-chain systems was the same as the evolution of audio recordings that went from analogue vinyl records to cassette tapes and eventually to digital software over the decades. Under his oversight, the Crypto Task Force in the US is working to curate a rational regulatory framework that clearly outlines the rules and cautions for Web3 players to adhere to and participate in expanding Web3 adoption. "First, I intend for the Commission to establish clear and sensible guidelines for distributions of crypto assets. Second, I support providing registrants with greater optionality in determining how to custody crypto assets. Third, I am in favour of allowing registrants to trade a broader variety of products on their platforms and in response to market demand," Atkins added in his keynote address. In the coming months leading up to August, more such roundtable discussions will be held at the SEC office located in the US capital, Washington DC. The Crypto Task Force, established by US President Donald Trump earlier this year, has been tasked with formulating the US' crypto regime. In March, the task force announced that it would host a series of roundtable meetings to gather public insights on its regulatory approach towards Web3. The inaugural session was held on March 21, and the topic on the table was dubbed the "Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity". Over the last few weeks, topics like trading regulations and Know Your Customer (KYC) considerations have also been discussed at the meetings. Each roundtable session has been open for public participation, as well. According to Peirce, "the roundtables are an opportunity for us to hear a lively discussion among experts about what the regulatory issues are and what the Commission can do to solve them."

Title: Trump Arrives In Saudi Arabia To Kick Off Middle East Trip: Here’s What To Know

BySara Dorn andSiladitya Ray BySara Dorn, Forbes Staff andSiladitya Ray, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump signed a $600 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia on Tuesday that includes a major defense contract and substantial investments in artificial intelligence—as U.S. business executives made their own set of deals in the backdrop of Trump’s visit to Riyadh, the first stop on his four-day tour of the Middle East. U.S. President Donald Trump walks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during an official ... More state arrival ceremony at the Saudi Royal Court in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Saudi company DataVolt will invest $20 billion in AI data centers and energy infrastructure in the U.S. and the Saudis will purchase $142 billion in military equipment and services from the U.S. as part of the agreement, according to a White House press release. Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom would aim to increase its total investment to $1 trillion—a figure Trump has repeatedly urged Riyadh to agree to. Coinciding with Trump’s visit, U.S. billionaires, including Elon Musk, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Palantir’s Alex Karp and BlackRock’s Larry Fink attended the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, where organizers said 145 deals worth more than $300 billion have been signed, including a deal for Nvidia to sell 18,000 AI chips to the new Saudi-backed company Humain, and Saudi approval of Musk’s Starlink. Trump also announced the U.S. would ease sanctions against Syria, and a White House official said he agreed to “say hello” on Wednesday to Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former Al Qaeda member who has since severed ties with the terrorist organization and took over after Bashar al-Assad regime was overthrown in December. Trump, who raised the possibility he could ease the sanctions on Monday, said he made the decision at Turkish President Recep Erdogan’s urging, though the timing of the announcement will most certainly raise eyebrows after al-Sharaa on Monday proposed a Trump Tower Damascus, Reuters reported, citing multiple sources. Conflict-of-interest concerns swirled ahead of Trump’s visit, particularly surrounding Trump’s family business ventures in the region and, more recently, the expected announcement that Qatar will gift the Trump administration a new 747 mega-jet. Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here. Saudi Arabia debuted the company Monday. It’s chaired by bin Salman and backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund and Public Investment Fund. Former Aramco Digital executive Tareq Amin will lead the company, which will “pave the way for a groundbreaking national AI strategy in Saudi Arabia,” Amin said in a December LinkedIn post. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was also in Saudi Arabia to announce the deal alongside Amin. The defense contract includes sales across five categories: air force and space, air and missile defense, maritime security, border security and information technology and communications systems, the White House said. In addition to the defense agreement, it also includes a deal for Google, DataVolt, Oracle, Salesforce, AMD and Uber to invest more than $80 billion in both countries. The Saudis welcomed Trump with great fanfare. Saudi fighter jets escorted Air Force One upon its landing in Riyadh, where bin Salman greeted Trump on the tarmac, and a convoy of Arabian horses then surrounded Trump’s motorcade en route to the Saudi royal court. The Saudi crown prince’s decision to personally greet Trump at the tarmac of Riyadh’s airport stood in stark contrast to the cold reception former President Joe Biden received in 2022. The former president had criticized bin Salman over the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi during his presidential campaign and vowed to turn Saudi Arabia into a “pariah” state. In 2021, the Biden administration also halted the delivery of offensive weapons to the Saudi government, citing concerns about its handling of the conflict in Yemen. But when faced with high oil prices in 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Biden flew to the Middle Eastern kingdom to persuade it to ramp up oil production. He was greeted by a provincial governor at the airport and later met bin Salman in Jeddah, where the two shared an awkward fist bump. On Wednesday, Trump will travel to Qatar, where he’ll meet with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. He will conclude the trip Thursday in the United Arab Emirates, where he will meet with President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan before returning to the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, among others. Multiple Trump-branded properties and crypto deals are among those in the Trump family’s Middle East business portfolio. Among the real estate ventures in the works are a Trump golf resort in Qatar and Trump residential towers in Dubai and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. An investment fund backed by the United Arab Emirates, MGX, also used $2 billion in stablecoin issued by the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial to invest in Binance earlier this year. The deal contributed to the failure last week of a crypto industry-friendly bill that would have regulated stablecoins, as senators on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about Trump's links to the MGX-Binance deal and his personal stake in the stablecoin legislation. The White House has dismissed concerns about any potential conflicts of interest between Trump’s official government duties and his personal business in the Middle East. “I think it’s frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Friday. Trump is seeking a $1 trillion investment in the U.S. from Saudi Arabia. He told reporters in March he agreed to the trip because Saudi Arabia agreed to the investment, though Riyadh has yet to confirm the figure, and experts told The New York Times the amount is unrealistic given the size of Saudi Arabia’s economy. Qatar is expected to gift the Trump administration a $400 million 747-8 jumbo jet to use in place of Air Force One—what could be the largest foreign gift to the federal government in history, raising concerns it could set the stage for a quid pro quo situation. The White House has vehemently rejected any pay-for-play suggestions. Trump said Monday the plane would be gifted to the Defense Department, not him personally. He also said he wouldn’t use the plane after leaving office even though it would be donated to his presidential library after its tenure as Air Force One. Saudi Arabia proposed in January an additional $600 billion investment in the U.S. over the next four years, with the potential to increase the amount, though it’s unclear exactly where the money would go. The United Arab Emirates announced in March a new $1.4 trillion investment over the next decade in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, manufacturing and energy. The U.S. and Qatar last year reached an agreement to extend U.S. military presence at the Al Udeid Air Base for another 10 years. No, and it’s been noted by experts that it could be viewed as a sign of tensions between Trump and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “There’s nothing that Netanyahu has that Trump wants, needs or can give him, as opposed to, say, the Saudis, the Qataris, the Emiratis,” former Israeli diplomat Alon Pinkas told CNN. Trump has made several moves recently that have reportedly surprised Israel, including renewed nuclear deal negotiations with Iran and his agreement for a ceasefire between the U.S. and the Houthis, but not Israel. The U.S. also negotiated the release of the last American Hamas hostage, Edan Alexander, released Monday, without Israel.

Title: Saudi-US Investment Forum: Billionaires and CEOs talk Middle East optimism and spar over who's been in Saudi Arabia the most

On a panel of billionaires and high-powered CEOs in Riyadh, the competition was not about who has the most assets under management, the best returns, or the swankiest private jet. Instead, the friendly back-and-forth was focused on who had visited Saudi Arabia the most and the date of their first visit to the Middle East country. BlackRock's Larry Fink boasted of coming more than 65 times over several decades. Blackstone's Steve Schwarzman said he first came to the country in 1991 when most of the roads were unpaved. Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson admitted she was late to the party — her first visit was in 2020 — but said she has made up time by coming on 15 different occasions since. "It's always a wonderful time to be back in the Kingdom," fellow panelist Jane Fraser, the CEO of Citi, said. The event was one of many at the Saudi-US Investment Forum in Riyadh on Tuesday; the forum is being held in conjuction with President Donald Trump's state visit to the Kingdom, which said at the start of the president's second stint in the White House that it would invest hundreds of billions in the US. American investors, meanwhile, are looking to put capital to work in the Middle East. Fink, who runs the world's largest asset manager and is increasingly focused on private market investments in areas like infrastructure, said Saudi Arabia has become a capital "destination" instead of just a capital provider for foreign investors. "The emphasis on 2030 was really a statement to the world that we're going to do it ourselves," Fink said about the country's sovereign wealth fund's plan to diversify and grow different parts of the economy. Fraser said the next step for the country's capital markets would be to build a treasury function. Johnson boasted about her firm's new local private credit offering. "We could see the Kingdom being a top 10 economy in the world," Fink said of a country that produced $1.1 trillion in GDP last year — less than half of what Canada, the world's tenth-largest economy, generated in 2024. The optimism for the country's future did not take away from the general uncertainty many finance leaders have expressed about the immediate future, thanks to the Trump administration's tariff policies, though the recent agreement with China has provided hope that the new global trade landscape will be clearer soon. The bigger fear expressed by Fink is not short-term volatility — "I don't really care about the next 90 days," he said — but instead a continued reliance on public funding for long-term projects. The "vitality" of any economy, he said, is measured by the amount of private capital flowing to investments that will take years to complete. So far, those who have invested in public-private partnerships in Saudi Arabia are pleased. Schwarzman said his firm's $20 billion in 2018 from the Kingdom's Public Investment Fund has generated annual returns of 17.5%. "We have a lot of happy friends," the billionaire said with a wry smile. Jump to

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump signed a host of economic and bilateral cooperation agreements in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as he kicked off a four-day Middle East trip with a focus on dealmaking with a key Mideast ally while shared concerns about Iran’s nuclear program and the war in Gaza dragged on in the background. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi de facto ruler, warmly greeted Trump as he stepped off Air Force One at King Khalid International Airport in the Saudi capital. The two leaders then retreated to a grand hall at the Riyadh airport, where Trump and his aides were served traditional Arabic coffee by waiting attendants wearing ceremonial gun belts. “I really believe we like each other a lot,” Trump said later during a brief appearance with the crown prince at the start of a bilateral meeting. They later signed more than a dozen agreements to increase cooperation between their governments’ militaries, justice departments and cultural institutions. Additional economic agreements were expected to be inked later Tuesday at a U.S.-Saudi investment conference convened for the occasion. Prince Mohammed has already committed to some $600 billion in new Saudi investment in the U.S., but Trump teased $1 trillion would be even better. The pomp began before Trump even landed. Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s provided an honorary escort for Air Force One as it approached the kingdom’s capital — an exceptionally rare sight. Trump and Prince Mohammed also took part in a formal greeting and lunch at the Royal Court at Al Yamamah Palace, gathering with guests and aides in an ornate room with blue and gold accents and massive crystal chandeliers. As he greeted business titans with Trump by his side, Prince Mohammed was animated and smiling. It was a stark contrast to his awkward fist bump with then-President Joe Biden, who looked to avoid being seen on camera shaking hands with the prince during a 2022 visit to the kingdom. Biden had decided to pay a visit to Saudi Arabia as he looked to alleviate soaring prices at the pump for motorists at home and around the globe. At the time, Prince Mohammed’s reputation had been badly damaged by a U.S. intelligence determination that found he had ordered the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But that dark moment appeared to be distant memory for the prince as he rubbed elbows with high-profile business executives — including Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — in front of the cameras and with Trump by his side. Later, the crown prince will fete Trump with an intimate state dinner at Ad-Diriyah, a UNESCO heritage site that is the birthplace of the first Saudi state and the site of a major development project championed by the crown prince. Saudi Arabia and fellow OPEC+ nations have already helped their cause with Trump early in his second term by stepping up oil production. Trump sees cheap energy as a key component to lowering costs and stemming inflation for Americans. The Republican president has also made the case that lower oil prices will hasten an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. But Saudi Arabia’s economy remains heavily dependent on oil, and the kingdom needs a fiscal break-even oil price of $96 to $98 a barrel to balance its budget. It’s questionable how long OPEC+, of which Saudi Arabia is the leading member, is willing to keep production elevated. The price of a barrel of Brent crude closed Monday at $64.77. Trump picked the kingdom for his first stop, because it has pledged to make big investments in the U.S., but he ended up traveling to Italy last month for Pope Francis’ funeral. Riyadh was the first overseas stop of his first term. The three countries on Trump’s itinerary — Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — are places where the Trump Organization, run by Trump’s two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects. They include a high-rise tower in Jeddah, a luxury hotel in Dubai and a golf course and villa complex in Qatar. Trump is trying to demonstrate that his transactional strategy for international politics is paying dividends as he faces criticism from Democrats who say his global tariff war and approach to Russia’s war on Ukraine are isolating the U.S. from allies. He’s expected to announce deals with the three wealthy countries that will touch on artificial intelligence, expanding energy cooperation and perhaps new arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The administration this month announced initial approval to sell $3.5 billion worth of air-to-air missiles for Saudi Arabia’s fighter jets. But Trump arrived in the Middle East when his top regional allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, are far from neatly aligned with his approach. Before the trip, Trump announced Washington was halting a nearly two-month U.S. airstrike campaign against Yemen’s Houthis, saying the Iran-backed rebels have pledged to stop attacking ships along a vital global trade route. The administration didn’t notify Israel — which the Houthis continue to target — of the agreement before Trump publicly announced it. It was the latest example of Trump leaving the Israelis in the dark about his administration’s negotiations with common adversaries. In March, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t notified by the administration until after talks began with Hamas about the war in Gaza. And Netanyahu found out about the ongoing U.S. nuclear talks with Iran only when Trump announced them during an Oval Office visit by the Israeli leader last month. “Israel will defend itself by itself,” Netanyahu said last week following Trump’s Houthi truce announcement. “If others join us — our American friends — all the better.” William Wechsler, senior director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, said Trump’s decision to skip Israel on his first Middle East visit is remarkable. “The main message coming out of this, at least as the itinerary stands today, is that the governments of the Gulf ... are in fact stronger friends to President Trump than the current government of Israel at this moment,” Wechsler said. Trump, meanwhile, hopes to restart his first-term effort to normalize relations between the Middle East’s major powers, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Trump’s Abraham Accords effort led to Sudan, the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco agreeing to normalize relations with Israel. But Riyadh has made clear that in exchange for normalization it wants U.S. security guarantees, assistance with the kingdom’s nuclear program and progress on a pathway to Palestinian statehood. There seems to be scant hope for making headway on a Palestinian state with the Israel-Hamas war raging and the Israelis threatening to flatten and occupy Gaza. Prince Mohammed last week notably hosted Palestinian Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh in Jeddah on the official’s first foreign visit since assuming office in April. ___ This story has been corrected to show the Palestinian vice president’s name is al-Sheikh, not Sheikh, and he is an official, not a sheikh.

Title: The Seed 40: The best women early-stage investors of 2025

Early-stage investors take some of the biggest — and boldest — swings in venture capital. Our Seed 40 list, in its fifth year, spotlights the women who have done exactly that: find breakout talent early, and work alongside these founders to shape the future of tech. This year's honorees have placed bets across some of 2025's hottest verticals, from AI to health tech. Perhaps it's no surprise that these investors are drawn to founders with similar characteristics. Mathilde Collin, one of the new members on this year's Seed 40 and Seed 100, told Business Insider she seeks out "a delicate balance between humility, self-awareness, and self-confidence." "Enough self-confidence to inspire people to be on the journey with them, enough humility to get people to help them, enough self-awareness to work on themselves," she added. This list is compiled using data analysis supplied by Termina, a software platform spun out of Tribe Capital. Read the full methodology behind the list. Rippy says that when the world is chaotic, startups are the most nimble, which is why she's excited for this year. "The pattern of 2025 so far is highly talented teams tackling big opportunities," she told BI. Based in Boston, Rippy has built a large network of school-related founders and investors. She runs two school-centric funds, Green D at Dartmouth College and Yard Ventures at Harvard, and she's also the managing partner of Alumni Ventures, one of the most active VC firms in the world. Alumni brings VC investing to individual investors' portfolios and manages more than 650,000 members. Prior to joining Alumni Ventures in 2017, Rippy spent 14 years at the private family office Ripplecreek Partners. Gandhi's track record shows she gets results for limited partners. In under a decade, the solo capitalist has returned her first $7 million fund at a fivefold multiple, with more companies still waiting to exit. A stream of acquisitions has sped along those distributions, including Simility, a fraud-detection company which sold to PayPal in 2018, just two years after Gandhi invested. As a one-time startup founder, Gandhi decided to raise a fund in 2016 because she saw a need for more investors who rolled up their sleeves at the seed stage. Her fund, Array Ventures, helps technical founders close early sales and develop their go-to-market sales strategy. For a career investor like Dwane, AI has represented a generational shift, which is creating an exciting time to evaluate startups and founders for new investment opportunities. "The last year has been like no other," she told BI. "AI's impact is just beginning to show up in legacy industries, where the gap between what's possible and what exists remains wide." Dwane added that the industry is also experiencing a revolution when it comes to software development, which she said will allow more people to build companies. Across Village Global's three funds, Dwane's deals have a cumulative holding value of more than $16 billion. Before Village Global, Dwane cofounded the veteran-focused news site Military.com and later served as the CEO of Zinch, a university-recruitment startup acquired by the edtech company Chegg in 2011. Demirors has had a busy year launching her new firm, Crucible Capital, which invests in energy, compute, and crypto startups. Crucible ended 2024 with $36 million in committed capital from a $50 million target fund and is now oversubscribed, Demirors told BI. The firm also recently made its third investing hire. For Demirors, Crucible Capital is the natural extension of her long career as an investor outside the traditional venture capital space. Rather than spinning out of a VC fund, she built investment firms and asset managers in crypto while she was angel investing. Prior to launching Crucible, Demirors was the chief strategy officer at the digital-asset investment company CoinShares. At Crucible, her LPs are mostly builders, operators, and investors, rather than institutional investors or funds of funds. "I feel like Crucible is a bit of an anomaly and it can be challenging considering how clubby venture can be sometimes," she said. Colllin cofounded Front, a customer service platform startup, in 2013 after working as a project manager at another startup. She served as Front's CEO until October and is now its executive chairperson. Collin also angel invests in a variety of companies, which include the fintech banking startup Mercury and the tool-building platform Retool. In founders, Collin looks for "a delicate balance between humility, self awareness and self confidence," she told BI. "Enough self confidence to inspire people to be on the journey with them, enough humility to get people to help them, enough self awareness to work on themselves." DeWitt has spent her career helping companies build new transformative biotechnologies. She began in VC at the Massachusetts life sciences firm Flagship Pioneering, then moved to Sanofi, where she guided the pharma giant's investments. She joined The Engine, an MIT spinout, in 2018, two years after its launch. First as The Engine's chief operating officer, then as a general partner, she supported the startup incubator and accelerator's work with "tough tech" companies, offering an array of resources from lab space to capital for startups building in areas like climate and human health. In 2023, DeWitt stayed on the investing side of the business when The Engine split its startup support operations from its venture arm. She highlighted Engine Ventures' investment in Cellino, which announced in February plans to open a stem cell manufacturing facility on-site at Massachusetts General Hospital in partnership with the top health system Mass General Brigham's Gene and Cell Therapy Institute. Fake is a serial entrepreneur, cofounding the photo-sharing service Flickr, which was acquired by Yahoo in 2005. She makes investments through Yes VC, her firm that invests in climate, AI, health and longevity, energy, and defense companies. She's backed Etsy, Cloudera, Oura, and Adept. She was also named to the VC firm Trac's list of "SuperForecasters," or people the firm considers "extraordinary" pre-seed and seed VCs. Fake has said that this ability to spot future unicorn companies, "plus strong networks and access, is an absolute requirement for angels and VCs." Costello founded the venture fund Portfolia in 2014. The fund taps women investors to lead venture capital deals in areas such as women's health, sustainability, active aging and longevity, and startups led by founders of color. Before that, Costello was part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem for more than two decades with her work as the cofounder of the Kauffman Fellows program, an education and leadership program for venture capitalists. Costello told BI that while many venture firms slowed their investing pace last year because of market conditions, Portfolia closed 27 investments, adding to its more than 100 investments in the past five years. "Over the past year, we determined that the smartest trend was to stay consistent and disciplined and keep putting our money to work," she said. Hartz is the animating spirit behind Eventbrite's mission to create a closer world through live experiences. She's also an ardent supporter of early-stage companies. Her angel investing portfolio includes Socket, a startup focused on helping companies secure open-source software, and Nooks, which is developing a fully autonomous sales assistant. Before Eventbrite, Hartz helped develop television shows for MTV Networks and FX Networks. For a seasoned consumer investor like Green, a visionary founder is only part of the equation — when she's evaluating a potential startup investment, she's also looking for which business models are going to make for knockout consumer experiences. "The strongest businesses don't just have a great product or compelling branding — they are structurally designed to scale in a way that enhances the customer journey, accelerates inevitable behavior shifts, and creates self-reinforcing business advantages over time," Green told BI. Green founded Forerunner in 2012 and has spent more than a decade investing in early-stage consumer companies such as the fintech Chime, the vision juggernaut Warby Parker, and the healthtech company Hims & Hers. Rao's Zeal AI, an AI-powered restaurant scheduling platform that launched in November, is her latest venture in a storied career at consumer-focused companies. She first founded and co-led the e-commerce beauty site Eve.com, which Idealab acquired in early 2000 for $110 million. She's held leadership roles at Airbnb, Gap's Old Navy, and LivingSocial, which was acquired by its rival Groupon. Before Zeal, she was the CEO of the reproductive health platform Nurx, which merged with the telehealth company Thirty Madison in 2022. She's also an executive partner at the healthcare-focused VC firm Flare Capital Partners, primarily advising new and existing investments. She's using her experiences as a founder and an investor to keep Zeal AI lean and focused on driving meaningful consumer growth, even amid market volatility. "Now is a really awesome time to build if you can manage your burn because there is going to be less competition," she said. It's been over a decade since Lee coined the term "unicorn," the once-rare feat for startups worth over $1 billion. She left Kleiner Perkins in 2012 to start her own firm, Cowboy Ventures, to invest in pre-seed to later-stage startups. Since then, a few of Lee's notable exits include Dollar Shave Club, which sold to Unilever for $1 billion in 2019, and Trendyol, which Alibaba acquired for almost $750 million in 2018. Lee told BI that she loves meeting founders who are "learning animals" and have a keen desire to build relationships, absorb information, and grow quickly. "We don't require product market fit or even a fully built product to want to invest in a team. We look for a unique insight into an underestimated category, and also pedigree, or a vision, for a way better solution to an existing huge problem," she said. Wong founded Highbury Group in 2013. She invests in science-driven startups, though she has backed some major SaaS players, such as Slack, as well. Her technical background helps her assess some of the most technical startups. Wong got her masters and a doctorate in applied sciences, bioengineering, entrepreneurship, and global health from Harvard University and bachelor's degrees in chemical engineering and biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Deshpande has been building Maven Ventures alongside its CEO, Jim Scheinman, since 2014. At Maven, she makes seed investments in companies capitalizing on emerging consumer trends, from areas like fertility care (Carrot Fertility) to sustainable seafood (Wildtype). She said she's known for her "tough love" approach with founders. "I try to be the most honest voice they can have about the risks and opportunities related to the company they're pursuing," she said. Deshpande is also a board observer at Daybreak Health and Medeloop. Beyond her day job at Maven, she helps teach a course at Stanford Graduate School of Business called Startup Garage, where students devise and stress-test new business ideas. In fact, she invested in Medeloop after its founder got the idea for the AI-powered medical research platform based on Deshpande's advice during the course. Wilkinson invests in companies working to change how we work. That focus paid off big time during the pandemic as companies moved dramatically toward digital channels. To date, she's invested in over 100 companies and deployed more than $70 million in capital. One of Wilkinson's portfolio crown jewels is Placer.ai, a startup that turns location data into market research for companies. Last year it crossed $100 million in annualized revenue. A former Twitter exec and partner at Andreessen Horowitz, Weil cofounded Scribble Ventures in 2020. But she's been investing for well over a decade, making over 100 angel investments across all stages, including in Slack, SpaceX, Figma, Coinbase, Superplastic, Gusto, Tipalti, Envoy, Daily, and Carta. At Scribble, Weil invests in pre-seed and seed rounds and will write initial checks of up to $1.5 million. The rocket developer Stoke Space, one of Scribble's early investments, is preparing its initial launch plans at Cape Canaveral in Florida after being awarded the launchpad space by the US Space Force. The startup also just announced a $260 million Series C round in January, with the launch site to be ready by the end of the year. "We dig in with our founders on product, hiring, and go-to-market because these are the two most precarious — and pivotal — elements of early-stage success," Weil said. Garaizar invests with ClimaTech Global Ventures, a firm that invests in early-stage, cross-border startups using AI in the climate tech space. She's also a partner at Portfolia, a firm based in San Mateo, California. Previously, Garaizar was the chief development and investment officer at Greentown Labs, a climatetech startup incubator. One of her investments, Cemvita Factory, is a biotechnology startup that converts carbon dioxide into compounds to make products like oil. When asked about the future of her portfolio, Garaizar was enthusiastic about its opportunities for overseas expansion: "I am very excited about the international expansion of my portfolio companies such as Cemvita Factory in Brazil, Canela Media in Latin America and Spain, and Kauel in Europe," Garaizar told BI. Seseri and her firm, Glasswing Ventures, know how to cut through the hype and find companies designed with artificial intelligence at its core, not as an afterthought. She leads the firm's investments in startups harnessing this tech to drive measurable value and enterprise growth. She also sits on boards including Basetwo, a low-code platform for manufacturing engineers, and Reprise, an Iconiq Growth-backed startup that helps companies create software demos. Seseri spent her early career at Credit Suisse and Microsoft, where she was a senior manager in corporate development and led several successful acquisitions. Bashllari launched Arkitekt Ventures in 2017 to back early-stage startups advancing human health. A neuroscientist by training, she's invested in dozens of startups across healthcare and biotech, from the egg donation startup Cofertility to the gene delivery company Nanite to the brain implant maker Paradromics. She's an advisor for Harvard Business School's dual MBA and Master of Science life sciences program, having received multiple degrees herself — an MBA from Harvard and a Ph.D. from Columbia University. She said evaluating founder-market fit is particularly critical in life sciences investments. "These legacy industries have deeply entrenched structures and complexities — it's crucial for founders to truly understand the nuances of the space, the market dynamics, and stakeholder incentives to successfully build and scale their company," she said. Xuezhao studied the human mind for her doctorate in psychology at the University of Michigan. Little did she know that studying psychology would be useful for investing in AI, which is programmed to mimic how a human brain works. Xuezhao is something of a sage when it comes to AI investing. When she started her firm, Basis Set Ventures, in 2017, few other venture capitalists focused on the field. She's among the early investors in startups including Quince, Sakana and Workstream. Before getting into venture capital, Xuezhao built out the corporate development strategy team at Dropbox, using her years of experience at McKinsey helping tech companies with their growth strategies. Miura-Ko, who has a Ph.D. from Stanford and is a lecturer there, has been dubbed "one of the most powerful women in startups." As the cofounding partner of the seed-stage VC firm Floodgate, Miura-Ko and the firm made early bets on Lyft, Twitter, Twitch, and Okta. Her passion for technology started when she was a child, inspired by her father's work as a rocket scientist at NASA, and continued during her studies at Yale, where she took part in robotics competitions around the world. Her recent early investments are gaining traction. In the past year, the AI document search startup Hebbia has raised $130 million in a funding round led by A16z. As for what Miura-Ko is interested in investing in, she told BI: "We're excited about founders that are willing to look beyond immediate efficiency gains and instead envision entirely new ways of working, collaborating, and creating value through AI." Lefcourt is a two-time founder (WeddingChannel.com and Bella Pictures) and a partner at Freestyle, an early-stage venture firm that's sector agnostic and leads seed rounds with funding between $2 million and $4 million. As one of the few women to ascend to the highest ranks of venture capital, she cofounded All Raise, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing diversity in tech. In the past year, she invested in Payman, which enables AI agents to move money safely, and Keebler Health, which specializes in AI-driven solutions for healthcare providers. "Given how quickly AI is evolving, I look for founders who are constantly learning and can react fast to harness AI for maximum impact," Lefcourt told BI. Juan was one of the first 150 employees at Facebook, where she co-created Facebook Ads. She then worked at several startups, including Khan Academy, before she took the ultimate entrepreneurial plunge and founded Fundastic, which looked to provide small businesses with information on funding options. Juan previously told BI that even though Nav bought her company in 2015, the windfall wasn't massive, and she considered it a failure. But she said she gained valuable perspective from the experience that had helped her guide other startup founders as an investor. Juan said she really admired what the AI startup Perplexity was doing and wished she were an investor. "I am basically looking for founders who are like the Perplexity team, and I will just give them the money and have them figure things out," she said. Underwood is the embodiment of a builder VC, having held product, partnership, and engineering roles at Slack, Twitter, Google, and Intel. While at Twitter, Underwood started investing in startups through #Angels and personally backed companies like Color, Cue Health, and Carta. She also sits on the boards of Zillow Group and Eventbrite. In 2023, Underwood teamed up with her fellow Twitter alum Jessica Verrilli to form Adverb Ventures, a $75 million fund focused on early-stage investments. One of Adverb's recent investments, Shotsy, a GLP-1 companion app, breezed past $1 million in subscription revenue in under nine months on the market, Underwood said. As for what she looks for in a founder, Underwood said: "Founders who roll up their sleeves and just start building before waiting for permission get me excited." Solivan founded TaskRabbit in 2008 and was CEO of the online marketplace for freelance laborers for nearly eight years before it was acquired by Ikea in 2017. That year, she joined Fuel Capital, where she has helped fund Pacaso, a vacation coownership company, and Upwards, formerly known as Weecare, one of the largest childcare networks in the US. "I look for founders who are obsessed with solving a specific problem because he or she has a personal connection to it," Solivan told BI. "We call it founder-market fit." Kirsch has been interested in climate policy for nearly two decades. She began her career working for the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, where she worked with local California businesses on the state's Energy and Climate Action Plan. In 2018, she founded Powerhouse Ventures, which works with global corporations such as Google and The Rockefeller Foundation to back climate-focused, seed-stage startups working on decarbonization efforts. In 2019, she was elected a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum and began serving on the advisory board for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of clean tech innovation and programming in New York. When assessing founders, Kirsch opts for those with strong technical prowess and a differentiated approach to a major bottleneck. Her biggest win so far in 2025 has been the energy SaaS company Enverus' acquisition of the automation interconnection solutions company Pearl Street Technologies, Kirsh told BI. "Their CEO David embodies exactly the kind of founder we love to back — understated, brilliant, and deeply technical." Cadena is an engineer turned investor. She studied engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and began her career at Boeing, eventually leading a team that coordinated support for 400 mechanics on one of the first 787 airplanes. At Supply Change Capital, Cadena invests in environment, health, and diversity-focused startups, according to its website. "This is a critical time to invest in technology across the food supply chain as a driver for health, consumer preference and efficiency," Cadena told BI. "Food safety, nutrition, and cost of goods are top of mind for all stakeholders and Supply Change Capital invests in infrastructure technologies to improve the flow of data and goods." Zhang has spent the past decade building the biotech startup Verge Genomics to use AI for better, faster drug discovery. Since then, Verge has raised $180 million from top firms including BlackRock, Merck Global Health Innovation Fund, and Y Combinator. The startup also notched a deal with the pharma giant Eli Lilly in 2021 to develop drugs for the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. As an angel investor, she's backed the immunotherapy-focused biotech startup Asher Bio, which raised a $55 million Series C in April 2024, and the biopharma robotics startup Multiply Labs, which notched an $85 million contract with the Sam Altman-backed Retro Biosciences in May 2024. Zhang's Fusion Fund, which invests in healthcare and enterprise AI startups, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year and closed a $190 million fund, roughly $40 million oversubscribed, bringing its total assets under management to more than $500 million. "It's a key milestone that reflects our decadelong commitment to backing technical founders building transformational companies," Zhang told BI. Zhang sold her healthcare startup, Acetone, which made medical devices for testing type 2 diabetes, and founded Fusion Fund by the age of 25. In 10 years, Fusion Fund has invested in at least five unicorns, such as the food tech startup GrubMarket and the DNA analysis company Element Biosciences, as well as cutting-edge AI startups including You.com and Otter.ai. Xie invests in crypto companies alongside working her day job as the developer ecosystem lead at Farcaster. One of Xie's early bets, Sardine, recently raised $50 million in Series B funding. Xie highlighted her in-depth experience in the crypto industry as helping her as an investor. "I've been working in crypto full time for 11 years, so have seen a lot and found that I'm often able to help founders most as a sounding board, share what else I'm seeing out there, and help make connections to others in the ecosystem," Xie said. Before becoming a venture capitalist, Messerschmidt worked in tech at companies including Netflix and Twitter, now X, where she spent six years as its vice president of global business development and platform. A few years after leaving Twitter, she joined Lightspeed Venture Partners as a partner. In 2015, she cofounded #ANGELS, a venture capital firm founded by former female tech execs that works to close the gender gap among investors and founders. After a decadelong career on Wall Street as a bond trader, McDermott decided to turn her attention to the tech startup world. She's since become known as an advocate for female founders and an active angel investor. She was an early backer of Maven, a women's digital-healthcare company last valued at $1.7 billion in 2023. (McDermott sold her stake in 2020.) McDermott has focused on other investments in sustainability, biotech, and fintech, such as the startups Conekta and Eggschain. Later this year, she plans to turn more attention to ocean tech startups, which she sees as a "huge opportunity." "I often look for companies that are moving the needle in an impactful way for society," she told BI. Casson bets on founders with big ideas about how the workforce can work better. Her portfolio includes WorkMade, a fintech helping freelancers keep track of their earnings and pay taxes, and Elevate K-12, an edtech company working to address the nationwide teacher shortage. Casson cut her teeth as an investor at GE Ventures, where she helped incubate and operate a startup in the drone space. Then she went to IrishAngels, an angel network of Notre Dame-affiliated investors, before settling in at the seed-stage venture fund, Vitalize Venture Capital. She recently left Vitalize after over six years to pursue a new, unannounced opportunity. When Williams took a step back from tennis in 2022, she jumped into investing with both feet. The tennis champ raised a massive $111 million fund, a testament to her relationships and competitive edge. Williams invests in consumer brands and software companies that positively impact "the everyday lives of everyday people," she said during an event late last year. Her firm stands apart from traditional investors because it focuses on underestimated founders. According to a spokesperson, around half of the portfolio companies were founded by women. Banister has been seed investing for more than a decade and has backed SpaceX, Uber Technologies, and DeepMind. She was previously a partner at Founders Fund and worked at AngelList. She recently raised a $181 million fund with Arielle Zuckerberg for their firm, Long Journey. Banister told Bloomberg that Long Journey aims to "look for those magically weird people and to find them before it becomes consensus." "There's always a pocket of dreamers and weirdos. You just have to know where to look," Banister said. Before joining Ulu Ventures in 2022, Salamanca was a partner at Unshackled Ventures, where she focused on seed investing in teams with immigrant founders. From 2015 to 2022, Salamanca helped make more than 75 seed investments at Unshackled. She was also an early team member at FWD.us, an immigration lobbying group founded by Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and other tech leaders. When asked what she looks for in a startup before she invests, Salamanca said she assesses how they will use time, not money. "I look for speed of execution, relentless prioritization, and the ability to define the toughest problems that must be solved to de-risk and unlock the next phase of the company," Salamanca told BI. Liu founded the mobile game company Kabam in 2006, and she grew the startup for more than a decade until it was acquired for $1 billion in 2017 by South Korea's NetMarble Games. Since 2021, Liu has been running PKO Investments, the VC fund she cofounded that focuses on early-stage startups at the intersection of tech and entertainment in sectors including the metaverse, Web3, crypto, the creator economy, gaming, and social media. So far her fund has raised more than $27 million from over 370 investors, and written checks to 33 startups, including Roboto Games, Lovo, and Pixels. Klein is the founding partner of Bloomberg Beta, the venture arm of Bloomberg. Before helping to launch the firm, she led several initiatives at Bloomberg. She previously worked at SoftBank, leading the division that reviewed new investments and VC firms MC Group and Knowledge Universe. Bloomberg Beta has been at the forefront of AI, investing in the space long before it was in vogue. She continues to be excited about this area. "As a firm that has been investing in the future of work since 2013 and AI since 2014, it's rewarding to see new opportunities continue to emerge that make work better," Klein told BI. She highlighted startups such as Bluefish, which helps brands navigate the new world of LLMs, Folio, which enables employers to hire job-ready students, and Synaptic, which uses AI agents to optimize Salesforce integrations. Dua tried on many hats throughout her career before settling on venture capital. She spent six years as an M&A lawyer at the Australian law firm Blake Dawson before moving to Bain & Co. as a management consultant, and then to the internet provider AOL, where she managed its pop culture website Cambio. At AOL, Dua created Built by Girls, a software platform that connected young women with tech professionals. Then, backed by AOL, she cofounded BBG Ventures, using that acronym to invest in companies with one or more female founders. BBG Ventures spun out of AOL in late 2018. The firm now invests at the pre-seed and seed stages in often overlooked founders tackling areas like healthcare, education, and financial security. Spring Health, which Dua first backed in 2018, raised a $100 million Series E round at a $3.3 billion valuation in July. After a stint in management consulting at Bain, Barna cofounded the subscription company Birchbox in 2010. She moved over to the investing side in 2016 to join First Round Capital to lead its New York office, where she has focused on commerce, supply chain, climate, and healthcare. "Right now, I'm most excited about a wave of seed-stage companies (still in stealth) applying AI to transform healthcare operations and patient experience," Barna told BI. "These founders are tackling real-world pain points with potential for outsized impact on cost and quality of care." Interactive development by Annie Fu and Randy Yeip. Jump to

Title: Trump says he will end Syria sanctions during Saudi visit marked by big money deals

By Aya Batrawy , Franco Ordoñez President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speak during a meeting at the Royal Palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 13, 2025. Brendan Smialowski/AFP hide caption RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — President Trump on Tuesday said he would order an end to sanctions on Syria in place since 1979, and the White House said he would briefly meet Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Thursday, a dramatic about-turn in U.S. policy toward a man who until recently led a group the United States labeled a terrorist organization. "There is a new government that will hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace," Trump said to extended applause at an investment conference in Riyadh, where he made the first major foreign policy address of his second term. Until earlier this year, Sharaa led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — a group linked to al-Qaeda — which overthrew Bashar al-Assad's government. Sharaa was named head of a new interim government in January and has worked since then to build international legitimacy. It was an early moment of diplomacy in Trump's first official overseas trip, which has otherwise been defined by business deals. Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia accompanied by a massive delegation of top U.S. CEOs and members of his Cabinet who reflect the array of business and security interests underpinning relations with the kingdom. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speak during a meeting at the Royal Palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 13, 2025. Alex Brandon/AP hide caption Saudi Arabia is no longer just a key oil producer in the world, but a country in transition looking to diversify its economy, position itself as a mediator on the global stage and spur new industries that can create millions of jobs for young Saudis. To do this, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is rebranding the country and embarking on a massive social transformation that's liberalizing society, all while looking to the U.S. to maintain its role as security guarantor in the region. This intertwining calculus was on display in the deals inked during Trump's visit to Riyadh. Trump called the crown prince an "incredible man" and said he wants to strengthen the bilateral relationship. "It is more powerful than ever before -- and by the way, it will remain that way. We don't go in and out like other people," Trump said. The trip kicked off with the crown prince greeting the president with a handshake on the tarmac as Trump stepped off Air Force One. That's a departure from former President Joe Biden, who in 2022 avoided shaking hands with the crown prince on camera, instead giving him a fist bump. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman greets President Trump in Riyadh on May 13, 2025. Brendan Smialowski/AFP hide caption That was viewed as a snub in the region, but at home was derided as capitulation after the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi — an operation that U.S. intelligence assessed had been approved by the crown prince. Biden had raised the issue of human rights during that trip, something Trump is not expected to bring up in conversation. Trump said gains in the region can come from within, not through the interventions of "nation builders, neocons or liberal nonprofits" from the West. He said a new generation of leaders in the Middle East was "transcending the ancient conflicts of tired divisions of the past" and defining the region "by commerce, not chaos, where it exports technology not terrorism, and where people of different nations, religions and creeds, are building cities together, not bombing each other out of existence. We don't want that," he said. This is very much a trip underpinned by big business deals, and drew a roster of who's-who to Riyadh, including Elon Musk, who runs Tesla and SpaceX, the CEOs of AI companies like Palantir and OpenAI, chipmaker Nvidia, as well as Google, Coca-Cola, Boeing and other major U.S. weapons manufacturers, as well as asset management firms like Blackstone and BlackRock. Trump had announced Saudi Arabia as his first overseas state visit after a call with the crown prince in January, during which Prince Mohammed said the kingdom would invest at least $600 billion into the U.S. over the next four years. The White House announced some of those pledges on Tuesday, including: Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are directed to greet the Saudi Crown Prince at the Royal Court in Riyadh on May 13, 2025. Brendan Smialowski/AFP hide caption During most of Biden's term, sales of precision-guided munitions had been paused over concerns about Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. The Saudis now see an opportunity to upgrade all of their systems and for additional weaponry and more high-tech planes, said Elizabeth Dent, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "They see Trump as a businessman, as a very transactional diplomatic character, who if you're willing to name the right price of investment into the United States, he is willing to make concessions that other American presidents likely would not have," Dent said. The crown prince also wants to build a civilian nuclear program with U.S. technology, and those discussions are moving ahead under Trump. That's something that had been tied to Saudi Arabia establishing relations with Israel, but the kingdom has been clear it will not move ahead with normalization without Israel stopping its war in Gaza and creating a pathway to Palestinian statehood. The current far-right government in Israel is rejecting both, and has been planning an even larger-scale invasion of Gaza amid a devastating blockade that is starving people there, according to the latest findings by independent experts on famine. Trump said it was his "fervent hope, wish — and even my dream" for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel by joining the Abraham Accords. "I really think it's going to be something special. But you'll do it in your own time and that's what I want, that's what you want, and that's the way it's going to be," Trump said. President Donald Trump walks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during an arrival ceremony at the Royal Terminal of King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh on Tuesday. Alex Brandon/AP hide caption Huge amounts of money from the Gulf have flowed into Trump's orbit since he was first elected president nearly nine years ago. Just weeks ago, his son, Eric Trump, who runs the Trump Organization, was in the region for the launch of two new projects with a Saudi developer: A high-rise Trump hotel tower that will have the world's highest pool, and a sprawling Trump golf course with villas in Doha, Qatar. That's in addition to other Trump towers and projects underway in Saudi Arabia and Oman. While president, Trump's investments and assets are in a trust managed by his children. Still, these deals and others have drawn criticism. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has previously secured a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund — overseen by the Saudi crown prince. It helped Kushner launch his private equity fund just months after leaving the White House where he was adviser to Trump in his first term. Mamoun Fandy, director of the London Global Strategy Institute think tank, said these family business deals compromise the image of the office Trump holds. "In the past, the presidency used to cost the president his financial well-being, if you will, that most people have to declare their assets and make sure they are separated from his office," Fandy said. "Now everything is conflated." The latest gesture came from Qatar, which has offered the president a new Boeing jet to use while the aging Air Force One fleet is overhauled. When asked by reporters about this before heading to the Gulf on Monday, Trump said he appreciated the offer. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman walk during an arrival ceremony at the Royal Palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Alex Brandon/AP hide caption "I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, 'No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane,' " he said. The offer has drawn outrage by Democrats aghast at the suggestion of such a large gift from a foreign country. Meanwhile, investments from the Gulf keep coming. The latest deal included the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture called World Liberty Financial. It's co-founded by Zack Witkoff, whose father is Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Mideast. Just days ago, an Abu Dhabi firm used World Liberty's stablecoin to close a $2 billion investment into crypto exchange, Binance. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters it's ridiculous to even suggest Trump is making money off being president. "He left a life of luxury and a life of running a very successful real estate empire for public service, not just once, but twice," she said. In his remarks, Trump did not speak extensively about the war in Gaza, where the health ministry says Israeli attacks have killed nearly 53,000 people, a third of them children. "The people of Gaza deserve a much better future, but that cannot occur as long as their leaders choose to kidnap, torture and target innocent men, women and children for political ends," Trump said. Trump's team held direct talks with Hamas in Qatar, leading to the freeing of Israeli-American soldier and hostage, Edan Alexander, on Monday. His release from Gaza is putting pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to return in earnest to negotiations to end the war, and change course on his government's plans to permanently occupy the Gaza Strip. Arab Gulf states also want to see Trump's team give adequate time to Iran for negotiations over its nuclear enrichment and missile program. There's still a lot of uncertainty around the talks. "The administration has given very inconsistent signals about whether, ultimately, it would agree to an arrangement in which Iran would be able to continue domestic enrichment," said Daniel Shapiro, a fellow with the Atlantic Council and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Mideast. In his speech, Trump said he wants to make a deal with Iran that would end its nuclear ambitions, but warned he would "inflict massive, maximum pressure" if Iran rejects a deal. "This is an offer that will not last forever," Trump said. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: Big money deals, pomp and delicate diplomacy mark Trump's trip to Saudi Arabia

By Aya Batrawy , Franco Ordoñez President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speak during a meeting at the Royal Palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 13, 2025. Brendan Smialowski/AFP hide caption RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — President Trump on Tuesday said he would order an end to sanctions on Syria in place since 1979, and the White House said he would briefly meet Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Thursday, a dramatic about-turn in U.S. policy toward a man who until recently led a group the United States labeled a terrorist organization. "There is a new government that will hopefully succeed in stabilizing the country and keeping peace," Trump said to extended applause at an investment conference in Riyadh, where he made the first major foreign policy address of his second term. Until earlier this year, Sharaa led Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — a group linked to al-Qaeda — which overthrew Bashar al-Assad's government. Sharaa was named head of a new interim government in January and has worked since then to build international legitimacy. It was an early moment of diplomacy in Trump's first official overseas trip, which has otherwise been defined by business deals. Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia accompanied by a massive delegation of top U.S. CEOs and members of his Cabinet who reflect the array of business and security interests underpinning relations with the kingdom. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speak during a meeting at the Royal Palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 13, 2025. Alex Brandon/AP hide caption Saudi Arabia is no longer just a key oil producer in the world, but a country in transition looking to diversify its economy, position itself as a mediator on the global stage and spur new industries that can create millions of jobs for young Saudis. To do this, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is rebranding the country and embarking on a massive social transformation that's liberalizing society, all while looking to the U.S. to maintain its role as security guarantor in the region. This intertwining calculus was on display in the deals inked during Trump's visit to Riyadh. Trump called the crown prince an "incredible man" and said he wants to strengthen the bilateral relationship. "It is more powerful than ever before -- and by the way, it will remain that way. We don't go in and out like other people," Trump said. The trip kicked off with the crown prince greeting the president with a handshake on the tarmac as Trump stepped off Air Force One. That's a departure from former President Joe Biden, who in 2022 avoided shaking hands with the crown prince on camera, instead giving him a fist bump. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman greets President Trump in Riyadh on May 13, 2025. Brendan Smialowski/AFP hide caption That was viewed as a snub in the region, but at home was derided as capitulation after the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi — an operation that U.S. intelligence assessed had been approved by the crown prince. Biden had raised the issue of human rights during that trip, something Trump is not expected to bring up in conversation. Trump said gains in the region can come from within, not through the interventions of "nation builders, neocons or liberal nonprofits" from the West. He said a new generation of leaders in the Middle East was "transcending the ancient conflicts of tired divisions of the past" and defining the region "by commerce, not chaos, where it exports technology not terrorism, and where people of different nations, religions and creeds, are building cities together, not bombing each other out of existence. We don't want that," he said. This is very much a trip underpinned by big business deals, and drew a roster of who's-who to Riyadh, including Elon Musk, who runs Tesla and SpaceX, the CEOs of AI companies like Palantir and OpenAI, chipmaker Nvidia, as well as Google, Coca-Cola, Boeing and other major U.S. weapons manufacturers, as well as asset management firms like Blackstone and BlackRock. Trump had announced Saudi Arabia as his first overseas state visit after a call with the crown prince in January, during which Prince Mohammed said the kingdom would invest at least $600 billion into the U.S. over the next four years. The White House announced some of those pledges on Tuesday, including: Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are directed to greet the Saudi Crown Prince at the Royal Court in Riyadh on May 13, 2025. Brendan Smialowski/AFP hide caption During most of Biden's term, sales of precision-guided munitions had been paused over concerns about Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. The Saudis now see an opportunity to upgrade all of their systems and for additional weaponry and more high-tech planes, said Elizabeth Dent, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "They see Trump as a businessman, as a very transactional diplomatic character, who if you're willing to name the right price of investment into the United States, he is willing to make concessions that other American presidents likely would not have," Dent said. The crown prince also wants to build a civilian nuclear program with U.S. technology, and those discussions are moving ahead under Trump. That's something that had been tied to Saudi Arabia establishing relations with Israel, but the kingdom has been clear it will not move ahead with normalization without Israel stopping its war in Gaza and creating a pathway to Palestinian statehood. The current far-right government in Israel is rejecting both, and has been planning an even larger-scale invasion of Gaza amid a devastating blockade that is starving people there, according to the latest findings by independent experts on famine. Trump said it was his "fervent hope, wish — and even my dream" for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel by joining the Abraham Accords. "I really think it's going to be something special. But you'll do it in your own time and that's what I want, that's what you want, and that's the way it's going to be," Trump said. President Donald Trump walks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during an arrival ceremony at the Royal Terminal of King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh on Tuesday. Alex Brandon/AP hide caption Huge amounts of money from the Gulf have flowed into Trump's orbit since he was first elected president nearly nine years ago. Just weeks ago, his son, Eric Trump, who runs the Trump Organization, was in the region for the launch of two new projects with a Saudi developer: A high-rise Trump hotel tower that will have the world's highest pool, and a sprawling Trump golf course with villas in Doha, Qatar. That's in addition to other Trump towers and projects underway in Saudi Arabia and Oman. While president, Trump's investments and assets are in a trust managed by his children. Still, these deals and others have drawn criticism. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has previously secured a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund — overseen by the Saudi crown prince. It helped Kushner launch his private equity fund just months after leaving the White House where he was adviser to Trump in his first term. Mamoun Fandy, director of the London Global Strategy Institute think tank, said these family business deals compromise the image of the office Trump holds. "In the past, the presidency used to cost the president his financial well-being, if you will, that most people have to declare their assets and make sure they are separated from his office," Fandy said. "Now everything is conflated." The latest gesture came from Qatar, which has offered the president a new Boeing jet to use while the aging Air Force One fleet is overhauled. When asked by reporters about this before heading to the Gulf on Monday, Trump said he appreciated the offer. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman walk during an arrival ceremony at the Royal Palace in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Alex Brandon/AP hide caption "I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, 'No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane,' " he said. The offer has drawn outrage by Democrats aghast at the suggestion of such a large gift from a foreign country. Meanwhile, investments from the Gulf keep coming. The latest deal included the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture called World Liberty Financial. It's co-founded by Zack Witkoff, whose father is Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Mideast. Just days ago, an Abu Dhabi firm used World Liberty's stablecoin to close a $2 billion investment into crypto exchange, Binance. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters it's ridiculous to even suggest Trump is making money off being president. "He left a life of luxury and a life of running a very successful real estate empire for public service, not just once, but twice," she said. In his remarks, Trump did not speak extensively about the war in Gaza, where the health ministry says Israeli attacks have killed nearly 53,000 people, a third of them children. "The people of Gaza deserve a much better future, but that cannot occur as long as their leaders choose to kidnap, torture and target innocent men, women and children for political ends," Trump said. Trump's team held direct talks with Hamas in Qatar, leading to the freeing of Israeli-American soldier and hostage, Edan Alexander, on Monday. His release from Gaza is putting pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to return in earnest to negotiations to end the war, and change course on his government's plans to permanently occupy the Gaza Strip. Arab Gulf states also want to see Trump's team give adequate time to Iran for negotiations over its nuclear enrichment and missile program. There's still a lot of uncertainty around the talks.

Title: Trump in the Middle East: How much are US-Gulf investments worth?

President Trump embarks on a three-day tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, three of the most influential US partners in the Gulf region. United States President Donald Trump has started his Middle East tour, arriving in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, just after 10am, where he was greeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). During his three-day trip, he will also travel to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with a focus on securing economic agreements with three of the world’s wealthiest nations. The trip will involve discussions on investment opportunities, and some experts say Trump may urge the Gulf countries to lower oil prices. Trump arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday just before 10am local time (07:00 GMT), where he was greeted by MBS. The same day, he is scheduled to attend a Saudi-US investment forum featuring leading companies such as BlackRock, Citigroup, Palantir, Qualcomm, and Alphabet. On Wednesday, he is scheduled to take part in a Gulf summit in Riyadh, before travelling to Qatar later that day. He will conclude his trip in the UAE on Thursday, May 15. During his first term, 2017 to 2021, Trump became the first US president to make the Middle East his first international destination, breaking with the longstanding tradition of visiting neighbouring North American countries first. His trip to Saudi Arabia from May 20 to 22, 2017 – during which he attended the Riyadh Summit – was a calculated move to bolster defence ties and secure substantial arms deals. During that trip, Trump also visited Israel and Palestine. While Trump did not go to Qatar or the UAE during his first term, he met Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at the Riyadh Summit. During the summit, Trump and Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud signed a $110bn arms deal, including missile defence systems, tanks, combat ships and cybersecurity technology, with the intent of buying $350bn worth of arms over 10 years. A memorable moment from that 2017 trip to Saudi Arabia was during the inauguration of the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology in Riyadh. In a surreal photo op that quickly went viral, Trump stood alongside King Salman and President el-Sisi with their hands on a glowing orb. Sami al-Arian, director of the Center for Islam and Global Affairs at Istanbul Zaim University, told Al Jazeera that Trump has been very vocal about his objective in visiting the three Gulf states: investments. Trump’s administration has reportedly discussed the possibility of expediting investments by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE before his trip to the region. “He’s trying to get trillions of dollars out of these countries,” al-Arian told Al Jazeera. “He’s already said that he’s hoping to get $1 trillion from Saudi Arabia in terms of arms sales and commercial deals,” he said. According to the latest data from the US Department of Commerce, the total stock of US foreign direct investment (FDI) in Saudi Arabia reached $11.3bn in 2023. Conversely, Saudi Arabia’s FDI stock in the US stood at $9.6bn, mostly in transport, real estate, plastics, automotive, financial services and communications, according to the Commerce Department. These figures are only FDI, not other investments, like portfolio investments or short-term financial flows. In 2023, the total stock of US FDI in Qatar was estimated at $2.5bn. According to the US-Qatar Business Council, US companies that have facilitated FDIs in Qatar focused on the fields of energy, petrochemicals, construction, engineering, and communications technology. Conversely, Qatari FDI stock in the US reached $3.3bn in 2023, with investments concentrated in financial services, energy and real estate. In 2023, the total stock of US FDI in the UAE reached $16.1bn. According to the Reuters news agency, in 2023, the main FDI drivers were manufacturing, finance and insurance, construction and wholesale and retail trade sectors. Meanwhile, UAE FDI stock in the US totalled $35bn in 2023 – in financial services, transport, food and beverages, aerospace, and business services, according to the Commerce Department. In March, UAE National Security Adviser Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan met Trump and committed $1.4 trillion in investments to the US over 10 years in sectors such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. The US is the biggest exporter of arms globally and a top supplier to Gulf countries. Qatar and Saudi Arabia each accounted for 6.8 percent of the world’s total arms imports for 2020-24, making them the third and fourth largest importers globally. The UAE is the 11th largest importer of arms, accounting for 2.6 percent of global imports for the same period. Saudi Arabia is the main recipient of US arms, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Between 2020 and 2024, Saudi Arabia received 12 percent of the US’s total arms exports. About 74 percent of Saudi arms imports come from the US. Trump is poised to offer Saudi Arabia an arms package worth more than $100bn during his trip, according to Reuters. In the 2020-24 period, the US was the top supplier of arms to Qatar, accounting for 48 percent of its imports. In March, the US Department of State approved a large weapons package to Qatar worth $2bn, which includes long-range maritime surveillance drones and hundreds of missiles and bombs. In the same period, the US was also the top supplier of weapons to the UAE, accounting for 42 percent of the country’s arms imports. Follow Al Jazeera English:

US President Donald Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to begin a four-day tour of the Gulf region, with a focus on economic agreements rather than regional security crises, including the war in Gaza and the growing tension over Iran’s nuclear program.Accompanied by prominent American business leaders – including Tesla CEO and Trump adviser Elon Musk – Trump will visit Riyadh first, the site of the Saudi-US Investment Forum. He is scheduled to travel to Qatar on Wednesday and the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.“While energy remains a cornerstone of our relationship, the investments and business opportunities in the kingdom have expanded and multiplied many, many times over,” Saudi Investment Minister Khalid al-Falih said as he opened the forum. “As a result... when Saudis and Americans join forces, very good things happen – more often than not, great things happen when those joint ventures happen,” he added, speaking ahead of Trump’s arrival.The forum began with a video montage featuring soaring eagles and falcons, celebrating the longstanding relationship between the United States and the kingdom.Seated at the front of a palatial hall were BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Blackstone CEO Stephen A. Schwarzman, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan, and al-Falih.Saudi Arabia and the United States have enjoyed decades of strong ties, anchored by a longstanding agreement in which the kingdom supplies oil and the superpower provides security. Trump may also travel to Turkey on Thursday for potential face-to-face talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.This marks Trump’s second foreign trip since taking office again – his first was to Rome for Pope Francis’s funeral – and it comes amid escalating geopolitical tensions.In addition to pursuing a resolution to the war in Ukraine, his administration is advocating a new aid mechanism for Gaza and urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a new ceasefire.Over the weekend, US and Iranian negotiators met in Oman to discuss a potential deal aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.

SCB WEALTH, a key business unit of SCB, is dedicated to enhancing the wealth of Thai investors and expanding opportunities for global investments. SCB launched partnership with BlackRock who is the world’s largest asset management company. By partnering with BlackRock, a company that shares the same business philosophy, both organizations emphasize the customer-centric approach, focusing on developing investment products that truly meet clients’ needs. SCB WEALTH views wealth management as a long-term investment, ensuring a strong financial future under the concept of “Your Success. Our Success.” Under this collaboration, the bank’s wealth clients will gain privilege access to exclusive world-class investment products, in-depth research, and strategic market insights through BlackRock’s extensive global network, said Mr. Kris Chantanotoke, Chief Executive Officer of SCB. He said the bank spent about a year finalizing the collaboration to ensure the partnership genuinely enhances the wealth of Thais. As a result, the bank is deeply focusing on three core areas of development under this collaboration: investment products, research and risk management, and human capabilities “SCB has set an ambitious goal to become No.1 wealth management institution in Thailand by 2026. To achieve this, partnering with a global leader like BlackRock is essential, as it aligns with our strategic objectives in every aspect”, said Mr Kris. Through this strategic partnership, SCB WEALTH combines its deep understanding of Thai investors' needs with BlackRock’s global investment expertise. This synergy enables the creation of tailored investment strategies and solutions that align with clients’ financial goals and risk profiles. As part of the partnership, SCB Wealth and BlackRock have established working team to evaluate and curate exclusive investment products for the bank’s wealth clients, reinforcing the unique value of this collaboration. Additionally, SCB WEALTH prioritizes the development of its Relationship Managers (RMs) through a specialized training program designed by SCB WEALTH Academy in collaboration with BlackRock. This program focuses on enhancing investment knowledge, providing a deep understanding of investment products, and elevating client service/advisory to international standards. The ultimate goal is to become No.1 in NPS by 2026 "Beyond our existing wealth clients, we aim to expand opportunities for Thai individuals with wealth potential who are interested in investing. In particular, personal financial planning and retirement planning will play a key role in helping them build long-term financial security and well-being," Mr. Kris said. Apart of its mission, SCB sees digital/AI technology as a key to expanding its wealth business and meeting customer needs. This includes creating innovative new investment products and enhancing investment services for customers through digital technology. BlackRock will share experiences and global investment insights , ensuring a more tailored and efficient experience for customers. Andrew Landman, Deputy Head of Asia-Pacific and Head of Asia Pacific Wealth at BlackRock, said SCB’s platform will open greater opportunities for customers to access wealth management services, With its expertise, BlackRock is well-equipped to provide advisory support to SCB WEALTH in developing products that are globally diversified and better meet the need of Thai investors. In addition, Mr Landman underscored the importance of co-research as a key component of this strategic alliance, particularly in light of global economic uncertainty and market volatility driven by rising geopolitical risks. However, BlackRock remains focused on long-term investments, helping clients achieve reasonable returns while ensuring sustained growth of their portfolios over the long term, he said. “In today’s world, investors are inundated with vast amounts of information especially from social media. At BlackRock, we focus on extracting credible, high-value insights that truly benefit investors, ensuring long-term portfolio growth.” Mr Landman noted. Finally, Mr Kris said the collaboration with BlackRock will empower Thai people to access global investment insights, providing opportunities for better returns compared to investing solely in the domestic market. It will help them develop investment planning skills and risk management strategies, ensuring long-term financial prosperity and sufficient assets for a comfortable retirement.

Title: Trump is headed to Saudi Arabia — and a 'who's who' of US CEOs are right behind him

Time Published: 2025-05-12T21:09:17Z
Full Content:
As President Donald Trump embarks on the first international trip of his second term, a crowd of Wall Street and Silicon Valley executives are also jetting off to Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, executives from companies like Google, Nvidia, and BlackRock are scheduled to speak at the Saudi-US Investment Forum, according to the event's website. The forum will cover a range of topics — AI, energy, defense, and manufacturing, to name a few — and host some of the kingdom's power brokers. Investment is top of mind beyond Tuesday's conference: Trump has said he wants to secure $1 trillion worth of deals during his trip to the gulf, multiple outlets reported. A guest list for a lunch on Tuesday included some of the event's most prominent speakers, like Elon Musk and Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman, as well as other private sector bigwigs. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi were among the diners who aren't slated to speak. The invite list provided by the White House Included Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn cofounder and noted Democrat, but his office later denied he was there, and his chief of staff posted a photo of them two together. A long list of Saudi business leaders were also invited, according to the guest list. Here are some of the biggest names scheduled to take the stage at Tuesday's forum. Representatives for the Saudi-US Investment Forum did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is listed as a featured speaker as Saudi Arabia is working to establish itself as a global AI leader. Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud business, has committed to investing more than $5.3 billion in Saudi Arabia in the coming years to build data centers for the computing power needed to run AI models. The Palantir CEO is scheduled to speak at the conference, and has recently credited a pro-defense tech wave for solid first quarter performance. Alex Karp said on a recent earnings call that part of Palantir's success had to do with "an unvarnished cacophony of the combination of 20 years of investment and a massive cultural shift in the US." Elon Musk is listed as a speaker, just a few months after Tesla announced it will be entering the Saudi market. The world's richest man has previously had a somewhat rocky relationship with Saudi Arabia over unsuccessful business deals. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, launched an investment firm in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, last year, and CEO Larry Fink stressed the firm's global reach on a recent earnings call. He was once a leading voice on issues like ESG and DEI, but the firm's recent annual letter didn't mention either issue. Instead, Fink wrote in it that BlackRock is now betting big on the private market. Trump's AI and crypto czar is among the White House officials scheduled to speak. On Sunday evening, David Sacks posted about arriving in the Middle East on X, saying that America needs to be the "partner-of-choice" when it comes to AI, and that "effective AI diplomacy is vital now more than ever." Representatives from Nvidia spoke at this year's Global AI Summit, hosted in Saudi Arabia, and now CEO Jensen Huang is set to represent the chips giant at Tuesday's conference. A top Saudi AI official told CNBC in September that the country hoped to get access to Nvidia's high-performance chips within the year. Groq, a semiconductor startup and potential competitor to Nvidia, announced that it has gotten a $1.5 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to expand the delivery of its AI chips. Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser is among the Wall Street leaders slated to speak. She also spoke at Saudi Arabia's Future Investment Initiative in October. Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of Blackstone, also spoke at Saudi Arabia's Future Investment Initiative ahead of the presidential election and said he thought that Trump would be a better president the second time around. Last year, the billionaire said he wants Blackstone to become the "largest financial investor" in global AI infrastructure. Boeing has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia since the 1940s, according to its website. Though CEO Kelly Ortberg is scheduled to speak in Saudi Arabia, Boeing has made headlines related to a different country in the Middle East, after multiple outlets reported that the Qatari royal family plans to give the Trump administration a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet to be used as Air Force One. The plane is worth a staggering $400 million and has been criticized by figures on both political parties for potential conflicts of interest. Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer of Alphabet, is scheduled to speak, and Google has made recent investments in Saudi Arabia. In 2024, the company announced that it was opening an AI hub in Saudi Arabia, and a 2025 partnership between Accenture and Google Cloud seeks to further generative AI capacities in the country. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna recently announced a new slate of AI products from IBM as the company seeks to grow its generative AI business. In February, IBM announced it was expanding its AI efforts in Saudi Arabia and the company opened regional headquarters in the country last year. Omeed Malik founder and president of 1789 Capital, a VC firm that counts Donald Trump Jr. among its partners. He recently started a private club in Washington, DC, that caters to the MAGA social scene once co-hosted a Trump fundraiser that raised upwards of $10 million. 1789 Capital invests in energy and software, among other industries, and it bills itself as anti-ESG.

During the regulator’s fourth crypto-focused roundtable since March, which today focused on moving traditional Wall Street securities onto blockchain networks, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw interrogated whether the premise of hosting traditional finance firms at the agency’s headquarters, to discuss how they should adopt blockchain technology, may constitute overstepping. In recent months, former Democratic SEC appointees have begun openly questioning the motives behind the Republican Party’s recent embrace of crypto, with some arguing that exempting the novel sector from securities regulations could in turn weaken consumer protections in traditional financial markets. “No one seems to disagree that the SEC should remain a tech-neutral regulator,” Crenshaw said Monday. “So why is it our place to assess particular forms of blockchains as candidates for industry adoption? Why would we focus on blockchain in particular over other types of distributed ledger technologies?” “Regulatory efforts to facilitate adoption of blockchain, let alone specific forms of it, seems a bit like the government picking winners and losers,” she continued. Chairman Paul Atkins' remarks at the Crypto Task Force roundtable on tokenization: The topic of this afternoon’s discussion is timely as securities are increasingly migrating from traditional (or “off-chain”) databases to blockchain-based (or “on-chain”) ledger systems. — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) May 12, 2025 The event was attended by representatives from Wall Street titans including BlackRock, Nasdaq, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton, all of which have expressed interest in offering securities via blockchain networks. It kicked off with remarks from SEC chair Paul Atkins, who praised crypto’s potential to revolutionize traditional financial markets. “Blockchain technology holds the promise to allow for a broad swath of novel use cases for securities, fostering new kinds of market activities that many of the Commission’s legacy rules and regulations don’t even contemplate today,” he said. The two principal selling points of tokenizing traditional securities markets have long been making such markets more efficient, and more accessible. Blockchain technology could, in theory, allow for the instantaneous, on-chain settlement of transactions like stock trades, which typically take a day to settle. Such speed could in turn allow for more accessible markets. But Crenshaw pushed back on such assumptions Monday, arguing that current delays in settlement on Wall Street allow for key benefits. Those include granting flexibility to pause transactions in cases of fraud or national security risk, and drastically reducing the number of transactions requiring final settlement, by about 98%. “This allows the current system to handle tremendous volume,” she said. “It’s a key reason why our markets withstood sustained, record breaking trading volume in recent weeks without major failures.” Crenshaw questioned, further, whether blockchain networks would be capable of settling every stock trade live in real-time, without causing those networks to crash. In her own remarks Monday, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, chief of the agency’s crypto task force, hailed blockchain technology as a tool with the potential to revolutionize securities markets just as the internet did. But she also acknowledged, deviating from prepared remarks, that her Democratic colleague may have a point about holding back from integrating instantaneous crypto transactions with Wall Street. “As Commissioner Crenshaw discussed, there are reasons why that might not always be something we want,” Peirce said. “But I think it’s a potential we should be thinking about.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Trump En Route To Middle East: Here’s What To Know
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/05/12/trump-en-route-to-middle-east-heres-what-to-know/
Time Published: 2025-05-12T20:43:10Z

BySara Dorn andSiladitya Ray BySara Dorn, Forbes Staff andSiladitya Ray, Forbes Staff. President Donald Trump signed a $600 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia on Tuesday that includes a major defense contract and substantial investments in artificial intelligence—as U.S. business executives made their own set of deals in the backdrop of Trump’s visit to Riyadh, the first stop on his four-day tour of the Middle East. U.S. President Donald Trump walks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during an official ... More state arrival ceremony at the Saudi Royal Court in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Saudi company DataVolt will invest $20 billion in AI data centers and energy infrastructure in the U.S. and the Saudis will purchase $142 billion in military equipment and services from the U.S. as part of the agreement, according to a White House press release. Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the kingdom would aim to increase its total investment to $1 trillion—a figure Trump has repeatedly urged Riyadh to agree to. Coinciding with Trump’s visit, U.S. billionaires, including Elon Musk, OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Palantir’s Alex Karp and BlackRock’s Larry Fink attended the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, where organizers said 145 deals worth more than $300 billion have been signed, including a deal for Nvidia to sell 18,000 AI chips to the new Saudi-backed company Humain, and Saudi approval of Musk’s Starlink. Trump also announced the U.S. would ease sanctions against Syria, and a White House official said he agreed to “say hello” on Wednesday to Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former Al Qaeda member who has since severed ties with the terrorist organization and took over after Bashar al-Assad regime was overthrown in December. Trump, who raised the possibility he could ease the sanctions on Monday, said he made the decision at Turkish President Recep Erdogan’s urging, though the timing of the announcement will most certainly raise eyebrows after al-Sharaa on Monday proposed a Trump Tower Damascus, Reuters reported, citing multiple sources. Conflict-of-interest concerns swirled ahead of Trump’s visit, particularly surrounding Trump’s family business ventures in the region and, more recently, the expected announcement that Qatar will gift the Trump administration a new 747 mega-jet.

Saudi Arabia debuted the company Monday. It’s chaired by bin Salman and backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund and Public Investment Fund. Former Aramco Digital executive Tareq Amin will lead the company, which will “pave the way for a groundbreaking national AI strategy in Saudi Arabia,” Amin said in a December LinkedIn post. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was also in Saudi Arabia to announce the deal alongside Amin. The defense contract includes sales across five categories: air force and space, air and missile defense, maritime security, border security and information technology and communications systems, the White House said. In addition to the defense agreement, it also includes a deal for Google, DataVolt, Oracle, Salesforce, AMD and Uber to invest more than $80 billion in both countries. The Saudis welcomed Trump with great fanfare. Saudi fighter jets escorted Air Force One upon its landing in Riyadh, where bin Salman greeted Trump on the tarmac, and a convoy of Arabian horses then surrounded Trump’s motorcade en route to the Saudi royal court. The Saudi crown prince’s decision to personally greet Trump at the tarmac of Riyadh’s airport stood in stark contrast to the cold reception former President Joe Biden received in 2022. The former president had criticized bin Salman over the killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi during his presidential campaign and vowed to turn Saudi Arabia into a “pariah” state. In 2021, the Biden administration also halted the delivery of offensive weapons to the Saudi government, citing concerns about its handling of the conflict in Yemen. But when faced with high oil prices in 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Biden flew to the Middle Eastern kingdom to persuade it to ramp up oil production. He was greeted by a provincial governor at the airport and later met bin Salman in Jeddah, where the two shared an awkward fist bump. On Wednesday, Trump will travel to Qatar, where he’ll meet with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. He will conclude the trip Thursday in the United Arab Emirates, where he will meet with President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan before returning to the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, among others. Multiple Trump-branded properties and crypto deals are among those in the Trump family’s Middle East business portfolio. Among the real estate ventures in the works are a Trump golf resort in Qatar and Trump residential towers in Dubai and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. An investment fund backed by the United Arab Emirates, MGX, also used $2 billion in stablecoin issued by the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial to invest in Binance earlier this year. The deal contributed to the failure last week of a crypto industry-friendly bill that would have regulated stablecoins, as senators on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about Trump's links to the MGX-Binance deal and his personal stake in the stablecoin legislation. The White House has dismissed concerns about any potential conflicts of interest between Trump’s official government duties and his personal business in the Middle East. “I think it’s frankly ridiculous that anyone in this room would even suggest that President Trump is doing anything for his own benefit,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Friday. Trump is seeking a $1 trillion investment in the U.S. from Saudi Arabia. He told reporters in March he agreed to the trip because Saudi Arabia agreed to the investment, though Riyadh has yet to confirm the figure, and experts told The New York Times the amount is unrealistic given the size of Saudi Arabia’s economy. Qatar is expected to gift the Trump administration a $400 million 747-8 jumbo jet to use in place of Air Force One—what could be the largest foreign gift to the federal government in history, raising concerns it could set the stage for a quid pro quo situation. The White House has vehemently rejected any pay-for-play suggestions. Trump said Monday the plane would be gifted to the Defense Department, not him personally. He also said he wouldn’t use the plane after leaving office even though it would be donated to his presidential library after its tenure as Air Force One. Saudi Arabia proposed in January an additional $600 billion investment in the U.S. over the next four years, with the potential to increase the amount, though it’s unclear exactly where the money would go. The United Arab Emirates announced in March a new $1.4 trillion investment over the next decade in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, manufacturing and energy. The U.S. and Qatar last year reached an agreement to extend U.S. military presence at the Al Udeid Air Base for another 10 years. No, and it’s been noted by experts that it could be viewed as a sign of tensions between Trump and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “There’s nothing that Netanyahu has that Trump wants, needs or can give him, as opposed to, say, the Saudis, the Qataris, the Emiratis,” former Israeli diplomat Alon Pinkas told CNN. Trump has made several moves recently that have reportedly surprised Israel, including renewed nuclear deal negotiations with Iran and his agreement for a ceasefire between the U.S. and the Houthis, but not Israel. The U.S. also negotiated the release of the last American Hamas hostage, Edan Alexander, released Monday, without Israel.

Skip to comments. Posted on 05/12/2025 9:48:18 AM PDT by MtnClimber The banking industry is attempting to take programs from Indiana’s state treasurer because he works to protect Christians and conservatives. ndiana lawmakers amended a proposal that had attempted to give some of state Treasurer Daniel Elliott’s powers to big banks angered by his strong defense of taxpayers, Christians, and conservatives. Yet the program is still at risk of being turned over to the state’s powerful banking lobby, which has donated to all the politicians who control the $3 billion local investment pool targeted by the changes. The provision inserted by Republican Sen. Travis Holdman, a former bank CEO, initially attempted to demote Elliott from sole manager of TrustIndiana to one member of a banker-controlled five-member board managing that pool. Holdman was formerly on the board of a bankers’ organization that merged into the outfit that lobbied for these changes, the Indiana Banker’s Association. The IBA “has been opposed to some of my policies right from the beginning,” Elliott said in a phone interview. “They were opposed to me pushing back on ESG [leftist social justice investment metrics]. They were opposed to me fighting against BlackRock … That’s fine, they can have their opinions. What bothered me was that this was a backroom deal done in the middle of the night.” Banking Regulations Hurt TaxpayersElliott told The Federalist bankers on the board would present a conflict of interest, as banks can financially benefit from the pool investments. Local officials are beneficiaries of the program, and thus naturally want TrustIndiana to perform optimally while lacking ethical conflicts over where the money is invested, Elliott noted. This is why the Association of Indiana Counties opposed the attempted changes. So did Hoosier conservative activists, who rallied at the governor’s mansion in late April to push for property tax cuts and protect TrustIndiana. “This is crony capitalism at its worst,” “said Coalition of Central Indiana Tea Parties Chairman Adam Harvey in a press release. “They want to put a board of bankers over the elected State Treasurer, directing investments that benefit their shareholders instead of Hoosier taxpayers and local governments.” The banking lobby already has reduced TrustIndiana’s returns by requiring 50 percent of the pool to go into bank deposits, which return a lower interest rate, Elliott said. The S&P will not rate TrustIndiana, he said, “because it has too much of its assets in bank deposits.” That’s just one of several examples of how Indiana’s banking lobby has reduced TrustIndiana returns for local officials and taxpayers via regulations, Elliott said. To get some of those removed, he agreed to the legislature creating a board to oversee the program.

Yet the program is still at risk of being turned over to the state’s powerful banking lobby, which has donated to all the politicians who control the $3 billion local investment pool targeted by the changes. The provision inserted by Republican Sen. Travis Holdman, a former bank CEO, initially attempted to demote Elliott from sole manager of TrustIndiana to one member of a banker-controlled five-member board managing that pool. Holdman was formerly on the board of a bankers’ organization that merged into the outfit that lobbied for these changes, the Indiana Banker’s Association. The IBA “has been opposed to some of my policies right from the beginning,” Elliott said in a phone interview. “They were opposed to me pushing back on ESG [leftist social justice investment metrics]. They were opposed to me fighting against BlackRock … That’s fine, they can have their opinions. What bothered me was that this was a backroom deal done in the middle of the night.” Banking Regulations Hurt TaxpayersElliott told The Federalist bankers on the board would present a conflict of interest, as banks can financially benefit from the pool investments. Local officials are beneficiaries of the program, and thus naturally want TrustIndiana to perform optimally while lacking ethical conflicts over where the money is invested, Elliott noted. This is why the Association of Indiana Counties opposed the attempted changes. So did Hoosier conservative activists, who rallied at the governor’s mansion in late April to push for property tax cuts and protect TrustIndiana. “This is crony capitalism at its worst,” “said Coalition of Central Indiana Tea Parties Chairman Adam Harvey in a press release. “They want to put a board of bankers over the elected State Treasurer, directing investments that benefit their shareholders instead of Hoosier taxpayers and local governments.” The banking lobby already has reduced TrustIndiana’s returns by requiring 50 percent of the pool to go into bank deposits, which return a lower interest rate, Elliott said. The S&P will not rate TrustIndiana, he said, “because it has too much of its assets in bank deposits.” That’s just one of several examples of how Indiana’s banking lobby has reduced TrustIndiana returns for local officials and taxpayers via regulations, Elliott said.

Title: ‘Putting everyone’s health record on their phone would save the HSE billions’

Vision outlined at Digital Health Summer School in Maynooth Maynooth University Professor Martin Curley Giving everyone in Ireland a health record on their phone that also offers preventative healthcare assisted by artificial intelligence (AI) could save the HSE billions and help to dramatically cut patient waiting lists and numbers in A&E. That’s according to a vision to become a leading digital health nation set out by the health service’s former digital transformation director and current Maynooth University Professor Martin Curley as he launched an initiative called Mission 10X at its Digital Health Summer School. “This is a moonshot empowering every Irish citizen to manage and improve their health. We want your health to revolve around you and not around hospitals,” he said. The school’s launch saw demonstrations of a number of technologies, including AI-assisted smartwatches to monitor patients who are at risk and AI-assisted screening technology deployable in homes, pharmacies, primary care centres and GP practices.. “These innovations are low-risk, low-cost proven technologies that help detect disease early. It’s a preventative approach, in contrast to the current one, where we spend the majority of the budget on treating sick patients in hospitals. “The best way to predict the future is to innovate it. We have all the knowledge and technology to build and scale a world-class health and wellness system – one powered by open, intelligent technology and centred on patients, not paperwork. “Deploying these nationwide could ultimately enable us to offer a full annual medical screening for about €100 per person. Early detection is better for the service, for patients and for health budgets. “Mission 10X is fully aligned with Sláintecare, would cost €100m and is achievable in about five years, enabling the nation to ‘leapfrog’ current systemic and infrastructural obstacles,” he said. Prof Curley’s vision is in contrast to the HSE’s current digital health approach centred on hospitals and regions. Last year, its Digital Health Strategic Implementation Roadmap sought an increase in the HSE’s annual IT budget to between €1bn and €1.4bn a year over seven years. Health sources say that hospital-based digital health records would cost between €2bn and €5bn to roll out nationwide. “That would only see us largely get to where some other countries’ health services were 20 years ago. But Mission 10X could also complement that plan,” Prof Curley said. Ireland ranks last in European digital health rankings, but could become a global leader alongside countries such as Estonia, which has already adopted this approach, if our health service adopted 10 recommendations his vision is based on, Prof Curley said. “We’ve had an increase to date of about 3.5pc in health productivity as the result of 50,000 more health workers and spending €8bn. This preventative approach would save anywhere between 10 and 100 times its comparatively low cost,” he added. The first step towards this goal is a phased investment in a secure patient information network, or SPINE, at an initial cost of €10 million to study its feasibility, ahead of scaling to a €100 million nationwide deployment, he said. Prof Curley, a former senior Intel executive who is now Director of Digital Health at the University’s Innovation Value Institute, has already trialled the initiative with two senior HSE managers and 15,000 patients in Leinster, some of whom have complex health needs. The trial also involved 1,000 patient queries that would otherwise have seen all of them visit their GP or local A&E. Out of those, our approach helped triage and guide people to establish that 30 actually needed to visit their GP, and six needed to go to A&E. “If you multiply that small example on a nationwide scale, it could be transformational for health productivity, and in terms of the time and cost savings to both patients and health workers. It benefits everyone,” Prof Curley said. His vision is supported by a range of clinicians and others concerned with and within the health system. Dr John Sheehan, Clinical Director of Radiology at Blackrock Health, said: “With a modest initial investment of €10m, Ireland can create a scalable digital health system, mirroring Estonia’s successful model. This is a historical opportunity we cannot afford to miss.” Stephen McMahon, head of the Irish Patients Association added: “This is a revolutionary beacon of hope and healing for patients today and future generations. Mission 10X shows that together, we truly can transform healthcare.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: WoW's Leeroy Jenkins, one of the internet's oldest memes, turns 20 years old—and after looking back on what we wrote in 2005, I feel like we've failed Leeroys everywhere

I'm comin' up with 32.33 (repeating of course) percentage of feeling your age. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. I don't like to make our readers feel the weight of the passing years—but I'm afraid I have to inform you that Leeroy Jenkins, one of the internet's oldest memes, turned 20 years old yesterday. I know, I know. I'm not sure how to feel about it either. The meme (which is one year away from being able to drink in the US, and has already been slamming pints for two years in the UK) was released on May 11, 2005 to Warcraftmovies—you know, back when you could still have websites dedicated to the machinima of a single game. Also, back when 'Machinima' was still a word people used. The video, recorded by the charmingly-named guild Pals for Life, features the titular Leeroy Jenkins just absolutely screwing up an entire raid pull in the Rookery of Blackrock Spire. It's a perfect comedy routine: A set of exasperated, tired gamers talking about their chances of successfully pulling off a good fight. One player saying, with full knowledge that the number's a complete asspull, how the group has a "32.33 (repeating of course) percentage" of victory. Then Leeroy, belting his own name like a battlecry to the gods, springs out of his AFK state, fuelled by some animating spirit of the skalds of legend, and barrels inside, quickly killing everybody in a swarm of dial-up internet lag and bad decisions. As the dust settles, he's called "stupid as hell", to which he replies "at least I have chicken". Two decades later, we're still making Leeroy jokes. In 2023, US House representative Jared Huffmann belted his name with the same intonation after three days of arduous voting. Sweep back through the past, and you'll be pelted with Leeroy Jenkins. How I Met Your Mother even referenced it, doubtless leaving plenty of sitcom watchers confused. Turns out, we even wrote about it back then—and with a little bit of hunting in our archives by our own Dave Jones, we were able to dredge up some excerpts from "The Ballad of Leeroy Jenkins" by former PCG writer Craig Pearson. It gives a nice window into the 2005-era internet. An era I fear we've now well and truly lost. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. "A legend has been born," Pearson wrote. "Leeroy's guild forum is littered with fans clamouring to bask in the man's presence." He goes on to cite a post from the Pals for Life site, which stated: "All day today my local radio station was pranking people with the Leeroy Jenkins yell, and my local tobacco and liquor shop was giving away free drinks and radio station T-shirts to people who came in and yelled 'Hell yea it's Friday, LEEROY JENKINS!!!!'. All damn day they were doing this." According to that article, Leeroy's player endured no small amount of internet stardom, for good or for ill, with routine messages and "increased attention from enemy players, horde gangs queuing up to snuff him out the minute he shows up in enemy territory." Rewatching the video itself, I can't help but feel nostalgic. Even if Kotaku would later break my heart and reveal it was staged—although re-reading Pearson's article from 2005, it turns out most people knew all along: "Of course, it's a setup. Made to parody nerdy guilds," he wrote, before also adding that Pals for Life themselves told PCG directly that: "With MMOs, a lot of people treat the game as a job, and with our guild that is exactly what we're trying to avoid". Pearson also elaborates that "Stunts like naked raids on enemy settlements are an integral part of their manifesto". Hardly the type to have a mathemagician spin percentiles out of thin air. It's a symbol of a simpler time, where videogame memes could crop up pure, unfiltered, and spread because they were gut-bustingly funny. It also reflects a goofier era in MMOs in general—perhaps I was simply too much of a greenhorn noob in my youth, but in the modern era of instantly-solved raid mechanics and mandatory UI mods, I'm not sure something like Leeroy Jenkins could exist. Honestly, looking at Pearson's conclusion to the phenomenon nowadays gives me a sense dramatic irony: "For too long we've suffered under the folk who take games too seriously, who call us 'noobs' for dying, or killing them when they weren't expecting it, or not following their perfectly laid plans. "Leeroy shows us the way. A simple act of (staged) idiocy has freed us all and reminded us what gaming's about: Fun." Anyone who's done Mythic+ dungeon runs in WoW can tell you this liberation did not last. I'm sorry, Leeroy. We've lost our way. We no longer know how to cry "times up, let's do this!". We may not even have chicken. Sweaty, high-DPS min-maxers are now the expected norm, rather than the butt of a joke. Leeroy's brand of hooliganry now has to manifest in terms of service-violating nonsense—and while I'll still have a good-old chuckle, it's all far less wholesome. They just don't make memes like they used to, and none of us can just run in without fearing the wrath of strangers. The folks who take games too seriously won.

Find out more BlackRock has been confirmed as a partner for the venture, providing insurance asset management, advisory services and the integration of its Aladdin technology. Additionally, Lunate will join the initiative, bringing expertise in global, multi-asset investment to the platform. The yet-to-be-named platform will provide property and casualty (P&C), life and specialised insurance products. Operating from the ADGM, it will also cater to international markets, with a particular emphasis on the Middle East and Asia. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The platform’s operations will be built around an AI-native framework, aiming to improve data analytics and pricing, and expected to enhance risk assessment processes and capital efficiency. A buy-and-build strategy is central to the platform’s growth plans, targeting initial liabilities of more than $10bn (Dh36.73bn). The initial equity commitments are projected to be more than $1bn, supplemented by additional financing. BlackRock will make a minority investment in the venture upon completion of the definitive documentation. The leadership of the new company will be under the chairmanship of United Arab Emirates Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, with former Aviva CEO Mark Wilson at the helm. Al Jaber said: “Supported by exceptional global partners in IHC, BlackRock and Lunate, the new company will bring deep expertise, a strong capital base, and AI-driven underwriting to enhance efficiency and precision. Furthermore, establishing the company in ADGM gives us access to a robust regulatory framework, a rapidly growing insurance market and dynamic financial hub.” IHC CEO Syed Basar Shueb stated: “This venture embodies IHC’s commitment to innovation and strategic growth. By leveraging our diversified portfolio and deep regional insights, we aim to redefine the insurance landscape, delivering sustainable value to our stakeholders and contributing to the economic prosperity of the region.” In March, BlackRock, along with Allianz and T&D Holdings, agreed to purchase Viridium Group from Cinven for €3.5bn ($3.89bn).

Title: Ethereum explodes 42% in one week, outperforming Bitcoin as 60% of holders move into profit

Ethereum's rally hints at a bullish phase as technical upgrades and easing tensions take hold. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum is back in the spotlight after jumping 42% over the past week to trade above $2,500, a level it hasn’t touched since March. This marks one of its most notable breakouts in over a year, signaling renewed investor confidence. On-chain data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) shows that this rally has pushed more than 60% of Ethereum addresses into profit. That’s nearly double the 32% recorded just a month earlier, highlighting the strength of the market’s turnaround. Moreover, the rally puts ETH ahead of Bitcoin in terms of recent performance. While Bitcoin climbed just 10% in the same period to surpass $105,000, Ethereum’s sharper rise has surprised many in the market. The rally has triggered speculation that Ethereum could be entering a new bullish phase after months of sluggish performance. Sean Dawson, head of research at Dervive.xyz, told CryptoSlate: “ETH has a 20% chance of exceeding $4,000 by Christmas (up from 9% last week) and a 12% chance of hitting $5,000. The chance of ETH falling below $1,500 by Christmas has dropped to 15% (down from 40%).” Market analysts have pointed out that several key factors, including recent technical improvements, rising institutional backing, and easing global tensions, appear to be fueling Ethereum’s recent surge. Last week, Ethereum completed its highly anticipated Pectra upgrade, which unlocked a new set of features for the blockchain network. The update introduced improvements across the network’s wallet functionality, streamlined validator performance, and expanded Layer 2 support. These upgrades are expected to make Ethereum more efficient and easier to use across decentralized finance applications. Another factor driving ETH’s rally is the fact that several traditional financial institutions, including BlackRock, are deepening their use of Ethereum’s infrastructure through real-world asset tokenization. According to data from RWA.xyz, this sector has grown over 10% in the past 30 days, reaching a combined value of $22.1 billion. Ethereum leads the market with $6.9 billion locked in tokenized assets and controls 58% of the market share. Meanwhile, macroeconomic developments are also lifting sentiment in the broader market. A new trade agreement between the US and UK, alongside a temporary pause in US-China tariff escalations, has helped ease investor fears. These geopolitical developments support a broader risk-on mood in global markets, giving Ethereum further room to rise. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: SEC crypto task force to meet, with a spotlight on tokenization – Details

From the next steps for crypto to new blockchain shifts, here’s what we know. As the SEC’s Crypto Task Force prepares for its round table discussion, the backdrop is anything but quiet. The Roundtable on “Tokenization: Moving Assets Onchain” kicks off tomorrow, and the sector braces for what’s dubbed a “spring sprint toward crypto clarity.” From BlackRock’s talks with regulators to the unexpected failure of the GENIUS Act in the Senate, the signals are clear – debates over the regulatory future of digital assets are heating up. Adding another dimension, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has outlined a bold new chapter for the blockchain platform; a shift toward faster development and more inclusive innovation in 2025. The U.S. SEC’s Digital Assets Task Force will hold its fourth Digital Asset Roundtable on the 12th of May, further reinforcing the growing intersection between TradFi and DeFi. Key SEC figures, including Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce, will deliver opening remarks, with Peirce highlighting tokenization’s transformative potential. The agenda includes speakers from major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity, indicating increasing institutional engagement. Just days before the roundtable, stablecoin regulation hit a snag. On the 8th of May, the GENIUS Act – a long-anticipated stablecoin regulation bill – surprisingly failed to advance after a narrow 49-48 vote. The setback was driven by a notable shift among several Democrats who had earlier backed the legislation. Source: mailchi.mp Lawmakers, including Ruben Gallego and Lisa Blunt Rochester, cited national security risks, insufficient consumer protections, and gaps in anti-money laundering provisions as reasons for their reversal. Their joint statement called for tighter oversight, putting regulatory clarity on pause yet again. As institutional players deepen their engagement, BlackRock met with the SEC Crypto Task Force on the 9th of May to discuss a detailed agenda spanning staking, tokenization, and crypto ETP approval standards. Of course, BlackRock’s presence signaled more than curiosity—it was a deliberate push to define compliance in crypto investing. Source: X In parallel, Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, announced a strategic shift in philosophy, departing from its traditionally slow, academically rigorous development model. In a candid update, he emphasized the urgency of delivering “Leios by 2026, not 2028,” justifying recent team contract terminations to prioritize speed and innovation. Hoskinson spotlighted Aiken and Midgard—new teams focused on modularity and speed, marking a break from Cardano’s early academic model. It is becoming increasingly evident that the sector is recalibrating toward faster execution and greater regulatory clarity.

Title: Panama canal crisis: U.S. and China vie for control as Panamanians plead for American support

Geopolitical Battleground: The Panama Canal is a critical trade and military chokepoint where U.S.-China tensions escalate, with Panama divided over American retreat and Chinese infrastructure expansion. Chinese Influence Grows: China is gaining control through ports, migration, and economic projects, filling the vacuum left by the U.S. after its 1999 handover of canal operations. Military & Economic Risks: The canal enables U.S. naval mobility; Chinese dominance could disrupt supply chains or sabotage the waterway by targeting key infrastructure like the Gatun Dam. Global Trade at Stake: Similar struggles exist in the Suez, Hormuz, and Malacca straits, where China exploits U.S. disengagement to reshape global trade routes in its favor. Urgent U.S. Action Needed: Without a stronger U.S. response, China may seize control, threatening Americaâs economic and military dominanceâexperts warn Washington must act before itâs too late.

Urgent U.S. Action Needed: Without a stronger U.S. response, China may seize control, threatening Americaâs economic and military dominanceâexperts warn Washington must act before itâs too late. The Panama Canal, a linchpin of global trade, has become the latest battleground in the escalating geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China. As tensions rise, Panamanians are dividedâsome urging Washington to reassert influence, while others fear Chinese colonization through infrastructure investments. Experts warn that losing control of this critical waterway could cripple U.S. economic and military logistics, leaving China poised to exploit the vacuum left by American retreat. A Strategic Waterway Under Threat The Panama Canal, which handles 70% of U.S. trade for both coasts, remains one of the most vital maritime chokepoints in the world. Yet, since the U.S. handed over control to Panama in 1999 under President Carter (finalized by Clinton), American influence has wanedâwhile China has steadily expanded its footprint. Michael Yon, a geopolitical analyst who recently returned from Panama, warns that China is "colonizing" the country through infrastructure projects, commercial ports, and migration. "The Chinese are taking over positions of power, mostly behind the scenes," Yon explained in an interview with Mike Adams on Brighton.com. "Theyâre building bridges, controlling ports, and subtly shifting demographicsâjust like they did in Hong Kong." U.S. Retreat, Chinese Expansion The Biden administration has continued the Obama-era policy of disengagement, while Chinaâs state-linked firms like Hutchison Ports now operate key terminals on both sides of the canal. BlackRock, a major U.S. asset manager with deep ties to China, has also sought to acquire these portsâraising concerns about de facto Chinese control over critical trade routes. Yon notes that Panamanian ship pilots guide every vesselâincluding U.S. nuclear submarines and aircraft carriersâthrough the canal, a stark contrast to the past when American operators dominated. "The Panamanians ask, Where are the Americans? We left a vacuum, and China filled it," he said. Military and Economic Stakes The canal is not just an economic artery but a military lifeline for the U.S. Navy, allowing rapid deployment between the Atlantic and Pacific. If China gains dominance, it could strangle U.S. supply chains in a conflictâor even sabotage the canal by targeting the Gatun Dam, which, if destroyed, would drain the canalâs freshwater supply and shut it down for years. Trumpâs aggressive stanceâincluding threats to seize control of the canalâhas drawn mixed reactions. Some Panamanians welcome U.S. protection, while nationalists resist foreign intervention. "Panama is a juicy lamb surrounded by predators," Yon warned. "If the U.S. doesnât act, China or others will take it." Broader Geopolitical Chessboard The canal crisis mirrors struggles elsewhere: Suez Canal: China, Russia, and Egypt are forming alliances, exploiting perceived U.S. weakness. Strait of Hormuz: A potential U.S.-Iran conflict could disrupt 30% of global oil shipments, devastating Europe. Strait of Malacca: China is building rail bypasses to reduce reliance on this chokepoint. Whatâs Next? With Trump pushing tariffs and Bidenâs passive stance, the U.S. risks losing its grip on global trade routes. Meanwhile, Chinaâs "debt-trap diplomacy" and infrastructure investments are reshaping the Americasâfrom Panama to Argentina. As Yon starkly put it: "If China takes the Panama Canal, they can strangle us to death." The question is: Will Washington wake up before itâs too late?

Title: Degrees without CAO points were meant to be a ‘game changer’. Why do so few students avail of them?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/05/12/tertiary-degree-university-leaving-cert-cao/
Time Published: 2025-05-12T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
Cullain Burke’s delight with his Leaving Certificate results was short-lived. The 424 points he achieved in 2023 were not enough to secure his dream course, software development at Munster Technological University (MTU), which had soared above 500 points. “I was a little bit devastated to miss out,” he says. “It was upsetting. All my friends were going there. I had enough points for a business course, but I knew, really, it wasn’t something I’d be interested in.” As he weighed up whether to complete a post-Leaving Cert course, Burke was told of a brand new option: tertiary degrees. They are regular university bachelor’s degrees which begin in a further education college and finish up in a higher education institution. Entry is not based on CAO points and there are no tuition fees for the first one to two years. [ ‘No points needed, just potential’: Forty college degrees open for applicants outside CAO systemOpens in new window ] As it happened, there was a new tertiary degree in software development, with the first two years at Cork College of Further Education and Training and the final two years at MTU. “I thought, ‘there’s no way it’s real – it’s too good to be true’,” Burke recalls. “It’s far cheaper. It’s even closer to home. And it meant I’d have full access to all the facilities at MTU and could keep in contact with my friends.” Tertiary degrees were announced in a blaze of publicity three years ago by then minister for higher education, Simon Harris. They were, he said, a “game-changer” and had the potential to lift the stress on students forced to compete in a highly competitive CAO points race for college places. “These [tertiary] third-level courses challenge the notion that your Leaving Cert results should determine your education and career path, define a person or their capabilities, or get in the way of their dreams,” he said, shortly after the launch of the scheme. “With these courses I want to send a clear message to young people and their parents when considering options after school: you can be an engineer, a nurse, study business or work in ICT without ever having to worry about those archaic and stressful Leaving Cert points.” Yet, three years into the operation of the initiative, the numbers taking part are disappointing. A total of 152 students started courses during the first intake in 2023 across 14 different degrees. Last year the number climbed to 224 tertiary students. By comparison, the CAO this year received a record 83,000-plus applications, up from almost 77,000 last year. [ Could my son really lose a college offer if his CAO details are incorrect?Opens in new window ] So, why haven’t tertiary degree options caught the imagination of school leavers? One chair of a further education college board, who declined to be named, questioned the extent to which higher education institutions have bought into the scheme. “If you look at the courses on offer, they tend not to be the ones in high demand through the CAO,” the source said. “In many cases, they are courses the colleges are struggling to fill anyway. Until you see the really high points courses on offer, it won’t be the game-changer it was intended to be.” The most popular tertiary degree routes so far are for courses in nursing. While it used to attract high points, it has fallen to between 340 and 420 points in recent years. Some tertiary courses have not had any participants. Burke feels numbers taking part are relatively low because students are not aware of it, as well as a lingering stigma over further education being “second best”. “There can be a feeling that if you’re not going straight into [University College Cork] or MTU, then you’re not really progressing properly,” says Burke, from Blackrock in Cork. “This is completely not the case.” Another senior education observer points to the “rushed” manner in which tertiary degrees were introduced. [ Many apprentices are now on higher salaries than college graduates. Is snobbery around ‘earn and learn’ options fading?Opens in new window ] “I think Harris wanted it done in a hurry, with details to be thrashed out later. So, there are still unresolved issues around pay rates for staff in [Further Education and Training] colleges and poor linkages with traditional universities. Like it or not, they’re still seen as having a higher status.” There are some signs of change, however. University College Cork (UCC) is the first traditional university to offer tertiary degrees. One of its offerings is a BSc in occupational therapy, which had CAO entry points in excess of 500 points last year. Tanya Jones, deputy director of the National Tertiary Office, which oversees the roll-out of the new offerings, says demand is increasing. A total of 38 tertiary degrees are on offer this year across business, ICT, arts, engineering, social sciences, early learning & care, agricultural science, sport, construction and nursing. More programmes are now being designed in partnership with industry to tackle skills shortages and equip students for careers in sectors that need them. “Whether you’re finishing school, returning to education, or upskilling later in life, tertiary bachelors’ degrees are about meeting you where you are and helping you get to where you want to go,” Jones said. “Options and demand are increasing year on year, demonstrating the need for and importance of a more accessible route like the one presented by tertiary bachelors’ degrees.” These programmes ensure that your exam results won’t limit your options. If you’re willing to study and work hard, there’s a path for you in tertiary education. Nessa White, executive director for transformation at Solas, the State body which oversees the further education and training (FET) sector, adds that a key differentiating factor for tertiary degrees is that they are much more accessible. The fact that further education is available in almost every community across Ireland is, she says, creating a “supportive and tailored environment where people can develop their abilities and skills.” “This makes it a great platform for progression to higher education,” she said. Minister for Further and Higher Education James Lawless is convinced that the pathway will grow and give more students than ever the chance to pursue their ambitions without being tied down by the CAO points race. “I understand that many young people feel anxious about their educational future, worrying each year if their Leaving Certificate results will be enough to get into the course they want,” he said. “These programmes ensure that your exam results won’t limit your options. If you’re willing to study and work hard, there’s a path for you in tertiary education.” Burke, meanwhile, is on course to progress into the third year of his BSc in software development at MTU in September, having completed two years at Cork College of FET. He says he values the one-to-one help he received in a further education setting, while smaller class sizes in first year meant the transition from secondary school wasn’t as daunting. “If you need help in class, there’s never an issue. There’s a big emphasis on learning by doing ... you’re not just sitting in a lecture hall and listening.” While he knows some students have struggled in university, Burke feels he has a more solid foundation of learning. His dream of working as a data scientist is alive and well. “I’ll tell anyone who’ll listen to me to try this as an option. I’m excited to be gong to MTU in September ... I couldn’t recommend it highly enough.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC
