Title: ‚ÄòTake some time to look up‚Äô: Perseid meteor shower could be visible from Ireland tonight

One of the most eagerly awaited astronomical events of the year ‚Äì which promised one or two meteors or ‚Äúshooting stars‚Äù a minute ‚Äì is set to continue in Irish skies on Wednesday night. Tuesday night saw about 60 meteors an hour darting across the sky and stargazers can expect about half that amount on Wednesday night. ‚ÄúThe Perseids will be half as strong tonight as they were last night, so that‚Äôs still 10 times more meteors tonight than a normal night, so well worth viewing,‚Äù said David Moore from astronomy.ie. ‚ÄúThe best time to view is dusk until dawn,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe had people sending us counts of how many they saw every 15 minutes from 10:30pm last night when it got dark enough to see them. I saw some after 4am when dawn was breaking.‚Äù ‚ÄúDublin gets much the same view as the rest of the country, indeed, all of Europe,‚Äù Mr Moore said. ‚ÄúThis year the moon is in the sky so even those in the countryside will have moonlit skies so even suburban viewers will get the same view.‚Äù Met √âireann has forecast a humid night with clear spells on Wednesday, however a few showers are possible which could be heavy or thundery. Mr Moore advised stargazers to ensure they are comfortable while looking up. ‚ÄúStanding with your neck craned back for hours is not comfortable. ‚ÄúLook anywhere in the sky. If there are clouds look in the clear patches. If totally clear stand with your back to the moon so it does not dazzle you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe paths of the meteors will all point back to the constellation Perseus but you do not have to look at Perseus.‚Äù The Perseid meteors are caused by dust particles shed by the comet Swift-Tuttle. The comet, which takes 133 years to orbit the sun, was last seen in Irish skies in 1992. At this time of year, Earth moves through this debris cloud, making one of the most celebrated astronomical events and arguably the most predictable. Particles from the debris cloud subsequently burn up on entering Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and create flashes of light. The shower is active for several weeks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a special time of the year,‚Äù said astronomer Danielle Wilcox from Blackrock Castle Observatory, Cork. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a really good meteor shower in particular because it gives us a lot of meteors per hour compared to other meteor showers,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what‚Äôs so exciting about it, especially for people who have never seen ‚Äòshooting stars‚Äô, this is your chance to get out there and see that,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTake some time to look up,‚Äù she said.

Title: XRP Double-Bottom Breakout Sets Sights On $34, Predicts Analyst
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-double-bottom-breakout-34-predicts-analyst/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Gert van Lagen says the macro structure of XRP has finally done the one thing it needed to do: break the neckline of a seven-year base and hold it. ‚ÄúXRP [2W] ‚Äì Ripple is ready to rip. The 7-year double bottom has broken out at ‚ùå The neckline was successfully retested at üîµ ATH cleared ‚Äî first target near ~$34, at 2.00 fib. extension of double bottom. ‚Üí Compare with 2014‚Äì2017 setup,‚Äù the analyst wrote. His chart is drawn on a logarithmic scale with two-week candles, framing the move as a multi-cycle reversal rather than a short-term pop. The geometry is clear on the chart. A broad W-shaped base stretching from the 2018‚Äì2024 bear market carved twin lows in the sub-$0.20‚Äì$0.30 region, then returned to a horizontal neckline that sits just above the $2 handle. Van Lagen marks an initial breakout attempt with a red cross just over that barrier, followed by a decisive surge and a pullback that tags support around the $2 area, annotated with a blue dot. On a log chart, that textbook breakout-retest sequence is the confirmation step technicians typically look for before projecting targets. Price at the time of the snapshot is labeled $3.19 on the right axis, meaning XRP is trading above the neckline but still below the 2018 all-time high at $3.40. That placement matters because the prior macro cap now acts as support; staying north of roughly $2.00 keeps the double-bottom thesis intact. The measured arrow drawn from the neckline replicates the height of the base on a multiplicative (log) basis, which is why the upside extension leaps into the mid-double digits rather than adding only a few dollars. Van Lagen‚Äôs first objective is derived explicitly from Fibonacci proportions. He sets the 2.00 extension of the double-bottom as the initial target, landing ‚Äúnear ~$34.‚Äù On his scale the projected path peaks above the $27 and $20 grid lines and briefly tags the mid-$30s before mean-reverting, consistent with how log-scale extensions translate when a long consolidation unwinds quickly. The left side of the graphic provides the historical rhyme he wants readers to notice. Between 2014 and 2017, XRP built a smaller double-bottom within a shaded accumulation zone, broke its neckline, retested it, and then accelerated vertically. Van Lagen marks that sequence with the same red cross at breakout and blue dot at the retest, plus a vertical measuring arrow to illustrate how the earlier base resolved. The current pattern, shaded across 2018‚Äì2025, repeats that choreography at a far larger scale. His sketch includes a time-and-price roadmap using twelve forward candles‚Äîtwo-week bars‚Äîimplying a five- to six-month arc for the entire move if it were to echo the prior cycle. The first projected bar vaults XRP above $11. After three candles, the blue path tops out above $36, roughly six weeks into the run. The fourth candle traces a deep retracement back toward the $11 region, followed by a sharp recovery above $30 on the fifth. The next three candles stabilize around the $30 area before the path draws another slide to ~$11 and the onset of a cooling phase. The sequence is illustrative rather than prescriptive, but it visually anchors the extension math to possible market behavior. Whether XRP can follow the steep path sketched in blue is a separate question from whether the double-bottom has technically activated. Van Lagen‚Äôs chart answers the second with a yes: the breakout and retest sequence is complete. The first answer‚Äîdelivery toward the ~$34 Fib extension‚Äîwill be determined by how the next several two-week candles will look like. At press time, XRP traded at $3.14.

Title: Bullish Cryptocurrency Exchange Expands IPO Plans To $5 Billion

Time Published: 2025-08-12T09:00:08Z

Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish has announced a significant increase in the size of its initial public offering (IPO), aiming to raise approximately $990 million. According to a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company plans to offer 30 million shares priced between $32 and $33 each, targeting a market valuation of around $4.8 billion. This marks a notable shift from its earlier proposal, which included the sale of 20.3 million shares at a lower price range of $28 to $31, with a valuation goal of $4.2 billion. Led by former New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) president Tom Farley, Bullish has granted its underwriters‚Äîcomprising JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Citigroup‚Äîa 30-day option to sell an additional 4.5 million shares. Once the new offering is completed, the crypto exchange‚Äôs stock will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ‚ÄúBLSH.‚Äù In a show of confidence, major investment firms such as the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, BlackRock, and Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARK Investment Management, have expressed interest in acquiring up to $200 million worth of BLSH shares. This interest reflects a broader trend of renewed investor enthusiasm and regulatory support for the cryptocurrency sector under President Donald Trump‚Äôs new administration, as evidenced by recent successful market entries, including the notable debut of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRLC). The Bullish crypto exchange founded in the ‚Äúyear of the bull,‚Äù 2021, has also outlined plans to convert a significant portion of the initial public offering proceeds into stablecoins, collaborating with one or more dollar-pegged cryptocurrency issuers to facilitate this transition. This decision follows the recent signing of the GENIUS Act into law by President Donald Trump. The country‚Äôs first crypto bill establishes a new framework for stablecoins to thrive and integrate into the traditional finance sector. Despite its ambitious plans and the positive market climate, Bullish reported a loss of $349 million for the quarter ending March 31, a stark contrast to the $105 million profit it recorded during the same period last year. As Bullish prepares for its IPO, it joins a wave of crypto firms entering public markets, including Mike Novogratz‚Äôs Galaxy Digital, which recently uplisted to Nasdaq, and eToro, which has opened trading to the public. Additionally, crypto custody startup BitGo and the Winklevoss-run Gemini crypto exchange have both confidentially filed for US listings, signaling a renewed interest in cryptocurrency investments under a more favorable regulatory environment in the US. Amid these developments, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization hit a new record high of $4 trillion on Monday, with Bitcoin (BTC) once again surpassing the $120,000 threshold. However, despite Monday‚Äôs early momentum, the total market cap has since retraced and stabilized at around $3.93 trillion.

Title: Tonight, tomorrow best times to see Perseid meteor shower
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2025/0812/1528037-perseid-meteor-shower/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T08:23:52Z

The Perseid meteor shower will reach its peak tonight and tomorrow, making it the best time for stargazers to view the celestial fireworks. The event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every 133 years. The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earth's atmosphere at 36 miles per second, to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky. Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from 1,648C to 5,537C as they hit the atmosphere. The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus. Speaking on RT√â's Morning Ireland, Resident Astronomer at Blackrock Observatory in Cork Danielle Wilcox said the best time to view the spectacle is after sunset and before the moon rise as it will be the darkest time. Ms Wilcox said there are around 12 meteor showers every year but Perseid has the most and brightest meteors. "These are very predictable, they happen every year at the same time," she said. "What is happening is we have comets that come from the outer solar system and they come in from the sun and they come near the sun and start to break up. "So you have all this debris that comes from the comet, so you will have ice, rock and different things that are coming from the comet. "And it leaves this cloud and it is in the same spot in space, so as we are going around the sun, Earth slams into this cloud and passes through all this debris in August every year," Ms Wilcox said. She said if anyone misses meteor shower tonight or tomorrow, not to worry as it continues for the next week. ¬© RT√â 2025.

BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) also posted their largest single-day inflows, drawing about $640 million and $277 million, respectively.

Title: China and the U.S. clash at the U.N. over the Panama Canal

By The Associated Press A cargo ship navigates through the Panama Canal, seen from the Cerro Ancon in Panama City. Matias Delacroix/AP hide caption UNITED NATIONS ‚Äî The United States and China clashed over the Panama Canal at the United Nations on Monday, with the U.S. warning that Beijing's influence over the key waterway could threaten global trade and security and China calling U.S. accusations a pretext to take over the canal. The clash took place at a U.N. Security Council meeting where Panama's President Jos√© Ra√∫l Mulino stressed the neutrality of the canal and his country's ownership of the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Panama holds the council presidency this month, and Mulino was chairing a meeting on challenges to maritime security. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza told members these include piracy, armed robbery, transnational crime and cyber criminals weaponizing artificial intelligence to attack ports where there is "minimal cyber security, maximum exposure." U.S. President Donald Trump thrust Panama into the spotlight even before winning election last November by suggesting that his country should consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accusing Panama of ceding influence to China. The U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Control of the waterway transferred to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. China's U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong emphasized to the council that "Panama has consistently and effectively managed the canal, making significant contributions to global shipping and trade." "China has always respected the permanent neutrality of the canal and firmly supports Panama in safeguarding its sovereignty over the canal to ensure its openness and smooth operation," he said. Acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea, who spoke afterward, went after China, expressing concern about its "outsized influence over the Panama Canal area, especially over critical infrastructure and port operations." Alluding to its claims in the South China Sea, she said, "China's expansive and unlawful maritime claims and aggressive actions demonstrate its threat to maritime security and commerce." She said the U.S. rejects these claims and supports countries opposing them. "China's influence in the canal area is not just a risk to Panama and the United States, but rather a potential threat to global trade and security," Shea said. The Trump administration has pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at either end of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium that includes BlackRock Inc. Panama has vehemently rejected a takeover of the canal, but in April, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama and agreed with Mulino to step up security coordination. The agreement also gives U.S. troops access to strategic air and naval facilities in the Central American nation, which sparked large protests in Panama's capital. China's Fu asked for the floor to respond to Shea's accusations after all council members spoke, this time lashing out at the Trump administration. "The United States' fabrication of lies and groundless attacks against China are nothing but a pretext for seeking control of the canal," he said. The Chinese envoy called the U.S. and its deployment of offensive weapons in the South China Sea area "the biggest disrupter of peace and stability" in the region, and he accused the administration of exacerbating risks to global maritime security. "China firmly opposes economic coercion and bullying practices and urges the United States to stop fabricating rumors, lies and creating trouble," Fu said. Murillo then responded, saying he wanted to stress Panama's sovereignty "in terms of the ownership of the canal" and the multilateral treaty governing its administration. He called the canal's neutrality "the only and the best defense" to any specific or global threats. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: All-Time High For Crypto Market: Ethereum Leads The Charge Above $4,000

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. On Monday, the total crypto market capitalization (TOTAL) reached an all-time high (ATH) of $4.03 trillion, driven by significant gains in leading cryptocurrencies Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), reflecting renewed optimism in the crypto space fueled by favorable regulatory developments from the US. Ethereum notably broke through the $4,000 barrier for the first time in almost nine months, closing the gap to its all-time high of $4,878, now just 13% away. This upward momentum has been attributed to growing interest in cryptocurrencies, bolstered by pro-crypto regulatory measures that have enhanced market sentiment. Notably, the US has spearheaded a new wave of pro-crypto regulations, sparking a surge in investment in the digital asset market with the passage and signing of the first crypto bill, the GENIUS Act. This new legislation aims to create a more favorable regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Ethereum plays a key role in the stablecoin market, as a large portion of stablecoin activity occurs on its blockchain. In contrast, Bitcoin approached its current record high of $123,000 earlier in the day but ultimately fell short of the critical $120,000 mark, which is seen as essential for entering a new price discovery phase. Despite this, the overall market sentiment remains buoyant, particularly in light of recent executive orders from President Donald Trump aimed at fostering a more favorable environment for digital assets. On Thursday, Trump issued directives calling for a reevaluation of federal guidance on integrating cryptocurrencies into employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s. Analysts view this shift as a potential boom for the crypto industry, especially considering that 401(k) assets totaled $8.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute. As such, Ethereum has outperformed many of its peers among the top ten cryptocurrencies, posting gains of just over 13% in the past week. The only token to surpass this growth has been Cronos (CRO), which saw an 18% rally during the same period. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit has weighed in on Ethereum‚Äôs performance, suggesting that breaking the $4,000 barrier signals a massive breakout from an ascending triangle pattern on the monthly chart. This pattern is considered bullish, indicating that Ethereum could continue its upward trajectory in the coming months. In a recent analysis shared on X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit projected that Ethereum might reach new heights, potentially hitting $8,000. If this forecast holds true, it would represent an impressive 88% increase from ETH‚Äôs current trading price of $4,250 as of late Monday.

Title: How safe is your sunscreen and how long does it last after opening?

Consumer concerns have been raised about the protection offered by sunscreens after some well known brands were found in independent studies to contain less SPF (sun protection factor) than they indicated on the label. The consumer groups Choice and Which? sent a variety of popular sunscreen brands to be tested in accredited independent laboratories to see if they met their stated SPF claims. The brands Ultra Violette and Ultrasun were found to offer much lower levels of SPF than their labels indicated. Choice found that Ultra Violette‚Äôs Lean Screen SPF50+ Mattifying Zinc Skinscreen, which retails for ‚Ç¨39 at Space NK, returned a SPF rating of just 4 when tested. Separately, Which? revealed that the Ultrasun Family SPF30 lotion, which retails for ‚Ç¨35 at Boots, did not meet the minimum required UVA level in their tests. Both Ultra Violette and Ultrasun strongly disputed the claims citing their own testing protocols as superior to those employed in Choice and Which?‚Äôs research. Lidl and Aldi‚Äôs own-brand products were Which?‚Äôs best value sunscreens. Aldi‚Äôs Lacura SPF50+ Sensitive Lotion and Lidl‚Äôs Cien Sun Spray SPF30, which both retail for ‚Ç¨3.99, passed key sun safety tests and were significantly cheaper than their big brand rivals. However, Choice found that another Aldi own-brand sunscreen, Ombra Everyday Sunscreen Lotion 50+, which is not available in Ireland but is sold abroad, returned an SPF rating of just 26. We put Choice and Which?‚Äôs findings to three consultant dermatologists, each of whom say they would not be concerned by the results. ‚ÄúSunscreen testing is technically complex and highly sensitive to variations in methodology,‚Äù says Prof Caitr√≠ona Ryan, consultant dermatologist at the Institute of Dermatologists and Blackrock Clinic. ‚ÄúIn the case of the recent Choice report, several products were tested using a small sample size, which is well below the standard required for international SPF testing. Ultra Violette have since provided retesting data from accredited labs showing that their products do meet or exceed SPF 50+ claims under proper conditions.‚Äù Prof Anne-Marie Tobin, consultant dermatologist and professor of clinical medicine at Trinity College Dublin, is more concerned by lack of awareness around the exposure risks of applying expired sunscreen. ‚ÄúYou should not use any old sun cream out of your bathroom cabinet, as it may have expired. Expired sun cream will not give you protection against UVA or UVB rays, as the active ingredient in the sun cream will have degraded,‚Äù Prof Tobin says. ‚ÄúYou can check if your sun cream has expired by looking for a small drawing of a jar with a lid that has a number inside it, which is on every bottle of sun cream. The number tells you how many months you can use your sun cream for after you have opened it.‚Äù Prof Ryan adds that while UVB rays are primarily responsible for sunburn and direct DNA damage, UVA rays penetrate deeper into the skin, accelerating photo-ageing and increasing the long-term risk of skin cancer. ‚ÄúUnlike UVB, UVA levels remain constant throughout the year and can penetrate through cloud and glass. This is why choosing a sun cream that offers broad-spectrum protection, which shields against both UVA and UVB, is essential, even on cloudy days or when indoors near windows and particularly when driving,‚Äù Prof Ryan says. When it comes to the difference in protection between SPF30 and SPF50, Prof Ryan explains: ‚ÄúThe SPF is a time-based measure, it indicates how much longer someone can stay in the sun without burning, compared to wearing no sunscreen. If you would normally burn after 10 minutes of sun exposure, an SPF30 theoretically allows you to stay protected for 300 minutes, while SPF50 would extend that to 500 minutes. SPF30 filters out around 97 per cent of UVB rays, and SPF50 filters about 98 per cent.‚Äù Prof Tobin and London-based consultant dermatologist Dr Aamna Adel agree that more people than ever are practising sun safety whether that is because people have aesthetic concerns around skin ageing or they are worried about developing skin cancer. Prof Tobin notes that while patients are very good at applying protection to their faces, they are not as good at protecting their chest, shoulders, neck and back. All three experts agreed that most skin cancers arise from cumulative UV exposure. ‚ÄúYou can get skin cancer from being continuously exposed to low levels of UV over many years, rather than a one-off burn. It is best to turn putting on sun cream into an everyday habit like brushing your teeth. However, sun cream is only as effective as the person who applies it and most people don‚Äôt apply enough sun cream or don‚Äôt reapply their sun cream as frequently as they should,‚Äù Dr Adel says. [ Sunscreen: All you need to know to pick the best SPF for your face, scalp and bodyOpens in new window ] Prof Ryan also points to an alarming trend among younger people, using UV index data, not to avoid harm, but to maximise tanning. ‚ÄúSome social media influencers now promote the idea of ‚Äòsafe tanning‚Äô during peak UV hours, but UV radiation is a Group 1 carcinogen, and tanning, even without burning, still causes cumulative DNA damage that can lead to skin cancer. There is also a common misconception that sunscreen blocks all vitamin D production, but research shows that people produce adequate vitamin D while wearing SPF.‚Äù Prof Ryan has seen an increase in the number of younger adults being diagnosed with melanomas. ‚ÄúParticularly women in their 20s and 30s, which is likely linked to intermittent high-intensity UV exposure from tanning beds and sun holidays.‚Äù Prof Tobin advises that most sun protection should be provided by clothing, and staying out of the sun when the UV is strongest between 12pm and 3pm. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in Ireland, with more than 11,000 people diagnosed annually according to the Irish Cancer Society. The National Skin Cancer Registry Ireland expects the number of diagnoses to double by 2040. However, Prof Tobin believes the official diagnosis statistics are actually underestimated because statisticians must verify every case and so are ‚Äúlikely quite behind with the figures they publish‚Äù. There are two main categories of skin cancer: melanoma and non-melanoma. Dr Adel says that the symptoms of melanoma are ‚Äúa mole that is in any way changing in size, colour, texture or even if it begins to itch‚Äù. While the symptoms of non-melanoma are: ‚Äúa spot or scab that is oozing, crusting over or just not healing‚Äù. Prof Tobin wants there to be greater awareness around the symptoms of non-melanoma skin cancer as it is the most common form of skin cancer. ‚ÄúAbout 1,200 people are diagnosed with melanoma skin cancers every year, the rest are all non-melanoma.‚Äù Dr Adel frequently encounters people who delay getting checked because they worry that they will be wasting the doctor‚Äôs time. ‚ÄúI would much rather have people come to see me with something that does not turn out to need treatment than to wait longer and potentially put themselves at risk. Early detection gives patients the best chance of making a full recovery,‚Äù Dr Adel says. [ Six of the best budget sunscreens for summer 2025Opens in new window ] In response to Choice‚Äôs SPF protection findings Ultra Violette issued this statement: ‚ÄúUltra Violette is deeply committed to the health and safety of our customers and only work with reputable, TGA licensed manufacturers who perform substantial quality release testing in accordance with the strictest SPF standards in the world. We do not accept these results as even remotely accurate.‚Äù Likewise, Ultrasun disputed Which?‚Äôs findings: ‚ÄúUltrasun is fully confident in our testing protocols. Our chosen testing protocol is one of the strictest available, and our UVB and UVA filters are tested both in vitro and in vivo. We conclusively support the result of our independent tests which found that the Ultrasun Family SPF30 reached a UVB-SPF in vivo of 31.4 and a UVA-PF in vitro of 13.1, which equates to a 92 per cent UVA absorbance.‚Äù ¬© 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: A US senator from Colombia emerges as a Trump link for Latin America's conservatives

U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration MIAMI -- When Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno visits Colombia this week as part of a three-nation tour of Latin America, it will be something of a homecoming. Ohio‚Äôs first Latino senator, who defeated an incumbent last year with the help of Donald Trump‚Äôs endorsement, was born in the Colombian capital of Bogota, and even as he was chasing the American dream, he kept close tabs on the country through older brothers who are heavyweights in politics and business there. Moreno, 58, has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration. In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the trip, he expressed deep concern about Colombia‚Äôs direction under left-wing President Gustavo Petro and suggested that U.S. sanctions, higher tariffs or other retaliatory action might be needed to steer it straight. The recent criminal conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe, a conservative icon, was an attempt to ‚Äúsilence‚Äù the man who saved Colombia from guerrilla violence, Moreno said. Meanwhile, record cocaine production has left the United States less secure ‚Äî and Colombia vulnerable to being decertified by the White House for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs. ‚ÄúThe purpose of the trip is to understand all the dynamics before any decision is made,‚Äù said Moreno, who will meet with both Petro and Uribe, as well as business leaders and local officials. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs taken off the table at this point and there‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs directly being contemplated.‚Äù Moreno, a luxury car dealer from Cleveland, defeated incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown last year with the help of $441 million in political ad spending ‚Äî the most in U.S. Senate race history. He became Ohio‚Äôs senior senator on practically his first day in office after his close friend JD Vance resigned the Senate to become vice president. In Congress, Moreno has mimicked Trump‚Äôs rhetoric to attack top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as a ‚Äúmiserable old man out of a Dickens novel,‚Äù called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatened to subpoena California officials over their response to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. On Latin America, he‚Äôs been similarly outspoken, slamming Petro on social media as a ‚Äúsocialist dictator‚Äù and accusing Mexico of being on the path to becoming a ‚Äúnarco state.‚Äù He also surprised many hardliners in the GOP early on by suggesting in January that Trump should engage with Venezuelan President Nicol√°s Maduro despite his re-election in what the U.S., European Union and other governments condemned as a rigged vote. While referring to Maduro as a ‚Äúgang leader‚Äù and "terrorist," Moreno nonetheless expressed support for the Trump administration's decision last month to allow energy giant Chevron to resume drilling in Venezuela following a deal with Maduro to free 10 jailed Americans held there. ‚ÄúWhat people wanted to hear in January is that we‚Äôre going to fly F-16s into Caracas and wage war against the country and that just wasn‚Äôt going to happen,‚Äù said Moreno in the interview. ‚ÄúIf we take actions that are too much in that direction, we end up turning Venezuela over to China.‚Äù Such comments barely register in blue-collar Ohio, but they‚Äôve garnered attention in Latin America. That despite the fact Moreno hasn‚Äôt lived in the region for decades and doesn‚Äôt sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs somebody to watch,‚Äù said Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one of the most loyal Trump supporters in the Senate, and, given his background in Latin America, he could be influential on policy.‚Äù Moreno starts his first congressional delegation to Latin America on Monday for two days of meetings in Mexico City with officials including President Claudia Sheinbaum. Moreno, in the pre-trip interview, said that Sheinbaum has done more to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. than her predecessor and mentor Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, who he described as a ‚Äútotal disaster.‚Äù But he said more cooperation is needed, and he‚Äôd like to see Mexico allow the DEA to participate in judicial wiretaps like it has for decades in Colombia and allow it to bring back a plane used in bilateral investigations that L√≥pez Obrador grounded. ‚ÄúThe corruption becomes so pervasive, that if it‚Äôs left unchecked, it‚Äôs kind of like treating cancer,‚Äù said Moreno. ‚ÄúMexico has to just come to the realization that it does not have the resources to completely wipe out the drug cartels. And it‚Äôs only going to be by asking the U.S. for help that we can actually accomplish that.‚Äù From Mexico, Moreno heads to Panama, where he‚Äôll tour the Panama Canal with Trump‚Äôs new ambassador to the country, Kevin Marino Cabrera. In March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate struck a deal that would have handed control of two ports on either end of the U.S.-built canal to American investment firm BlackRock Inc. The deal was heralded by Trump, who had threatened to take back the canal to curb Chinese influence. However, the deal has since drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in Beijing and last month the seller said it was seeking to add a strategic partner from mainland China ‚Äî reportedly state-owned shipping company Cosco ‚Äî to the deal. ‚ÄúCosco, you might as well say, is the actual communist party,‚Äù said Moreno. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no scenario in which Cosco can be part of the Panamanian ports.‚Äù On the final leg of the tour in Colombia, Moreno will be joined by another Colombian American senator: Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona. In contrast to Moreno, who was born into privilege and counts among his siblings a former ambassador to the U.S., Gallego and his three sisters were raised by an immigrant single mother on a secretary‚Äôs paycheck. Despite their different upbringings, the two have made common cause in seeking to uphold the tradition of bilateral U.S. support for Colombia, for decades Washington‚Äôs staunchest ally in the region. It‚Äôs a task made harder by deepening polarization in both countries. The recent sentencing of Uribe to 12 years of house arrest in a long-running witness tampering case has jolted the nation‚Äôs politics with nine months to go before decisive presidential elections. The former president is barred from running but remains a powerful leader, and Moreno said his absence from the campaign trail could alter the playing field. He also worries that surging cocaine production could once again lead to a ‚Äúnarcotization‚Äù of a bilateral relationship that should be about trade, investment and mutual prosperity. ‚ÄúWe want Colombia to be strong, we want Colombia to be healthy, we want Colombia to be prosperous and secure, and I think the people of Colombia want the exact same thing,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúSo, the question is, how do we get there?‚Äù ___ Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: China and the US clash at the UN over the Panama Canal, a focus of Trump‚Äôs attention

By EDITH M. LEDERER UNITED NATIONS (AP) ‚Äî The United States and China clashed over the Panama Canal at the United Nations on Monday, with the U.S. warning that Beijing‚Äôs influence over the key waterway could threaten global trade and security and China calling U.S. accusations a pretext to take over the canal. The clash took place at a U.N. Security Council meeting where Panama‚Äôs President Jos√© Ra√∫l Mulino stressed the neutrality of the canal and his country‚Äôs ownership of the waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Panama holds the council presidency this month, and Mulino was chairing a meeting on challenges to maritime security. Interpol Secretary General Valdecy Urquiza told members these include piracy, armed robbery, transnational crime and cyber criminals weaponizing artificial intelligence to attack ports where there is ‚Äúminimal cyber security, maximum exposure.‚Äù U.S. President Donald Trump thrust Panama into the spotlight even before winning election last November by suggesting that his country should consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accusing Panama of ceding influence to China. The U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Control of the waterway transferred to Panama in 1999 under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. China‚Äôs U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong emphasized to the council that ‚ÄúPanama has consistently and effectively managed the canal, making significant contributions to global shipping and trade.‚Äù ‚ÄúChina has always respected the permanent neutrality of the canal and firmly supports Panama in safeguarding its sovereignty over the canal to ensure its openness and smooth operation,‚Äù he said. Acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea, who spoke afterward, went after China, expressing concern about its ‚Äúoutsized influence over the Panama Canal area, especially over critical infrastructure and port operations.‚Äù Alluding to its claims in the South China Sea, she said, ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs expansive and unlawful maritime claims and aggressive actions demonstrate its threat to maritime security and commerce.‚Äù She said the U.S. rejects these claims and supports countries opposing them. ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs influence in the canal area is not just a risk to Panama and the United States, but rather a potential threat to global trade and security,‚Äù Shea said. The Trump administration has pressured China to have the Hong Kong-based operator of ports at either end of the canal sell those interests to a U.S. consortium that includes BlackRock Inc. Panama has vehemently rejected a takeover of the canal, but in April, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited Panama and agreed with Mulino to step up security coordination. The agreement also gives U.S. troops access to strategic air and naval facilities in the Central American nation, which sparked large protests in Panama‚Äôs capital. China‚Äôs Fu asked for the floor to respond to Shea‚Äôs accusations after all council members spoke, this time lashing out at the Trump administration. ‚ÄúThe United States‚Äô fabrication of lies and groundless attacks against China are nothing but a pretext for seeking control of the canal,‚Äù he said. The Chinese envoy called the U.S. and its deployment of offensive weapons in the South China Sea area ‚Äúthe biggest disrupter of peace and stability‚Äù in the region, and he accused the administration of exacerbating risks to global maritime security. ‚ÄúChina firmly opposes economic coercion and bullying practices and urges the United States to stop fabricating rumors, lies and creating trouble,‚Äù Fu said. Murillo then responded, saying he wanted to stress Panama‚Äôs sovereignty ‚Äúin terms of the ownership of the canal‚Äù and the multilateral treaty governing its administration. He called the canal‚Äôs neutrality ‚Äúthe only and the best defense‚Äù to any specific or global threats.

The prospective Truth Social Bitcoin ETF moves closer to reality as Trump Media files amendments, intensifying focus on its ambitious crypto vision. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has filed its first amended registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, advancing plans to enter the fast-growing spot Bitcoin ETF market. The ETF, to be listed on NYSE Arca under the ticker B.T., will hold Bitcoin (BTC) directly and seek to track the flagship crypto‚Äôs market price. Crypto.com will act as the exclusive custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider, while Yorkville America Digital will serve as the ETF‚Äôs sponsor. The ETF‚Äôs structure allocates 70% of its assets to Bitcoin, with 15% in U.S. Treasury securities and 15% in cash or cash equivalents, aiming to balance exposure to the crypto with traditional financial instruments. The launch remains subject to SEC approval of both the updated Form S-1 registration and a separate Form 19b-4 listing application. The company has not provided a specific launch date but indicated it expects the fund to go live before year-end. TMTG, parent of the Truth Social social platform, streaming service Truth+, and fintech brand Truth.Fi, said the ETF forms part of a broader Bitcoin-focused strategy. The strategy includes building a corporate Bitcoin treasury and expanding into digital asset products through its financial services division. The company has already committed substantial capital to Bitcoin acquisitions this year, positioning itself among the more aggressive corporate entrants into the sector. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would enter a competitive landscape dominated by heavyweight issuers such as BlackRock, whose spot Bitcoin ETF has drawn billions in inflows since the first U.S. approvals in January and set multiple records. The ETFs have attracted a mix of institutional and retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin without the need for self-custody. The filing also highlights the political dimension of TMTG‚Äôs crypto ambitions. President Donald Trump, the company‚Äôs majority shareholder, has made digital assets a policy priority, pledging to roll back what he calls restrictive regulations and promote U.S. leadership in the crypto economy. A spot Bitcoin ETF tied to a political brand of Trump‚Äôs profile would be unprecedented in the market, potentially attracting a distinct investor base but also intensifying public and regulatory scrutiny. The timing of the filing reflects an environment where spot Bitcoin ETFs are gaining mainstream acceptance and competitive differentiation is becoming critical. While the SEC has approved multiple products this year, new entrants face the challenge of building liquidity and investor trust in a market already served by established issuers.

Title: REX Osprey Solana ETF posts zero net flows across majority of August sessions

The main reasons are likely lack of institutional interest and the complicated structure which the ETF is based on, analysts weigh in. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. REX Osprey Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) recorded zero trading activity on four of six trading days through August 8, according to Farside Investors data. Trading under ticker SSK, the fund posted no flows on Aug. 1, Aug. 4, Aug. 5, and Aug. 7, with minimal $6.4 million in activity on Aug. 8 and $2.7 million outflows on Aug. 6. REX Osprey‚Äôs fund is the first US-listed Solana ETF to integrate native staking mechanisms. The product operates outside standard SEC-registered spot ETF frameworks, delivering SOL exposure through indirect vehicles rather than direct crypto holdings. CoinShares flow data showed Solana products attracted $874 million in year-to-date inflows, staying behind Ethereum (ETH) and XRP among major cap altcoins despite its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The trading pattern could reflect broader institutional hesitation toward Solana-focused investment products compared to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum alternatives. Nansen senior research analyst Jake Kennis attributed the disparity to institutional portfolio allocation strategies. He explained in a note: ‚ÄúETH is seeing a lot of new activity as institutions were likely underweight ETH relative to BTC. Solana has been mostly in the backseat for this new wave of attention, but SOL ETFs would likely pick up if institutions are looking to also diversify away from BTC and ETH.‚Äù The REX Osprey fund‚Äôs design incorporates staking mechanisms and offshore ETF allocations that differentiate it from traditional spot cryptocurrency products. Stabolut founder and CEO Eneko Kn√∂rr identified these features as adoption obstacles rather than demand deficiencies. Kn√∂rr said: ‚ÄúSSK‚Äôs quiet tape looks more like a brand and distribution issue than a pure demand problem. Its design isn‚Äôt a simple ‚Äòspot SOL in a wrapper‚Äô‚Äîthe fund stakes SOL and can allocate a portion into other SOL ETFs/ETPs, many offshore, which adds complexity that some buyers shy away from.‚Äù The fund charges a 0.75% management fee, positioning it at the higher end of cryptocurrency ETF expense ratios. Traditional spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs from major issuers typically carry fees between 0.15% and 0.25%. Kennis, from Nansen, noted that the fee structure creates a cost-benefit analysis for institutional investors weighing direct cryptocurrency exposure against ETF convenience. He referenced Solana‚Äôs approximately 7% annual staking rewards: ‚ÄúThe staking component seems like a major feature given the ‚Äòpassive‚Äô yield being left on the table.‚Äù The absence of major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity in the Solana ETF space contributes to limited market penetration. REX Shares operates as a smaller ETF issuer without the distribution networks and brand recognition of Wall Street‚Äôs largest asset managers. Kn√∂rr argued: ‚ÄúEarly trading will likely remain lumpy until bigger brands enter the space. Structure, complexity, and limited shelf space are holding it back‚Äîinterest in Solana exposure itself doesn‚Äôt appear to be the issue.‚Äù As of Aug. 11, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is still considering the approval of Solana ETFs under the more tax-friendly 1933 Act.

Title: Why The Trump Administration MAGA Stock Dreams For Fannie And Freddie Could Be A Windfall For Wall Street

BySergei Klebnikov BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. The Trump administration is teeing up what could be the biggest shakeup in U.S. housing finance since the 2008 crisis‚Äîa pair of IPOs that might value Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac at a combined $500 billion. The plan, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and is still being finalized by the administration, would see the federal government sell between 5% and 15% of each company, potentially raising about $30 billion in what would be one of the largest stock offerings in American history. Yet behind the fanfare lies a precarious gamble on institutions still tethered to taxpayer support and whose profitability is largely cushioned by an implicit government guarantee. Senior administration officials have in recent days confirmed the plans are far along, though crucial structural decisions‚Äîsuch as whether to list the two separately or together‚Äîremain unresolved. President Trump himself has signaled his intention to proceed with the listings this year: ‚ÄúI am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES,‚Äù he wrote on social media last week. On Saturday, he posted an edited picture of himself ringing the opening bell at the NYSE for a hypothetical, combined entity called the Great American Mortgage Corporation trading under the ticker ‚ÄúMAGA.‚Äù The Treasury‚Äîwhich currently holds the bulk of both government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) equity‚Äîcould release new shares, sell existing ones, or blend both strategies to create liquidity. Wall Street heavyweights such as JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America have reportedly been asked to advise on pricing and structure. The history of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a cautionary tale. Fannie‚Äôs roots stretch back to 1938, Freddie‚Äôs to 1970; Both were designed to keep mortgage credit flowing by securitizing and guaranteeing home loans. Their business model‚Äîbuying mortgages from lenders, bundling them into mortgage-backed securities and guaranteeing payment to investors‚Äîhelped lower borrowing costs for generations of Americans. During the mid-2000s housing boom, both ramped up exposure to riskier loans and loosened underwriting standards, leaving them vulnerable when home prices crashed. During the housing bubble the top executives of these quasi-governmental agencies benefited from compensation packages in the tens of millions. By September 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) had placed them into conservatorship after a combined $187 billion Treasury rescue, wiping out most private shareholder value. In the years since, the GSEs have returned to profitability, paying dividends that exceeded the bailout amount. Yet they have remained under government control, their retained earnings capped for much of the past decade until capital buffers were gradually rebuilt. FHFA‚Äôs 2024 Annual Report to Congress shows that by year-end, Fannie Mae‚Äôs total equity had grown $17 billion to $94.7 billion, while Freddie Mac‚Äôs climbed 24.8% to $59.6 billion. In a brief published earlier this year by Jim Parrott of the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, and Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody‚Äôs Analytics, the two highlighted the importance of keeping the implicit federal guarantee post-IPO. ‚ÄúCritical to the rating agencies and the Fed is not that the GSEs posed little risk, but that they enjoyed the unlimited backing of the U.S. government,‚Äù they write, warning that without that support, funding costs could climb sharply‚Äîdriving up mortgage rates by 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points as well as shrinking credit access. The pair go on to caution that ending conservatorship without a clear legislative or financial framework risks delivering ‚Äúno value,‚Äù and could leave the system ‚Äúless liquid and stable.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe believe it‚Äôs essential for the government to retain the explicit government guarantee if they pursue privatization, which could take years to implement,‚Äù wrote Lawrence Gillum, chief fixed income Strategist for LPL Financial. ‚ÄúRemoving the guarantee would disrupt both markets and make housing even less affordable.‚Äù A $30 billion stock sale by the Federal government would provide a one-time boost to Treasury‚Äôs coffers but it would only represent an estimated 1.6% slice of the current fiscal year‚Äôs projected $1.9 trillion deficit. After the sale it is likely that the Federal government would still own 85% to 95% of the government sponsored mortgage companies and thus benefit from any appreciation in its share price. The windfall would also extend beyond the public purse. Hedge fund billionaires such as Bill Ackman and John Paulson, who built large positions in the mortgage giants years ago betting on their return to the market, could reap outsized rewards if the IPOs hit their targets. Ackman, who has long advocated for the privatization of the two GSEs, owns roughly 10% of the common stock of both Fannie and Freddie through his fund, Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman‚Äôs firm first invested in Fannie and Freddie common stock in late 2013, roughly five years after they were put under government conservatorship during the financial crisis. His cost basis for each averaged just over $2 per share. Today, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae currently trade at $9 per share and $11.50 per share, respectively. According to previous filings from his firm (Pershing Square stopped disclosing these specific holdings in regular filings several years ago), he owned 115.5 million shares of Fannie and 63.5 million shares of Freddie‚Äîthat stake today would be worth roughly $1.8 billion. Wall Street underwriters also stand to collect millions in advisory fees. Banks like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were top originators for Freddie and Fannie last year, while institutions like BlackRock and PIMCO are significant holders of mortgage backed securities. If the Trump administration pulls it off, the planned Fannie and Freddie offerings could rank among the most ambitious privatizations in modern U.S. history. Still, trying to privatize much of the nation‚Äôs mortgage infrastructure during the worst housing affordability crisis in a generation will be no easy task, as critics have pointed out. The current administration will no doubt need to be more specific and methodical than they have been so far if they want to avoid losing investor confidence and causing a shock to the financial system.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily The case of the "missing shares" started in 2021, and has wound its way through several jurisdictions. A takeover could be next. PARIS ‚Äî SMCP, the parent company of Sandro, Maje, Claudie Pierlot, and Fursac, has regained control of a 15.5 percent stake of its capital as a result of a ruling by the Singapore High Court, following a lengthy legal battle. The group said Monday after market close that the shares ‚Äî previously transferred in 2021 to Dynamic Treasure Group, a trust registered in the British Virgin Islands ‚Äî have officially been returned to European TopSoho, a Luxembourg-based holding entity and former majority shareholder of SMCP. The return of the shares follows a July 4 decision by the court in Singapore, where the shares were being held. Related Articles Financial SMCP Q2 Sales Up 3% With Full-price Strategy Boosting Growth Financial SMCP Secures Singapore Court Victory in Battle Over Disputed Share Transfer ‚ÄúThe return of the shares clarifies SMCP‚Äôs shareholding situation,‚Äù the company said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe group remains focused on executing its profitable growth strategy, leveraging the desirability of its brands, its operational agility, and ongoing efforts in cost management.‚Äù You May Also Like The 15.5 percent stake has been at the center of a years-long shareholder dispute dating back to the financial collapse of Chinese conglomerate Shandong Ruyi, which had acquired a majority stake in SMCP in 2016 through European TopSoho ahead of the group‚Äôs 2017 initial public offering. This is the latest twist of the ‚Äúmissing shares‚Äù case that began in 2021, when 15.5 percent of the share capital ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù from Luxembourg and reappeared in the British Virgin Islands two-and-a-half months later. They reappeared in the accounts of Dynamic Treasure Group, also controlled by European TopSoho director Chenran Qiu, the daughter of Shandong Ruyi‚Äôs founder. European TopSoho had sold them to Dynamic Treasure Group for a symbolic one euro. In the interim, European TopSoho also issued a press release denying Qiu‚Äôs involvement in Dynamic Treasure Group, misleading the market. The Singapore court ruling followed a similar decision by the English High Court in July 2024, which canceled the sale of the shares to Dynamic Treasure Group. Jurisdiction moved to Singapore, where the shares were being held in local accounts. European TopSoho, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in February 2023, is now under the control of a court-appointed administrator in Luxembourg. The return of the 15.5 percent stake won‚Äôt immediately change control of SMCP but does bring greater transparency to investors. London-based GLAS currently acts as trustee for European TopSoho‚Äôs creditors, including BlackRock, Carlyle, Anchorage, Boussard and Gavaudan, who remain SMCP‚Äôs largest shareholders. Last year, GLAS revealed its intention to offload 37 percent of the group‚Äôs shares ‚Äî a move that could trigger a mandatory takeover under French law if a single buyer snaps them up. In its second-quarter financial results released July 29, SMCP posted 3.3 percent organic sales growth to 304.5 million euros, as the group doubled down on full-price sales and tighter inventory controls. Chief executive officer Isabelle Guichot‚Äôs recovery strategy continues to focus on stabilizing the business following store closures in China, while expanding in new markets including India and the Philippines, and focusing investment on its core brands Sandro and Maje.

Title: A US senator from Colombia emerges as a Trump link for Latin America‚Äôs conservatives
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/08/11/senate-moreno-latin-america/
Time Published: 2025-08-11T16:38:35Z
Full Content:
By JOSHUA GOODMAN and JULIE CARR SMYTH MIAMI (AP) ‚Äî When Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno visits Colombia this week as part of a three-nation tour of Latin America, it will be something of a homecoming. The Ohio senator, who defeated an incumbent last year with the help of Donald Trump‚Äôs endorsement and the highest political ad spending in U.S. Senate race history, was born in Bogota and has brothers who are heavyweights in politics and business there. Moreno has emerged as an interlocutor for conservatives in Latin America seeking to connect with the Trump administration. In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of the trip, he expressed deep concern about Colombia‚Äôs direction under left-wing President Gustavo Petro and suggested that U.S. sanctions, higher tariffs or other retaliatory action might be needed to steer it straight. The recent criminal conviction of former President Alvaro Uribe, a conservative icon, was an attempt to ‚Äúsilence‚Äù the man who saved Colombia from guerrilla violence, Moreno said. Meanwhile, record cocaine production has left the United States less secure ‚Äî and Colombia vulnerable to being decertified by the White House for failing to cooperate in the war on drugs. ‚ÄúThe purpose of the trip is to understand all the dynamics before any decision is made,‚Äù said Moreno, who will meet with both Petro and Uribe, as well as business leaders and local officials. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs taken off the table at this point and there‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs directly being contemplated.‚Äù Moreno, a luxury car dealer from Cleveland, defeated incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown last year and became Ohio‚Äôs senior senator on practically his first day in office after his close friend JD Vance resigned the Senate to become vice president. In Congress, Moreno has mimicked Trump‚Äôs rhetoric to attack top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer as a ‚Äúmiserable old man out of a Dickens novel,‚Äù called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and threatened to subpoena California officials over their response to anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. On Latin America, he‚Äôs been similarly outspoken, slamming Petro on social media as a ‚Äúsocialist dictator‚Äù and accusing Mexico of being on the path to becoming a ‚Äúnarco state.‚Äù Such comments barely register in blue-collar Ohio, but they‚Äôve garnered attention in Latin America. That despite the fact Moreno hasn‚Äôt lived in the region for decades, speaks Spanish with a U.S. accent and doesn‚Äôt sit on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs somebody to watch,‚Äù said Michael Shifter, the former president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one of the most loyal Trump supporters in the senate and given his background in Latin America he could be influential on policy.‚Äù Moreno, 58, starts his first congressional delegation to Latin America on Monday for two days of meetings in Mexico City with officials including President Claudia Sheinbaum. He‚Äôll be accompanied by Terrance Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who is making his first overseas trip since being confirmed by the Senate last month to head the premier federal narcotics agency. Moreno, in the pre-trip interview, said that Sheinbaum has done more to combat the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. than her predecessor and mentor Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, who he described as a ‚Äútotal disaster.‚Äù But he said more cooperation is needed, and he‚Äôd like to see Mexico allow the DEA to participate in judicial wiretaps like it has for decades in Colombia and allow it to bring back a plane used in bilateral investigations that L√≥pez Obrador grounded. ‚ÄúThe corruption becomes so pervasive, that if it‚Äôs left unchecked, it‚Äôs kind of like treating cancer,‚Äù said Moreno. ‚ÄúMexico has to just come to the realization that it does not have the resources to completely wipe out the drug cartels. And it‚Äôs only going to be by asking the U.S. for help that we can actually accomplish that.‚Äù From Mexico, Moreno heads to Panama, where he‚Äôll tour the Panama Canal with Trump‚Äôs new ambassador to the country, Kevin Marino Cabrera. In March, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate struck a deal that would‚Äôve handed control of two ports on either end of the U.S.-built canal to American investment firm BlackRock Inc. The deal was heralded by Trump, who had threatened to take back the canal to curb Chinese influence. However, the deal has since drawn scrutiny from antitrust authorities in Beijing and last month the seller said it was seeking to add a strategic partner from mainland China ‚Äî reportedly state-owned shipping company Cosco ‚Äî to the deal. ‚ÄúCosco you might as well say is the actual communist party,‚Äù said Moreno. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no scenario in which Cosco can be part of the Panamanian ports.‚Äù On the final leg of the tour in Colombia, Moreno will be joined by another Colombian American senator: Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona. In contrast to Moreno, who was born into privilege and counts among his siblings a former ambassador to the U.S., Gallego and his three sisters were raised by an immigrant single mother on a secretary‚Äôs paycheck. Despite their different upbringings, the two have made common cause in seeking to uphold the tradition of bilateral U.S. support for Colombia, for decades Washington‚Äôs staunchest ally in the region. It‚Äôs a task made harder by deepening polarization in both countries. The recent sentencing of Uribe to 12 years of house arrest in a long-running witness tampering case has jolted the nation‚Äôs politics with nine months to go before decisive presidential elections. The former president is barred from running but remains a powerful leader, and Moreno said his absence from the campaign trail could alter the playing field. He also worries that surging cocaine production could once again lead to a ‚Äúnarcotization‚Äù of a bilateral relationship that should be about trade, investment and mutual prosperity. ‚ÄúWe want Colombia to be strong, we want Colombia to be healthy, we want Colombia to be prosperous and secure, and I think the people of Colombia want the exact same thing,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúSo, the question is, how do we get there?‚Äù Smyth reported from Columbus, Ohio.

Title: Ethereum Bullish Fundamentals Clash With Short-Term Leverage Risks
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-bullish-fundamentals-clash-with-short-term-leverage-risks/

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum reached multi-year highs, breaking decisively above the $4,300 level after several days of strong bullish momentum. This breakout marks Ethereum‚Äôs highest level since late 2021, fueled by growing institutional demand, ETF inflows, and expanding on-chain activity. However, fresh market data from CryptoQuant suggests that caution may be warranted in the short term. The all-exchange Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) has climbed to 0.68, approaching historical highs and signaling excessive market-wide leverage. While Binance‚Äôs ELR sits lower at 0.52, indicating more measured positioning on the world‚Äôs largest exchange, higher relative leverage on other platforms points to elevated speculative activity elsewhere. Ethereum‚Äôs price is currently testing a critical resistance zone between $4,020 and $4,060‚Äîa historically pivotal area that has often determined whether a rally accelerates or faces a sharp pullback. Adding to the short-term risk profile, Binance netflows have spiked significantly above the all-exchange average, suggesting concentrated inflows that may lead to localized sell pressure, possibly linked to liquidations or arbitrage-driven trades. According to Crypto Onchain, a CryptoQuant analyst, Ethereum‚Äôs mid-term fundamentals remain strongly bullish despite short-term caution signals. Institutional demand is surging, with US Spot Ethereum ETFs recording a record $726.6 million in daily net inflows, driven by giants like BlackRock and Fidelity. This has pushed total ETF holdings above 5 million ETH (valued at approximately $20.3 billion), a milestone that underscores Ethereum‚Äôs growing role in institutional portfolios. Beyond ETFs, major players are increasing direct exposure. Ark Invest purchased 30,755 ETH worth $108.57 million, while Fundamental Global allocated $200 million to ETH as part of its treasury strategy. This wave of accumulation reflects deepening confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term utility and value proposition. On-chain metrics also paint a bullish picture. Transaction volumes are hitting new highs, and staking participation continues to expand, locking up more ETH and reducing circulating supply. Regulatory clarity‚Äîsuch as the SEC closing investigations into liquid staking‚Äîhas further strengthened structural demand for ETH. Upcoming network upgrades, including Pectra and Fusaka, are set to boost scalability and lower costs. This will enhance Ethereum‚Äôs appeal to both developers and enterprises. In the short term, high leverage, key resistance levels, and concentrated exchange inflows pose a risk of sharp volatility. However, the mid-term outlook remains intact, supported by sustained institutional inflows, robust network growth, and technological advancements. Even if near-term corrections occur, these factors should help cap downside pressure and maintain Ethereum‚Äôs broader bullish trajectory. Ethereum‚Äôs 4-hour chart shows a strong breakout above the key resistance at $3,860, which had capped price action in late July. Following this decisive move, ETH surged past the $4,300 level, marking its highest point since November 2021. This rally was supported by strong bullish momentum, as seen in the steep incline of the 50-period SMA (blue) and the price holding well above the 100-period (green) and 200-period (red) SMAs. Currently, ETH is consolidating just below its recent peak, around $4,240, signaling a potential pause before the next move. This consolidation at elevated levels, rather than a sharp retracement, suggests that bulls remain in control. The $3,860‚Äì$3,900 zone now acts as a critical support, and a retest could provide a healthy setup for continuation. Volume spikes during the breakout indicate strong buying interest, but the reduced volume in the latest candles suggests the market is waiting for fresh catalysts. A sustained move above $4,300 could open the door toward the $4,450‚Äì$4,500 zone, while a breakdown below $3,860 would weaken the bullish structure.

Crypto exchange Bullish has raised the size of its initial public offering to $990 million from $629 million, as the company looks to take advantage of a hot market for crypto firms. CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Bullish. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Bullish is aiming to sell 30 million shares at a price of $32 to $33 each, or $990 million and a valuation of $4.8 billion at the top of the range. In a previous filing on Aug. 4, the company had planned to market 20.3 million shares at $28 to $31 each, or about $629 million and a $4.2 billion valuation at the top of the range. Bullish is one of many crypto companies hoping to take advantage of a booming IPO market in the space as the industry is starting to profit from a clearer regulatory framework and investor interest, not to mention sharply higher prices of late for leading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether. Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) was among first to go public in June and has seen its share price skyrocket 93% since. In an earlier filing with the SEC, Bullish disclosed that funds managed by BlackRock and Ark Investment Management have expressed interest to buy $200 million worth of shares of the company at the IPO price. The company, which would trade under the ticker ‚ÄúBLSH‚Äù also disclosed that it had posted a net income estimate of $106 million to $109 million for the second quarter after reporting losses for the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2024.

Title: BlackRock Addresses Burning XRP ETF Question: Is A Filing Coming Or Not?

The world‚Äôs largest asset manager, BlackRock, has broken its silence on whether it intends to file for an XRP ETF. This follows months of speculation that the firm could soon file to offer this fund. A BlackRock spokesperson told The Block that they have no plans to file for an XRP ETF at this time. This ends speculations that it will join eight other asset managers who have already filed to offer this fund. The world‚Äôs largest asset manager already offers Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and based on the statement, the firm plans to stick with only the two largest crypto assets. NovaDius Wealth President Nate Geraci was one of those who had speculated that BlackRock was going to file for an XRP ETF soon. Prior to the asset manager‚Äôs statement, Geraci opined that the firm was waiting for the Ripple SEC lawsuit to end before filing for an iShares XRP ETF. He made this prediction following Ripple and the SEC‚Äôs filing of a joint dismissal to end the XRP lawsuit. Geraci further remarked that it makes ‚Äúzero‚Äù sense for BlackRock to ignore crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. He added that if they do that, they are basically saying that BTC and ETH are the only crypto assets that will ever have value. Following BlackRock‚Äôs statement, the NovaDius Wealth president said that the firm‚Äôs decision not to file for an XRP ETF will be looked on as a mistake. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas also weighed in on BlackRock‚Äôs decision not to file for an XRP ETF. He asked Geraci if an XRP filing is enough or if he feels the world‚Äôs largest asset manager should also file for SOL, Tron ETFs. He further questioned where exactly the line should be drawn on how many crypto ETFs asset managers should offer. Nate Geraci believes that there will be significant demand for the XRP ETFs, which is one reason why he thinks BlackRock is making a mistake by not filing for one. He noted that futures-based XRP funds have taken in over $1 billion since their launch this year. He opined that this proves that there will be ‚Äúreal‚Äù demand for the spot funds. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton is confident that BlackRock will still file for an XRP ETF. He said that he is willing to bet that this happens within a year. BlackRock‚Äôs failure to file for this ETF now and opt to do so later could prove costly since the pending applications could have the first-mover advantage. According to Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, there is a 95% chance that the SEC approves these funds this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.26, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Title: Impact Accounting Has an Equity Problem (Blog)

Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? By Andrew A. King, Ken Pucker & Jesse Colman Aug. 11, 2025 Impact accounting is the heir apparent to ESG (environmental, social, governance) accounting and investing. Where ESG investing emphasizes risks to the firm, impact accounting measures how corporate actions help or harm people and the planet. Its advocates predict impact accounting will engender a more transparent, responsible, and sustainable capitalism. Sir Ronald Cohen (a financier and leading advocate of impact accounting) and Professor George Serafeim (head of Harvard‚Äôs Impact Weighted Accounts Initiative) claim it will ‚Äúredefine success, so that its measure is not just money, but the positive impact we make during our lives.‚Äù Impact accounting has attracted influential advocates. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva describes it as ‚Äúa blueprint for a hope-filled future,‚Äù while former SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee contends it could ‚Äúensure that those who want to make an impact will make an impact where it matters most.‚Äù Leading corporations have begun adopting impact accounting frameworks: BlackRock, Target, and Eisai have pilot-tested methodologies developed at Harvard University, while Kering‚Äîthe parent company of Gucci‚Äîhas created its own proprietary system for dollarizing environmental impact. But impact accounting has a dark side that makes its use dangerous. In a previous SSIR article, ‚ÄúHeroic Accounting,‚Äù we reviewed the potential for miscalculation and misuse of impact accounting measures. We also highlighted concerns about the feasibility and the perils of centralized, subjective pricing of externalities. There is another important problem we overlooked in that review: Impact accounting has an equity problem, because practical means for calculating impacts discriminate against poor people. This flaw is challenging to correct because it emanates from impact accounting‚Äôs core premise: that social and environmental effects can and should be priced and compared in global monetary terms. One recent example illustrates this defect in particularly stark terms. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. Evidence of the discriminatory tendencies inherent in impact accounting appears in a recent report by the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts (IFVI)‚Äîan organization co-founded by Sir Ronald Cohen and Tracy Palandjian (Co-founder and CEO of Social Finance). The report estimates the social cost of consuming fresh water‚Äîa resource of growing global concern‚Äîfor each country. Strikingly, the IFVI assigns the lowest social cost to Mauritania, a desert nation identified by the World Resources Institute (WRI) as facing an ‚Äúextremely high‚Äù risk of future water scarcity. According to the IFVI, consuming a cubic meter of groundwater in Mauritania causes only $0.13 in social harm. In contrast, Sweden‚Äîrated by the WRI as having a "low" water risk‚Äîis estimated to suffer $3.23 in social harm per cubic meter of groundwater consumed, nearly 25 times the estimate for Mauritania. These counterintuitive estimates are part of a general trend. The IFVI estimates a low cost of water consumption for other water-scarce nations, including Somalia ($0.27/m¬≥) and South Sudan ($0.53/m¬≥), but calculates a much higher social cost in some countries with abundant water resources. Even rain-soaked Ireland is assigned a higher social cost of water consumption ($0.74 /m3) than Mauritania, Somalia, or South Sudan. Why does the IFVI assess Mauritania, Somalia, and South Sudan as places where consuming fresh water causes minimal social harm? The answer appears to lie in their poverty. In these nations, water is primarily used to produce basic goods for local consumption, which are then sold at low prices. The IFVI‚Äôs methodology assumes that low prices reflect low social value, and consequently, it concludes that little harm is caused by sacrificing this production to divert water to other uses. By contrast, in wealthy countries like Sweden and Ireland, water is often used to produce higher-priced goods, including luxury items destined for global markets. The higher market prices of these goods are interpreted by the IFVI as indicators of higher social value, leading to greater estimated harm from water consumption. As shown in Figure 1, all countries assigned low social costs for water use by the IFVI are among the world‚Äôs poorest, while rich countries‚Äîeven those with abundant water resources, such as Sweden, Ireland, and Canada‚Äîare assigned significantly higher costs. The IFVI's discriminatory estimates are not caused by a bug or error; they are an inevitable consequence of impact accounting's reason for being‚Äîthe monetization of social impacts expressed in terms of a global unit of exchange. Monetization makes risky assumptions about the relationship between social value and its monetary expression‚Äîprice. As scholars Garry Jacobs and Ivo ≈†laus (2010) warned, "The temptation to measure all value in terms of price plays havoc with commonsense, reason, and human values." In the case of impact accounting, this temptation results in systematic bias against poor people. In Mauritania, consuming water displaces activities such as subsistence agriculture, which the IFVI methodology interprets as causing minimal social harm, even though these activities are essential for survival. Conversely, in Sweden, water extraction displaces high-priced uses like decorative landscaping and is thus mistakenly assigned higher social value despite its lower importance. As a result, impact accounting risks reinforcing global inequalities under the guise of objectivity. Sir Ronald Cohen argues ‚ÄúWe have to be able to measure a company's performance in delivering impacts as well as profits.‚Äù But how should impact be measured? In financial accounting, price serves as a valid proxy: Managers aim to minimize the prices paid to suppliers and maximize the prices received from customers. Profit, then, reflects how effectively a firm achieves these goals. The same logic does not hold when measuring impact. Market prices do not reliably capture social and environmental outcomes and relying on price as a stand-in for value can lead to severe distortions. Consider a manager overseeing identical facilities in Sweden and Mauritania who must decide where to invest to reduce the social impact of lost work. The manager‚Äôs employees require proficiency in mathematics‚Äîand thus earn wages comparable to local math teachers: approximately $57,600 per year in Sweden and $5,000 in Mauritania. Following the IFVI‚Äôs approach, the social value of lost work is calculated as the product of wage and time, and by this logic, losing a Swedish worker imposes more than ten times the social harm of losing a Mauritanian one. Consequently, to reduce the firm‚Äôs measured impact the manager should invest much more money to reduce lost work in Sweden than in Mauritania. But this conclusion is irrational. Higher wages in Sweden reflect the country‚Äôs robust institutions and strong economy, not a greater intrinsic value of worker labor. In contrast, Mauritania‚Äôs low wages result in large part from weak governance and systemic corruption, which suppresses economic opportunity and distorts labor markets. A 2023 report estimates that at least 3 percent of Mauritanians are paid nothing at all: They are enslaved. By the IFVI‚Äôs method, their work provides no social value! The connection between good government and economic development is well established in the economics literature. ‚ÄúInclusive political institutions that distribute power broadly in society and are accompanied by inclusive economic institutions create the incentives and opportunities that make a nation prosperous,‚Äù write Nobel Laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their 2012 book, Why Nations Fail. ‚ÄúInstitutions that lack inclusivity‚Äîwhere political and economic power are concentrated‚Äîtend to reproduce themselves, creating a vicious circle of deprivation and underdevelopment.‚Äù Accordingly, it is not a lack of social impact that causes a Mauritanian worker to receive a salary one-tenth the size of his Swedish counterpart; it is a consequence of his working in Mauritania. Proponents of impact accounting shrug their shoulders at such concerns and respond that any accounting of social costs, even if done inaccurately, is better than no accounting at all. For example, Sir Ronald Cohen writes, ‚ÄúUntil now, the prevailing view has been that impact cannot be measured reliably enough to be truly useful, however, in John Maynard Keynes's words, ‚ÄòIt is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.‚Äô‚Äù Unfortunately, inaccurate information can be worse than no information at all. Impact information that directs harm to the poor and dispossessed will cause a decline in social welfare, not an increase, because income has a declining marginal influence on welfare. Depriving $1000 in income to a person in Mauritania, where the average income is $2200, may cause them to have trouble surviving. Deprive that same amount to a person in Sweden, where the average income is 22 times higher, and they may not even notice. If inaccurate information about impacts causes increased harm to poor people, social welfare will decrease. More information will not be better than no information at all. It might seem that the problem outlined above could be solved by adjusting observed prices or by using other methods to calculate impact. But such solutions are extraordinarily difficult to implement. For example, to compare the Mauritanian and Swedish teachers accurately, one would have to calculate the Mauritanian‚Äôs wage if the country were well governed and the economy booming. This requires constructing an economic model of the national economy and then simulating how it would function under better governance. Such calculations remain at the frontier of economic theory. Even the most advanced models reduce complex economies to simplified, stick-figure representations of activity. They also require extensive data and research to calibrate and are often opaque in their assumptions and outputs. Ongoing debates surrounding models of the social cost of carbon illustrate just how contested and fragile these estimates can be. Accurately determining the "true" price of every resource in every country is, in practice, impossible. What about simply weighting impacts in poor countries to match those in wealthy ones? In principle, this could work‚Äîbut how should the weights be determined? One alternative is to use purchasing power parity (PPP)‚Äîa method of determining the buying power in local currencies for a basket of goods. It is thought to better capture cost-of-living differences than exchange rates. However, switching to PPP does not fully solve the problem. For example, it still leaves us with the conclusion that Swedish workers provide three times the social value of their Mauritanian counterparts, even if employed in the same job. The creators of the PPP system‚Äîthe International Comparison Program‚Äîcaution against using it to compare prices at the unit or industry level across countries because the appropriate valuation factor should vary by product and context. But calculating such variable factors would require building and validating comprehensive models of each national economy, and as with the previous approach, it would be prohibitively difficult to implement such a system. Limiting the scope of use for impact accounting seems to be the best option. For example, impact accounting might allow for comparisons of the impacts within the same governing institution, such as the effects of extracting water in different parts of the same U.S. state. Alternatively, impact accounting could concentrate on genuinely global effects‚Äîthose that transcend national boundaries‚Äîsuch as the environmental impact of corporate greenhouse gas emissions or global carbon sinks, such as forests and oceanic phytoplankton. We hope our arguments will lead to significant changes in how impact is measured, but that is beyond our control. We expect the proponents of impact accounting to continue to promote it as the heir apparent to ESG. If they are successful, managers and investors may soon confront impact accounting measures. Some guidance in their use is in order: 1. Beware of claims to accuracy. Impact accounting measures present as precise and interpretable dollar values, but this is an illusion. They rest on layers and layers of approximations and assumptions. Understanding those layers is crucial. 2. Avoid cross-country comparisons. Using impact accounts to compare firms across borders‚Äîespecially between rich and poor nations‚Äîrisks serious misrepresentation. Impact measures are likely to discount harm to poor people. 3. Check against common sense. If impact accounting tells you water consumption is less harmful where water is scarce, ask why. Check against first principles. Scarcity should increase value, not reduce it. 4. Recognize that impact accounting may be just the latest idea for an easy fix to social and environmental problems. Over the past 40 years, many solutions have been proposed for leveraging the power of business to advance sustainability. All have come and gone, all but one: strengthened institutions. 5. Strengthen institutions. As Acemoglu and Johnston have shown, social outcomes are better where institutions are stronger. We don‚Äôt need Nobel Laureates to tell us, we know that from experience. Controlling institutions have made our air and water cleaner, our cars safer, our resources better protected, and our living standard higher. Such institutions are constantly under attack, yet they remain the best way to improve our planet. Impact accounting will likely come and go, but the effect of our institutions will remain.

Business Crypto exchange Bullish is targeting a valuation of up to $4.82 billion after upsizing its initial public offering on Monday, underscoring sustained investor interest in digital assets. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel-backed Bullish's raise, still well below its $9-billion valuation target in a failed 2021 blank-check merger, showcases the expanding role that crypto companies are playing in the momentum built by the IPO markets. "In many cases the initial price range is set well below a company's last private valuation or below what the company had originally hoped for," said Kat Liu, vice president at IPO research firm IPOX. The crypto sector's recent climb to a $4-trillion market value has boosted public market sentiment.

IRELAND HEAD COACH Scott Bemand has named a 32-player squad for the 2025 Women‚Äôs Rugby World Cup in England. Munster hooker Beth Buttimer is the one uncapped player included, having impressed in the recent U20 Summer Series. Ex-England players Ellena Perry and Nancy McGillivray, and Connacht‚Äôs Ivana Kiripati, who were all capped in the warm-up games, also make the final squad. IrishRugby TV / YouTube Christy Haney misses out with a hamstring injury, while Dorothy Wall and Erin King had previously been ruled out with long-term setbacks. Aoife Wafer is named as Ireland continue to sweat on the fitness of the 2025 Six Nations player of the championship. Co-captain Edel McMahon also makes the plane having emerged as an injury concern last week. Advertisement In all, the squad is comprised of 18 forwards and 14 backs and is captained by McMahon and Sam Monaghan. Alex Codling, Denis Fogarty, Larissa Muldoon, James Scaysbrook and Gareth Steenson make up Bemand‚Äôs coaching team. Uncapped U20 hooker Beth Buttimer.

Title: Ireland name one uncapped player in World Cup squad

Only time will tell if Aoife Wafer‚Äôs selection by Irish women‚Äôs rugby coach Scott Bemand was a calculated risk or not. Perhaps Ireland‚Äôs most influential player, Wafer has been included among the 18 forwards and 14 backs selected ahead of the 2025 Rugby World Cup in England, which begins for Ireland in Franklin‚Äôs Garden in a few weeks. The 22-year-old, who underwent knee surgery in July after sustaining the injury against Wales, has been central to the Irish team and hopes to be fit for the World Cup Pool C opener against Japan on August 24th. An outstanding backrow, Wafer was named 2025 Six Nations Player of the Championship, but missed Ireland‚Äôs two recent warm-up games against Scotland and Canada. Clearly the Irish medics believe she can play a role at some point in the tournament. After Japan, Ireland play against Spain on August 31st and title holders New Zealand on September 7th in the remaining pool games. Japan are ranked 11th and Spain 13th to Ireland‚Äôs fifth on the world table. Defending champions New Zealand are ranked third in the world behind first placed England and Canada, who beat Ireland 26-47 last weekend in Belfast. Wafer‚Äôs power game has been a critical aspect of Ireland‚Äôs play as highlighted in scoring four tries in the Six Nations. But she missed the last game of the championship against Scotland and has been unavailable since then. Edel McMahon, who co-captain‚Äôs the squad with secondrow Sam Monaghan, is also among the 32 names. The backrow also injured her knee and did not feature against Scotland or Canada. [ Scott Bemand happy with how Ireland are shaping up for Rugby World Cup despite Canada defeatOpens in new window ] Backrows Dorothy Wall (Achilles) and the dynamic Erin King (knee) also miss out on selection due to injury as does Christy Haney. Prop Haney suffered a hamstring injury, and her place is taken by Ellena Perry, who made her debut in Saturday‚Äôs defeat to Canada. Perry won 11 caps with England but hadn‚Äôt lined out for them since 2020 and satisfies World Rugby‚Äôs stand down rules for switching nations. She is Irish-qualified via a grandparent and plays with Neve Jones and Monoghan at Gloucester. Exeter centre Nancy McGillivray, is another of the selected players, who was named in England squads in the past but was never capped, debuted after qualifying through her Irish-born father. She became available to make the switch after her England contract expired in June. Ireland will undoubtedly miss the injured players. King started at openside flanker in Ireland‚Äôs opening three Six Nations matches. Wall had involvement in all five games, playing in the secondrow and backrow, while Haney came off the bench in all the matches. Bemand has also picked one uncapped player, hooker Beth Buttimer as well as two players with one cap, Perry and McGillivray and one player with two caps, forward Ivana Kiripati. [ Ivana Kiripati: ‚ÄòI am a Samoan girl, born in New Zealand, doing life in Ireland ‚Äì how cool is that?‚ÄôOpens in new window ] The overall look of the side tends towards inexperience when compared to the England squad, who have a couple of players with over 100 caps and several more approaching that number. No Irish player selected has yet reached 50 caps with just five players with 30 or more. But Ireland travel with hope and some momentum, having come from behind to beat Scotland and then finished strongly in the second half of their match against Canada after trailing 33-7 at the interval. ‚ÄúWhen we qualified for the Rugby World Cup in April 2024, we knew it gave us a solid amount of time to prepare for the tournament,‚Äù said Bemand. ‚ÄúWe have used that time to build depth and cultivate our ‚ÄòGreen Wave‚Äô. The majority of this squad have now been together since the start of June, and we are excited to finally get going.‚Äù Co-captain Monaghan added that having missed out on qualification for the last World Cup in New Zealand, the energy and hope within the group remains high. ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòGreen Wave‚Äô is more than just a slogan for us ‚Äì it‚Äôs the spirit we carry on to the field,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOver the coming weeks, we want to make our families proud and inspire the nation. This is a moment we‚Äôve worked tirelessly for, and we‚Äôll leave nothing behind. ‚ÄúMissing out on the last World Cup lit a fire in all of us. Getting Ireland back on the world stage means absolutely everything, it‚Äôs something we have dreamed of and fought forever since. We‚Äôre ready, and we are going to give it everything for our country.‚Äù In an expanded 16 team competition, countries are divided into four pools of four teams (pools A to D). Teams in each pool will play one another in a round-robin format, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage. Ireland are eyeing a knockout position in Pool C, which means winning the pool or finishing second. The favourites to top the pool are New Zealand.

Title: Boost for Ireland as Wafer named in World Cup squad

Michael Glennon RT√â Sport Journalist Aoife Wafer and co-captain Edel McMahon have been named in the Ireland squad for the Rugby World Cup, however, Christy Haney misses out through injury. Six Nations player of the tournament Wafer underwent knee surgery last month but the back row has been included in the 32-player squad for Pool C games against Japan, Spain and New Zealand in England, starting on 24 August. Flanker McMahon missed both of Ireland's warm-up games with a knee injury but is also included. Prop Haney suffered a hamstring injury and her place is taken by Ellena Perry, who made her debut in Saturday‚Äôs defeat to Canada in Belfast. Perry won 11 caps with England but hadn‚Äôt lined out for the Red Roses since 2020 and is Irish-qualified via a grandparent. Similarly, centre Nancy McGillivray, whose father is Irish, makes the cut having switched from the England set-up recently. The Exeter player (below) scored on her international debut against Scotland nine days ago. Flanker Ivana Kiripati, who won caps against Scotland and Canada, also makes the cut but there is no place for Deirbhile Nic a Bh√°ird. There is one uncapped player in the squad, with Munster hooker Beth Buttimer, who impressed in the recent U20 Summer Series, getting the call-up. Forwards Erin King and Dorothy Wall had already been ruled out due to injuries picked up in the Six Nations. Head coach Scott Bemand said: "When we qualified for the Rugby World Cup in April 2024, we knew it gave us a solid amount of time to prepare for the tournament. "We have used that time to build depth and cultivate our 'Green Wave‚Äô. "The majority of this squad have now been together since the start of June, and we are excited to finally get going."

Title: Solana Price Prediction: SOL Timeline to $500 Outlined by Experts, But This Play Could Yield Superior Returns In The Interim

Solana price looks primed for a surge in the next few weeks as recent price patterns show it responding to new demand pressure. However, another project is unfolding into the spotlight with the potential to steal the shine from the Solana price prediction. Solana‚Äôs standout performance this year has attracted hundreds of whales, driving price growth that could see it at 2x this year. Whereas, while Solana price prediction suggests an incoming 2x before year-end, this other altcoin is projected for 30x in the same time frame. Here is the whole gist on why this could happen even before November. The price action indicates that the SOL price is rapidly recovering from its earlier correction a few months ago and is now poised for a significant breakout. According to the analysis, the Solana price prediction is set at around $500 this year as renewed ETF sentiment fuels institutional demand. The trending Solana price prediction sees the ongoing ETF calls as a catalyst that could see the coin double in price before the year‚Äôs end. There is an aggressive accumulation currently ongoing in the Solana ecosystem as new fundamental factors add to its visibility. New utilities such as the Solana PayPal stablecoin integration are boosting demand today. In addition, top brands like Blackrock and Fidelity keeping Solana in their reserve have further renewed hope of Solana‚Äôs continuous growth. Solana price prediction speculates a $500 growth this year as it continues to hold a position above the 200EMA. This reflects a long-term bullish momentum that could drive the SOL price to a new high by September as it reclaims old resistance. The price has maintained a position above the $165 resistance in the past few weeks, even in the face of a market drawdown. A breakout of the SOL price beyond $200 this week might see it returning to $294 as new support. Furthermore, the Solana price prediction could be achieved this year if it can hit $350b by early September. This move could fuel a new FOMO rally that can help the Solana price hit $500 as early as November. While Solana price action shows strong bullish potential, analysts say Remittix could hit 30x easily this year. This is because Remittix‚Äôs crypto-to-fiat and low-cap potential show promise to drive a strong bull run before December. The last few weeks have seen Remittix become the favourite new entry, raising $18.7 million in a short period. Analysts are saying this fast climb is showing strong market confidence in Remittix utility and could be prime for 30x before December. Remittix growth factors this year include: These catalysts have been fueling a high demand lately as anticipation grows for the Remittix breakout.

Highlights LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn says that the personal loan market is at its highest TAM ever as consumers face rising interest rates on credit card products and rising prices on everything they buy. LendingClub is moving from lender to a comprehensive financial ecosystem amid rekindled marketing efforts. Sanborn tells Karen Webster that new products like LevelUp Checking offer cash back on essentials and loan payments, while LevelUp Savings incentivizes consistent savings behavior. LendingClub‚Äôs latest quarter showed robust originations and profit growth, and marketplace support by heavy hitters like BlackRock.

Œî LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn said more than half of consumers don‚Äôt know the interest rates on their credit cards. Among those who claim to know their rates, half underestimate what they‚Äôre actually paying. The findings come from LendingClub‚Äôs internal research, as credit card interest rates have risen to the high-20% range while essential expenses continue to outpace income growth over the past two decades. Credit card revolving balances have reached record levels during this period. ‚ÄúAdd in the inflationary pressure, which doesn‚Äôt seem to be going away as fast as anyone would like,‚Äù Sanborn told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster during a Monday Conversation session. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs putting pressure on consumers, who are managing‚Ä¶but things are tight.‚Äù Sanborn said the conditions have created the largest total addressable market for personal loans that the company has seen. LendingClub estimates that 52% of Americans are currently carrying credit card debt at historically high interest rates. LendingClub began as a peer-to-peer lending platform in 2006 before acquiring Radius Bank in 2020. Sanborn said the bank acquisition was a key strategic move to empower consumers to make what he called ‚Äúsmart financial decisions‚Äù and transform the company‚Äôs operations into a comprehensive financial ecosystem. Following a strong second quarter reported at the end of July, the company reactivated key marketing channels that had been curtailed during interest rate shifts and the 2023 banking crisis. These channels include online advertising, display ads, paid search, and direct mail campaigns. ‚ÄúOur early results came in stronger than we expected,‚Äù Sanborn said, attributing the performance to the significant interest rate savings LendingClub can offer to consumers carrying high-rate credit card debt. LevelUp Checking launched just over a month ago with features designed to reward responsible financial behavior. The account offers 1% cash back on essential purchases, including gas, groceries, and pharmaceuticals, plus 1% annual percentage yield on account balances and 2% cash back for customers who make on-time loan payments. The cash back on loan payments effectively reduces the interest rate customers pay on their loans. Since the product launch, sign-ups increased sixfold compared to previous account opening rates. Approximately 60% of new checking accounts have come from existing borrowers who are setting up direct deposits and automated loan payments, indicating strong cross-selling success between LendingClub‚Äôs lending and banking operations. LevelUp Savings has attracted $2.7 billion in deposits in what Sanborn described as a short period. The savings product offers higher interest rates for customers who maintain consistent saving behavior over time. ‚ÄúThese offerings are good for the consumer, better than the competition, and best when they‚Äôre used together,‚Äù Sanborn explained, referring to the integrated approach across checking, savings, and lending products. The banking product growth is being supported by what Sanborn called robust momentum in the company‚Äôs core lending businesses. Second-quarter loan originations rose 32% compared to the same period last year. The company attributed this growth to strong credit performance among existing loans and high demand from institutional loan buyers. LendingClub has maintained what Sanborn described as ‚Äúa pretty cautious credit stance‚Äù that has contributed to more than four years of outperformance relative to competitors. The company‚Äôs current approval rates are approximately one-third lower than the levels maintained before inflation began affecting borrower finances. When the interest rate environment first shifted upward, asset management companies that had been buying loans from LendingClub‚Äôs marketplace moved to the sidelines because their cost of capital increased dramatically. ‚ÄúSo we pivoted to banks,‚Äù Sanborn explained. ‚ÄúAnd we went upstream in terms of credit we were sourcing, because that‚Äôs what bank buyers want.‚Äù This pivot toward higher-quality borrowers proved beneficial when the 2023 banking crisis occurred. ‚ÄúLuckily we were ‚Äòup‚Äô credit at the time when inflationary pressures were also hitting borrowers,‚Äù Sanborn said. ‚ÄúThat really benefited us and we‚Äôre selling that higher quality credit now to both banks and asset managers.‚Äù The conservative underwriting approach has enabled LendingClub to maintain strong loan performance even as economic conditions have created stress for many borrowers across the industry. In its core business of refinancing credit card debt, LendingClub directly pays off customers‚Äô existing card balances rather than providing cash to borrowers. This process ensures the funds are used as intended for debt consolidation and prevents customers from accumulating additional debt on top of their new personal loan. ‚ÄúIf you tell us you‚Äôre going to pay off your credit card debt, we say, great,‚Äù Sanborn explained. ‚ÄúHere are your cards‚Ä¶we will pay those directly for you.‚Äù This approach helps consumers reduce their overall cost of debt while maintaining the same total debt level, consolidating multiple credit card accounts into a single point of interaction through the LendingClub platform. LendingClub recently announced a significant partnership with BlackRock that includes a structured certificate product with an investment-grade rating from Fitch Ratings. Sanborn described BlackRock as a ‚Äúblue chip counterpart‚Äù for the partnership. The BlackRock deal includes up to $1 billion in forward flow commitments for future loan purchases, initially targeting lower-cost capital sources such as insurance companies. This partnership is designed to help power LendingClub‚Äôs online marketplace for loan sales to institutional investors. Sanborn said these partnerships distinguish LendingClub from what he called ‚Äúepisodic entrants‚Äù in the lending market who ‚Äúcome in with guns blazing using inferred bureau models‚Äù without the depth of experience that comes from extended market presence. He noted that LendingClub has two decades of operating experience, dozens of internal credit models, and $100 billion in loan originations over 17 years of operations. This track record, according to Sanborn, provides advantages over newer competitors that rely primarily on standard credit bureau data and models. The company is developing what Sanborn called a proprietary ‚Äúdynamic application‚Äù system that will control LendingClub‚Äôs full mobile technology stack. Unlike most banks that rely on third-party technology solutions, LendingClub‚Äôs internally controlled system is intended to enable more data-driven, customer-focused experiences. Additionally, the company is building a mobile marketing platform to support customer acquisition and engagement efforts. These technology investments are part of LendingClub‚Äôs broader strategy to differentiate its customer experience from traditional banking and lending competitors. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really pleased with the progress we‚Äôre making,‚Äù Sanborn told Webster. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very bullish on the future of LendingClub and we‚Äôre running ahead of our own expectations, which is great.‚Äù The company‚Äôs strong second-quarter performance and successful product launches have exceeded internal projections, according to Sanborn, positioning LendingClub for continued growth in what the CEO sees as an expanding market opportunity driven by consumer financial pressures and limited awareness of debt costs.

IRELAND‚ÄôS LATEST RISING star in athletics, Conor Kelly, has confirmed he will follow in Rhasidat Adeleke‚Äôs footsteps by attending the University of Texas. Kelly collected his 400m gold medal at the European U20 championships today, having stormed to victory in yesterday‚Äôs race, clocking a new U20 national record of 45.83 seconds while he was at it. Speaking today to Athletics Ireland after stepping off the podium, Kelly said, ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt stop smiling, it was incredible. I was probably up a little later than I should‚Äôve been. I woke up a little late, not much sleep‚Ä¶This is the last week before I go to Texas (for college) so I better get a good goodbye in.‚Äù Advertisement Kelly raced alongside Adeleke in the mixed 4x400m at the world relay championships in May. Today marked the final day of the championships in Tampere, Finland, with Sean Cronin (1500m) and the Irish women‚Äôs 4x100m relay team finishing eighth in their respective finals. Racing in a stacked, tactical 1500m final. Clonliffe Harriers clubman Cronin dug deep down the home straight to cross the line in 3:50.80. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really proud of how I ran that race. I think I got as much out of it as I could have,‚Äù he told Athletics Ireland. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm delighted with the progression I‚Äôve made this season, I think I‚Äôve really stepped up. I‚Äôve not just trained harder; I‚Äôve trained smarter and done all the little things right in between.‚Äù An hour earlier, the Women‚Äôs 4x100m relay team of Fatima Amusan (Leevale AC), Molly Daly (Kilkenny City Harriers), Leila Colfer (St Laurence O‚ÄôToole AC) and Precious Akpe-Moses (Blackrock AC) clocked a time of 45.17 seconds in finishing eighth in their relay final, which was faster than their heat time. Akpe-Moses ‚Äì who was racing at these championships for the eighth time, having made the finals of both the 100m and 200m ‚Äì reflected on her performance and that of the team with pride. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long championship,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe made it to the final, did what we could do, and we‚Äôre satisfied.‚Äù After a long two days of competition, Enya Silkena (Ratoath AC) finished 17th in the Women‚Äôs Heptathlon with 4693 points. Silkena was in action in the Long Jump (5.63m), Javelin Throw (39.48m) and 800m (2:30.19) today. Seamus Clarke (Moy Valley AC) was unable to finish the final of the Men‚Äôs 10,000m Race Walk due to injury.

Title: Ethereum surges with $461M ETF inflows ‚Äì Will ETH break its ATH?

With BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale leading the buying spree, Ethereum‚Äôs breakout looks increasingly credible. Ethereum is gaining serious momentum as institutional ETF inflows surpass Bitcoin. Bullish metrics and rising open interest point to growing confidence in ETH, bringing it within an achievable distance of a new all-time high. Ethereum [ETH] just stole the spotlight from Bitcoin [BTC]. ETF inflows have flipped the usual script, on-chain trends are pointing up, and big players are quietly piling in. But will ETH be able to sustain this breakout and go further? ETFs are snapping up more Ethereum than Bitcoin, with a recent single-day haul of $461 million in ETH products compared to $404 million for BTC, according to Arkham Intelligence. Source: Arkham Intelligence The surge was led by institutional titans ‚Äì BlackRock scooped up $250 million worth of ETH, Fidelity added $130 million, and Grayscale followed with $60 million. In fact, this was one of the strongest single-day institutional buying waves ETH has seen this year. Glassnode data revealed a sharp rise in first-time buyers and momentum traders, pushing new demand higher. Source: Glassnode Having said that, conviction buyers ‚Äì those raising their cost basis despite elevated prices ‚Äì also grew, signaling deeper market commitment. On top of that, this mix of fresh inflows and seasoned holder conviction could set the stage for an aggressive leg upward if buying pressure sustains. At press time, Ethereum‚Äôs derivatives market is heating up, with Futures Open Interest sitting at $51.61 billion ‚Äì near a yearly high. Source: CoinGlass Price action remained strong despite a minor pullback, with ETH trading at $4,190, above its 9- and 21-day EMAs. Momentum indicators added to the bullish bias: RSI hovered just below overbought territory at 69.8, while MACD remained firmly positive. Source: TradingView With less than $700 to reclaim its $4,891 all-time high, ETH‚Äôs current structure suggests a shot at price discovery this year. Of course, profit-taking could slow the climb before any decisive breakout. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Inside the mind of Lyn Alden: Bitcoin, AI, and the unstoppable deficit train

Renowned macro analyst Lyn Alden shares her views on fiscal deficits, 'sticky' inflation, Bitcoin cycles, and the remarkable 20-watt human brain. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate‚Äôs new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. Lyn Alden is an exceptional human. Broadly recognized as one of the top minds in macroeconomics, during a conversation with Lyn, you can feel some of her vast intellect rubbing off on you; I swear my IQ increased several points by the time our chat was over. Even navigating heavy topics like the fiscal deficit and the onset of AI, she does so with a smile on her face and more eloquence and poise than an Olympic gymnast executing a triple backflip. Founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy and general partner at venture firm Ego Death Capital, alongside other industry heavyweights like Jeff Booth and Preston Pysh, Lyn has earned her stripes over the years as one of the most respected macro analysts in the space. She‚Äôs also one of the most solicited for interviews, thanks to her razor-sharp insights and depth of market knowledge. As a prolific content creator, Lyn offers a free investing newsletter and frequents the virtual corridors of Crypto Twitter daily, amassing three-quarters of a million followers who rely on her timely commentary and finely-edged wit: beyond the undeniable words of wisdom and investment advice, Lyn‚Äôs something of a master when it comes to memes. Lyn is perhaps best known for her book Broken Money, which provides a comprehensive view of the history of money and a well-illustrated critique of the global monetary system. She‚Äôs also highly vocal about her thesis on the U.S. fiscal deficit, AKA, ‚ÄòNothing stops this train‚Äô. Sky-high levels of U.S. spending are rising at a pace that far outstrips the government‚Äôs ability to pay for it, creating what Lyn dubs a ‚Äúslow-motion runaway train.‚Äù She explains: ‚ÄúLarge U.S. fiscal deficits are going to continue for the foreseeable future, five, 10 years, any sort of investable time horizon. There are a bunch of reasons why, and a lot of them have to do with political polarization. It‚Äôs very hard to either massively raise taxes or massively cut spending in a very polarized situation, as well as mechanically the kind of debt levels they find themselves in.‚Äù The total amount of money the U.S. government owes to its lenders currently amounts to an eye-watering $36.9 trillion, representing over 120% of GDP, and growing by around $1 trillion every quarter. Even the most highly skilled ringmaster with smoke and mirrors would struggle to obfuscate such an alarming level of federal debt. With a diminishing ability to pay it off, I wonder, if nothing stops this train, can anything slow it down? She replies: ‚ÄúThere are plenty of things that can slow it down a little bit. Tariffs are one of the things that can slow it down because they bypass some of that polarization. Tariffs are basically really big tax hikes that go around Congress because of an emergency authorization executive order, so they temporarily bypass some of the frictions against them.‚Äù While tariffs may serve to fill the government coffers a little higher, Lyn says the numbers don‚Äôt add up enough to make a significant impact: the deficit is around $2 trillion, and the income from tariffs at the current level only equates to roughly a quarter of it at around $500 billion a year. Plus, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre already seeing exemptions.‚Äù She adds: ‚ÄúThe last line for the ‚ÄòNothing stops this train‚Äô view is that the U.S. is very financialized, meaning that our government‚Äôs tax receipts are very correlated with asset prices. Any attempts at austerity at this point tend to fail to address the problem because you either slow down the stock market or slow down the economy. Therefore, with a lag, you weaken your other tax receipts and make deficit reduction on a sustained basis hard.‚Äù I nod, contemplating the enormity of the situation and the inevitable collision course the economy is on. She continues: ‚ÄúJust structurally, it‚Äôs growing above target almost without any way to stop it.‚Äù We turn the conversation to last week‚Äôs market slump following a weaker-than-expected jobs report that triggered former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes to sell off a chunk of his crypto holdings. I ask Lyn how significant the jobs report is and whether she echoes Hayes‚Äô bearish near-term views on global liquidity. She frowns, pointing out that Hayes is more of a frequent trader than she is, however: ‚ÄúThe jobs report was pretty significant. It was the biggest downward revision in quite a while, and it‚Äôs corroborated by other things as well. The ISM Purchasing Managers‚Äô indices are also showing a similar directional weakness.‚Äù The ISM Manufacturing PMI is a key indicator of the state of the U.S. economy as it signals the level of demand for products by measuring the amount of ordering activity at U.S. factories. Lyn continues: ‚ÄúNow, whether that affects Bitcoin and broader crypto, I‚Äôm more hesitant to say. While it can slow down earnings that can impair the economy in various ways, it also generally means more Fed dovishness, which, around the margins, is good for Bitcoin and crypto.‚Äù Despite not making short-term trading decisions like Hayes, Lyn gives some credence to his outlook over the coming quarters based on a couple of parameters: Tariffs may make a dent in the deficit and serve to take the wind out of crypto‚Äôs sails (‚Äúslightly slower the train for a couple of quarters‚Äù), and the treasury is attempting to refill its general cash account (the TGA) after the debt ceiling was passed. That means sucking liquidity out of the system, which can negatively impact risk assets. Lyn explains: ‚ÄúIronically, debt ceilings, when they‚Äôre an issue, are actually good for liquidity because they force all these pockets of liquidity to go back into the market, but then afterward, when they refill their cash levels, they‚Äôre pulling cash out of the system. They [the treasury] expect to do that through the rest of this quarter, to Arthur‚Äôs point, which is historically not amazing for asset prices across the board.‚Äù In contrast, Lyn isn‚Äôt too worried about a broader tightening of global liquidity. She says: ‚ÄúI would say liquidity‚Äôs in a middling place because the dollar is no longer falling as it was earlier this year, and the dollar is a really big variable for liquidity, generally. A falling dollar is overall good for global liquidity. At the other end of the spectrum, China‚Äôs credit impulse is on the upswing, which is good for global liquidity. So it‚Äôs kind of neutral at the current time.‚Äù While it‚Äôs not the perfect setup for a million-dollar Bitcoin, things could definitely be worse. Lyn affirms: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this cycle‚Äôs over yet. I think we‚Äôre going to see higher highs in Bitcoin this cycle. That could be later this year. That could be early next year. There are lots of little variables that can affect that, but so far, we don‚Äôt see any indicators that look like a multi-year top.‚Äù In fact, she explains that we‚Äôre ‚Äúnowhere near multi-year tops‚Äù based on various indicators that track market value compared to on-chain cost basis, a ‚Äúkind of a measure of euphoria.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think liquidity still looks decent, maybe not great for a quarter, but it‚Äôs not an acute headwind per se, in my opinion, and going into next year, I still think we‚Äôre going to see most likely higher Bitcoin prices.‚Äù How high is that? Lyn pauses and says she has no firm view. Unlike other personalities in the space, she doesn‚Äôt win over more followers by making outlandish predictions. Instead, she simply says: ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going over $150k this cycle. Now the number could be much higher than that, but I always try to start conservatively, and it depends on market conditions at that time.‚Äù She believes that Bitcoin cycles are changing, and we should expect this one to be longer and ‚Äúmaybe less extreme‚Äù than previous runs. We should also prepare to see strong moves upward followed by periods of consolidation, ‚Äúrather than going to the moon and collapsing.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you look at what used to be called FANG stocks, and now it‚Äôs the Mag7 stocks, basically large-cap U.S. tech stocks, they kept grinding up longer than people thought. Value investors were always shocked that these things just kept growing. ‚ÄúSometimes they get over their skis and have a 30% correction, sometimes worse. Sometimes they have a flattish, choppy year, but then they keep grinding higher after they work out some steam. I think Bitcoin could resemble that model to some extent. Maybe it‚Äôs still more volatile than that, but I do think we should expect maybe longer and less extreme cycles on average.‚Äù For anyone who‚Äôs been flushed out by a Mt. Gox, China ban, or FTX-style black swan event that abruptly reversed most of Bitcoin‚Äôs gains, Lyn‚Äôs prediction may provide some relief. But is there any potential catalyst for the end of the cycle quietly chirping away like a canary in a coal mine? Bitcoin treasury companies, for example? Lyn points out that now that Bitcoin is a multitrillion-dollar asset, it‚Äôs inevitable that smart money flows in. She says: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no world in which only individuals own Bitcoin and magically no large pools of capital want to own it. That only makes sense when Bitcoin is a tiny market.‚Äù She‚Äôs not concerned about the centralization threat to Bitcoin posed by entities like Strategy gobbling up BTC like it‚Äôs going out of style (Strategy‚Äôs BTC holdings currently stand at over 628,791, just shy of 3% of the entire supply). She simply shrugs and says it‚Äôs no different from previous cycles: ‚ÄúAt one point, Mt. Gox supposedly had over 800,000 coins, and there were fewer coins back then. So that was a bigger percentage of coins than, say, BlackRock or Strategy has now. So while there‚Äôs always some degree of centralization concerns, it‚Äôs really not worse now than it was at periods of times in the past. So, no. I‚Äôm not really worried about that from a centralization perspective.‚Äù What is important to be on the lookout for, Lyn explains, is the amount of leverage in the system, since ‚Äúany degree of euphoria and leverage is what causes the next downward cycle.‚Äù Bitcoin needs upward volatility to go from zero to trillions of dollars of value and become relevant on a global scale; and upward volatility, Lyn warns, breeds euphoria and leverage. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when you get over your skis and you get consolidations and downside volatility. There are obviously other liquidations that happen from time to time, so they certainly could feed the next downturn, but I don‚Äôt view it as fundamentally different from prior cycles, and the current leverage in the treasury space is not that high. MicroStrategy has pretty low leverage relative to their Bitcoin. Metaplanet has relatively low leverage relative to their Bitcoin. We‚Äôll see how the others come as they go. I certainly think that we‚Äôll see a washout. We‚Äôll see a lot of altcoin treasury companies get washed out, and some Bitcoin ones that are poorly managed are going to be at risk in the next downturn.‚Äù It was sometime during the COVID lockdowns that Lyn began discussing the persistent inflation that would stem from shuttering the world and inflating the money supply. She would later characterize the 2020s as the decade of inflation, as governments struggle to rein in rising costs. Does Lyn expect this trend to continue? ‚ÄúTo some extent, I mean, we‚Äôre in 2025. We‚Äôre still above the way the Fed measures inflation. We‚Äôre still above their official target even though it has come down. Now, whether or not we have another dramatic spike comes partially down to whether energy is constrained or not. It‚Äôs pretty hard to have major inflation without energy suppression, so anything that keeps the supply of energy high is a way of keeping inflation down.‚Äù Unlike previous decades, she says, where we were able to print money and offset it with productivity gains from automating manufacturing, she sees the 2020s as ‚Äústickier‚Äù in terms of average inflation; unless we realize a major productivity increase through a technology such as AI, although even that won‚Äôt bring down the cost of store-of-value assets. She says: ‚ÄúThe things that are truly scarce, like waterfront property, gold, fine art, high-quality stocks, and things like that, all go up dramatically because it‚Äôs hard to increase those things. So I think going forward, AI making, say, white collar types of services cheaper can suppress in some way CPI and certain wages and expenditures that people have. This could be offset by ongoing money printing, higher gold, higher Bitcoin, higher prestige properties, and just truly scarce things. So I do think that we‚Äôre still in a sticky inflation environment, even though it‚Äôs hard to get dramatic inflation without energy shortages.‚Äù Since she‚Äôs brought up AI for its productivity gains, I ask if she‚Äôs concerned about job losses and whether she believes it‚Äôs a net positive for humanity, being something of an AI skeptic myself. Lyn‚Äôs markedly more optimistic. Just like the runaway fiscal deficit train, she says AI is inevitable. ‚ÄúAt this stage, if you try to ban it in one country, another will do it, and it will be open-sourced in some capacity. Like any technology, it can be disruptive when it hits; a lot of people can lose their jobs at once.‚Äù She likens AI to social media in the way the latter disrupted social interaction, and warns that it must be used carefully to avoid doing more harm than good. I recall reading an MIT study, to her point, that found AI to be a great learning tool; as long as people didn‚Äôt become so dependent on it that their intelligence drained away like blood from an open wound. Lyn continues: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing that we find ways to make repetitive white-collar work cheaper and more affordable because that allows those people or future generations to do other types of work, which is true for any time we automated textiles or farming with tractors and hydrocarbons and things like that. It‚Äôs the same thing except it‚Äôs quicker.‚Äù She points out that portable AI is different from data center AI and marvels at the mechanics of the human brain: our ability to process complex thoughts and emotions, ‚Äúvery high bandwidth senses,‚Äù and ‚Äúself-healing‚Äù capability run on just 20 watts of power. She enthuses: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs remarkable. It‚Äôs less than an incandescent light bulb. The equivalent amount of processing in a data center runs on megawatts of power, so millions of watts of power‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre anywhere near the level where there‚Äôs nothing humans could do to add value over silicon. I think it‚Äôs more a case of disruption that then puts more people into doing other things.‚Äù I nod, wondering whether my metaphorical lightbulb requires as much energy as Lyn Alden‚Äôs giant brain. With persistent inflation, societal disruption, and broken money, to boot, this era bears all the hallmarks of a fourth turning, and I struggle to feel positive about where it all ends. I wonder what Lyn thinks. Is this a good time to be alive? She ponders: ‚ÄúI think so. Fewer people die from avoidable things than almost ever before globally. It‚Äôs not an accident that the population bubble is happening now‚Ä¶ For the most part, I consider it good, but it goes through waves of getting too much, like when people get cut off from social connections. People have way more depression now than hunter-gatherers, even though in most capacities, we live longer and are less likely to die from something random‚Ä¶ Technology is polarizing because, in some ways, it becomes like a winner-take-most, and to the extent that we get through this whole thing successfully, I think we have to learn to use technology in a more natural way than be so reliant on it. I think eventually that will be the case.‚Äù Lyn also believes that AI won‚Äôt continue to develop and improve ad infinitum, but will eventually hit a plateau, just like aviation did: progress within that industry has been fairly stagnant for years, following its mind-blowing takeoff in the 20th Century. She says: ‚ÄúWe went from the Wright brothers to people on the moon in one human lifetime. But then, once we hit the 70s, we slowed down. We still don‚Äôt have a jet faster than the Blackbird.

The cryptocurrency industry has been about hitting new milestones in 2025, with the futures-based Solana and XRP ETFs (exchange-traded funds) among the latest to reach new achievements. According to the latest market data, the SOL and XRP ETFs have reached $1 billion in total capital inflows since their launch earlier. This feat comes on the back of rumors that the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, BlackRock, might look to launch a spot XRP-based exchange-traded fund. In an August 9 post on the X platform, the president of The ETF Store, Nate Geraci, revealed that the futures-based Solana and XRP ETFs have attracted over $1 billion in capital since launch. These crypto-linked investment products started trading in the United States about five months ago‚Äîaround March (for SOL ETF) and April (for XRP). For context, futures-based exchange-traded funds are a type of investment product that holds the futures contracts of an asset. A futures contract is a financial instrument that allows an investor to buy an asset at a predetermined price on a predetermined date. In March 2025, Volatility Shares launched the first-ever Solana exchange-traded funds in the United States. The firm rolled out two products at the time: Volatility Shares‚Äô Solana fund, which replicates the performance of Solana futures, and the 2x SOL ETF that offers double-leveraged exposure. While Teucrium launched the first US-based XRP ETF (a 2x leveraged fund) in April, Volatility Shares offered the first non-leveraged futures-based XRP exchange-traded fund in May. As shown in the chart below, both the SOL and XRP ETFs had posted only modest monthly performances up until July‚Äîwhere they each posted approximately $350 million in capital inflows. Geraci noted that these figures include REX-Osprey‚Äôs Solana staking exchange-traded fund, which boasts up to $150 million in assets under management. According to the ETF expert, this performance proves that there will be demand for spot SOL and XRP ETFs. It is worth mentioning that a slew of applications from various asset managers are awaiting approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Solana and XRP ETFs. As reported by Bitcoinist, BlackRock has indicated that it currently has no plans to join the race for spot Solana and XRP ETFs. In a second post on X, Geraci reiterated his belief that BlackRock would be looking to expand its crypto ETF portfolio. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm being told BlackRock doesn‚Äôt want a piece of this?‚Äù the ETF expert said, referring to the attention being enjoyed by the future-based version of the XRP exchange-traded fund.
